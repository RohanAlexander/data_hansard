0,NA,Unknown,"Monday, 26 November 2018 The SPEAKER (Hon. Tony Smith) took the chair at 10:00, made an acknowledgement of country and read prayers. NA Members Sworn The SPEAKER (10:01): I have received a return to the writ which I issued on 17 September 2018 for the election of a member to serve for the electoral division of Wentworth in New South Wales to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of the Hon. Malcolm Bligh Turnbull. By the endorsement on the writ, it is certified that Kerryn Lyndel Phelps has been elected. Kerryn Lyndel Phelps made and subscribed the oath of allegiance. NA Petitions Committee Report Mrs WICKS (Robertson) (10:06): I present the 32nd report of the Petitions Committee for the 45th Parliament. NA Mrs WICKS (Robertson) (10:06): On behalf of the Standing Committee on Petitions, I present the following petitions: Falun Gong NA ASSEMBLED IN PARLIAMENT This petition of certain citizens and residents of Australia draws to the attention of the House that Falun Gong is a peaceful meditation practice based on the principles of Truthfulness, Compassion and Tolerance. Falun Gong practitioners in China have been subjected to the most brutal and relentless persecution by the Chinese Communist regime since July 1999. According to investigative reports published by human rights lawyer David Matas and former Canadian Secretary of State for the Asia Pacific David Kilgour, a large number of imprisoned Falun Gong practitioners have been subjected to forced organ harvesting for China's transplant market and lost their lives (www.organharvestinvestigation.net). We therefore ask the House to request the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister to openly and forthrightly call for an immediate end to the persecution of Falun Gong in China. from 6383 citizens (Petition No. PN0383) Drought The time for drought relief & that of band-aid solutions of low interest loans & short term cash relief, but time for a permanent Drought Relief Scheme(DRS). Farming is the backbone of any nation, without it, everyone is affected. Farmers should not be put through the stress they are under, financially and mentally. We therefore ask the House to vote on (DRS), including dams & pipework: 1. direct supply to farms, or, access to filling stations which would be used by farmers using a community owned water truck 2. backup by desalination plant 3. new infrastructure to reuse sewage, storm water & water from flood zones 4. In return, farmers will allocate acres of their land which they will indefinitely loan for solar, hydro & wind power production technology to be installed by the (DRS), to feed power to any infrastructure, to have it running at cost neutral to farmers. As well as additional power to feed back into the grid as green energy which will see the Scheme being paid for by any such power & ongoing maintenance & expansion costs. 5. This is a large project that will need many workers of different skill trades. We also propose that this is a perfect time for the governments of Australia, to wind back the use of Greenhouse producing electricity power stations and use the labor force that comes out of this closure, to be used and retrained if required, in the construction and maintenance of that outlined in (see.4). See original petition & information https://www.change.org/p/to-the-australian-state-federal-governments-senate-proposalfor-infrastructure-implementation-for-permanent-drought-relief-water-supplies from 33 citizens (Petition No. EN0725) Great Barrier Reef As a group of concerned citizens the Great Barrier Reef, a natural wonder of the world, provides a tourist attraction and substantial economic benefits for our country. Adani's coal mine (an enterprise limited company) is conducting mining on the Carmichael Coal Mine in the North of the Galilee Basin in Queensland, Australia which is polluting the environment and destroying our reef therefore requiring immediate action. The Great Barrier Reef is already under pressure from coastal industrialisation, chemical farm runoff, and the recent massive coral bleaching crisis leading to society needing to take ownership on protecting our natural wonders to preserve the beautiful reef. With greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to more  than 4.49 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide pH levels of the ocean become affected leading to animals, habitat destruction, and ecosystems all being destroyed. 69,000 reef related tourism jobs will be affected from an economic aspect, with the megamine leading to a climate disaster. We therefore ask the House to implement laws restricting Adani's from undertaking coal mining across the Great Barrier Reef. This includes a potential law of not involving any economic profitable organisations to undertake an environmentally threatening assignment across a prevalent landmark. It is also requested that a form of action is carried out and awareness of this issue is widely publicised which will cause society to fight against this. from 45 citizens (Petition No. EN0726) Human Rights ""ICESCR Article 11 states: The States Parties to the present Covenant recognize the right of everyone to an adequate standard of living for himself and his family, including adequate food, clothing and housing."" This is from www.humanrights.gov.au. This states that the basic human right of adequate housing is recognised, yet there are still no housing options for those who are homeless, particularly for youth who struggle to pay for even the most affordable housing, while still feeding, clothing, and transporting themselves. We therefore ask the House to enquire into the reasons emergency accommodation and other such services are unavailable, enquire for resolutions to these reasons, and take action into providing the homeless, especially youth who are homeless, with adequate opportunities to rebuild themselves in a safe environment that is within their needs and restrictions, i.e. time, affordability, location, education, work. from 17 citizens (Petition No. EN0727) Foreign Investment We feel that because Australia has traditionally relied on foreign investment we are not self sustainable. We are lucky we are are an Island and should not have to rely on foreign influence. We should be investing all we have in Aus. All tax payers money should go back into Australia. Policies should be changed to stop foreign plunder of our natural resources. foreign companies should be charged more to pay off our debt. citizens should have less regulation and fines and more regulation and fines should be redirected toward foreign business. Chance is we will lose some foreign investment but this then opens avenues for Australian investment in Australia. stop selling off our resources and invest in us. We request the Aus Gov to trust and have faith in the Australian people and our culture of respecting the land whilst doing business. We therefore ask the House to consider future policies of less foreign investment in Australia and encourage more Australian investment opportunities. for all future policies to incorporate the perception of becoming self sufficient in an unstable world. To consider if all new and old policies work toward a solid and stable base support. We are a hot commodity we ask to up the price for foreigners and lower the price for Aussies. We are young and we are free don't ruin that. from 22 citizens (Petition No. EN0728) Superannuation As a returned service person I would like to Roll over my Military Superannuation. Current financial returns are based on CPI which isn't in the best interest of our ex service men and women. I propose we as volunteers to our country be given the respect and responsibility to ""own"" what is rightfully ours. I beleive our government has a moral obligation to authorise the Roll Over of Superannuation for those who have served. All other super funds allow for this process and appear to care for thier customers. Our financial future is in jeapordy due to the short sighted governers of MilSuper. I beleive i could have earned an average of 10% per year on my current balance since leaving the Military in 2006. In 12 year since leaving i have made $25,000.00. In comparison to my curren Super provider of $130,000.00 This is a huge difference of earnings and retirement comfort. Why are we being financialy punished ?? we deserve to be in control of our financial future as Milsuper can not match or even compete with the lowest Super earners. Give back our money. We therefore ask the House to release our Military Super to be rolled over into another fund. from 41 citizens (Petition No. EN0729) Population Growth We the undersigned petitioners are concerned about the lack of infrastructure, public amenity, damaging environmental impacts and rises in National Security threats in major cities, due to Australia's rapid population growth. Many Australians want to be part of determining the future of their nation, including the livability and safety of their communities, thru sustainable population, compatible immigration, and infrastructure planning. The petitioners request they be included in a national conversation to determine their future. They want to be provided with all relevant information, including current migrant and refugee intakes, projected population growth to 2050, planned and funded infrastructure, ‘planned decentralization' to relieve clogged major cities and redistribute growth to under-populated rural and regional Australia, and the plan to grow a sustainable and liveable Australia. The nation has not had a national conversation to decide whether they want a ‘bigger or a better' Australia. There is an urgent need to address this issue and start a plan. We therefore ask the House to commence a national conversation on population and immigration, through an online poll run by the Federal Government, providing relevant data to enable a meaningful result based on facts and evidence. from 187 citizens (Petition No. EN0730)  Law Enforcement Requesting tougher mandatory sentencing for child abusers and child sex offenders. Sentencing is currently far too lenient and inconsistent, particularly in relation to historical sex offences against children. The sentencing currently fails to reflect the life sentence suffered by survivors of childhood sexual abuse. We therefore ask the House to apply stricter mandatory sentencing to all offenders who sexually abuse children. from 1057 citizens (Petition No. EN0731) Visas I am requesting leniency for visa genuine applications for foreign Syrian/Lebanese families that want to be part of something special with Australian families, on 2 occasions we have applied for immediate family to come attend 2 weddings and both times were denied visas, I find this unfair as they do have enough incentive to return to their country. it would be appreciative if we could have the assessment conducted with more sentiment in future as we would love to share the greatness of this country with every part of the world. It is quite sad for a father not to attend his own sons wedding because of someones bias opinion that there is no motivation of return but i am 100% sure there is, as these people have homes and businesses and families to go back to. We therefore ask the House to Please in future would you take some more consideration to honest applicants or ask more questions before denying the application. that is the least we could ask for. from 6 citizens (Petition No. EN0733) Agriculture Industry The Australian Agricultural industry suffers a huge amount loss when incidents occur and media coverage exacerbates the negative impacts of a situation. Large retailers like Coles, Woolworths and Aldi then impose their ridiculous standard of produce, causing farmers to; dump their product, sell at a loss or simply NOT BE PAID by these entities. These entities then proceed to import produce from other countries. We therefore ask the House to sanction the import of produce which is attainable within Australia be banned. We therefore ask the House to empower Australian Growers & Suppliers the right and ability to contest a retailer such as Coles, Woolworths and Aldi when produce is not accepted This contest needs to be affordable by the Australian Grower and not result in court battles. There should be a body within the Australian Grower's Association that is empowered to review this and protect the Australian Industry and end consumer with the Australian economy and industry at the core of it's focus. from 26 citizens (Petition No. EN0735) Taxation Has the Australian Government looked at the $1 tax system where everybody is taxed $1, including big business. Big business taxed $1 for each thing they do. This system will actually work. It will pay our National Debt. We therefore ask the House to look seriously, explore and implement the $1 tax system from 10 citizens (Petition No. EN0737) Employment House to enact federal legislation introducing aged parental leave, and encourage states to support this change. This to ease the burden on persons working past retirement and also attempting to take care of aging parents. We therefore ask the House to introduce and discuss the idea of aged parental leave being introduced into the Australia workplace as is Parental Leave. Keeping our aged at home longer with family support and making it easier for people to work past retirement. from 16 citizens (Petition No. EN0738) Parliamentarians' Entitlements For too long politicians have lived in an era of entitlement, this has to stop We therefore ask the House to review ALL parliamentary privileges including payment of pensions on termination of employment, wage rises, superannuation rates and all allowances that politicians currently receive. from 81 citizens (Petition No. EN0739) Christian Festivals We the undersigned petitioners are concerned about the systematic and deliberate removal of Christmas and Easter celebrations. Businesses and schools are removing these celebrations due to some people taking 'offense'. Australia is a multiethnic nation; however, our own western civilizational culture and heritage was founded on Christian-Judea principles. Migrants coming to Australia share in the benefits this culture provides. Migrant communities are assisted with government grants to help celebrate their own religious and cultural festivals as part of 'Multiculturism'. Most Australians , however, are Christians, or have a Christian background. Christmas and Easter are their significant cultural and religious events! We are concerned that the majority's cultural and religious celebrations are being removed. Politicians join in Eid celebrations, Jewish and Buddhist Rosh Hashanah and Loy Krathong festivals, but at the same time are allowing the cultural and religious heritage  of the nation, to be quietly erased. It is time to save Christmas and Easter; before they become distant memories, and our own cultural heritage is lost. We therefore ask the House to recognize the traditions of Christmas and Easter and encourage them to be openly celebrated across ALL sectors of Australian society. We also request the house include the majority 'Australian culture' in all aspects of 'Multicultural Australia' thru grants, legislation and representation. from 405 citizens (Petition No. EN0740) Prime Minister The people of Australia deserve and need stable Leadership we can count on. We therefore ask the House to hold a National Referendum and change the Constitution to merge the Federal Governments of Australia and New Zealand so that Jacinda Arden will be our Prime Minister. from 18 citizens (Petition No. EN0742) Goods and Services Tax The Australian Government take an extra 10% GST on top of the fuel excise which in turn is driving up fuel prices. There is no need to double dip on an already highly taxed product. The Fuel Companies are not getting off easy either, price gouging and collusion between service stations and price differences of up to 20c per litre when the Petrol stations are across the road from each other. It is criminal. We are wanting to achieve more affordable fuel for all Australians. We therefore ask the House to consider in the interests of the Citizens of Australia our proposal for removing the GST on the fuel excise and also lowering the fuel excise and a Royal Commission into Fuel Prices and price gouging. from 35744 citizens (Petition No. EN0744) Superannuation The DFRDB Authority failed to disclose to veterans the whole-of-life impost of a Lump Sum Commutation on superannuation payments reduced by a factor, based on redundant Notional Life Expectancy data and an individual's Service data. Limited disclosure of the whole-of-life deductions was made by DFRDB, 37years after the Scheme was launched, but never to members so affected. Direct debit by DFRDB has been incremented and escalated over time, to a level where the original lump sum has been reimbursed multiple times. This effectively means that veterans are subsidising their own benefits. There was no definition of the term 'commutation' within the legislation or in any document provided by DFRDB to superannuants, until its disclosure advised above. The direct debits were shown in the legislation and the DFRDB's Administrative Manual to be a finite amount, not an escalating continuum . On advice from DFRDBA all superannuants understood Commutation as an advance of Benefits to be reimbursed to DFRDB by fortnightly debits over a finite period and at a finite rate. How deluded Veterans were through DFRDB's failure to disclose their interpretation of the Legislation, before the fact, thereby committing Veterans to an ever increasing, spiraling, life-term DEBT-SENTENCE We therefore ask the House to: Instate the NLE point of each affected veteran as the point where full reinstatement of their Commutation obligation is fulfilled: and, Reimburse to each DFRDB veteran, all over-subscribed payments forfeited by direct debit by them, once their original lump sum was repaid in full. from 3753 citizens (Petition No. EN0745) Mental Health We are asking for this to be implemented due to the elevated stress and high rates of suicide experienced within this industry. Every year 190 Australians who work in these industries take their own lives. Please sign now to recommend funding for the development of programs to help guide best practice strategies for addressing mental health at work. These would seek to accomplish the following: reduce exposure to hazards in the workplace; promote positive aspects of mental health; provide mental health and suicide prevention literacy; and, facilitate early intervention and treatment. Such measures would aim to improve the overall psychosocial quality of work in the industry. We believe that there are key factors in the trade industry workers external environment that can be modified by prevention initiatives. This would result in an overall improvement in mental well-being of construction workers; a decrease in psychological distress and mental health of construction workers; and, an overall improvement in the psychosocial characteristics of working conditions. We suggest that post industry-approved approaches are developed, relevant standards and protocols are established. We are undergraduate BA students from Massey University working on a group project to improve mental health in the trade industry in Australia. We therefore ask the House to recommend that companies operating in the building, mining and farming industries have a mental health dimension within their procurement policies from 45 citizens (Petition No. EN0746) Higher Education We the undersigned petitioners are concerned about the lack of free speech in Australian universities. Denying students, the opportunity to engage in a robust discussion of ideas is, in fact, denying the genesis and role of the institutions themselves. Recently there have been calls in the media for universities to rethink their policies on free speech, especially in the humanities and social science sectors. Recently, a series of visiting guest speakers at Universities have been de-platformed, tours cancelled, students and members of the public abused, assaulted and prevented from entering venues and attending  lectures. Taxpayer-funded education institutions must provide a platform to debate ideas and opinions. In addition, educational institutions should be expected to fulfill their charter and apply their own Codes of Conduct. A failure to do so, is a failure of both the institution and the government. We therefore ask the House to review funding for institutions who fail to allow free speech, fail to fulfill their charter, and who fail to apply their own Codes of Conduct. When breaches occur, such as have recently occurred, preventing freedom of speech on university campuses, these should be met with punitive measures including withholding funding until such time breaches are addressed and remedied. from 317 citizens (Petition No. EN0747) National Security We the undersigned petitioners are concerned that national security and public safety is compromised while the law permits people to cover their faces in public spaces, and, therefore, their identity. Currently, under Federal Law, there are no provisions banning face coverings that impede or prevent proper identification. The current state laws differ from federal law and differ from each other. Face coverings include any garment that disguises the wearer, including masks, scarfs, motorbike helmets, balaclavas, and burqas. Covering one's face in public divides a free society when doing business and engaging in social discourse, however, lack of proper identification becomes a threat to safety and security when criminal acts are committed by people wearing face coverings. The United States is seeking to pass a Bill: HR 6054, that would punish anyone wearing a mask or disguise, who ‘injures, oppresses, threatens or intimidates' someone else exercising a right guaranteed under the Constitution. In support of public safety and national security, we believe Australia should pass a similar bill. We therefore ask the House to pass legislation, that prohibits the wearing of any face covering in public spaces, to deliberately impede or prevent a person being properly and clearly identified A suitable fine and /or custodial sentence should be imposed by the relevant Minister. from 587 citizens (Petition No. EN0748) Food Labelling There is ongoing public discussion on the matters of confusing labelling of food and beverage products, we wish to see food labelling requirements changed, so that the origins of products are not misrepresented, nor otherwise obscured. Examples are the various milks available, we believe it should be a requirement that all milks include the animal or plant of their origin such as ""cow's milk"" ""goat's milk"" ""soy milk"" etcetera - and that obscuring the origins of such products by labelling them only 'milk' should not be permitted. This will both ensure that purchasers acquire the milk they intend, and that those with allergy, religious, or other concerns may be assured of acquiring milks that meet their needs. We therefore ask the House to review the standards for food labelling to ensure accurate representation of product origin is shown for all products, so as to remove obscure or 'blanket' naming that may cause confusion - along with potential health, religious, or other issues - to Australian consumers from 23 citizens (Petition No. EN0750) Australian Broadcasting Corporation: iView The ABC iView facility on LG televisions and perhaps other brands is scheduled to have that service removed on 8 November 2018. This applies to many expensive LG televisions and perhaps other brands purchased 2012-2013. In view of the fact that the televisions purchased with that facility are recent it is felt to be unfair to have the facility removed. Even more so if it only applies to Lg televisions. We therefore ask the House to ensure in all fairness that funding required to provide ABC iView is continued to those televisions which are scheduled to have that facility removed. from 15 citizens (Petition No. EN0754) Climate Change We have twelve years (just four election cycles) to significantly reduce our greenhouse emissions. Failing to take drastic action now would mean passively and impotently submitting to our collective fate, environmental disaster and destruction. We can and must do better. As our elected representatives, you have a duty to put concrete, actionable climate change policy at the top of the House's agenda and heed the advice of experts and the irrefutable scientific evidence before you that says climate change is real, man-made and a threat. We can no longer depend on fossil fuels, a dwindling and harmful resource, to provide us with energy. Australia has unbridled potential to lead the world in non-renewable energy production. Not only can it reduce carbon emissions, it can revitalise our economy and create hundreds of thousands of jobs. Given that we have the means to harness Australia's renewable resources (e.g. sunlight, wind etc.) and our great capacity for innovation and ingenuity, it is imperative that the House acts now. We therefore ask the House to 1. Put Climate Change policy at the top of the agenda in all future sittings 2. Do all it can to eliminate fossil fuels, beginning with voting to close down coal stations and to implement an actionable strategy for completely transforming Australia's energy production into non-renewables 3. Implement a strategy for collaboration with our neighbours and partners, namely China, Japan and India to commit to a concrete plan of decarbonisation from 167 citizens (Petition No. EN0756)  NA Responses Mrs WICKS (Robertson) (10:06): Ministerial responses to petitions previously presented to the House have been received as follows: Visas Dear Mrs Wicks Thank you for your correspondence of 21 May 2018 on behalf of the Standing Committee on Petitions regarding petition number EN0547. Your correspondence has been referred to me as the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs as the matter falls within my portfolio responsibilities. This petition requests the Australian Government consider granting access to permanent residency for Temporary Work (Skilled) (subclass 457) visa holders after two years if their occupation is listed on the Medium and Long-term Strategic Skills List (MLTSSL) and they were granted their subclass 457 visa after 18 April 2018. On 18 April 2017, the Government announced that the subclass 457 visa would be abolished and replaced with the new Temporary Skill Shortage (TSS) visa. On 18 March 2018, the TSS visa was introduced, along with complementary reforms to permanent employer sponsored visas. The visa reforms implemented in March 2018 are designed to ensure Australian workers have priority for Australian jobs, and strengthen the integrity and quality of our skilled visa programmes. This included extending the period a subclass 457 or TSS visa holder must have worked for their employer in Australia from two to three years to be eligible to apply for permanent employer-sponsored visas in the Temporary Residence Transition (TRT) streams. The Government has taken steps to mitigate the impact on people who held existing subclass 457 visas on the date of announcement, 18 April 2017, by enabling them to access special arrangements which ensure the previous two-year requirement continues to apply to them. Further, the Direct Entry streams of the permanent employer-sponsored visas continue to be available to anyone who meets the visa requirements, and do not require a residence period. Thank you for bringing petition EN0547 to my attention. Yours sincerely from the Minister For Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Mr Coleman Live Animal Exports Dear Mrs Wicks Thank you for your correspondence of 13 August 2018 in relation to petition number EN0619 regarding live animal exports. Animal cruelty in any circumstance is abhorrent and must be condemned. The government supports a sustainable livestock export trade and has recently introduced a number of measures to make the trade accountable for its actions. In April this year I commissioned a review by veterinarian Dr Michael MCCarthy to assure the health and welfare of sheep being transported to the Middle East during the northern hemisphere summer. The government accepted all 23 recommendations made by Dr MCCarthy, and the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources implemented most of the recommendations immediately. Some recommendations, such as a revised heat stress risk assessment model based on animal welfare, rather than mortality indicators, will take more time to implement. The first issues paper seeking public input on the development of a new approach to heat stress risk assessment of livestock for export to the Middle East is on the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources' ' Have your say' web page for comment until 19 October 2018. To reap Dr MCCarthy' s report and find out more information about the actions being undertaken in response to the review, visit agriculture.gov.au/LAB. Following the MCCarthy review, the department implemented a reduction in stocking densities, so fewer sheep are carried on a vessel at any given time. As a result, sheep will have up to 39 per cent more space. This equates to a reduction in stocking density of up to 28 per cent. While the Australian Position Statement on the Export of Livestock is not being reviewed at this time, the government is reviewing the Australian Standards for the Export of Livestock. ASEL ensures that livestock are fit for export and that their health and welfare is managed during live export voyages. An independent technical committee is currently reviewing ASEL and have just completed one round of public consultation. More information on the review is available at agriculture.gov.au/animal/welfare/export-trade/review-asel. Further consultation is expected to take place in late October, also via the department's ' Have your Say' website. Thank you for bringing this petition to the government's attention. Yours sincerely from the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, Mr Littleproud  Illicit Drugs Dear Mrs Wicks I refer to your letter of 17 September 2018 on behalf of the Standing Committee on Petitions, concerning the proposal to increase the scope of health issues which warrant the use of medicinal cannabis, to make the process of obtaining licenses to prescribe medicinal cannabis easier for applicable professionals, improve access of medicinal cannabis from controlled suppliers and establish specific age requirements to specific key health issues in terms of prescription - Petition Number EN0662 To enable appropriate patient access to medicinal cannabis products the Liberal National Government decided to regulate medicinal cannabis products as medicines under the remit of the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA). There is currently only one TGA approved medicinal cannabis product which is indicated for certain patients with Multiple Sclerosis. Therefore many of the medicinal cannabis products doctors may wish to prescribe are unapproved medicines and have not been evaluated by the TGA for quality, safety and effectiveness. However, unapproved medicines can still be accessed by one of TGA's unapproved product access schemes including the Special Access Scheme (SAS) and Autho1ised Prescriber Scheme. Depending on the tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol composition of the product, the doctor may also need state/territory approval to presc1ibe. Access for patients to unapproved medicinal cannabis products has been steadily increasing in recent months. From 1 January 2016 up to the end of September 2018 there have been a total of 1419 SAS Category B approvals, with 238 approvals in September alone. In addition, over 300 patients have been prescribed medicinal cannabis products through the Authorised Prescriber scheme There are no general Government restrictions on the health conditions that doctors can apply to access medicinal cannabis products for and we note that each patient's circumstances are different. It is the responsibility of the prescribing doctor to provide clinical justification for use of the product in the patient's particular circumstance. This is the same requirement for any unapproved product accessed under the SAS. Likewise, there are no specific age requirements for access to medicinal cannabis products as each case is assessed on its own merits, noting that tetrahydrocannabinols (one of the compounds found in some medicinal cannabis products) are not rec01mnended for children or adolescents. The process for doctors to receive approval to access unapproved medicinal cannabis products has also been streamlined in recent months. From July, doctors in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria have been able to apply simultaneously to both the TGA and their state health department via TGA's online portal. This streamlined process is now also available to doctors in South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory as of the end of September. Decisions on applications submitted through the online portal are issued within 48 hours of all the required information being submitted. With the introduction of the above streamlined process I am confident that the time-frame for patients to access to medicinal cannabis products once their doctor has decided to prescribe them has been significantly reduced. Thank you for writing on this matter. Yours sincerely from the Minister for Health, Mr Hunt My Health Record Dear Mrs Wicks I refer to your letter September 2018 seeking my response to a petition raised by the dHealthNetwork for the Government to prove the quality of data management and security to inform individual choice (petition EN0670). I take this petition to relate to the My Health Record and the current transition to opt-out participation arrangements which will see a My Health Record created for every eligible Australian by the end of 2018, unless they opt-out by 15 November 2018. In terms of security, the My Health Record system has been designed at its core to have the highest level or security and privacy to protect people's health information. These capabilities include comprehensive security monitoring, strong process and technology security controls, security assurance for all new releases, and dedicated security operations management. The Australian Digital Health Agency employs multiple layers of security to protect the system from malicious attack. This approach, known as defence in depth, is based on the idea that any single method of defence can be bypassed so it is important to implement a range of security measures that work simultaneously to protect our critical data. Continuous improvements in the cyber security environment help ensure that the security of the My Health Record system is maintained and constantly improved. Further, in order to ensure the handling and protection of information continues to be subject to Australian law, My Health Record information cannot be taken, held, processed or handled outside Australia. More information about the security measures and activities used to protect the My Health Record system is provided in the Australian Digital Health Agency' s submission to the Senate Committee Affairs C01mnittee's inquiry in the My Health Record system, available on the C01mnittee's website.  Organisations participating in the system, primarily registered healthcare provider organisations, are subject to a range of security requirements and obligations. For example, systems used by registered healthcare provider organisations to access the My Health Record system must pass strict conformance requirements in order to connect to the system. Then, once connected, those systems must have user account management practices that enable it to restrict access to only those authorised by the organisation to access My Health Records, which uniquely identify users and are protected by passwords or other robust security mechanisms. Failure to comply can incur serious civil and c1iminal penalties of up to $630,000 or imprisonment for two years for each offence. Participating organisations are also subject to severe penalties if they misuse My Health Record information. Individuals can also take steps to further protect their information, including monitoring the audit log which records each access to their My Health Record, applying codes so that only an organisation provided the code can access the whole My Health Record or particular documents in it, electing to be notified by SMS or email of certain events such as when a new organisation accesses their My Health Record, removing or classifying documents in their My Health Record, and electing not to share their de-identified information for research purposes. Ultimately an individual can choose to cancel their My Health Record and it will no longer be accessible. Subject to the enactment of changes proposed by the My Health Records Amendment (Strengthening Privacy) Bill which is currently being considered by the Parliament, if an individual cancels their My Health Record the system operator will be required to delete any health information it holds about the individual. In terms of data quality, registered healthcare provider organisations are required to ensure any information they contribute to a My Health Record is accurate and up-to-date, and is not misleading or defamatory. Again, penalties apply if an organisation fails to comply with this requirement. More broadly, in order to enable the exchange of high quality data with a c01mnonly understood meaning that can be used with confidence, Australian governments are working together in a range of activities that will see improvements in the quality of health data. Among other things; they will co-produce a national interoperability strategy which will set out agreed base-level requirements for using digital technology when providing care, and current standards and specifications will be continually enhanced to give healthcare providers access to complete, accurate health information. Yours sincerely from the Minister for Health, Mr Hunt Australian Constitution Dear Mrs Wicks Thank you for your letter of 17 September 2018 regarding Petition EN0672 on constitutional heads of power for Commonwealth legislation. I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this to my attention. I refer to my letter of 13 July 2018 on the same topic. When the Government proposes new or amending legislation it considers a range of matters, including the constitutional basis for the legislation. A number of government agencies have responsibility for considering the constitutional basis for legislation, including the Office of Parliamentary Counsel and the Attorney-General's Department, which includes the Australian Government Solicitor. The proposal in the Petition, to include provisions in Commonwealth legislation detailing the underpinning head/s of power, would not be determinative of the validity of the legislation. Under the Australian Constitution, the judicial branch of government has responsibility for determining whether legislation is constitutionally valid. Only the courts can determine this question. As Australia's highest court, it is the High Court of Australia which has the power to finally determine whether a law is within the legislative powers of the Commonwealth. Thank you for raising this matter with me. I trust this information is of assistance. Yours sincerely  Illicit Drugs Dear Mrs Wicks I refer to your letter of 17 September 2018 on behalf of the Standing Committee on Petitions, concerning the proposal to change the laws regarding cannabis - Petition Number EN0673. I note that the petition requests that the House change the current laws regarding cannabis to allow adult Australians to grow their own cannabis for medicinal use (the number of allowable plants would be based on current daily use). The petition appears to suggest that adults should be allowed grow plants wherever they see fit, and that diagnosis and treatment (via medicinal cannabis) would not necessarily include the opinion of a medical professional. Currently, cannabis is a narcotic drug in Australia and its use and supply is controlled by a number of laws including the Crimes (Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Act 1990, the Customs Act 1901, the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 and the Narcotic Drugs Act 1967 (the ND Act). The ND Act is the enabling legislation to implement Australia's obligations under the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961 (the Single Convention) to which Australia is a party. The ND Act's present strict controls on the cultivation of licit cannabis crops for medicinal use, strike the right balance between patient access, community protection and our international obligations.  A change in regulation of this nature would dismantle the carefully constructed regulation of the cultivation, production and manufacture of medicinal cannabis. Specifically, the changes that are petitioned for would not be compliant with Australia' s international treaty obligations as provided for by the Single Convention. Australia's obligations under the Single Convention include:  the prevention of diversion to illicit trafficking and uses;  a single agency to designate areas of land where cultivation can occur;  the licensing of the cultivator by the agency;  control of cultivation and production to ensure there is no oversupply;  reporting annually to the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB). As a signatory to the Single Convention, Australia is required to regularly provide info1mation to the INCB to allow it to ca1Ty out its functions including publication of both an annual report and technical reports on narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances that provide details on estimates of the annual legitimate requirements of each country, as well as data on licit production, manufacture, trade and consumption of drugs worldwide. To meet Australia's reporting obligations, my Department requires manufacturers to regularly report to it relevant estimates. The changes suggested in this Petition would result in Australia failing to meet its international obligations to provide information to the INCB. Australia's international reputation for its progressive, balanced and comprehensive approach to dealing with problems posed by the use and misuse of drugs in the community would potentially be damaged by such a change. There are community expectations that there should be a licit source of cannabis for medicinal use. The changes suggested in this petition would remove the necessary controls on the quality or strength of the resulting medicinal cannabis product. This could expose the community to potentially dangerous substances and outcomes. The carefully considered controls on the supply chain that are mandated in the ND Act would be non-existent. The ND Act presently limits the grant of a licence to manufacture medicinal cannabis products to an applicant who is able to demonstrate a legitimate supply route; cultivators may only obtain a licence by demonstrating the ability to supply to a licensed manufacturer. The purpose of the scheme's design to remove the possibility of oversupply or excess production and the risk of diversion, would, should such a change occur, be destroyed - presenting the attenuated risk. In addition to this, it is the responsibility of the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TOA) to determine how medicines in Australia should be accessed, including medicinal cannabis products. This process is known as 'Scheduling'. Scheduling is a national classification system that controls how medicines and poisons (substances) are made available to the public. Scheduling is an independent process where decisions are made by a senior TOA Medical Officer, on the advice of an expe11 committee on behalf of the Secretary of my Depai1ment. It is not a decision made by me (as the Minister of Health) or the Parliament. Substances are classified into Schedules according to the degree of risk and the level of control required over their availability in order to protect consumers. These factors include the risk profile of the substance including risks of abuse and dependency, the requirement for medical diagnosis, management and monitoring by a medical practitioner, and the se1iousness, severity and frequency of adverse effects. The Schedules are published in the Poisons Standard and are given legal effect through state and territory legislation. The higher the Schedule, the more restrictive the controls are on the availability of a substance. Medicinal cannabis products fall into Schedule 4 (Prescription Only Medicine), Schedule 8 (Controlled Drug) (this is the same schedule as substances such as morphine and cocaine) or Schedule 9 (Prohibited Substance) of the Poisons Standard depending on such their composition and what their intended use is. For example, products containing cannabis (including seeds, extracts, resins and any pai1 of the plant) and tetrahydrocannabinols (when extracted from cannabis) when prepared for human therapeutic use are in Schedule 8. Cannabidiol-only products (that contain less than 2% of other cannabinoids found in cannabis) are in Schedule 4. Nontherapeutic use of cannabis products are in Schedule 9. Schedule 8 medicinal cannabis products contain tetrahydrocannabinols which are the psychoactive component of cannabis and were established as Schedule 8 due to the risk of misuse, abuse or illicit use. As cannabis and tetrahydrocannabinols are in Schedules I and IV of the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961, the co1Tesponding Australian Scheduling Policy Framework directs these substances should be in Schedule 8. The Commonwealth's approach to treating cannabis as a narcotic and a medicine, including through the National Drug Strategy, reflects Australia's balanced health and law enforcement approach to reducing the impact of illicit drug use, tobacco use and the harmful use of alcohol. Relevantly, all scheduling decisions include consideration of a standard set of factors, to ensure that public health objectives are consistently met and the application of public health risk considerations is consistent within each Schedule. The factors for each Schedule are set out in the Scheduling Policy Framework and relate back to the matters required to be taken into account by section 52E(l) of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989. Cannabis and its therapeutically active substances are included in the Poisons Standard, which assists in determining the need for particular health professionals to be involved in their supply as medicinal substances to promote their safe and quality use.  As noted earlier, Australia is a signatory to the Single Convention that aims to combat drug abuse by coordinated international action. There are two forms of intervention and control that work together. First, it seeks to limit the possession, use, trade in, distribution, import, expo1t, manufacture and production of drugs exclusively to medical and scientific purposes. Secondly, it combats drug trafficking through international cooperation to deter and discourage drug traffickers. Further, Australia's obligations under the Single Convention require putting in place a system of control over the cultivation of cannabis plant for the production of cannabis or cannabis resin. Cannabis and cannabis resins are Schedule I and IV drugs under the Single Convention and require additional measures of control. If Australia was to implement the suggested changes outlined in the petition, parties might close off international access to imported medicinal cannabis, potential exportable medicinal cannabis and potentially other drugs as Australia may be in violation of the Single Convention. For example, regulation that is not consistent with Australia's international obligations would have adverse reputational implications for Australia's licit poppy industry with medium term risks to Australia's approved status as a major supplier of poppy straw in a timely controlled manner. There is a very real possibility that the INCB would take the opportunity to revisit global allocations, and other countries, who also trade in narcotics (poppies), may take advantage of the scenario replacing Australia' s position as a major narcotic supplier. This could significantly negatively impact the agriculture/economy of the state of Tasmania While many Australians may view cannabis use as harmless, almost a quarter of Australia's drug and alcohol treatment services are being provided to people identifying cannabis as their principal drug of concern. This is roughly the same number of treatment episodes as for amphetamine use. Cannabis use has been demonstrated to have significant negative health outcomes, including problems with memory and learning, addiction, decreased motivation, and concentration, anxiety, increased risk of respiratory diseases, paranoia and in some cases psychosis. The Liberal National Government's views on cannabis are consistent with the principles set out in Australia's National Drug Strategy, which identifies cannabis as a priority substance. This includes a commitment to activities which aim to prevent uptake and delay first time use, to provide access to treatment and support services (which includes drug diversion programs in some states/territories) and to prevent and disrupt the supply of cannabis to reduce availability . Yours sincerely from the Minister for Health, Mr Hunt Trade Dear Mrs Wicks Thank you for your letter of 17 September 2018 about Petition EN0678 which relates to lamb prices and drought support to farmers. I note the concern of the petitioners about the impact of Australian lamb exports and drought on the domestic market. Australian families are facing a number of cost pressures which may limit their ability to pay a higher price for meat at the supermarket. However, I am sure they would appreciate that current red meat prices are very welcome for farmers with livestock to sell, especially for those in the drought-affected eastern states. Higher returns at the farmgate for sheepmeat producers mean that debt is being paid down, bills are being paid off, food is being put on the table and rural and regional communities are being injected with a much needed boost during times of widespread drought. Export markets are critical to the Australian sheepmeat industry as Australia produces much more lamb and mutton than Australians consume. The domestic market is and will remain very important for our red meat industries. Meat & Livestock Australia is taking steps to ensure that all Australians can enjoy lamb and beef, for example by investing in educating consumers about how to get the most out of every cut of meat they buy. On his first day in office, the Prime Minister, the Hon. Scott Morrison MP affirmed the government's highest priority is responding to the drought. As the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, I am eagerly working with the Prime Minister to support farmers experiencing hardship. In response to the current drought conditions, the government has already announced $1.8 billion in new assistance, additional funding and improvements to existing support. Our recent announcements reflect what members of our government have heard on the ground in our most drought-affected communities. The Coalition Government is supporting fanners and rural communities through the drought by funding a broad range of initiatives, which include:  the Farm Household Allowance, which supports farmers and their partners in financial hardship, regardless of the cause  the Rural Financial Counselling Service, which provides free financial counselling to farmers and small related businesses in, or at risk of, financial hardship  the Regional Investment Corporation, which administers the delivery of fam1 business concessional drought and investment loans and national water infrastructure loans  the Drought Communities Programme, which supports communities in drought-affected areas through local infrastructure projects and other drought-relief activities   various taxation measures and concessions, including the Farm Management Deposits Scheme and accelerated depreciation measures  funding the management of weeds and pest animals in drought-affected areas  enhanced weather and climate forecasting services to help prepare for drought  investments in water infrastructure to provide greater water security  support for rural mental health services and community organisations  appointing a National Drought Coordinator, Major General Stephen Day, DSC, AM, to engage across all levels of government, the private sector, philanthropic organisations, communities and farmers, and to facilitate coordinated delivery of drought assistance; and  appointing the Hon. Barnaby Joyce MP as Special Envoy on drought to focus on talking to farmers about the human and economic impact of the drought and the effectiveness of relief efforts. The petitioners can find more information about the range of available assistance measures on my department's website at agriculture.gov.au/assistance. I will continue to work hard to ensure our agricultural industries are able to thrive, bringing benefits to consumers, rural and regional communities, and the Australian economy at large. Thank you for bringing the petitioners concerns to my attention. Yours sincerely from the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, Mr Littleproud NA Statements Mrs WICKS (Robertson) (10:06): Petitions have been a constant feature of proceedings in the House since Federation. Inherited from the UK House of Commons, petitioning still offers an important opportunity for Australians to seek action on matters of national concern. In contrast with this long standing tradition, the Petitions Committee is a more recent feature of the House. The first Standing Committee on Petitions was established at the beginning of the 42nd Parliament. The committee aimed to strengthen the status of petitions, and to ensure that the House could appropriately respond to them. The role of the committee is to receive and process paper and electronic petitions. It can also inquire and report to the House on any matter relating to petitions and the petition system. Each petition is carefully examined against the standing orders, and petitions must contain a valid request that the House is able to action. As chair of the committee, I present petitions that meet requirements on sitting Mondays. Other members of the House can also present petitions. At the conclusion of the last sitting week, individual members had presented 39 paper petitions and 10 electronic petitions during the 45th Parliament. After a petition is presented, the committee usually refers it to the relevant government minister for comment. The minister is asked to provide a written response to the petition within 90 days. Once provided to the committee, responses are presented to the House. While a response may not grant a petitioner's request, it can provide up-to-date information on the legislation or policy surrounding the topic, or explain why a certain decision has been made. Mr Speaker, I look forward to reporting to the House at the conclusion of the committee's current inquiry into the future of petitioning. The committee will be speaking with petitions committees from the UK and Scottish parliaments over the coming days. NA Social Policy and Legal Affairs Committee Report",19
1,Ms BANKS,COMMITTEES," On behalf of the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs, I present the committee's report, incorporating a dissenting report, entitled Breaking barriers: a national adoption framework for Australian children, together with the minutes of proceedings. November is National Adoption Awareness Month, and today I am delighted to present the report of the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs, Breaking barriers: a national adoption framework for Australian children. In doing so, I would first like to acknowledge former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's heartfelt support for this inquiry on the basis that all Australian children deserve love and stability and that a national approach could address and break down the barriers.  I'd also like to reaffirm the committee's resolve to ensure a forward-looking approach to adoption and assurance that the past practices of forced adoption are never to be repeated. A forward-looking approach means that the best interests and safety of the child must be absolutely paramount considerations when making any decision about their adoption. Nothing is more important than providing children with safe, secure and nurturing homes. There are over 47,000 children in Australia living in out-of-home care. While many are with relatives or kin, there are far too many who are stuck in long-term foster care or residential care. The system is trapping many of these children into an unhealthy cycle. One of the biggest problems facing children in out-of-home care is the lack of permanency. Children are likely to bounce around the system from carer to carer, in some cases experiencing over 10 placements. We know that these children have poorer outcomes. They face constant change and instability on top of the trauma that led them to out-of-home care in the first place. This is a national issue that needs a national solution. It's time we gave these children a better option. The report is about breaking the barriers that are preventing vulnerable children from enjoying the safety, security and well-being that a permanent adoptive family can provide. Currently, there are very few adoptions in Australia. Less than 250 Australian children were adopted last year, and we have one of the lowest adoption rates in the world. We know that inconsistent adoption laws in states and territories are a barrier to adoption. There are different rules for consent, different rules for reunification with families, different time frames for how long children must wait for a permanent home and different rules for adoption from foster care. The committee has therefore recommended a national law for adoption. This will improve complexity and improve consistency. It also means children won't have to wait longer for permanent families, no matter where they live. Importantly, we recommend the national law for adoption, where suitable, provides for open adoption. Open adoption is different from the closed adoptions in the past. Closed adoptions were shrouded in secrecy. Adopted children's original birth certificates were sealed. Amended birth certificates were issued that established the child's new identity and relationship with their adoptive family as if their original family did not exist. The practice was strongly condemned in many submissions and considered a barrier to adoption. Open adoption is different. There is no secrecy and no loss of identity. Children do not lose; they stand only to gain. Open adoption means that children remain connected to their birth family, their culture and their identity. It can provide a profound sense of belonging and safety. It can stop the merry-go-round of foster carers and give children permanent families not just for childhood but for life. We've also recommended the use of integrated birth certificates, which include the details of the children's birth parents and adoptive parents. Integrated birth certificates state the facts; they do not conceal or deny the past. The committee has made other recommendations to improve adoption processes. The committee has recommended child-centric time frames for making decisions about permanent care so that children do not have to wait any longer than necessary. We also recommend streamlining processes to make adoption easier and so data collection can be improved. Childhood is fleeting. Every child deserves a safe, happy childhood providing them with the best possible foundations for the future. Removing the barriers to adoption can only be a positive move. We know that adoption will not suit all children who are in out-of-home care; however, there are many who will never be able to return to their birth families. It is these children that need to be given a profound sense of place. We need to give them permanent stable homes. We need to give them permanent stable families. We need to give them and their families legal permanency and we need to break the barriers standing between these Australian children and a brighter future. Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who has contributed to this inquiry. We valued immensely your participation and hope our work can help achieve better outcomes for all Australian children, who deserve love and stability. I commend the report to the House.",29
2,Ms CLAYDON,COMMITTEES," Given this is the first opportunity I have to welcome the new member for Wentworth, it's a great pleasure to see her sitting on the benches here today. I would like thank the chair and the committee for this opportunity to make some remarks about Labor members' dissenting report. I'm joined by all of the Labor colleagues who participated in the committee process; the member for Macarthur and the member for Lindsay are here today. I'd like to thank everybody who wrote submissions to this inquiry and took the time and effort to appear before it. I'd also like to give thanks at the outset for the support from the secretariat under the leadership of Shennia Spillane. I acknowledge their presence here today. Regretfully, Labor cannot support the government's report, which, contrary to government claims, will ultimately see a return to Australia's reprehensible legacy of permanently removing First Nations children from their families. We know that this policy has a profoundly disproportionate impact on First Nations children. From  the beginning of this inquiry, we have been dogged by complaints of bias and preconceived outcomes from organisational representatives and First Nations organisations and individuals in particular. Some stakeholders said that they had been actively excluded in favour of witnesses who supported adoption. I know that the secretariat have been very challenged, in trying to respond to these concerns raised by stakeholder groups, and that they have done their best. But, I have to say, Labor committee members held their own concerns that the outcome of this inquiry was a foregone conclusion. First, some background: in March this year, the then Assistant Minister for Children and Families, David Gillespie, sparked community outrage with an unprompted public call to open up adoptions of Indigenous children from out-of-home care. Unsurprisingly, the proposal was quickly condemned by experts and First Nations representatives alike, with the AbSec chief executive labelling it 'incredibly offensive'. Rather than listening, the minister in fact doubled down by referring this inquiry to the committee just a few weeks after he made those inflammatory comments. If Labor was suspicious about the referral of the inquiry, its suspicions were indeed confirmed by the first of only two terms of reference, which called for the consideration of 'stability and permanency for children in out-of-home care with local adoption as a viable option'-a virtual echo of the minister's ill-conceived call. Regretfully, but as Labor members predicted, the government members' report went on to recommend that we open up adoption to children in out-of-home care, exactly as the minister had suggested. Attempts by Labor to work through a bipartisan position for a consensus report were rejected. This is a shame, but it confirmed that the sole purpose of the report was to support the minister's original assertion. Labor members simply cannot countenance this recommendation, which would have a detrimental and disproportionate impact on First Nations communities, given that their children are 10 times more likely to be in out-of-home care. It will cast aside the evidence based Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Child Placement Principle. It severs children's links to their family and culture, and risks creating another stolen generation. The government members' report not only wilfully ignores the weight of evidence from submitters but also flies in the face of human rights conventions and the recommendations of countless inquiries that connection to kin, culture and country is critical to the safety and well-being of First Nations children. The proposed plan in the government members' report rests solely upon diverting children from out-of-home care into open adoption, which purports to be about providing an open exchange of information and contact between children and their birth parents and families. However, many witnesses told the committee that their lived experience of so-called open adoption was very different. Indeed, there is no agreed definition of 'open adoption', let alone how it works. In my few remaining moments, I urge this government to reconsider its position. Organisations and individuals have pleaded with us not to return to those despicable policies of the past. Sadly, their concerns have been ignored. I plead with the government not to make the same mistake, and to reconsider these recommendations.

6,Ms BANKS,COMMITTEES, I move: That the order of the day be referred to the Federation Chamber for debate. Question agreed to. NA Equal Pay Standard Bill 2018 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Wilkie. Bill read a first time. Second Reading,31
7,Mr WILKIE,BILLS," I move:  That this bill be now read a second time. Australia currently has a gender pay gap of 14.6 per cent, which means that on average women earn 14.6 per cent less in the workforce than men. Yes, this gap has been closing in recent years, but there's still a long way to go because it's still higher than the OECD average and in some industries in particular the gender pay gap is staggering. For example, in the finance industry there's a gender pay gap of over 30 per cent; in building and construction it sits at over 35 per cent; and in some sections of the economy such as financial asset broking services it's over 50 per cent. Clearly, this is a big problem, and it's not a situation that any of us should stand by and accept. There are obviously lots of reasons for this gender pay gap. Indeed, according to the Workplace Gender Equality Agency, they include that women and men are working in different industries and different jobs, with female-dominated industries and jobs attracting lower wages; women's disproportionate share of unpaid caring and domestic work; the lack of workplace flexibility to accommodate caring and other responsibilities, especially in senior roles; and women's greater time out of the workplace, which impacts career progression and opportunities. That's why it's crucial the government work to address all of these areas. For a start, we need to ensure that female-dominated sectors like education, health care and social assistance are properly valued and paid accordingly. Quite simply, it's a disgrace that some people in these sectors who work the hardest are often among the lowest paid. The government also needs to take the lead in encouraging a culture of workplace flexibility, such as policies that support career progression for people working part time, including tackling negative perceptions around men who work flexibly. The elephant in the room here is, to quote the Workplace Gender Equality Agency, 'discrimination and bias in hiring and pay decisions'. In other words, employers are making the decision, whether consciously or not, to not hire women in the same positions as men and, crucially, to pay them less than men when they do hire them. This leads to workplaces and then whole industries where there is an imbalance-sometimes a huge imbalancebetween the amount women and men get paid. It's this inequity in pay that this bill aims to address. Before I explain how the bill would work, I'd like to talk briefly about where the inspiration for it came from, which is Iceland, where last year their parliament passed amendments to the Act on Equal Status and Equal Rights of Women and Men which, in essence, require companies with 24 or more employees to get independent certification that they pay women and men equally. Equal pay is assessed against an internationally recognised standard, and there are fines-often quite severe fines-for employers who don't comply. The measures will be phased in over the next few years, but already Iceland is being seen as a world leader in tackling the gender pay gap by implementing this certification framework. The Equal Pay Standard Bill 2018 now before our parliament would establish a similar system. It works in three steps. Firstly, it requires the minister to develop an equal pay standard against which companies will be assessed. There is some flexibility as to what is in the standard and how it is assessed, but it must include a requirement that, when individuals receive different wages, that decision is based on considerations that do not include gender. It can include other requirements but it has to include that as a minimum. The minister also has to consult with employers, employees and small business when developing the standard. Secondly, this bill requires employers to obtain certification once the standard is in place. The requirement phases in for smaller businesses, with employers with a workforce of over 250 people having to get certification by 1 January 2020 and, at the other end, employers with a workforce of between 25 and 89 people having until 1 January 2023. This bill would apply across the whole economy, public and private, and to all employers with a workforce of 25 people or greater. It also applies to the Commonwealth as a whole. The certification is obtained from a certification body, which is a class of organisations determined by the minister under the act, and which might be, for example, an auditing body. Crucially, though, the minister must make sure that a certification body will carry out its functions competently and impartially. Thirdly, and most importantly, this bill allows the minister to give a direction to an employer to do whatever is necessary to comply with the equal pay standard and a time frame in which to do so. There are fines of up to $52,500 for employers who don't comply and the option of removing a company's certification if it fails to meet its obligations to pay women and men equally. Also, certification is only valid for 12 months, meaning that employers would need to continually demonstrate they are achieving equal pay. In other words, this bill provides a framework for employers to be forced to clean up their act if they're found to be noncompliant. Delivering on equal pay through this framework will not be an onerous task for businesses. Employers, obviously, already keep data about the wages they pay their employees and report these to government agencies like the Australian Taxation Office, and small businesses with 25 or fewer employees aren't even covered by this  bill. To the extent this is a small administrative burden on some employers, quite frankly it's a small price to pay to get a little bit closer to gender equality. I would like to now touch briefly on why closing the gender pay gap is important. For a start, not only does being paid less, obviously, affect women's economic security in the short term but they also end up much further behind in the long term, especially when it comes to superannuation. Indeed, a 2017 survey found that, on average, women retire with a super balance of $230,000 while men, on average, retire with around twice that. The gender pay gap also makes it more difficult for women to escape family and domestic violence. According to the Domestic Violence Resource Centre Victoria, for example, the gender pay gap means that women are less likely to build up the financial resources they need to become independent, particularly if they have family responsibilities. I would like to acknowledge that there is some movement by the major parties regarding the pay gap. For example, the Labor Party has committed to reveal the gender pay gap for companies with over 1,000 employees, and I do applaud the government for their women's economic security package announced last week, although some measures are problematic, like women having to draw down their own superannuation to escape domestic violence, which puts the entire economic burden on themselves. In closing, can I just say we need a holistic solution to close the gender pay gap, and the measures in this bill would go some way to achieve that. I thank the member for Melbourne for seconding this bill, and I invite him to make a contribution in my remaining time.",31
8,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, Is the motion seconded?,33
9,Mr BANDT,BILLS," I second the motion and I congratulate the member for Denison for bringing this measure before the House. In the remaining two minutes, I acknowledge that we do have a problem with a gender pay gap in this country. Inequality, in general, is at a 70-year high. That inequality manifests in various ways, and one of them is that women get paid less than men. It happens in a variety of ways. It happens in the most obvious sense of sometimes a woman being paid less than a man doing exactly the same job, but it also happens in other ways, with companies structuring their workforces so that it ends up being women who do the lower paid jobs while men get the higher paid ones. Or, across industries, women can be concentrated in industries where they get they get paid lower. As a result, we have a 14.6 per cent gender pay gap in this country. What the Equal Pay Standard Bill 2018 would do is allow the government to step in-clearly the hands-off approach hasn't worked-and say to companies, 'You have to tell us that you are paying men and women equally.' It won't necessarily set the rates of pay. That will be left up to the Fair Work Commission and the company's individual decisions, but it will say that you have to pay equally. That is an unobjectionable proposition. Everyone should support the idea of the government being able to tell and direct companies to pay their men and women equally. There are other things that we need to do, like fix the Fair Work Act. We need to change it so that it's an objective of the award system that there be equal pay. That's certainly something that the Greens will be pushing for in this and the next parliament. But this is a step that we could do in the meantime. And this is a step that should get the support of everyone from across the parliament no matter what party they're in, because we must close the gender pay gap, and a simple way of doing that is for the government to direct companies to pay men and women equally. Thank you.",33
10,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, The time allocated for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. National Integrity Commission Bill 2018 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms MCGowan. Bill read a first time. Second Reading,33
11,Ms MCGOWAN,BILLS," I move: That this bill be now read a second time. There are three main points to my speech today. The first is to call on the government for action. The second is to outline the important elements of this bill. And the third is to acknowledge the support of the crossbenchers in bringing this bill to parliament, because surely today I'm part of a team, and this team represents the combined feelings of the people of Australia for our government to take national action in setting up a national integrity commission.  We have brought to this parliament what we think is best practice, and we now call on the government to tell us why not. And if they can't tell us why not, what they need to tell us is what it will take to bring to this parliament something that they will agree to. But it's not just for the government to agree to it-our call is for this whole parliament to work in a bipartisan way to give this country what it needs, and to do that before the next election so that we do not go to the election in 2019 arguing about the need for this bill. In presenting this bill today I will now outline the main aspects of the bill. It's a package of bills that we put forward with the aim of promoting public trust and confidence in the integrity of parliament, the public sector and a system of government. The package is about creating a culture of integrity and a proactive and solutions focused approach to preventing corruption. The intent is to create a nationally coordinated integrity framework, with an emphasis on prevention, supported by strong powers of intervention to enable criminal charges or other actions in response to cases of corruption. But rather than simply focusing on public naming and shaming, the objective of this package is to create a national culture of integrity where the expectation is that all of us are our best selves. But the bill does not just stand alone. It's on the shoulders of giants that I present the work today. I acknowledge the Australian Research Council's Linkage Projects scheme and Strengthening Australia's National Integrity System: Priorities for Reform, led by Transparency International Australia and Griffith University. I'm delighted to welcome to parliament today Fiona MCLeod and Professor AJ Brown and thank you for your work. I acknowledge the report of the Senate Select Committee on a National Integrity Commission in 2017, the Australian Greens' bill of the same name-first introduced to parliament in 2012-and the recommendation of The Australia Institute's National Integrity Committee. In developing this bill we have taken a similar approach to the Australian Greens bill by modelling the investigative functions of the commission on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, known as ACLEI. In most cases, the powers mirror those of the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner. This is a tried-andtested approach at the Commonwealth level, and this bill incorporates best practice from the integrity framework of other jurisdictions. We've learnt our lesson; it's not a cut-and-paste of the state based integrity commission. At a Commonwealth level there is a need for different approaches, where coordination, prevention and protection exist alongside the investigative role. The bill complements the Australian government's support for the Open Government Partnership and will help ensure Australia meets its obligations under the UN Convention against Corruption, the OECD Convention on foreign bribery and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. What will the bill do? The bill will establish the Australian National Integrity Commission as an independent, broad based, public sector anticorruption commission for the Commonwealth. Coordination The commission will be the lead agency for key functions, both existing and proposed, in a Commonwealth integrity framework and it will fill gaps in coverage. It will act as a partner to existing Commonwealth and state integrity and law enforcement agencies, with provisions for referrals, joint investigations and joint projects. Pro-integrity It will be pro integrity. The commission will lead a strong and embedded corruption prevention program, with education, research and investigation for the Commonwealth public sector. The commission will lead the development of a rolling national integrity and anticorruption action plan, with wide participation, and oversight its implementation, playing a strategic coordination role across all sectors and jurisdictions. Investigation The commission will have the power of a royal commission to investigate, where necessary, corruption issues involving or affecting the Commonwealth government, to be executed at the discretion of the commissioner. It may hold a public inquiry and/or public hearings where satisfied that this is the most effective means of investigation and, on balance, will be in the public interest. Referrals to the commission can be made by anybody who identifies a corruption issue.  There will be a mandatory reporting requirement for public officials and Commonwealth agency heads. The commissioner will have the discretion on how to manage referrals, including dealing with frivolous or vexatious referrals. After due process, the commission will be empowered to make findings of fact to be referred then to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions or other enforcement agencies for consideration for prosecution in criminal cases. It will also be empowered to make other findings of fact and recommendations, including by way of public report, in relation to non-criminal corruption issues, prevention and others areas of integrity reform. Protection The Whistleblower Protection Commissioner-and I dedicate this section to my colleague Andrew Wilkiewill:  receive and investigate disclosures of wrongdoing; and  provide advice, assistance, guidance and support to persons and agencies relating to the making of disclosure or wrongdoing. The Whistleblower Protection Commissioner will partner with the Commonwealth Ombudsman and the Australian Securities Investment Commission. It will act as the whistleblower protection authority for the Commonwealth public sector and Commonwealth regulated private and not-for-profit agencies, as recommended by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services. Who will hold the commission to account? The bill will also establish bodies to monitor the activities and administration of the National Integrity Commission:  the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian National Integrity Commission; and  the Parliamentary Inspector of the Australian National Integrity Commission will be established by this bill as an independent office of the parliament. It will also be subject to judicial review by the federal and high courts of Australia. The bill will operate alongside a second bill, which I will introduce next week-the National Integrity (Parliamentary Standards) Bill 2018. Together, it is our intention that these bills will boost confidence in the Commonwealth parliament by equipping it to prevent, manage and resolve its own integrity issues, where possible, while also providing clear pathways for investigation and resolution of serious corruption issues. With my remaining time, I would now like to call on the seconder of the bill, the member for Mayo, to add her comments to why this bill is important for the future of Australia.",33
12,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, We'll just wait for the process. Is the motion seconded?,35
13,Ms SHARKIE,BILLS," I second the motion. I appreciate the time given to me by the member for Indi and congratulate the member for Indi on this huge body of work, because we, as a crossbench, do not have the huge Public Service to use. We rely on other like-minded people to support us, and I, too, would like to acknowledge the work done by Transparency International Australia and also the Australia Institute. In this chamber, if this parliament does not take a stand against corruption then what message are we sending to the Australian people? That message is that we believe in this federal parliament there is nothing to see, that somehow we are immune from the same failings that have already been exposed at state level and in our banks and in our churches. We are also saying that we condone and accept the consequences of corruption-that we as a nation have no issue with nepotism, undue influence or the misuse of public funds. So I call on this government-if this government fails to establish a national integrity commission, they are contributing to the erosion of public trust and confidence, and we cannot allow this to happen. We have now dropped to 13th. We are out of the top 10 of the corruptions perceptions index. As usual, we're behind New Zealand. Sadly, that is how it is on so many levels of governance now and it is a great shame. This country-this nation, this parliament-must do better, and so I urge the government to use its time in this parliament to adopt a bipartisan approach. Work with us. Work with the opposition. We all want this, because we all know that sunlight is, indeed, the best disinfectant. We have a number of weeks left to go. Let's use the will of the parliament to do this.",35
14,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned. Resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next day of sitting.  PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS White Ribbon Day,35
15,Ms HUSAR,BILLS," I move: That this House: (1) notes that 23 November 2018 is White Ribbon Day (WRD) followed by the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women on 25 November; (2) recognises that WRD aims to prevent violence against women by increasing public awareness and challenging attitudes and behaviours that allow gendered violence to continue; (3) supports the United Nations UNiTE to End Violence against Women and the 16 days of activism campaigns which are held internationally from 25 November to 10 December each year; (4) understands that: (a) this year, as of 15 October 2018, 55 women have been killed by violence in Australia; (b) one in three women have experienced physical and/or sexual violence perpetrated by someone known to them; (c) each week on average one woman is killed by a current or former partner; and (d) domestic and family violence is the principle cause of homelessness for women and their children; (5) acknowledges the high economic cost of violence against women, which is estimated to cost the Australian economy $21 billion a year; and (6) asks all Members to show their support for the principles of WRD. Today, I'm proud to rise in support of a campaign to end violence against women and girls. I shared my personal story this time two years ago in the hope that women and girls throughout Australia would know the strength and resilience you can have after violence ends, and that no-one-no matter where they come from or their achievements in life-can have their lives interrupted by violence perpetrated against them. From 25 November until 11 December, we enter into 16 days of activism to end violence against women and girls. It's an international movement, one which I support but wish we didn't need. When we talk about gendered violence, we must recognise the intersectionality of gender violence around the world and, whilst we see it reflected in Australia, mostly in family and domestic violence, some in the world see violence against women as a weapon in war. They are different, of course, but both of them have their roots in the same place-control and power over women. Violence against women can take many, many forms. It can be easy to see for some-physical scars that leave marks which are hard to hide. For other women, violence can be financial-having money withheld or distributed as an allowance. Others may experience psychological and emotional violence, with constant threats and gaslighting. All these forms of violence are about power and control and, ultimately, a power imbalance. It's a story not too unfamiliar with the rest of our society and the power imbalances women are subjected to-not being paid equally, not having equal representation in our parliaments, not having equal positions on boards and having lower retirement incomes than men. Our society is experiencing a power imbalance, and it is no surprise that power imbalances in our homes are leading to violence at epidemic levels. When our society at large fails to value the contributions of women in our workplaces and our communities, this will continue to be a problem. I've risen many times to speak in support of White Ribbon, speaking up for the need to make the changes required to make sure women are safe in our homes, our streets, our workplaces and around the world. I'm committed to making sure the 63 women who have been murdered in 2018-this year-have not lost their lives for nothing. I do not want to continue to see an increase in those statistics. These 63 women provide each of us with a determination to do better and to be better. Two weeks ago, we watched in horror as the media reported the rape of a seven-year-old girl while she attended a dance class in Sydney. She was attending her weekly class, like so many children do, her childhood is now interrupted by a violent act against her by a man. Devastatingly, she joins the one in five girls who have been sexually assaulted by age 15 in this country. These are not numbers. These are lives of girls and women who have had their lives irrevocably disrupted by violence perpetrated against them. These are numbers we highlight, but, of course, we know there are so, so many more-hundreds of thousands of incidences of domestic violence being felt in our country each week. These numbers are just those that are reported for victims we know about. We know many women live in fear of speaking out because, when they do, the punishment is harsh, unrelenting and further used by the perpetrator to continue to instil fear and terror and to launch threats against their victims. We must join together as a nation to be their voices. We must give our strength to them until they regain theirs. We have reached a national crisis point. How many more women and how many more children must have their lives interrupted before this epidemic is addressed in a substantive and meaningful way? It has never been  tolerable to allow this crisis to continue. We are a smart nation. We know what needs to be done. What we don't have, though, is the political will, understanding or desire to fix a problem facing half the nation's populationwomen. We have leaders who are men and parliaments full of blokes who have likely never been on the receiving end of such treatment, because we know the statistics tell us that this affects women predominantly more than it does men. If you haven't experienced it, it can be hard to understand it. We know what needs to be done. Our experts and our communities have told us. The list is short, simple and common sense. It is time to fund women's crisis centres so, when it comes time to leave, there is somewhere for women to go. It is time to support women through legal services and for a proper, well-funded Family Court system so, when a woman does leave, she isn't facing systems abuse. It is time to eliminate current behaviours that enable violence against women, to educate and to support programs that shift attitudes and create a society rooted in equality, not power imbalances. It is time to ensure that men who are perpetrators are held to account by treating it as a criminal offence-no longer is it a private matter. We also need to profile offenders in order to better understand their patterns and their likelihood of reoffending and what drives them to offend in the first place. It is time to give women access to paid leave so, when a woman does leave, she can continue her employment and have the security of knowing that her job will still be there. Access to unpaid leave and her own super does nothing to support a woman who needs to go. It is time to end the gendered slurs on women in workplaces in senior roles- (Time expired)",36
16,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, Is the motion seconded?,37
17,Mr RAMSEY,BILLS," I second the motion and thank the member for the motion. In 2014, I took an oath to become a White Ribbon ambassador. It's part of my strong belief that women should live in safety and free from all forms of violence. On White Ribbon Day, 23 November every year, we stand together-men and women-and we condemn the actions of the few who commit domestic violence and we call on all men to respect women and show that they abhor violence against women and stand with us and say no. On Friday, I attended a breakfast in Jamestown for the White Ribbon Day organised by the combined service groups in the town to highlight the toll violence takes on women, children and society. I thank the members of those groups for putting together that breakfast. It was a very pleasant morning on the lawns in Jamestown. We want to enlist men in this campaign because we know how powerful it is when men say no to their brothers, their fathers, their sons and their mates when it comes to violence and disrespect of women. The label of 'domestic violence' somehow suggests violence against women is part of what goes on in the home. But it's not a private matter; it's a crime. The term 'domestic violence' is one that has the risk of minimising and mitigating what is a crime of violence. It has to be seen, rejected and stopped as a crime. Disrespecting women does not always result in violence against women, but all violence against women begins with disrespecting women. This is about respect. It presents a personal challenge to us when others either do not share our views or, maybe without specific intent in fits of personal rage or drug induced detachment, breach the trust between men and women in their relationships. Women are not to be owned, controlled or manipulated. They are not and should not be subservient to men. And, although on average they have less physical strength than men, there is no circumstance in which the exercise of physical dominance is acceptable. Sadly and alarmingly, violence against women continues to be one of the most prevalent human rights abuses in Australia and around the world. As a White Ribbon ambassador, I believe all men must act to prevent this domestic violence and all violence against women. Being an ambassador means taking an active stand against any form of violence committed against women, and those of us that take this oath make a promise to live by the oath and not to commit, excuse or remain silent on this issue. Statistics can be very confronting. They are, in this case, depicting an appalling story of abuse of women and children by men. It is true that I've come into contact with some men who have been victims of abuse and violence committed by their female partners, and that is no more acceptable than the violence committed against women, but the numbers overwhelmingly demonstrate that the predominance of violence is committed by men against women. In fact, some are quoted in the wording of this motion: (b) one in three women have experienced physical and/or sexual violence perpetrated by someone known to them; (c) each week on average one woman is killed by a current or former partner; and (d) domestic and family violence is the principle cause of homelessness for women and their children; Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women are 34 times more likely to experience domestic violence. As men, I and my fellow males, particularly those of us in positions of authority and in our communities, must confront these statistics. We must stand publicly against violence and abuse.  Violence comes in many forms. There is emotional violence where men control finances; isolate women from family and friends; humiliate, demean and belittle; make threats against children; threaten women with injury or death; and cause long-term emotional damage. Anecdotal evidence shows us the vast majority of violence against women goes unreported, and its prevalence has been unbroken and intensified through the decades. The federal government's domestic violence campaign launch last year was part of a $100 million Women's Safety Package targeting how parents raise young boys. Violence against women starts with disrespect. The excuses we make allow it to grow. We must support women who have suffered violence. If someone who has been suffering from domestic violence wants to make a permanent separation, they need support from family and friends and from organisations that offer safe refuge for abused women and children and that specialise in aiding victims of domestic violence. Women's stories are often unheard, but the long-term damage to them and their families is insidious. I encourage males using violence in relationships to seek professional help and use their networks to promote discussion and change. I swear never to commit, excuse, or remain silent about violence against women. That is my oath.",37
18,Ms LAMB,BILLS," Thank you to the member for Lindsay for raising this motion. I rise today in a state of furious dismay. I rise because our nation is in crisis and there is simply not enough being done to fix it. There have been 63 Australian women who have lost their lives to violence since the start of 2018. That's 63 lives too many and, with a month still left in the year, I fear that that number may rise further still. Make no mistake: this is a crisis. Yesterday, 25 November, marked International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women. It's almost incomprehensible that such a day need exist, but, until we see some change, we still need this platform to shed light on just how bad this problem has become. Every day, police respond to over 700 cases of domestic violence. While domestic and family violence affects people from all walks of life, we know that it is women who are disproportionately affected. In Australia, women are nearly three times more likely than men to experience violence from an intimate partner. They are almost four times more likely than a man to be hospitalised after being assaulted by their spouse or their partner. These are truly shameful statistics. Last month, I met with the founder of an initiative in my community called Hairdressers with Hearts. This initiative aims to assist women and men who are currently experiencing abuse, be it family and domestic violence or elder abuse, by utilising the safe and trusted space of a hairdressing salon to provide information, to provide support and, of course, to provide advice. The founder, Sonia Colvin, told me how she introduced this initiative three years after hearing some absolutely terrible stories from her clients, knowing that something had to be done. Sonia sought out the information and training to link victims up with the support they need in the time of crisis. She has now assisted 89 women and men since she commenced this initiative on Bribie Island. I truly commend Sonia and her team for the great work that they're doing, and I'm looking forward to continuing to work with them. But an organisation can only do so much. For real societal change, we need a government who will support people when they need it most. That's why Labor has committed to investing $88 million over two years in a new safe housing fund to increase housing options, including for women and children escaping domestic and family violence. To escape an abusive relationship, a victim needs somewhere to go. All too often, a lack of housing options can stand in the way of that escape. While victims need somewhere to go, they also need time to get their affairs in order-to seek support, to change a bank account, to go to the doctor, or probably just to move out. I don't believe that people should have to choose between leaving a violent relationship and earning a living. That's why I'm proud to support Labor's commitment to legislate 10 days of paid domestic violence leave into the National Employment Standards. I don't believe that this is something that should be contentious in parliament. I ask the Morrison government to join with Labor and offer bipartisan support for this legislation. In welcoming the newest member of the House this morning, the member for Wentworth-and I'd like to congratulate her, of course, on her recent election-I extend that request to her; I ask her to join and support this legislation for 10 days paid domestic violence and family leave as well. We need to do absolutely everything we can to make it easier for people to escape violent and abusive relationships, and this must be a priority. We cannot go on like this. We simply cannot. Sixty-three women have already lost their lives. This is a national crisis. The status quo is unacceptable, with 63 lives lost already. Let's stop this, and let's stop this now.",38
19,Mr DRUM,BILLS," It is certainly very, very true that all women in this great country of ours have every right to feel safe at all times. Whether walking down the street or in the safety of their own homes, all women should feel 100 per cent safe all the time. The coalition government has long been very  proud of their stance of zero tolerance towards any violence against any woman. White Ribbon Day is the opportunity for those of us in positions of leadership to actually stand strong, stand tall and loudly decry any sense of normality about domestic violence. We understand that it's out there. We understand it's in the community. One of Victoria's leading policemen, once he retired, described domestic violence as Victoria's and Australia's dirty little secret. The fact that it is so common is quite disgusting. We understand that one in four women have experienced emotional abuse by a current or former partner since the age of 15, and one in two women have experienced sexual harassment during their lifetime. On average, one woman per week is murdered by either their current partner or a former partner, and 40 per cent of women continue to experience violence from their partner while temporarily separated. The statistics are quite horrifying. What we have to understand is that we need to have these conversations. This is a male problem. This is a problem that men in Australia have to face up to and acknowledge and accept. Men have to be the proponents of the push to stop domestic violence. We need to have the conversations with our children, and certainly by that I mean our sons and our grandsons. It's not just a matter of having the conversation at one stage or one point in their careers or lives; it's a matter of continually reinforcing to them that there are no circumstances in which it is okay to physically strike a woman. The more we can bring this issue out into the open and the more we can decry the fact that this is still an ongoing issue, the more we can live in hope that eventually we will get on top of this and, in years to come, be able to look back into the past and say, 'Those statistics used to be horrendous and now they're considerably better.' We understand there was an enormous financial commitment by this government in the 2018-19 budget to create a range of initiatives. Over $300 million has previously been spent on women's safety. This new package of $100 million is additional funding in relation to safety, housing services and educational services. There has been more money spent in relation to preventive strategies and cultural change and money spent on services like housing and financial support to keep women safe so they can in fact leave a violent situation. There's $10 million to prevent forms of sexual violence, including non-consensual sharing of intimate images. There is $30 million for frontline legal services. There's $30 million for three years for a national campaign called 'Stop it at the Start' to target the influencers of young people-parents, friends, teachers and sports coaches-to help them change their actions and attitudes towards violence against women. In the previous budget, there was an additional $55.7 million for legal assistance to, again, help women who are in the process of separating from a violent situation. As I said earlier, this is a male issue. All the money in the world is not going to help stop this unless we can change attitudes and unless we can get to our young sons, our young grandsons, our nephews, unless we can get to young boys, to make sure that they understand that there is no situation anywhere in their lives where it's going to be okay for them to physically strike a woman.",38
20,Ms BRODTMANN,BILLS," Yesterday was International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women and day one of 16 days of the Activism against Gender-Based Violence campaign. Family violence and violence against women is an enduring and persistent social issue affecting the lives of too many Australian women and too many children and families. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics' personal safety report of 2016, 17 per cent of women have experienced physical violence at the hands of a former partner or partner and 23 per cent of women have experienced emotional abuse in a relationship. White Ribbon Day aims to prevent violence against women by increasing public awareness and challenging attitudes and behaviours that allow gendered violence to continue. But shouldn't we be doing this every day and shouldn't we be doing more? On average, an Australian man will murder his current or former partner at a rate of one woman per week. That is one woman every week. The dedicated volunteers of the organisation Counting Dead Women have concluded that 63 Australian women have been killed by their partner or former partner so far this year. That is 10 more than last year, and we still have over one month of 2018 to go. It is disturbing and it is simply unacceptable. Violence against women is prevalent in our society, and my community of Canberra is no different. According to the Domestic Violence Prevention Council, there were 1,408 people who accessed the Domestic Violence Crisis Service in Canberra in 2014 and, of those, 94.4 per cent were female. Family violence continues to be an increasingly alarming part of the Canberra community, with the most recent ACT Policing crime statistics showing 1,905 incidents of family violence from January to October of this year and 898 family violence assaults. Of all family violence assaults in Canberra, 62 per cent were perpetrated by a partner or former partner, and noone can forget the shock that went through Canberra when Tara Costigan was murdered those years ago. On Friday, I had a coffee catch-up at the local shops at Waramanga, at the What Cafe. I had the great pleasure of meeting Lula Dembele, who is the CEO and founder of A Man's Problem. As the member for Murray  mentioned today, this is a male issue, and this is the point that Lula's organisation is underscoring: that, while violence is a problem for women, it is not a woman's problem. Most sexual and family violence is committed by men against women, men are responsible for the majority of domestic homicides and 95 per cent of all victims of violence in Australia report a male perpetrator. So as Lula, who is here with us today-and it's great to have her in the chamber-points out: why do we view this as a woman's problem? Yes, violence is a problem for women but it is not a woman's problem. The perpetrators are accountable, so let's reframe this issue. As the member for Murray has said, this is a man's issue; a male issue. On average, one Australian woman per week is killed by her male current or former partner. Lula makes the point that, if we want to eliminate violence against women, we need to focus on and work with the people using violence in domestic and family settings. We need to understand that violence against women is a man's problem to own and to resolve. This is the 37th anniversary of International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, and we aren't making any progress. In fact, if anything, we're going backwards. These statistics will not change if we as a nation don't stand up and tackle this issue head-on. We reframe this issue, as Lula has mentioned and as the member for Murray has mentioned. This is a male issue. These statistics will not change if we as a nation continue to turn a blind eye to the heart breaking and tragic reality that one in six women will be assaulted and abused by someone they love. It is essential that we as a nation are able to come together to erase the scourge of domestic and family violence in our communities, to ensure that women have the support that they require to enable them to live a safe and happy life, and to ensure that they have support from services when they are fleeing violence. Today, I express my support for White Ribbon Day and the ongoing awareness campaign to reduce the occurrence of violence against women. I call on everyone in the Australian community to stand tall in the face of this heart breaking and prevalent issue, this scourge on our society and our community, and say enough is enough.",39
21,Mr GORMAN,BILLS," I commend the member for Lindsay for bringing this motion before the House. Of course, she shouldn't have to. Today, I stand in solidarity with her and with all survivors. White Ribbon Day was on 23 November. On that day, I joined hundreds of Western Australians marching for the 28th Annual Silent Domestic Violence Memorial March through the streets of Perth. While marching in silence through the streets of my city, I thought about those who we have lost and those who continue to suffer, too often silently, from domestic and family violence. My thoughts continued to return to Beverley, Mara, Charlotte, Alice and Beatrix, along with others lost, represented visually-bluntly-by coffins placed on the gardens of the Supreme Court. I thought of the ultimate act of violence inflicted upon these lives. I thought of all of the things they would never do, never see and never experience. But the thought I cannot get out of my head is, what were the last minutes of their lives like? Behind a front door, just like my own, just streets away from where I live with my wife and my young son, sustained violence was committed. To take that thought out of your mind is very difficult. My best attempt is to turn to the policy question which we have a duty to answer: how early and how comprehensive is the intervention needed to prevent such violence and murder from occurring? On average, one woman a week is killed by a current or former partner-every single week-in this country. One in three women have been assaulted. To put this 'one in three' into real lives, one analysis notes that some 2,194,200 Australian women have been victims of assault. No stadium or population comparison is needed: 2,194,200 Australian women. Just think about what that means for the community that we live in. Deep inside, you have to wonder: 'What if that violent capacity were inside me? What is different in my life that means that it isn't? And, given that the instances are in the millions, what don't I know about those who I see in my professional and friendship circles every single day?' And then there is the most uncomfortable question for any parent, 'How do you make sure that it isn't your son or your child who becomes the perpetrator?' I see one of the great tests of us as a country and us as a parliament is the question, 'Can we break this cycle in the next generation?' It's a challenge I take on, not just as a representative of the people of Perth but as a man, as a father, as a son, as a friend, as a colleague and as a member of my local community. Yesterday, November 25, was the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women. The United Nations UNiTE to End Violence against Women was an initiative launched some 10 years ago, in 2008. We have not lived up to its ambition. The initiative aims, amongst other things, for: - Adoption and implementation of multi-sectoral national plans of action that emphasize prevention and are adequately resourced. In other words, White Ribbon Australia does a great job but it fulfils only one very small part of the challenge ahead of us. In developing an adequately resourced national plan we must, at the centre, acknowledge that violence against women is driven by gender inequality. You will not eliminate violence against women without achieving gender equality, and elimination starts with our children. I do commend White Ribbon Australia for their Breaking the  Silence in Schools program and the teachers and parents who participate in that program. Of course, we need to teach children that violence is unacceptable. Elimination ultimately means more resources for community organisations. I want to acknowledge the work of the under-resourced organisations throughout Perth and throughout Australia which worked tirelessly to deliver support. I want to say very clearly and unambiguously that these organisations which reduce and prevent violence and provide safety for thousands of Australian women are under-resourced. We make choices in this place to under-resource them. With that in mind, I'm just going to say very quickly thank you to the Patricia Giles Centre, one of many centres in my electorate of Perth, and end by paying tribute to the brave women in our communities who have experienced or who are experiencing violence. Debate adjourned. Remembrance Day Mrs MARINO (Forrest-Chief Government Whip) (11:13): I move: That this House: (1) notes that: (a) on Remembrance Day on 11 November 2018, we commemorated the Centenary of the First World War Armistice; (b) from a population of less than five million, more than 400,000 Australians enlisted to serve, and of these, more than 150,000 were wounded, gassed or taken prisoner and more than 60,000 made the ultimate sacrifice giving their lives for their country; and (c) this was an enormous toll for a young nation like Australia with nearly every family and community across the country having experienced a loss of some kind; and (2) acknowledges: (a) the service and sacrifice of Australia's current and former serving men and women; (b) the unwavering commitment of the families who support our veterans on the home front; and (c) and thanks all current and former defence personnel for their service. As we know, World War I broke out in late July 1914 and out of a population of around 4.5 million some 416,000 Australians enlisted for service. That was around 10 per cent of the population and it was one of the largest contributions to the imperial war effort. Of those 416,000, more than 60,000 were killed and 156,000 were wounded, gassed or taken prisoner. As we saw, afterwards war memorials were built, from large cenotaphs in some town squares to memorial flagpoles in schools, community halls and parks all around Australia. I look at the beautiful, evocative Harvey War Memorial, and even at the beautiful Nannup War Memorial. As the war progressed, the names of battles which we now recognise as household names were spoken about in hushed tones and great men like Sir John Monash rose to prominence. There were names such as Gallipoli, Ypres, Bullecourt, Villers-Bretonneux, Beersheba, Passchendaele and Polygon Wood. I was able to lay a wreath at Ypres several years ago on behalf of Australia at the time. I saw those thousands and thousands of crosses at Ypres. I also saw the Menin Gate, with its over 55,000 names. I met one of the oldest Menin Gate buglers and I thanked him for the fact that they played our last post over 30,000 times voluntarily in the years since. He said to me: 'You listen to me. What we know in this country is that at the time the Germans were rolling across this nation it was like genocide. What we know in this nation is that all we are and all we have is because of your Australians' blood on our soil.' That was a very profound experience for me. With the final assault on the Hindenburg Line late in 1918 the German government sought a truce, and that came into effect at 11 am on 11 November 1918 and the guns fell silent. This year, in 2018, we have celebrated the centenary of that momentous event-the ending of the first truly global war and the end to a war that devoured the lives and spirit of 16 million soldiers on both sides. It took almost an entire generation of men from the earth. Allied countries took decades to fully recover from the loss. Governments fell, societies changed forever and the seeds of the next world war were sown. But we remembered on 11 November 2018. We remembered the sacrifice of those who served and died for what they believed in. In the centuries since Armistice almost two million men and women have served with pride in our armed forces. I want to thank and acknowledge the work of Brendan Nelson, the director of the War Memorial, who has done an outstanding job in ensuring the War Memorial plays an appropriately central role in commemorations and all of those who made the over 60,000 poppies we saw on the lawns of the War Memorial, which made a breathtaking reminder of the sacrifice made in World War I. I want to pass on to the Speaker my congratulations for the parliamentary program of commemorative events and the poppy displays in the building and the forecourt.  But it is also important to remember that there is an axial link between the Australian War Memorial and Parliament House that was purposely incorporated in the architecture. When certain doors are open there is a direct line of sight from the Prime Minister's office to the War Memorial and specifically a line between the cabinet room and the Tomb of the Unknown Australian Soldier. It is a deliberate reminder to those in government that in decisions involving the use of armed forces they should never forget those who have given the ultimate sacrifice. In the words of John MCCrae's famous poem, 'We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow, loved and were loved, and now we lie, in Flanders fields.' We must never ever forget the sacrifice of those who served our nation in uniform and we must recommit ourselves to supporting them into the future. I want to acknowledge the work of all of our RSLs and those who conducted commemorative services on 11 November this year in acknowledging the Armistice centenary.",40
22,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, Is the motion seconded?,42
23,Ms BRODTMANN,BILLS," I second the motion. I would like to begin by commending and thanking the member for Forrest for this motion, because, as she said, this year, 2018, marks the centenary of the end of the First World War, which we commemorated right throughout the nation in small towns, in country towns, at Norfolk Island and here in our nation's capital on 11 November. So thank you to the member for Forrest. To help local communities commemorate this important date in our history, in the world's history and in Australia's history, the Department of Veterans' Affairs offered the Armistice Centenary Grants Program for each electorate. In my electorate we had five successful applicants, one of which was the Minders of Tuggeranong Homestead, or MOTH. MOTH secured funds to develop The Soldier Settlers of Tuggeranong, a photographic exhibition, and I was honoured to formally open that exhibition at the Lanyon Homestead in October. The exhibition told the stories of eight men who returned from the war and took up soldier settlers blocks at Tuggeranong on land that had formerly been owned by the Cunningham family. The eight men who received land were Jack Cregan, George MCInnes, Eric MCMurtrie, Gerald O'Hanlon, Alec Powell, Nathaniel Smith, Darcy Thompson and Robert Dyson. We were honoured to be joined by the families of Darcy Thompson and Nathaniel Smith at the opening. This remarkable exhibition revealed their struggles with debt, with drought, with the rabbit plague and with uncertain markets, all while living with the legacy of their war service. I want to commend MOTH and in particular the chair, Jenny Horsfield, for bringing these stories to life, and I encourage anyone who is around Canberra to go and visit that exhibition at the Lanyon Homestead. On Remembrance Day, I had the great honour of representing the Speaker at the national ceremony and attended the beautiful service held by the French embassy. In the evening, I attended the Jewish commemoration service at the Jewish Centre here in Forrest. Despite its size, the Canberra Jewish community is strong and vibrant and makes a significant contribution to Canberra, and I hope it continues to flourish in the future. Despite its size, the Australian Jewish community has also made a significant contribution to Australia's defence with its participation in many conflicts since the Boer War. There was a strong but solid Australian Jewish presence in the Boer War, including Major Walter 'Karri' Davis, who endured two years as a prisoner of war; Myer Blashki; Louis Electorate Phillips; Alfred Saunders, who was the son of Melbourne Rabbi Reverend Moses Saunders; and two sons of Ballarat's Rabbi Reverend Israel Member Goldreich. Jewish women also volunteered to tend the sick and the wounded, including Sister Rose Shappere, who was the only Australian nurse who went through the entire Siege of Ladysmith. Her experiences of organising neutral hospitals to tend to both English and Boer fighters, her train being shelled by the Boers and nursing in a camp filled with 12,000 sick and wounded people led to her being mentioned many times in despatches and to her receiving the Royal Red Cross honour along with another medal from the king. In the First World War, it is estimated 2,304 Jewish males enlisted in the AIF, which was about 13 per cent of the Australian Jewish community at the time. Of these enlisted men, 300 made the ultimate sacrifice and more than 100 earned military honours or were mentioned in despatches. Australian Jewish personnel were also conspicuous during the Second World War when 4,000 enlisted in the various services. It is estimated that 200 died in action, 40 were decorated for gallantry and 30 more were mentioned in despatches. Sister Rae Reuben was the youngest to enlist in the AIF at the age of 24. Although there were so many Jewish nurses who served with distinction, I want to highlight her. She worked in Egypt before being transferred to Marseille in France and was moved up to just behind the firing line on the Somme, where she fell victim to a gas attack. It affected her health for the rest of her life and she died at 45. In the gardens of the Australian War Memorial, a sea of handmade red poppies pay tribute to Australians who made the ultimate sacrifice in the First World War. More than 330,000 Australians served overseas in the four years of the war and 62,000 died. On Remembrance Day we pause to commemorate 100 years since the guns fell  silent on the Western Front, 100 years since the Armistice was signed, ending the First World War-the war that was supposed to end all wars but didn't. We paused on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month to reflect and to remember those who died or suffered for Australia's cause in all world wars and armed conflicts. We remember the bravery, honour and sacrifice of all those who served and those who followed. Lest we forget. Mr VAN MANEN (Forde-Government Whip) (11:23): I want to thank the member for Forrest for bringing this motion to the House. As we stand here today and reflect on Remembrance Day 2018, we mark 100 years since the end of World War I. I have no doubt it was a special day not only for our veterans but for everyone in the Australian community. I was so pleased to see the record number of people, particularly young people, at the Remembrance Day service in Beenleigh. Every year, the Beenleigh and Greenbank RSLs go the extra mile to support our local community, to ensure that we not only celebrate but, more importantly, remember those who fought for the freedoms that we enjoy today. I want to thank all those who took part in Remembrance Day ceremonies across the electorate of Forde, and who wore a red poppy and who paused for a minute's silence to remember those who lost their lives for our freedom. It's interesting to reflect that during World War I, Australia, with a population of less than five million people, saw more than 400,000 soldiers enlist to serve. Of those, more than 150,000 were wounded, gassed or taken prisoner, and, tragically, more than 60,000 paid the ultimate sacrifice and did not return from war. This was an enormous toll for a young nation like Australia, with nearly every family and community across the country having experienced a loss of some kind. Remembrance Day holds a special place in the hearts of Australians. As we go around our towns and our communities across this country, we can have a look at our war memorials and cenotaphs and see listed there the names of those who did not come back. Many of those names are still familiar or known in our local communities, whether it's at the war memorial in Beenleigh, in Ormeau, in Cedar Creek or in Upper Coomera. Many of those names still have family members alive today and contributing to our communities. Equally, all those names are recognised in many places in our communities, whether it's streets or parks or other community places. This is what I think is important; that we have made an effort to remember those who paid that ultimate sacrifice. It's important that we do not forget the lessons of history. As the member for Canberra has just outlined, it was the war to end all wars. Yet we well know that that was not the case. It's important that we show a mark of respect to our soldiers, sailors and airmen who have contributed so much. The Remembrance Day ceremonies held across the country this year had record numbers of people attend. It shows the importance that we as a community place in that. But, in all of this, it's important to remember that we're remembering people, real people. They were brothers, sisters, husbands, fathers. Right across this country, families and communities were affected. As we stand here in this place, I think it's fair to say that it's difficult to understand what those families and communities went through at that time, which is why we should always be eternally grateful for the sacrifices that they gave to defend this country and others. We see each year the reverence with which the French commemorate Remembrance Day, and also ANZAC Day, in recognition of the service that Australian soldiers gave in their community. I'd like to again thank those who are serving today in various theatres around the world. They continue to demonstrate the qualities so ably given to this country by the ANZACs. Lest we forget.",42
24,Mr GOSLING,BILLS," I want to thank the member for Forrest for bringing forward this motion. As most would be aware, at 11 am on 11 November 1918, the guns on the Western Front fell silent after more than four years of continuous warfare and more than four years of carnage. The Allied armies had driven the German invaders back, having inflicted heavy defeats upon them over the preceding four months. The first modern world conflict had brought about the mobilisation of a staggering 70 million people and left between nine million and 13 million people dead-perhaps as many as one-third of them with no known grave. For Australia, the cost of this commitment was astronomical. From a population at that time of less than five million, more than 400,000 Australians enlisted to serve and, of these, more than 150,000 were wounded, gassed or taken prisoner, and more than 60,000 made the ultimate sacrifice, giving their lives for their country. As noted in this motion, there wasn't a family in the country who wasn't personally affected by the war. Many of our service men and women were and still are first-generation Australians, having emigrated from the UK, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Africa and the Americas. Others, like myself, have fathers and grandfathers who served with the armed forces. Indeed, my great-grandfather, Thomas Wood, a Scot from Glasgow, served with the British Army in the First World War before emigrating to Australia. Like the Australian nurse that the member for Canberra just mentioned, my great-grandfather, Thomas Wood, survived the Battle of the Somme but was gassed-an injury that probably saved his life, but ruined his health. Upon migrating to Australia, he took off up bush. He was a bit shell-shocked from the First World War, but he found that up in the bush the air was a lot cleaner and more gentle on his lungs. Like many of those who were gassed, he was probably getting around with  about a quarter of his lung capacity. He also couldn't handle the noise of the big city, though, and being around people. Like most veterans of his generation, he suffered in silence. The end of the Great War-the First World War-left Australia with an issue as difficult as the conflict itself: taking care of the survivors, the war widows and their children. It's noteworthy to remember that this generation who were devastated by World War I then had to endure the Great Depression. When the war broke out, Australia was in recession and unemployment continued to grow, peaking at 11 per cent in March 1915. We owe a great debt to those of that generation that persevered through those difficult years as they continued to build our great nation. Through the federal government's armistice grants, several marvellous projects were funded to commemorate this very significant centenary. In my electorate, I was very happy that I was able to provide armistice grants to the Darwin Chorale, who put on a brilliant show at the Darwin Entertainment Centre that had the audience in tears-tears of laughter and tears of sadness-recalling the stories of young Territorians that went off to fight. Another marvellous production was put on by the Darwin City Brass Band, who performed 'In Their Honour' at the Christ Church Cathedral. Darwin High School are also continuing their tradition of remembrance and are using the armistice grant for an honour board that will honour those who went from Darwin High School to the First World War. Finally, the Darwin Military Museum is using its grant to establish a centenary of Armistice monument at East Point. One hundred years after the First World War, we paused on the 11th of the 11th to remember those who sacrificed so much in that war and also those that have been lost or damaged serving in conflicts since then. In my electorate of Solomon, in Darwin and Palmerston, services were held at the Darwin Cenotaph, at North Darwin, at the Palmerston Memorial and at Adelaide River. We also had the NT Pipe Band simultaneously playing with other bands around Australia at 3.30 pm that day at the Palmerston Memorial. Well done to them all on this significant anniversary.",43
25,Mr VASTA,BILLS," I also thank the member for Forrest for this important motion, and for giving us the opportunity to reflect on the service and sacrifice of our Australian service men and women. This year marks 100 years since the Armistice, which ended the First World War. I was proud to see so many of my constituents wearing their red poppies proudly and paying their respects at local memorial services. I was glad to be able to attend many events in Bonner that marked the Armistice centenary. A highlight for me was visiting Lota State School and seeing their red-poppy garden. Principal Susan Hughes told me that it was a labour of love by their Environmental Club. I was struck by the garden's sheer beauty. It's a moving tribute to our diggers that will keep their memory alive for the next generation. Another Bonner school that has done a wonderful job in keeping the ANZAC spirit alive for our kids is Citipointe Christian College. It was an honour to attend their centenary memorial ceremony and hear from students, teachers and community members about how the Great War touched their families' lives. It was also a great honour for me to officially open Citipointe's new memorial to mark the centenary of the First World War Armistice. Last year, the federal government invited community groups to apply for grants of up to $50,000 to support local projects commemorating the end of the First World War. I was pleased to help Citipointe secure $18,182 through the Armistice Centenary Grants Program for their new centenary memorial. The centenary memorial is modelled on the Australian National Memorial in Villers-Bretonneux. The area will be used for community commemoration events and the school's annual ANZAC Day assembly. It will include an amphitheatre that looks towards the cross of sacrifice. It looks absolutely stunning at the moment, and I can't wait to see it completed. I was also pleased to secure a $9,091 Armistice centenary grant for Queensland Rifle Association. The grant went towards the installation of a new Armistice centenary memorial gate at Belmont Shooting Complex. I was very happy to attend their Remembrance Day service and the official opening of the memorial gate. It's a beautiful memorial that commemorates the more than 500 riflemen of the QRA who perished in the First World War. It also recognises the men and women of the many shooting disciplines in the Belmont Shooting Complex who have served in defence of the nation since 1946, including in peacekeeping. I also helped the P&F Association of Guardian Angels Catholic Primary School secure a $5,000 Armistice centenary grant. The grant is for a small memorial in an area designed for reflection and commemoration of our fallen ANZACs. It's another great project that teaches young students about the sacrifice of our soldiers and allows them to express their gratitude for our current freedoms. I thank local residents, families and groups in Bonner who marked a minute's silence at 11 am on Remembrance Day to remember those who have made the ultimate sacrifice for this country. I thank the local  schools and organisations who have erected new lasting memorials to honour the over 60,000 Australians who never made it home after the Great War. Lest we forget.",44
26,Ms TEMPLEMAN,BILLS," It is a privilege to speak to this motion put forward by the member for Forrest and join with my colleagues on both sides of the House to mark this year's Remembrance Day. Remembrance Day this year saw thousands of people across the country, including in the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury, mark 100 years since the signing of the Armistice. RSL sub-branches, community organisations, schools and aged-care homes held ceremonies to honour those who have served. At Windsor Memorial Park Gates in MCQuade Park I joined hundreds of people to mark the occasion, at 11 o'clock on 11 November, as similar ceremonies occurred in Richmond, Kurrajong, Glenbrook, Springwood, Katoomba, Blackheath, Mount Victoria, Wentworth Falls and other towns across my electorate of Macquarie. Our aged-care facilities also paused to honour the moment when, on the Western Front, the guns of the Great War fell silent. At North Richmond's Ron Middleton VC aged-care facility, residents and staff, helped by local high school and primary school students, remembered those who were wounded in all conflicts and those who made the ultimate sacrifice for our nation. At the time of the signing of the Armistice, more than 60,000 Australians had lost their lives, including 45,000 who died on the Western Front in France and Belgium and more than 8,000 who died at Gallipoli. We can only imagine the relief that the troops and families would have felt as word of the Armistice filtered out and they heard that the war had finally ended-indeed, the relief that entire nations across the earth would have felt. Both of my grandfathers served on the Western Front in World War I. Private Leslie Robert Templeman embarked from Sydney in October 1916 as reinforcement for the 19th Infantry Battalion. He arrived in France in March 1917 and was wounded in action six months later with a gunshot wound to his head and leg. After medical treatment and recovery in England, he was allocated to reinforcements for the 3rd Battalion, but the war ended before he could return to France. My mother's father, Private Herbert Raymond Axtens, left Sydney with reinforcements for the 12th Light Horse Regiment in October 1915, joining the regiment in February 1916 in Heliopolis. He was transferred to the 8th Brigade Machine Gun Company a few months later. He arrived in France in June 1916, but fell ill with influenza. He rejoined the Machine Gun Company at the beginning of November 1916 and remained with his unit until the end of the war, seeing many conflicts and battles. My grandfathers' stories of survival-and the stories they didn't share with their families of the ordeal, both physical and mental-were typical of those experienced by hundreds of thousands of young Australian men. Over the course of the four years of World War I, more than 416,000 Australians volunteered for service, with 330,000 leaving their families behind to serve overseas. In marking the 100 years of the end of the war, I was privileged to oversee the awarding of several grants under the Armistice Centenary Grants Program. From a sandstone memorial in Lone Pine Peace Park in Leura, erected by the Rotary Club of Central Blue Mountains and Katoomba RSL, to a project by the Blue Mountains Woodturners in Glenbrook and one in Blackheath Soldiers Memorial Park, the efforts were many and varied. A standout was the new work commissioned by the Phoenix Choir that had a magnificent premiere to mark Armistice Day. Composer and conductor Rowen Fox's new work-'All This is Ended'-is based on a poem by World War I poet Rupert Brooke and had its first performance at St Finbar's church in Glenbrook followed by a Remembrance Day performance in Lithgow. The work, with complex layers, was performed by the Phoenix Choir, which has a wide mix of people: some who haven't sung since high-school days and others who have made music their career. Music has such power to move and reach people, and I was privileged to be asked to read a dedication at their premiere. Another project marking the centenary is by Woodford Academy-part of the National Trust. The academy operated as a school from 1907 to 1925, and the project tells the story of each of the 57 ex-Woodford Academy students who had enlisted to serve in World War I. Each of these projects, and others that have received grants, are part of the history of World War I, particularly as it affected people in my electorate. As we mark the end of the centenary of the war, we remember the service of so many, then and now. Lest we forget.",45
27,Mr ALEXANDER,BILLS," On 11 November, we commemorated 100 years since the conclusion of the First World War-a conflict which, in its inestimable cruelty, claimed the lives of some 40 million civilians and military personnel around the world. Australia at the time was a very young and small country of only five million. We sent 416,809 men to fight. Of those, 60,000 did not return and 156,000 returned wounded or gassed; however, it is safe to say that no man or woman who served during that time came home without bearing some wound, physical or mental. The First World War was the first industrial war conducted on a mass scale involving innumerable machines and millions of men. The human suffering was on a similarly huge scale. At its conclusion, the First World War  was popularly named 'the Great War' and 'the war to end all wars'. The cruel irony of history was that its scale and suffering gave way to a more murderous and inhumane conflict barely a generation later. But the legacy of the First World War runs deep, both physically and mentally. To this day, the landscape of northern France and Belgium is pockmarked by barrages of artillery that turned hundreds of miles of landscape into wasteland. For Australia, the First World War was our trial by fire. Many of the values our nation lives by today trace their birth to places like Gallipoli, Passchendaele, Pozieres and Beersheba. Courage, mateship, teamwork, larrikinism, endurance and a healthy disregard for authority are all essential parts of our identity which grew from the horrid brutality of the First World War. One hundred years on, the sacrifice of our diggers is not forgotten. Over the last few weeks, I was fortunate enough to visit a great many local commemoration services, including the main commemoration at Memorial Park in Meadowbank. At this peaceful memorial overlooking the Parramatta River, local school students came together with community leaders to hold a wonderful ceremony. Bernie Cox again led the service, which was capped off with the unveiling of a plaque commemorating the event and was funded by the federal government's Armistice Centenary Grants Program. We were very fortunate to receive a number of these grants which enabled our community to commemorate the centenary. The Ryde District Historical Society received $5,000 to create a register of local memorials; Karonga School received funds for a living memorial, which will be accessible to students with special needs there; and both Epping Boys High School and Eastwood Heights Public School received over $10,000 to create memorial gardens. Our electorate of Bennelong sent a great many of its sons to far-off lands during the First World War, and it's worthwhile that we consider their immeasurable sacrifice and courage. Between 1914 and 1918, over 2,000 men volunteered from the area that is now covered by Bennelong. At the time, there were only a mere 3,500 dwellings in this area. This level of volunteering is almost unprecedented across the country. Remarkably, these volunteers came in a steady stream throughout the war, barely dipping after the threat from Gallipoli or during the defeat and stagnation of the Western Front in 1916. This patriotism and bravery is incredible and worthy of the huge turnouts seen across Bennelong last month. During this time, it's important we all stop and give thanks to those who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our safety, freedom, and prosperity. We stand on the courage and labour of generations past who valued the future of their country more highly than themselves. They set an admirable example that we would do well not to forget. Lest we forget.",45
28,Ms SWANSON,BILLS," In 1914, Australia was a population of fewer than five million people. When the Great War erupted, 416,809 men and women enlisted-a significant number from a very young Australia. Over 60,000 of these men and women never returned home. They paid the ultimate price. 156,000 were wounded, gassed or taken prisoner, which was an enormous toll on the nation. Nearly every family and community across our country experienced a loss. To mark 100 years since the guns fell silent on the Western Front, I joined several community groups in my electorate of Paterson to commemorate these men and women. At the 11th hour on the 11th day of the 11th month, I stood with hundreds of people from the Port Stephens community as we gathered in Nelson Bay for a service that was hosted by the Nelson Bay RSL Sub-Branch. It was a beautiful, sunny morning as we stood with the sea breeze licking our faces. I couldn't help but think of what had taken place 100 years earlier and how those who had fallen would be proud of the nation, largely, that we have become. I also attended the East Maitland War Memorial Centre for the unveiling of two plaques commemorating the end of the First World War. These plaques were unveiled by Mia Fullerton, the daughter of William Bevan, a World War I veteran and a teacher from East Maitland Public School; and Norm Burton. Norm's uncle was killed, and his body was laid to rest in France. The Beresfield chapter of the Maitland RSL Sub-Branch hosted a service to dedicate a lone pine tree to the fallen soldiers from the Beresfield community. At that service, I met the groundsmen from the Newcastle Memorial Park, who told me how grateful and pleased they were to be able to plant a tree that had been dedicated to many people who they had as ancestors. I also met the dedicated men and women from the Australian Armed Forces Re-enactment Heritage Unit. And what a fine unit they are! They have been flat chat in recent weeks, attending many services and adding an element of gravitas to those ceremonies. They did a truly remarkable bayonet drill on the day and they really looked absolutely the part. To mark this Centenary of Armistice, Pelaw Main Public School placed an additional servicemen's plaque at the entrance to their school after they discovered that 13 names had been missed in the original roll of honour that was put on their memorial gates. I was grateful to attend that and to officially unveil the additional plaque with many of the descendants of those World War I veterans. In the lead-up to the 100-year anniversary, I helped a number of community groups from my electorate secure a grant through the Centenary of Armistice grants program. This was for a wide range of activities and projects that commemorate the end of World War I. The Raymond Terrace and District Historical Society used the grant to  publish a book entitled Remembering for Peace: The Adventures of Emma and Ryan. It was written by Heather Sharp and illustrated by Laura Arnull. This children's book is going to be used as an educational resource to help primary-school children learn about World War I. It was a fantastic day at the launch of that book, as many young children were there. I knew that their parents, grandparents and other caregivers will read that book to them and they will learn much more in a far more in-depth way over the years to come. The Raymond Terrace RSL Sub Branch replaced the old wooden flagpole in the main street and dedicated it to World War II veteran Bill Bobbins OAM. For 15 years, Bill raised and lowered the Australian flag in the main street of Raymond Terrace, and now a plaque stands in the corner to honour this incredible effort. I can only think of doing that every day for 15 years. I think he missed very few; he got people to substitute for him on very few occasions. But he was there at morning and dusk every day for 15 years. Thank you, Bill, for that! We remember you for that and we remember your family, who attended. At every event I attended throughout my electorate, I was proud to see so many people from all generations proudly donning the medals of their ancestors. I would like to thank my community for that.",46

Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).",47
31,Mr CHAMPION,COMMITTEES,"by leave-On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I present the report, Contestability and consensus: a bipartisan approach to more effective parliamentary engagement with Defence. This committee report examined the prospect and desirability of a formal bipartisan Australian Defence agreement. Chapter 5 examines the benefits and risks of a formal bipartisan agreement. This chapter of the report outlines a spirited debate about the nature and desirability of bipartisanship in this area. The risks of a formal agreement are best expressed by the evidence of Dr Carr in clause 5.50 and former Vice Chief of Defence Force Des Mueller in clause 5.53. Lieutenant General Mueller is quoted in the report: The real danger of a bipartisan agreement is that it could become an exit ramp from the more robust, better-informed and ongoing discussion about defence which is what the national interest deserves. The evidence was that a formal written agreement on bipartisanship did not meet Australia's national interests. In short, a written formal agreement was undesirable and possibly counterproductive. The evidence submitted to the committee did, however, lead to a more controversial conclusion-that in order for the parliament to be properly informed and for the parliament to give appropriate oversight of Defence, a new committee of the parliament should be formed. This recommendation is borne out of the experiences of the Defence subcommittee in examining the Defence annual report. The review of the Defence annual report 2015-16 highlighted the challenges the subcommittee faced in seeking to oversee Defence's implementation of the internal reforms arising from the first principles review and the progress of $200 billion worth of investment in new Defence capability outlined in the 2016 Defence white paper. These challenges derived from the fact that most of the assessments in form, and the documents that guide Defence planning, are classified and, therefore, are currently unavailable to parliamentary  committees. And that makes meaningful parliamentary scrutiny of Defence, and scrutiny of the decisions and actions that flow from them, very difficult. This experience is common to other parliamentary committees scrutinising Defence projects-notably the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit and the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works. This report recognises that Defence strategy and planning documents, and the risk and security assessments that inform them, must be classified. However, parliament appropriates the money that pays for the work that goes into producing them, and it appropriates the money to implement the planning and acquisition that flows from them. Parliament has a constitutional right to the information necessary to properly oversee Defence. A high-security or commercial-in-confidence classification shouldn't be used as a veil to prevent or obstruct parliamentary scrutiny of Defence strategy, capability planning, investment decisions and expenditure. The report recommends a way to reconcile parliament's right to scrutinise with the need for the protection of classified information. The subcommittee has recommended the establishment of a new statutory parliamentary committee with an exclusive focus on Defence. This new committee with the legislated mandate to review Defence strategy, planning and investment decisions and with the powers to access information under safeguards and protections similar to those applying to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security would provide a means for the parliament to discuss and debate complex areas of Defence policy and reach agreement on solutions that transcend party lines to advance the interests of Australia. Clearly, a new committee for Defence replacing the Defence subcommittee and, in effect, having stronger powers and more effective oversight must be balanced by maturity and responsibility on the part of the parliament. Scrutiny must be combined with safeguards. Australia now faces the most challenging set of strategic circumstances since the 1920s, when the termination of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty and the Washington Naval Conference radically altered the balance of power in the Pacific. At the same time, the recent turmoil in Australian domestic politics has seen a rapid succession in Defence ministers. I believe we need less examination of Machiavellian Australian political life and more of Mahan and Mackinder in order to advance the national interests. The challenges of the next two decades will require the informed attention of a generation of members of parliament, and a new committee for Defence would create the mechanism to do that in a sensible and measured manner. For their efforts in the development of this report I'd like to thank Senator Jim Molan, the Chair of the Defence subcommittee; Senator Kimberley Kitching, the Deputy Chair of the Defence subcommittee; and the former chairs, Senator David Fawcett, Senator Linda Reynolds and Madeleine King. I'd also like to thank Mr James Rees, the secretary of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, for his efforts in this regard. I commend the report to parliament. I move: That the House take note of the report.",47

35,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,RESOLUTIONS OF THE SENATE, I have received the following message from the Senate: The Senate transmits to the House of Representatives the following resolution which was agreed to by the Senate this day: That the Senate calls on the Federal Government to establish a national anti-corruption commission. The Senate requests the concurrence of the House of Representatives in this resolution. Ordered that the message be considered immediately.,59
36,Mr SHORTEN,RESOLUTIONS OF THE SENATE," I rise to agree that this resolution from the Senate be agreed to. Despite the relatively few members of the government attending in this chamber at this time, the agreement to this resolution is a significant development. It is a win for Labor, it is a win for the crossbenches and, more importantly than that, this is a win for the people of Australia. Today, this parliament and the House of Representatives have for the first time endorsed the call for a national integrity commission. That is, the government has now moved its position. It was in January this year that I announced that a Labor government would establish a national integrity commission, not because I believe this parliament has a particular problem with corruption, because, if any members were aware of it, they would report it. Indeed, the members and senators that I have had the privilege to get to know over the past 10 years, from all points of view, are dedicated people here to make a difference. But I and Labor have been advocating for a national integrity commission because we believe it is essential to rebuild trust in our public institutions. People in Australia are concerned that politics seems to be about politicians looking after themselves and not the people. We have been advocating, therefore, a national integrity commission to rebuild some of that trust that the Australian people have lost in their democratic system. We need a national integrity commission to restore some faith in our politics and our democracy, to make it clear that there's not one rule for the politicians and the Commonwealth government on one hand and another rule for everybody else. I welcome today the Liberal and National government reversing their previous opposition to a national anticorruption commission. Of course, Australians do have the right to ask if the Prime Minister believes strongly and sincerely in a national integrity commission or if he's just focused on protecting his job. This should not have taken so long. The fact that there are so few members of the government here shows the reluctance that the government has to endorse an anticorruption commission, but nonetheless they have got to the right conclusion. But it should not have taken the fear of losing a vote on the floor of the parliament for the government to be dragged, fingernails on the concrete, into the chamber to endorse an anticorruption commission, a national integrity commission. But it is better to be late than not to be at all supporting an anticorruption commission. We now have an opportunity for the whole parliament to work together to help design the best possible national integrity commission. Labor has said that a national integrity commission will be based upon the following seven design principles. The commission should operate as an independent statutory body with sufficient resources to ensure it's able to carry out its functions regardless of the government of the day. Next, the commission will be constituted by one commissioner and two deputy commissioners, each of whom would serve for a single fixed five-year term. Further, the commission will have sufficiently broad jurisdiction and freedom of action to operate as a standing royal commission into serious and systemic corruption by Commonwealth parliamentarians or their staff, public servants, statutory officeholders, the Commonwealth judiciary and the Governor General. The commission should be granted the investigative powers of a royal commission, including search and surveillance powers and the power to compel witnesses and subpoena documents and to carry out its own investigations, with warrant oversight by the Federal Court. Further, while the presumption will be that the hearings will be held in private, the commission will have discretion to hold hearings in public where it determines it is in the public interest to do so. Labor would continue to consult on the appropriate threshold for such hearings, in conjunction with the government and, indeed, the crossbench. The commission should only be empowered to make findings of fact. Any findings that would constitute criminal conduct should be referred to the AFP or the Commonwealth Department of Public Prosecutions. A bipartisan joint standing committee of parliament would be established to oversee the commission and empowered to require the commission to provide information about its work. This committee should also be responsible for appointing the commissioners, and the commission would report to parliament on its performance annually.  The time has come-in fact, it is long past the hour-for this parliament to establish a national integrity commission. What we seek to do is make a powerful statement about restoring faith in our democracy, and it will be so much stronger and more meaningful if the whole parliament has a say in the design. This has to be about better politics, not more partisanship. That is why I wrote to the current Prime Minister last week proposing that, as a first step, the Attorney-General and the shadow Attorney-General sit down with members of the crossbench to talk about the design principles, including those that I've outlined. I regret to say that the former member for Wentworth, when he was Prime Minister, rejected our offer. I do acknowledge that the current Prime Minister, for all sorts of political reasons, has, nonetheless, arrived at the correct conclusion. Labor has been willing to cooperate in the national interest; it's now time for the government to do the same. Whilst the government, in its urgent need to seek to avoid a vote that it might lose, has drawn the right conclusion on establishing an anticorruption commission, it is important that it does not therefore cynically sit back and do nothing further on this matter. It is important now that we get on and do the job. If Labor were to win the next election, we would do the job in the manner in which we've outlined, but there is no need to wait until the next election to do it. What we need to do is help restore and rebuild some faith and trust in our democracy. We should treat this mission with the same seriousness that we treat national security and on the same cooperative, bipartisan basis. The people of Australia know this matters. They want better from their parliament, they want more from their government and they deserve much more from the political system. We understand today is a very significant day: the government has entered minority status and the member for Wentworth is an independent. The government faces the very real prospect that, despite its wishes and its opposition to a national integrity commission, the resolution in the Senate will be supported in the House of Representatives. I am pleased that the government, faced with defeat on the floor of the House of Representatives, has chosen the wiser and more pragmatic path of stopping its opposition to a national integrity commission. But, having said that, we should not now see this change, this reversal of position, this change of heart from the government, as being an excuse to dismiss this matter-to vote for it and then hope that it never comes back. I make this offer to the government: let us move forward and work together to get this done-the Attorney-General and shadow Attorney-General, in consultation with the crossbench, using some of the design principles that we've outlined and other principles as others may see fit to bring forward to the discussion. This is a very, very significant proposition. I move: That the resolution of the Senate be agreed to.",59
37,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,RESOLUTIONS OF THE SENATE, Is the motion seconded?,60
38,Mr BANDT,RESOLUTIONS OF THE SENATE," I second this motion. We are now in a power-sharing minority parliament, and the good thing about that is that things can get done that the Australian people want. Things will be put on the agenda even if the government doesn't want them. Even if the government doesn't want them, things will get put on the agenda that the Australian people want. If we act now, we could have a national corruption watchdog by Christmas. The Greens worked with Labor and the other members of the crossbench in the Senate to get this motion through the Senate. The Senate has expressed its view, on behalf of the Australian people, that it wants a federal anticorruption watchdog established. The House is now about to concur-I hope that the House is about to concur-and I hope the government has finally understood the message. When you have people with such diverse positions on the crossbench-me, the member for Kennedy, the member for Denison, the new member for Wentworth, the member for Mayo and, of course the member for Indi-together with the Labor opposition all saying it is time to establish a national anticorruption watchdog, the message is now ringing loud and clear. This is something that is close to my heart and close to the heart of the Greens. We were the first ones to introduce a bill into this parliament and also into this House. I applaud the member for Indi and the member for Mayo for now bringing forward a practical way of putting it into practice. Having listened to the comments from the experts, they've put a workable model on the table. We now have an opportunity to restore some trust in the political system. The idea that somehow corruption stops at the federal level and can only be found at the state level is just fanciful. The argument from the government so far has been: there's no evidence of corruption; therefore, we don't need an anticorruption watchdog. That's exactly why we need one. Seriously, can anyone say, hand on heart, that none of the activity we've seen at the New South Wales level, which has resulted in ministers going to jail, happens here? No, we cannot. The best thing to do is not only to have a transparent and corruption-free democracy but to be seen to have a transparent and corruption-free democracy. In commending this motion to the House, I'll say one last thing. We established the royal commission into the banks by working together in the Senate, bringing the matter to the House and bringing the government to the  point where they had to accept it, where they could not deny the inevitable any longer. In exactly the same way as we've managed to get the government to establish-against their will, kicking and screaming-a royal commission into the banks, I hope that the government will now see the light and take steps towards establishing a federal anticorruption commission, which the people of Australia so desperately want.  how any government or any parliament might improve the integrity framework at a federal level is a live question and one that should be under constant review. There are potential paths forward that could mean real improvement in that area. The member for Melbourne has just put to this parliament that the crossbench-and the member for Indi, in particular-have put on the agenda what he described as a working model. In the short period of time that's available, I want to point out to the House a number of reasons why this is an area for the most sober and cautious consideration. I mean no disrespect to the member for Indi in raising some of the issues I'm about to raise. The member for Indi has gone to some effort, at least, to propose a model in great detail, which can be the subject of debate and further consideration. The Leader of the Opposition has talked about design principles. They are of the most scant, vague and, might I say, unconvincing type. Labor have had 12 months to consider this, and coming up with the fact that there will be two deputy commissioners is hardly a massive amount to show for 12 months work. But what demonstrates",60
39,Unknown,RESOLUTIONS OF THE SENATE,Opposition members interjecting,61
40,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,RESOLUTIONS OF THE SENATE," Order!  before this parliament does. Every member opposite should have absolutely perfect understanding of what the bill now before this parliament does. Under the bill, which the member for Melbourne proposes to be a working model, any public official who did anything that could be said to impair public confidence in public administration-even if that conduct were so minor as to only constitute an administrative irregularity that had some form of employment or disciplinary outcome attached to it, or even if that conduct gave rise only to the most minor civil outcome-would be declared corrupt. Hundreds of thousands of civil servants would potentially be declared corrupt for the most minor of matters. Let me describe to the House how the bill that has been tabled by the crossbench would work. Under section 9, 'any conduct of any person' that, 'directly or indirectly', affected the impartial exercise of functions of any person or group in the Public Service would be, prima facie, corrupt; anything that any public official did that was a partial exercise of the public official's function would be, prima facie, corrupt; anything that constituted a potential breach of public trust would be, prima facie, corrupt; and any other conduct that could impair public confidence in Commonwealth public administration would be corrupt. That is, so long as any of those four standards met the additional standard that they represented any type of civil liability offence, no matter how minor; or any disciplinary offence, which might include any conceivable form of 'misconduct, irregularity, neglect of duty, breach of discipline or any other matter that constitutes or may constitute grounds for disciplinary action'; or any other reasonable grounds for an employment dismissal; or any conduct where grounds for arguing a substantial breach of an applicable public sector code of conduct existed. If you affected an impartial exercise of the functions of persons of a group in the Public Service; if you, as a public officer, partially exercised your functions; if you breached the public trust; or if you impaired public confidence in the Commonwealth public administration-if any of those four things were said to exist, and even if they represented only the most minor civil penalty or irregularity, that would be declared corrupt conduct. For example, any public official that it could be argued behaved in a way that constituted a breach of public trust or impaired public confidence in public administration would be liable to a finding of corruption, even if that behaviour otherwise would only have given rise to a small fine or it was an administrative irregularity or there was some breach of discipline or other conceivable form of misconduct. Any public official who did anything that could be said to have impaired public confidence in the public administration of the Commonwealth, even something so minor as to only constitute an administrative irregularity, under this bill that public servant would be corrupt. Have a moment's thought about what that would actually mean in practice. One recent example springs to my mind. In October 2017, Andrew Probyn, a public servant, an employee of the ABC, described the member for Warringah as the 'most destructive politician of his generation'. Mr Stephen Jones: Seconded!  corruption. ",61
41,Unknown,RESOLUTIONS OF THE SENATE,"Opposition members interjecting for Warringah in that way. A complaint was made to ACMA and ACMA found that Andrew Probyn had breached standard 4.1 of the ABC Code of Practice due to impartiality. Under this bill before the House-no ifs, ands or buts-Andrew Probyn would be found to have committed corruption.",62
42,Unknown,RESOLUTIONS OF THE SENATE,"Opposition members interjecting now before the House. If anything demonstrated the need for enormous caution in pursuing this type of issue, it would be the fact that misdrafting can have such a massive overreach in this area. Any ABC journalist or SBS journalist, as a public servant and public official, who criticised the government in a way that demonstrated impartiality, that breached a code of conduct, that was perhaps found to have constituted contempt or defamation and attracted a civil penalty-under this bill, the very definition of 'corruption' transforms matters of civil import, such as defamation, such as a breach of a code of conduct, into a finding of corrupt conduct. That's what the bill before us does, and that demonstrates why, in an area like this, an abundance of caution is absolutely necessary. For instance, last year at the AFP there were 922 conduct breaches that were finalised-922 conduct breaches-and 45, under present definitions, were found to be corruption. All of the remainder of those conduct breaches are highly liable to be referred under a model like this for a finding of corrupt conduct. These are matters that are dealt with in an employment based context, sensibly and soberly, at the moment. There are eight codes of conduct across the public sector for a variety of departments and agencies. If you transform breaches of those codes of conduct that impair public confidence in the Commonwealth, which frankly could be just about everythingMs Butler: Ask someone in the construction industry how they feel about this.",62
43,The SPEAKER,RESOLUTIONS OF THE SENATE,"The member for Griffith is warned!  the Commonwealth public sector will move to the realm of corrupt conduct. All you need to do is read what is before this parliament to understand how excessive and how dangerous it is. Let me note also that the most astonishing thing about this bill is that everything that I have described has retrospective application. A civil servant who had engaged in a minor breach of a code of conduct in their department many years ago that had been dealt with internally but, nevertheless, could be said to have impaired public confidence in the conduct of Commonwealth affairs would, many years later, find themselves potentially referred and possibly the subject of a finding of corruption. Anyone who has observed this area would have seen, in New South Wales, Western Australia and Queensland, decent, hard working public servants the subjects of findings of corruption which were not based on fact, which were found to be false due to errors inside the types of bodies that we are now contemplating. Those men and women had their careers utterly ruined based on no good fact and no good process. This is the time for the most sober and sensible process that we can engage in. That, I am very sad to say, is not indicated in the bill that we have before us today.",62
44,The SPEAKER,RESOLUTIONS OF THE SENATE,"The question is that the motion be agreed to. Before I call the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I want to remind members on both sides that this is not question time, where there is a tolerance, to a degree, for interjections. This is normal debate. If they interject as if it were question time, they'll be dealt with as if it were question time.",62
45,Ms PLIBERSEK,RESOLUTIONS OF THE SENATE," I'm not sure that you are very tolerant in question time, but thanks for the warning.",62
46,The SPEAKER,RESOLUTIONS OF THE SENATE,I just warn her: I don't have a sense of humour before question time.,62
47,Ms PLIBERSEK,RESOLUTIONS OF THE SENATE,"I'm rising today to support the resolution that the message from the Senate be agreed to. I thought I was going to be able to agree with the Attorney-General as well, because he started by saying that this matter deserves sober and cautious consideration. I completely agree that this is a very important motion and a very important matter that does deserve sober and cautious consideration. Sadly, the Attorney-General then went on to take us on a tour through a horror show of what would happen if we introduced a national integrity commission in Australia. If indeed what he was describing, that we'd be looking at 30-year-old breaches of workplace codes of conduct, was the outcome, I'd be the first to line up behind him and say that's not what we want in this country. But nobody is proposing a national integrity commission that would look at 30-year-old breaches of workplace codes of conduct. What we are saying on this side, what the crossbench are saying and what the Senate has said is  that where there is systematic and serious misconduct we ought to have a body in this country that is able to find it, examine it and then refer it, if there is cause for criminal charges, to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, the Australian Federal Police or an appropriate body. I am one of those people who is proud of the fact that I believe Australia is a corruption-resistant country and that we have low levels of corruption by international standards. I believe our public servants are, by and large, dedicated, good people who do their work with integrity every day. I believe the same of members of this place and the other as well. I believe the vast majority of my colleagues, even the ones I disagree with every day, work hard in the national interest. But we can't put our heads in the sand, because we know, from looking at the state based integrity commissions, that there are exceptions to this principle. We know, from looking at the work of these state based integrity commissions, that when we catch people we do a very good public service, because we restore the faith of our electors in our parliamentary democracy-in democracy itself-by saying that if something goes wrong there is somewhere to complain to and someone who can examine that complaint. I'm from New South Wales so I've had plenty of opportunity to see up close the work of an effective integrity commission. You can point to plenty of Liberal ministers and members of parliament on the other side who've resigned because of allegations of corruption, including recently when a member who was caught on tape resigned, causing a by-election. But we had our own, on our side. We had two former ministers jailed-one for five years and one for seven years. I and I know my colleagues would be the first to say, 'That is good. That is good for us as a party. That is good for us as a democracy.' We are prepared to be examined with all of the same scrutiny as we wish on our opponents. That is good for our democracy. I've got to say, seeing Eddie Obeid and Ian Macdonald jailed were two of the happiest days of my life, because it was like cutting a cancer out of the Labor Party. I'm happy that it happened. I am, first of all, prepared to say I don't believe that there is a great deal of corruption in Australia but I'm equally prepared to say that where there are these instances, it is vital for our democracy that we can find them out. I saw the open letter from 32 judges to the Prime Minister about this. I think the point made in that letter is important. It said: When this confidence and trust is diminished, pessimism, divisiveness and conflict increase; and social cohesiveness is harmed. We need to reassure Australians that, at a federal level, they can trust the integrity of our democratic processes. The judges went on to say: Existing federal integrity agencies lack the necessary jurisdiction, powers and know-how to investigate properly the impartiality and bona-fides of decisions made by, and conduct of, the federal government and public sector. These 32 people are in a better-than-average position to have an opinion on this and to know the difference that a national integrity commission would make. The member for Indi has proposed a way forward here. We have laid out our own principles that we would apply, and the Leader of the Opposition went through those seven principles. In fact, the integrity committee that has been sponsored by the Australia Institute has proposed a number of other ways forward in this area. I think the fact that we have three different sets of proposals shows how important it is to take a bipartisan approach here. The Attorney-General said that we should have a sober and cautious approach to this, and I agree. The best way that we can have a sober and cautious approach to designing a national integrity commission is for there to be a bipartisan approach, where the government-after rejecting the need for a national integrity commission for as long as they have-set aside those objections and agree to work with us, the member for Indi and others on the crossbench, on a detailed approach that looks at the strengths and weaknesses of the various state integrity commissions, looks at what can be improved in those state commissions and proposes publicly an approach that can be examined by people who have an interest, like these 32 former judges, like the National Integrity Committee that's been established. We can have a public debate that looks at a really robust approach that has strong investigative powers and balance that with the fact that anybody accused of impropriety ought to be accorded natural justice, ought to have the opportunity of properly answering those allegations before they're on the front page of a newspaper. Balancing those approaches, we can do that. The Attorney-General has gone through a whole lot of horror scenarios of what might happen. It is important that we get this right. It is absolutely critical that we get the detail right. But, surely, Attorney-General, the fact that you have concerns about the member for Indi's specific proposal is a reason for us all to work together across the chamber to get the detail right, not a reason to stick our heads in the sand and pretend there has never been, and never will be, corruption at a federal level. It is not beyond us to get this legislation right. We know that this is yet another area in which the people are ahead of the government. We know that about 80 per cent of Australians support some type of national integrity commission. I think, Attorney-General, when so many Australians have enough concern to support a national integrity commission, it is important that we ask  ourselves as political leaders, first of all, what we're doing wrong to see such concern amongst the people we represent; and secondly, how we can allay those concerns. What can we do together to design a national integrity commission with strong powers that can reassure Australians that we continue to live in one of the least corrupt countries on earth?",62
48,Mr KATTER,RESOLUTIONS OF THE SENATE," I'm one of the rare people in this place that has actually been through the grinding machine. I was one of the two ministers in Queensland who made the decision to bring on the Fitzgerald inquiry, which changed the politics of Queensland-hopefully forever, but certainly for the last 20 or 30 years. There were 54 murders or murder-suicides that had taken place in Queensland, and it turned out that they were attributable to one small group of policemen. It was referred to as 'the joke' in North Queensland by Steve Austin, the famous journalist. It was referred to as the 'Crooked Creek Cattle Company' in North Queensland. The first person to make noise was an ALP member. When I rang him up about it, he said he knew nothing about it and continued to say he knew nothing about it, and then hung up on me on the telephone. He was obviously terrified. But in an environment where 54 people have been murdered, it gets very, very scary indeed. So a decision was taken to have the inquiry. If we'd had the Criminal Justice Commission, as we call it in Queensland, seven or eight or nine years before, would we have stopped all of those murders? ",64
49,Mr KATTER,RESOLUTIONS OF THE SENATE,"I take the interjection. I was in Joh's cabinet. I was under attack by the corrupt coppers. I went to the person you would naturally go to-the commissioner of police-to put the objections in. Well, as it turns out, according to the courts, the commissioner of police was in fact the source of their protection. He wasn't the centre of the corruption, but he was most certainly the protector that had enabled the corruption to bloom. If I'd had the Criminal Justice Commission to go to, I still think I'd have probably gone to the commissioner-after all, I was a senior minister in the government; that was the natural person to go to. We had no idea, at that stage, that he was the source. That's one of the things with corruption-you don't know who's on whose side. That's the scary part about it. The good part from the point of view of this legislation-I applaud the member for Indi for precipitating the whole thing. I think we crossbenchers could claim the credit for the banking inquiry; I don't think that that's entirely unreasonable. Labor was there for six years or however long they were there for, and they had no intention of having a banking inquiry, so we precipitated it. I want to praise both sides of the House for having a bipartisan approach, and I would plead with both sides of the House that there needs to be a bipartisan approach here. We congratulate the member for Indi for precipitating the thing. I don't think anything would have happened if she hadn't precipitated it. I plead now for a bipartisan approach. The polls are indicating a Labor government is coming in-you blokes will be in the hot seat and the Liberals won't be. There's no point in going after the Liberals if they're not in government. There's plenty of point in going after them. Let me come back to Queensland. If a CJC had been there, it's possible that those murders would not have occurred. The murders, by the way, are a matter of public record. It's not my opinion; it's all a matter of public record. That they were related to 'the joke' is a matter of public record. When the Fitzgerald inquiry came in and was subsequently rolled over into what was called the Criminal Justice Commission, you had this witch burning. There was a wild bushfire raging out of control and it was going to burn a hell of a lot of people. One of them was a Labor premier. He and two National Party ministers that were under attack got cancer. Two of the three died. I don't doubt for a moment that cancer is somewhat related to extreme stress, and that's what occurred in these cases. A number of people were burnt subsequently. A minister, Brian Austin, went to jail because he had used his government car to go up and visit his kids at a private school in New South Wales on the weekend. This is a matter of public record. Once the fire starts, there are going to be an awful lot of people burnt-and an awful lot of innocent people. There was a judge stood down in Queensland. There was not the slightest scintilla of evidence ever produced against that judge. Not at any stage. Nothing. He was hung, drawn and quartered-his whole life destroyed-with not the slightest scintilla of evidence. But everyone knew why they were out to get him: because he was not a member of the club, the legal establishment that ran Queensland. They all went to rich private schools. They had all mixed with each other. They all knew each other. They were a very tight-knit club. And here was a bloke whose daddy was a Sicilian cane cutter from North Queensland, who had been to a state school and was suddenly thrown in as a judge. 'We can't have this. We can't have this.' They had the judges group assess him. Surprise, surprise, the judges group decided that he wasn't a proper person. But I just use that as an example. The Premier of Queensland-whatever else I might say about him-was a man of unquestionable honesty and decency, but there was a person in there that just hated him. Now, once you get a Criminal Justice Commission or  an ICAC-you understand this. Totally innocent-but it gets in there, and then the headline in the newspaper is, 'Minister under attack: referred to the Criminal Justice Commission.' From then on, your name is besmirched. Now, for those of you who like reading history books, you would have read about the Stuarts Star Chamber-a kangaroo court we'd call it here in Australia. You've read about the House Un-American Activities Committee in the United States-rampant MCCarthyism-where hundreds of people had their lives totally destroyed by a bushfire out of control. We could go through hundreds of examples of this. But what happened in the aftermath of the Fitzgerald inquiry was horrific to me, and I had to take responsibility for it, because it was Bill Gunn's decision but he needed my support to get it through cabinet. We were the two that made the decision to bring it down. I urge the parliament to consider: the greatest upheaval on corruption in recent Australian history was in Queensland-fairly or unfairly. Fifty-four people were murdered or murder-suicided. Fifty-four people-all a matter of public record-attributed to 'the joke' or, if you like, the 'Crooked Creek Cattle Company'. On the other hand, myriads of innocent people had their lives totally destroyed by what followed afterwards, including a Labor premier-a man whose honesty and integrity would never, ever be questioned in the public arena, yet the damage to him was colossal. So I find it very difficult because I can see the need for it but, on the other hand, I can see the grave dangers that exist here. I think a lot can be done to make it in camera, to do everything humanly possible to make it secret, so that some petty vendetta that some public servant had against some other public servant 20 years ago is not dredged up and then used to destroy a person who is totally innocent. I could give you case after case, but I'm not going to do that-time is too short. So I urge a bipartisan approach. I thank and congratulate the member for Indi. If she does nothing else in her life, this would be a great achievement and contribution to the Australian nation. We came through. It wasn't what we wanted with the banking inquiry, but there was a banking inquiry and it's done a hell of a lot of good. My colleague sitting on my left here-appropriately!-deserves a lot of the credit, as do a number of other backbenchers. So we need to be bipartisan. There is one thing that is absolutely a necessity-total secrecy. We know that that's not really a reality, but we can do a lot to ensure secrecy. I think that that is vitally important. But I urge this House to just say you have the memory, that it is there, of what occurred in Queensland-54 deaths on the one hand and, on the other hand-the negative side-hundreds of innocent people with their lives totally destroyed.",64
50,Ms MCGOWAN,RESOLUTIONS OF THE SENATE," I thank the member for Kennedy for sharing those stories with us. I also acknowledge the wisdom that he brings to this particular process. I actually want to address the what and how of this. Minister, I welcome your comments and certainly those from the Labor side. To me, the art of parliament is doing exactly what we've done here-you make your best effort and, as a private member, you bring the legislation to the House and ask, 'Okay, how can we, together, make this better?' Minister, I ask you: what will you do to help us make this legislation better? Certainly, I'm open to the critique that you bring to it. I also acknowledge your expertise in this area and also your access to your department. Clearly the whole parliament is looking to you to look at this legislation and make it better. I don't think it's appropriate, at this stage, to critique it in the detail which obviously needs to happen, but today what we're asking from you is the higher moral ground. We're asking: 'What is the government going to do about this? What is the government's position on this? What would it take for the government to come to what has been the most generous of speeches by the crossbench and Labor and work together, to do what we know the Australian people want-which is for us to work together on a thing that matters to them, which is trusting institutions?' So, Minister, I'm really pleased that you're here and you're part of the debate, but my call to you is: can you please tell us what, when and how? I pick up the member for Melbourne's comment of, 'Could we do it by Christmas?' because we all know, if this doesn't get resolved and we go to an election, how really bitterly this will be fought out. The stories of corruption that my colleague from Queensland tells us that we know are not very far below the surface will all come to the fore and we will spend our time arguing the detail and not doing what we know the people of Australia want us to do-work together and work in harmony. That's what we need to do. The second thing I want to say is a little bit about why I'm so passionate about this. The background for me is I'm a farmer by trade and inclination. My profession is agriculture. I really, really care about how agriculture is run in this country. I've had a lifetime of work with the department of agriculture and the public servants in it. So you could imagine my enormous distress when I read the Moss review that came down recently. I congratulate the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, David Littleproud, the member for Maranoa, for doing that review. But it showed us what is currently happening in the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources, which we love, about an issue that farmers particularly care about-the welfare of our sheep and our livestock-and we  could see that not only is the department not able to do its job but people have been intimidated and there's been a significant failure of the application of the regulations that needed to happen. So, for me, the main job of the government is to make sure that we make rules, that they're enforced, and that the regulation happens. I welcome the member for Farrer to the chamber for this bit: in live export we've had a huge failing of regulation. A commission like that we're talking about is exactly what could have helped very early. The people who knew there was a problem could have gone to this commission and said: 'We've got problems here. We don't think it's corrupt, but things aren't working out. Could you do an investigation?' We could have spared ourselves so much of the trouble we've had and the huge community angst around how the live sheep export business is being operated because our community in the Public Service didn't have a place to go to get it addressed. So that Moss example, for me, is just an absolute standout of why we need this sort of commissioner and why we need it now. Minister, I take on board your comments about the definition and about retrospectivity. If I could make a comment about retrospectivity and why it's in the bill, I, for one, am not a fan of retrospectivity-ever-but I know with corruption that there's often history-not always but frequently there's a story that needs to be understood. If we don't give this commission power to actually look at the history, to look at the story, of what we basically call deep-rooted corruption that has a past, we can't address it in the future. I'm really happy to work with you, Minister, your department and your staff about how we can do that better. But we can't just pretend that we're only going to look at things that go wrong from here on into the future, because so many things that we know don't work-for example, in the department-are because there's a history of how things were done, a history of how people were treated and a history of fear. You've actually got to do some degree of retrospectivity to address that. I would be really pleased to work with you and your department to get some words about how we could make this better in the future, but I don't want to ignore the past. I welcome your presence in the debate, Minister, but, from the bottom of my heart, I call out: 'Come back and tell us this week that the government, across the parliament, will accept the offer from Labor and from us to work together,' because, truly, it's only the government stopping this happening. We know that you're basically in favour of it. We know that the previous Prime Minister was basically in favour of it. We suspect that most of your backbench are in favour of it. What we're asking for now is some leadership in how we work together to get what the country wants, which is the ability to trust that we in this parliament can actually work in a way that gives people trust in our processes and our integrity in working together. I'll leave my comments there but look forward to continuing the conversation with you.",65
51,Ms SHARKIE,RESOLUTIONS OF THE SENATE," This morning, we talked about Transparency International Australia and the really good work they did to assist the member for Indi with her bill. We talked about the work of the Australia Institute and, more broadly, the desire of the nation to ensure that we have integrity: integrity in this place, integrity in the Public Service, integrity across all reaches of decision-making. I concur with the member for Kennedy and say, firstly, we absolutely need bipartisan support for this. The member for Indi is right: the only team that is holding this back is the government. I think it's fair to say the rest of the parliament want us to move forward. It's got a feeling of deja vu about it, doesn't it? It's a feeling of deja vu going back to the banking royal commission. Scores of times, the government voted against that. The government said, 'Nothing to see here!' 'Rank socialism' is what a former Prime Minister said with respect to a banking royal commission. But what we have uncovered is that it was much needed and should have happened years ago. I believe the same will happen with the National Integrity Commission. If the Prime Minister doesn't want to listen to the crossbench, if he doesn't want to listen to really everyone in the parliament apart from his own front-bench and if the Prime Minister is not paying any attention to what happened in Victoria over the weekend, I would urge the Prime Minister and indeed the government to listen to the story of the 34 former Australian judges-eminent people-who in quite an unprecedented manner wrote an open letter to the Prime Minister for the establishment of a national integrity commission. I wish to read into Hansard just some of the letter: Confidence and trust in government and public institutions is at an all-time low. When this confidence and trust is diminished, pessimism, divisiveness and conflict increase; and social cohesiveness is harmed. As a result, the economy and the welfare of all Australians suffers. Ultimately, as international experience has shown, democracy itself is threatened and may be irreparably damaged. Governments ignore at their peril demands by citizens to combat corruption with vigor. A major cause of the current deterioration in trust is the suspicion that corruption permeates many governmental decisions and actions. Corruption, broadly understood in this context, occurs when those in public office place private interests over the public good. The avoidance of corruption is an essential organising principle of our representative democracy.  Secrecy is at the core of corrupt conduct. Electronic communications and advanced developments in IT provide formidable means of concealing misconduct, which is difficult and expensive to combat. Those involved in large-scale corruption are usually well-organised, experienced, astute and wealthy. A well-funded and properly resourced national anti-corruption agency, with overall jurisdiction to investigate all public decisions and conduct, and with appropriate powers and protections, is needed to combat them. The price of freedom, and freedom includes living in a society free from corruption, is eternal vigilance. ……… The National Integrity Committee has outlined a benchmark for designing a model integrity commission. It must have a broad jurisdiction and strong investigative powers, including public hearings, in order to adequately investigate and expose corruption and misconduct. If the government doesn't want to listen to the crossbench, and if the government uses their first opportunity to talk about an integrity commission to critique the crossbench instead of leading from the front, I urge the Attorney-General: for goodness sake, lead from the front on this. If you're not going to listen to us, if you are not going to listen to the crossbench, if you're not going to listen to the Australian people, for goodness sake why don't you at least listen to 34 eminent former High Court and Federal Court justices? Thank you.",66
52,Mr WILKIE,RESOLUTIONS OF THE SENATE," It goes without saying that there's way too much questionable stuff going down in this country right now. So many decisions are being made by governments, by politicians and by senior officials that have question marks hanging over them that it is understandable that the community is concerned. One recent example is the decision to grant almost half a billion dollars to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation. There was the decision not that long ago to grant Foxtel, I think, it was $30 million, for reasons that are still unexplained. We go back some years, but it's a hot topic currently, to the issue of the spying on the East Timorese parliament and the fact that the government is now going after the whistleblower and his lawyer. Crucially, there is still the unaddressed matter that the then Minister for Foreign Affairs and the then secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs, who both were involved in as much as they would have had oversight of the spying operation, but yet the minister and the secretary both went on and worked for Woodside Petroleum. In the case of the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, in the case of the money for Foxtel and in the case of a former Minister for Foreign Affairs and a former secretary for Foreign Affairs going on and doing paid work for a company that their actions had materially benefited there might be a really good explanation. Perhaps in all of those cases there was no misconduct and they were all good decisions by good people. But we don't know, because we don't have any means to examine those sorts of issues. In a day and age when people are understandably more cynical than ever, of course people will start drawing conclusions that there was misconduct. I'm reminded that in the eight years I've been in this parliament, and before that, there have been dozens upon dozens of changes to our security legislation, including greater powers for the state and greater intrusiveness, like mandatory metadata retention. Whenever these sorts of things are sold to the public by governments, the government says, 'If you've got nothing to hide, you've got nothing to fear.' I will make the point again: the government says, 'If you've got nothing to hide, you've got nothing to fear.' So why then is the current government so anti some sort of federal anticorruption or integrity authority? If the government has nothing to hide it will have nothing to fear from the establishment of such an organisation. It is regrettable that the government has only been dragged to this point, kicking and screaming, because of the political reality of this parliament. The fact is that if there were a vote on this motion today and the government were to stick to its guns it would probably vote against it and try to sell its decision to the public. But the public would be outraged, so it looks like the government is going to roll over on this motion but probably do nothing about it. The government criticise the member for Indi's bill, which she introduced this morning and which has been seconded by the member for Mayo. Instead of criticising what the crossbench have put forward, why don't they actually come to the table, exactly as the member for Mayo has pleaded with them to do, and offer some amendments? If they're going to vote in favour of this motion because they've been forced to vote in favour of this motion by the reality of the numbers in the parliament, why don't they actually show a bit of backbone, lead from the front, as has been requested by the member for Mayo, come back to the parliament with some amendments and make it better? Make it perfect. We don't have the resources on the crossbench to come up with the perfect solution, but we can come up with a really solid start to an issue like this. Then, with all their resources, they can amend it and improve it. But I bet they don't. Then they'll wonder why they'll be struggling to win an election in six months time and struggling to regain the trust of the community. No wonder the community is so cynical about politicians. We only had a banking royal commission because the government was dragged, kicking and screaming, to that point. It is no wonder the  government is so on the nose and no wonder politicians are so on the nose when it is patently clear that the majority of members of the community want some form of integrity or anticorruption body. We in this place have no-one but ourselves to blame that we are held in such low regard by members of the community. There are just so many excuses: it would become some sort of mechanism for disgruntled public servants to go after their peers, or some means to go after a bureaucrat from 30 years ago. No it won't. That's not the intention. And if there is some sort of weakness in the current bill which would allow that, let's deal with that weakness. Let's close that hole in the current bill. I was really touched by the point made by the member for Indi, saying, 'Let's work together.' Can't we once, in the public interest and in the best interests of our constituents, come together as one in this place and come up with something that's a good thing? Why is it that everything one side in this place suggests is opposed by the other side? Why is it that just about everything from the crossbench is always ignored? Why can't governments be more open-minded to the talent and ideas in this place and be open-minded to the public interest and what the public wants? This is just another example of where governments are out of step with majority public opinion. I could rattle off so many things. The public want strong action on climate change-ignored by the government. The public want to shut down live animal exports-ignored by the government. The public want strong action as far as gambling reform goes-ignored by the government. The public want a strong and effective anticorruption body-ignored by the government. It will be ignored by the government because the only reason the government will support this motion is the numbers in this parliament, and none of us on the crossbench or on the opposition benches have any confidence that the government will actually go on and do something about it. Through you, Mr Speaker, to the Attorney-General: you're a decent man. Take this bill that's been tabled today by the member for Indi, allow it to be brought on for debate and bring some amendments back to this place. Let's improve it. Let's make it better. We won't be offended even if you table your own bill now. We want the outcome. This isn't about who owns this or whose name is on the front of it; it's about the outcome. Through you, Speaker, I implore the Attorney-General: either bring some amendments back to this place on the bill that's before the House, or bring your own bill into the House. I tell you what: it will be popular in the community and it will improve your stocks politically. Surely you want that? Surely the government wants to get off 45 per cent or 55 per cent in the next Newspoll, where it seems to be stuck? Act in the public interest. Swallow your pride. People will respect you for it. People will respect you a lot for it, for the fact that you say, 'Okay, we've come on board.' That's what the public needs. No more excuses. It's not good enough to say, 'This will just become a mechanism to go after public servants from 30 years ago.' It's not good enough to say, 'Look at the problems, say, in New South Wales with their ICAC,' or for the member for Kennedy to single out some of the problems that were created in Queensland in his experience when he was in the state parliament. In fact, we can leverage off those problems that have occurred over time and in other jurisdictions. We can examine those case studies, find out where the weaknesses are and make our federal integrity commission the best in the world. We're actually lucky that we have these examples of problems with other anticorruption bodies in the states in this country and overseas. We can learn from them, and the public will thank us for it. That's all I'll say. There is clearly a strong public interest in a federal anticorruption body. We're having issue after issue where questions have been raised and not addressed. Why exactly did the Great Barrier Reef Foundation get almost half a billion dollars? Why did Foxtel get $30 million? Why did a former foreign minister and a former secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade go and work for Woodside Petroleum, which was a material beneficiary of a spying operation that the former foreign minister and former secretary of that department had an association with? In all those examples, maybe everyone acted legally and with integrity. But we just don't know, because we don't have a body to examine these sorts of cases. It goes without saying that not only do we have to have good and clean governments but we have to be seen to have good and clean governments. In fact, if we set up an integrity commission and it looked at a 100 different issues and in every case it found that no-one did anything wrong, that would actually still be a good outcome. It would still be a reason to have the integrity commission, not to not have the integrity commission, because the public could have confidence that governance in this country is done cleanly and with integrity. I applaud the Labor Party for running with this issue now. If you do become the government in six months, the community will be expecting the new government to act on this and to speedily establish some sort of federal integrity commission. Question agreed to.  NA Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2018 Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2018 Second Reading Cognate debate. Consideration resumed of the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.  General and member for Isaacs, who is in an important intelligence committee meeting which unfortunately prevents him from being in the chamber. I will speak on two bills, the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2018 and the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2018. I'll say at the outset that Labor has always been strong on family law reforms. It was Labor, the Whitlam government, with Attorney-General Lionel Murphy, who created no-fault divorce in Australia. It was Labor and Gough Whitlam who created the family courts and has stood up for them ever since. Our family court system is considered a world-leading model, imperfect though it may be, which is something I will expand on later. Reform should always be well considered, and that has not been the case here-not at all. These bills have been subjected to no consultation with stakeholders, no consultation with the very people who use the Family Court system, the people who live and breathe it, day in and day out-the families and those who advocate for them, the lawyers who are daily in these courts, the judges presiding over the courts, the peak bodies of the professionals who use the courts and the organisations that advocate for victims of family violence. None of them were consulted about these radical reforms before they were introduced. Instead, these reforms have simply been forced upon them, whether they like it or not. But we will not ignore what the people who know the most about the family law system have to say. That is arrogant and is no way to roll out any reform, let alone reforms that are the most significant changes proposed to the family courts since they were created 43 years ago in 1975. Labor will not be supporting these bills in the House. We will not be supporting these bills for a number of reasons-firstly, due to the woeful process by which these reforms have come about. As I just mentioned, these bills are not the result of consultation-anything but. It's been more like tin-ear-it is. These bills are the result of a management consultant's report done in eight weeks by number-crunchers who have barely set foot in an operating family court. There is a pretty basic law in law making: if you don't consult, you make bad law. When there are families and children's lives at stake, this is not something that Labor can accept. That brings me to the second reason why Labor will not vote for these bills in the House today. There is a Senate inquiry on foot into this proposed legislation. It is a Senate inquiry which it seems this government has been very afraid of. Initially, the government tried to have this Senate inquiry completed in November, giving just weeks for the stakeholders who had not previously been consulted to write submissions on a 300-page bill. Rightly, the Senate decided it would not allow that to happen. Through a series of votes, the committee has been instructed by the democratically elected Senate not to report on this bill until April 2019. That would allow for a proper amount of time for hearings and for the completion of the landmark Australian Law Reform Commission review into the entire family law system. Yet, even despite the clear will of the Senate for proper time to be given for the consideration of these bills, bizarrely, the government are putting them to the House today. This is clearly premature. Why would they do this? It is unclear why they have done this and why Attorney-General Porter chose this course of action. Perhaps the Morrison government have run out of other things to talk about? The third reason Labor will not be supporting these bills is that the case for this particular change has not been made. That is partly due to, I suspect, the very poor consultation process. The Morrison government has little evidence, for example, for its heroic claims that 8,000 extra cases could be cleared each year if these reforms pass the parliament. It is also due to the blindness of this government to the other key factor in the problems in the Family Court-that is, funding. There has been a huge increase in demand on the courts, and funding has just not kept up. A key suggestion of the former and very well-respected Chief Justice of the Family Court Diana Bryant for an increase in the number of registrars in the court has been completely ignored by Attorney-General Porter. Moreover, the systemic degradation of community legal services under this government has meant we have witnessed an increase in unrepresented litigants, particularly in family law. Sadly, unrepresented litigants clog up the legal system. Why aren't we talking about these issues? It's because the government doesn't want to.  Unlike this Morrison government, Labor believe in consulting. After these bills were introduced, I hosted a round-table forum in Brisbane with Senator Murray Watt. We invited family law professionals, peak professional bodies and family violence prevention advocates all to come together so that we could ascertain their initial response to the family law bills. Understandably, almost all of those in attendance had not had time to fully digest the bills and the explanatory memorandum, which together run to more than 1,000 pages. However, their first impressions were not good. Every person who attended my round-table, all of them with years and years-in some cases decades-of experience with the work of the Family Court, had multiple concerns about many aspects of these bills. These bills, introduced by Attorney-General Porter before he completes his first year in the job, effectively herald the abolition of Gough Whitlam's Family Court of Australia. The Family Court of Australia was set up in 1975 as a specialist court with specialist judges to resolve the most complex of family disputes. It is a superior court of record. These bills purport to merge the Family Court of Australia with the Federal Circuit Court of Australia. Merge is a nice, soft word, but it contains a hard reality. The Federal Circuit Court is a lower federal court which has jurisdiction for not only family law but general family law jurisdictions as well, such as fair work and immigration law. The explanatory memorandum to the bill says the bill will bring these two courts together 'into an overarching, unified administrative structure to be known as the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia'. However, in effect, they would remain as two distinct courts with different names. The Family Court of Australia would be known as the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division 1). The Federal Circuit Court of Australia would be known as the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division 2). However, Attorney-General Porter's vision is to have one court to hear family law cases. Attorney General Porter favours all family matters being heard by the lower-level Federal Circuit Court, or division 2, in his brave new world. He will kill off the superior Family Court of Australia by attrition. This is not fearmongering; we know this because Attorney-General Porter has said as much himself. He told the Australian newspaper in May this year: The intention is that we won't reappoint into Division 1 … Over time there will no longer be a Division 1. Attorney-General Porter is, effectively, abolishing the Family Court of Australia, not amalgamating it. He's abolishing it; he's wiping it out. The Attorney-General is annihilating Gough Whitlam's legacy. The Law Council in a media release said: Our current understanding is the Australian Government will not make any new appointments of judges to the specialised Division 1 of the new court, meaning the quality of the family law justice system would reduce under this change. Australians may no longer have access to a court that specialises in family law. That's a quote from the Law Council of Australia-very well respected. The current provisions of the Family Law Act provide that judges should not be appointed to the Family Court of Australia unless 'by reason of training, experience and personality, the person is a suitable person to deal with matters of family law.' That provision is repeated in the bill for judges appointed to division 1, except Attorney-General Porter is not intending to appoint any. But the corresponding provisions for judges appointed to division 2 do not require such specialisation of training, experience and personality for matters of family law. Rather than a specialist superior court of record to hear the most complex family law matters, we would be left with one generalist court to hear every family court matter, without the breadth of experience and training or the personality that is necessary to deal with the most complex of family law matters, including those that involve family violence. At stake are the most vulnerable families and, most importantly, the children who rely on such folk to provide them with a place they can call home. Surely they deserve to have a specialist making the decisions that will impact on them, often for the rest of their lives. The Family Court of Australia currently has an appellate division with senior judges assigned to sit in that division and hear appeals from both the Federal Circuit Court and the Family Court. Appeals are heard by three judges unless the Chief Justice determines otherwise. Attorney-General Porter's bills will fundamentally change the way family law appeals are dealt with. There will no longer be an appeals division of what is now the Family Court of Australia; that will be completely abolished immediately. Appeals from a decision of either a division 1 judge or a division 2 judge of the FCFCA will be heard by a single Federal Court judge. I repeat: those appeals will be heard by a single Federal Court judge. Now, the Federal Court does not hear any family law matters; it has no family law jurisdiction. While I'm sure that the judges who sit on the Federal Court are extremely capable judges, they do not have any experience hearing family law matters and they will be hearing appeals as a single judge, not with the checks and balances that come with three judges sitting together. Unlike contract law, commercial law, conveyancing or most other areas of law, judicial discretion is almost always present in family law judgements. On appeal, the collective judicial wisdom and skill of three judges provide a check and balance to that discretion. If this bill passes, we will  have a situation where one judge's discretion may be replaced by another judge's discretion on appeal, and that appellate judge may have no experience hearing family law matters at all. You can see the problem. I particularly worry about developing areas of the law and how these changes will affect the progression of family law jurisprudence. The really difficult issues that come before the appellate division of the Family Court require not only a skilled legal mind but a breadth of experience of those issues and how they have been dealt with in the lower courts over many years. I'll give you an example of just one of the very difficult issues that this court has dealt with in the last year. It had long been a requirement that stage 2 treatment of gender dysphoria required an application to the Family Court for a determination of the child's competence, known as Gillick competence, before any treatment could be undertaken by medical professionals. This was required even if the child consented, both parents had no objection and all of the treating medical practitioners agreed that the child was competent to understand the treatment. I should point out that, in this case, Australia was the only country in the world that required court approval-that is, a legal process-for stage 2 treatment, which is effectively a medical procedure. Nevertheless, Family Court judges had no choice but to follow previous decisions of the full court that the court's authorisation was required. The only way to change that situation, bar a legislative change, was for the full court to decide that the previous full court decision was no longer good law. That did happen in Re Kelvin, decided last year by a full bench of the full court of the Family Court. Five experienced Family Court appeal judges heard that case. That decision in Re Kelvin will not have any impact on the vast majority of Australians; I understand that. But, for some young Australians and their families, this change to the law will be life-changing. In some cases, it will even be life-saving. Decisions like those in Re Kelvin are not easy, and they are not straightforward. But they are very important for some Australian citizens. Of course, parliament can always make changes to the law. But change such as occurred through Re Kelvin is not always readily taken up by political lawmakers. The previous Attorney-General, former Senator Brandis, was lobbied for a very long time to make that very change to the law. I must say: I thought he was very receptive to the change, but there was the problem of the political climate in which he was operating, especially around the same-sex marriage legislation. As a co-chair of the bipartisan Parliamentary Friendship Group for LGBTIQ Australians, I, along with the member for Leichhardt, Senator Rice and the member for Indi, had called on the Attorney-General to make this, on one level, quite simple and quite appropriate change to the law. But it was actually the five appellate judges of the Family Court who bravely changed this law, not this parliament. That's just one example of the importance of having an independent, specialist judiciary with a strong appellate division who are able to use their combined skill and experience to tackle the difficult issues that society will continue to throw at them. With due respect to the Federal Court judiciary, I am deeply concerned that appeals will no longer be heard by the very experienced specialists of the appellate division of the Family Court and will mostly be heard by only one judge. Attorney-General Porter has said publicly: Having more appeals heard by a single judge of the Federal Court will free up considerable judicial resources to help reduce delays in family law appeal matters and in first instance matters. If the proposed changes are merely cost-saving measures, this is short-sighted at best. This year I was honoured to address the 18th National Family Law Conference, held in Brisbane in October. These bills were of course a hot topic of conversation at that conference. Attorney-General Porter also made an address to the National Family Law Conference. Remembering that this Attorney-General had not consulted stakeholders prior to the introduction of these bills, you would think he would have been at pains to explain to the attendees why it was necessary to make the changes he has proposed-in effect, to argue his case for change in front of a conference full of lawyers. Instead, Attorney-General Porter used his address to criticise the professionals who spend their lives supporting, advocating for or making decisions about the most vulnerable families in Australia. One telling insight into his address was what Attorney-General Porter said in discussing when a matter is considered complex: When I initially asked the question 'how do we measure complexity?', frankly I was expecting a detailed multifactor analysis weighted to produce measures of complexity based on a long list of salient criteria (of which estimated trial length would be just one). Essentially, what Attorney-General Porter expected was a spreadsheet that would neatly dissect the lives of those using the court system. Would any of us want our family lives to be reduced to a spreadsheet? Would it even be possible for a spreadsheet to reflect the innumerable possible combinations of complexities that some vulnerable families experience? How can the effect of any one issue on a particular family be reflected in a spreadsheet?  Numbers mean something, but they rarely mean everything. In this case, Attorney-General, they mean nothing at all to families at breaking point. These families need a well-resourced, experienced, specialist court to hear their issues, ensure they are safe and protected in the process, and, where necessary, make a decision. I am not convinced these bills will meet the needs of Australian families. Attorney-General Porter arrogantly concluded his speech at the National Family Law Conference by saying, 'I am not going to resile from that process of reform.' The problem is that Attorney-General Porter has not undertaken any process of reform other than introducing a bill that proposes radical changes to the family law system. We should wait for the proper process to occur. The Senate inquiry should be allowed to complete its hearing and report. The ALRC review should be completed and the report considered before radical reform like that which is proposed is undertaken. These are the many reasons why Labor does not support these bills.",67
53,Mr LEESER,BILLS," I am pleased to speak on the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2018. Before I come to the substance of my remarks, I want to address a couple of points made by my friend the member for Moreton. This isn't about getting rid of the Whitlam government legacy. It's not an ideological exercise; it's a practical exercise. We now have two courts with different administrative functions. We have two courts that have different forms for lodgement. We have two courts that haven't been working together. This is trying to bring them together to stop the transferring of matters between courts, to make things easier for families who are going through a very stressful and very messy situation. I want to address the point that the member for Moreton raised about the issue of appeals being sent to a single judge of the Federal Court. In the migration system it often happens that appeals from the Federal Circuit Court get sent to a single judge of the Federal Court. Many judges are appointed to the bench that don't have particular expertise in the matters they hear, particularly in courts of general jurisdiction. Over the years we've had judges who haven't been family law practitioners appointed to the Family Court by both sides, but they have done a good job. I don't doubt that single judges of the Federal Court hearing appeals, as they will under this legislation, will do well. Family breakup is a traumatic time for all parties. There are currently two courts responsible for managing firstinstance family matters in the federal system: the Family Court of Australia and the Federal Circuit Court of Australia. The Family Court deals with the more complex cases, and the Federal Circuit Court processes less complex cases. The split system means that families can enter the system at multiple points and transfer between courts as the complexity of the cases evolves through proceedings. The structural overlap between the courts leads to great inefficiencies, confusion, delays, additional costs and unequal experiences for many families. This results in poor and potentially unsafe outcomes for some children and families. There are often problems involving family violence, child sex abuse, alcohol issues, mental health concerns and questions of parenting capacity. In some cases, increased stress from the proceedings themselves may lead to emotional, financial or physical abuse as anger escalates during divorce. Some people may be ending marriages to controlling or abusive spouses. Extreme cases may lead to extreme domestic violence reactions from abusive partners. My electorate hasn't been spared such instances. On the afternoon of 5 July 2018, John Edwards of Normanhurst murdered his son and daughter-15-year-old Jack and 13-year-old Jennifer-in West Pennant Hills. Later that night, Mr Edwards took his own life. Media reports suggested that Mr Edwards had been involved in custody hearings about the children with his estranged wife over the past two years. In Western Australia on 11 May at 4 am, Peter Miles walk from the main farmhouse to the converted shed where his daughter",72
54,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," The debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 43. The debate may be resumed at a later hour. NA Symonds, Mrs Elizabeth Ann (Ann), AM",72
55,Ms PLIBERSEK,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Today I rise to speak about the recent passing of one of our fierce Labor warriors, Ann Symonds. She was a warm, funny and generous woman who represented the Labor Party with distinction. She gave generously of her time and spirit, and was a mentor to me and to many, many others. She was a trailblazer, a true believer and a fighter. A champion for women in public life, she was the first female Deputy Lord Mayor of Waverley Council, and was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Council in 1982, serving the people of our state for over 15 years. She devoted her life to education and to common sense drug law reform, and has been at the heart of every important drug law reform in New South Wales history. Ann was a founding member of both the Australian Parliamentary Group for Drug Law Reform and the Australian Drug Law Reform Foundation. Looking at the beginning of the Uniting Medically Supervised Injecting  Centre in New South Wales, I don't believe that work would ever have happened without Ann's research and advocacy on this issue. Ann knew that drug law reform required health and social policy responses. She had an immeasurable impact on drug users themselves and on families and communities throughout Sydney. She also advocated for reform within our prison system, and the effect that had on women and their children in particular. She was a strong advocate for women prisoners and their families. My thoughts go out to her family today. Warringah Electorate: Lifeline Northern Beaches",72
56,Mr ABBOTT,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise today to acknowledge the work that Lifeline does around the country, but in particular the work that Lifeline Northern Beaches does. Lifeline Northern Beaches has just celebrated 50 years of operation. Suicide is one of our greatest killers. It is the greatest killer of young people, and that's why we need Lifeline. Just five years after Lifeline first started at the Wesley Mission, Lifeline Northern Beaches opened at the Balgowlah Uniting Church. That service now handles close to 10 per cent of the one million calls that Lifeline receives around our country every year. But Lifeline is not just a vital phone counselling service; Lifeline Northern Beaches offers face-to-face counselling for people in financial trouble, people with gambling addictions, people whose families are under pressure and young people who are wrestling with the meaning of life. There are also a number of groups that people can join if they are grappling with particular problems. There is a Suicide Bereavement Support Group, a grief and loss group, a Being Mums group and a moods matter group for young people in particular. I want to thank the staff of Lifeline for making me and my wife, Margie, so welcome last week. I particularly thank Ian Farmer, the chairman, and the 180 trained volunteers who do such a great job. You are the unsung heroes of our country and our area. (Time expired) Solomon Electorate: Darwin",73
57,Mr GOSLING,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Last week, Darwin had the pleasure of hosting the Japanese Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe. I was lucky to meet the Prime Minister when he came to pay the respects of his nation at our Darwin Cenotaph War Memorial. It was an historic visit, showing how far the relationship has come between Australia and Japan some 75 years after Japanese bombs rained down over our city-77 times our city was bombed. We see through the INPEX Ichthys project, which is Japan's largest-ever overseas investment, that the Japanese have now begun to ship natural gas from Darwin to Japan, and that has really reinforced Australia's position as Japan's main energy supplier. I'm particularly glad that the Japanese Prime Minister came to Darwin, because the current Australian Prime Minister also came to Darwin. I'm pleased to say that finally, after 577 days, the Darwin City Deal has been signed. Well done to all who worked on this at every level of government. We will honour that deal, should we be lucky enough to form government in the future, and we will improve on it as part of our City Partnerships plan. I call on the government to get the funds to the Northern Territory as soon as possible. Menzies Electorate: Smart Cities and Suburbs Program",73
58,Mr ANDREWS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I was very pleased last week to announce a $250,000 grant, under the Smart Cities and Suburbs Program, to Jackson Court, a shopping centre in Doncaster East in my electorate. It is one of 32 projects nationally and seven in Victoria. This federal grant of a quarter of a million dollars will provide the technology to improve the traffic flow, the parking, and the efficiency and amenity of this vibrant shopping centre. I was pleased to be able to work with the minister, the Hon. Alan Tudge, to secure this grant for my electorate and I look forward to joining with the local traders and residents in seeing the scheme in operation. The smart cities program is a great program which provides for facilities, such as those that will go into Jackson Court in east Doncaster, to ensure that our cities work in a more efficient and friendly way than they do at the present time. Solving traffic congestion problems, providing better parking options-these things add to the amenity of a shopping centre, and that is welcomed by the traders in Jackson Court in east Doncaster. Canberra Electorate: Torrens Primary School",73
59,Ms BRODTMANN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Rocked by the tragic news that their beloved kindy teacher, Mrs Ianna, had been diagnosed with terminal cancer and had only months left with her family, including her three year-old and her six-year-old, the Torrens Primary School community turned their grief into something positive. They got the Canberra community together for a night of friendship, food and entertainment to raise funds to fulfil Mrs Ianna's wish to take her family to Alice Springs. Last week, the community raised more than $10,000 to make Mrs Ianna's wish come true. It was an extraordinary effort by extraordinary people for an extraordinary woman, and it showcased the generosity and big hearts of the people of Canberra.  Today I want to say bravo and thanks to Amber Nichols and the brilliant performers on the night; A Bite To Eat in Chifley, for hosting the event and organising their suppliers, including Foodlink, Regional fruit and veg, and Two Birds Brewery, to donate food and drinks; The Chifley Grocer, for donating the proceeds from all coffees, milkshakes and ice creams; Virgin Australia, for flying the family to Alice Springs at no charge; Elite Event Technology, for supplying the stage and sound; Genplus, for supplying the generator; The Bravery media and PR, for pro bono publicity services; The Republic of Everyone, for designing the amazing flyer; Heartstory photography, for donating a complimentary family portrait; and Flash printing in Fyshwick. I'm so proud of everyone involved. Thank you so much. MCMillan Electorate: Prom Country Aged Care",73
60,Mr BROADBENT,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Last week, together with CEO Rhett MCLennan and resident Audrey Truscott, I had the pleasure of opening a new wing at Prom Country Aged Care in Foster. The staff and residents are absolutely proud of their new building and the community effort that has contributed so heavily to the success of Prom Country Aged Care. Prom Country Aged Care is a leader in caring for and supporting families and the elderly in the Prom Coast region. It began as Toora Nursing Home in January 1985. In 2009, the federal government approved a $9 million grant for the construction of a new, 60-bed aged-care facility. The board of management and executive management team are to be congratulated on their dedication and passion for ensuring that Prom Coast locals have this level of care and support provided within their own community. I want to mention and honour the board of management: Bill Bray; Tristan White; Jackie Dargaville; Sandy Bucello, who's been a driving force and someone who has pushed me; Phil Nightingall; Joan Liley; Liz Davies; and Llew Vale. One thing I want to say to the House is: there's an inquiry into the provision of aged care in Australia at the moment. But these people are absolutely dedicated. They have a $2.6 million new aged-care facility, which we opened, but they are really concerned that they are being targeted as not being competent in what they're doing. They are. They're amazing. We've got to remember that 99.9 per cent of our aged-care providers do a great job. Victorian State Election",74
61,Ms CHESTERS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," The Prime Minister and the government are kidding themselves if they think the result in Victoria at the state election had nothing to do with federal parliament or federal politics. Just see the results in regional Victoria, including in my seat. We won on the primary vote in Bendigo, a marginal seat, and won Bendigo East. I would have thought that at least they would have turned up in Bendigo East, but they struggled even to get their volunteers out on election day-they couldn't even be at the polling booths on election day. They had Sophie Mirabella handing out in Kyneton East. It won't surprise the House that we had a 15 per cent swing to us in that seat, which says a lot about who they are getting to hand out for them. The lessons of the state election ring true throughout the country. What happened in Victoria was Victorian voters saying no to division and no to nastiness. What the Victorian Liberals have in common with the Liberals in this place is their nasty, divisive politics. That's what Victorians rejected on election day. They rejected the wedge politics. They rejected the race politics. They rejected the fact that this government-like the Liberals in Victoria-smash up everything that people believe in. I want to congratulate the amazing women MPs in my part of the world who have been returned on the primary vote. There have been phenomenal efforts by Mary-Anne Thomas, Jacinta Allan and Maree Edwards. Mining",74
62,Mr CHRISTENSEN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," While North Queensland supports mining and mining jobs, a handful of extreme Greens insist that their own political beliefs and ideologies be shared by everyone. About ten of them gathered outside my office last week in yet another protest against local mining jobs. They were threatening a queue-in, blocking public access to my office, so my staff closed the door for the two hours of the protest. While they were protesting, my staff and I got on with the job of meeting genuine constituents and dealing with their concerns. Mackay's economy is now back on track, with mothballed mines reopening and new mines being constructed. The Carmichael coal project is opening up the Galilee Basin, creating thousands of jobs. Thousands of jobs are also going to flow from the China Stone project, promising to be bigger than the first stage of the Carmichael mine. The extreme Greens have now found an echidna to hold the China Stone project to hostage, hoping to prevent the project, but their skink and ornamental snake hostage plans failed to prevent approvals for the Carmichael mine. For those extremists, it's not about the wildlife. If it were, they would go out looking for lizards or whatnot to prevent the numerous solar projects across North Queensland. Likewise, it's not about carbon dioxide. If it were, they would support the use of high-grade Australian coal being burnt instead of coal from  Indonesia, which produces more emissions. For these extreme Greens, it's not about listening to what the majority wants. I'm listening to my electorate, and the vast majority of my constituents are telling me they are sick and tired of listening to the extreme Green whingers. Immigration Detention",74
63,Mr BANDT,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I stand today to acknowledge the Grandmothers Against Detention of Refugee Children. Last Tuesday I met a group of grandmothers who are taking action and saying that no refugee child should be trapped in detention. Australians have been horrified to see the impacts of cruel, prolonged and indefinite detention on refugee children and their parents. Hundreds of children have been kept in offshore detention over the years on Nauru and Manus, and it's destroying them and their families. The children must be taken to Australia and they must be released from detention. Scandalously, many of the children who've already suffered and faced lasting damage have reportedly been locked up again in Australia. According to reports, as of last week 13 children who'd been on Nauru were locked up in the MITA detention centre in Melbourne. Kids don't belong in detention, whether it's in Manus, Nauru or Melbourne. Grandmothers have been fighting this for years, and they continue to do so. To the grandmothers I met last week I say: thank you for fighting for what is right. Last Tuesday was Universal Children's Day. Grandmothers joined teachers in Melbourne and elsewhere in the country to say that no child should be in detention. Labor and Liberal continue to hold up the system of offshore detention they created and have backed in, in lock step, for years. It is shameful. To Labor and Liberal politicians, to the Prime Minister, and to the Leader of the Opposition I say: stop this cruelty and listen to the grandmothers and everyone else who is speaking up for children. Dunkley Electorate: Learn Engage Connect Young Parents Program",75
64,Mr CREWTHER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I recently attended the Learn Engage Connect Young Parents Program graduation dinner in my electorate of Dunkley. The program, run by Chisholm TAFE in conjunction with headspace Frankston and Anglicare, is giving young parents the chance to re-engage in education with their child. Set in a classroom where the young parent completes their VCAL studies with their child beside them, the program offers a children's learning program and family support, as well as education for the parents. This is the third year I have been involved, and I'm proud that the federal Liberal-National government continues to fund and support efforts to bring opportunities for education and employment to these young parents. As a father of a three year-old myself with another little one on the way, and having been on the board of Zoe Support Australia, doing a similar thing re-engaging young people with education, I know the importance of this program. Congratulations in particular to this year's graduates Rachael Maidment, Cassandra Wallace, Michaela Bryant, Kimberley Jennings, Caitlin Coxhell, Ruby-Lee Arnott, Vanida Khoeun, Phoenix Nicholson, Megan Smith and Chloe Pankhurst. And well done also to Lisa, Lisa and Corise, who once again spoke of their experience as past graduates. The Learn Engage Connect Young Parents Program is a wonderful initiative, and all participants should be proud of themselves. Congratulations again to all the organisations involved, including Anglicare Victoria, Awesome Kids Frankston, Chisholm headspace and also Maree Radford and all those involved, on the success of another year. Payday Lending",75
65,Mr DICK,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," The clock is ticking for this government in more ways than one. There are now just eight days left for this government to be true to its word and introduce the small-amount-credit contract laws legislation that will see millions of Australians given the protection they need when taking out a small loan. As it stands under this government, the loan sharks have been left to wreak havoc in the out-of-control payday loans industry, with over 800,000 Australians currently being taken advantage of. In fact, it is now 1,207 days since this government announced a review into the payday loans sector, but it has since caved into the loan sharks, with nothing on the horizon to suggest any changes. This is despite promises from Minister O'Dwyer, promises from the now-deputy Prime Minister and promises from the then-minister Michael Sukkar, writing to Queensland state MPs earlier this year to state that legislation will be progressed this year. There were also promises from former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who wrote to me in July this year promising that legislation would be introduced this year, which means Prime Minister Morrison now has just eight days left to come good on the government's four promises made in public in black and white. If he does not, it just proves that it's a shallow, deceitful, untrustworthy government that simply does not care about honouring its word or protecting Australian consumers. No wonder this government is in such a mess when it's failing to honour its promises to protect Australians from the loan sharks.  Diabetes",75
66,Mr DRUM,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Yesterday the Minister for Health announced that the government will expand free access to glucose-monitoring devices for pregnant women, children and more adults with type 1 diabetes, saving people up to $7,000 a year. The investment of an additional $100 million in funding over the next four years will ensure that free glucose-monitoring devices are available to over 37,000 eligible people with type 1 diabetes. It is only because the government has strong economic management that we can make sure that these medicines are available, and it is only because of this strong economic management that we can actually make this investment in type 1 diabetes. Not only can we keep putting more and more medicines on the PBS; we can make sure that people can live fuller lives primarily because we have a strong economy. Type 1 diabetes attacks a person's ability to produce insulin. People with this condition must be able to monitor their glucose levels day and night, and continuous glucose monitoring devices continually monitor a person's glucose level and provide alerts if the glucose levels drop too low. Once again, it was a fantastic announcement yesterday of $100 million over the next four years to make more and more people with type 1 diabetes able to live fuller lives. Victorian State Election",76
67,Mr GILES,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise today as a particularly proud Victorian and I take this opportunity in this place to congratulate the Daniel Andrews Labor government on an emphatic re-election at the Victorian state election on Saturday. I also, equally importantly, take this opportunity to thank the Victorian people for rejecting the politics of division and hate on the weekend and standing up for a positive vision of our communities. I'm so pleased to be able to acknowledge that the great campaigns run by my colleagues in the Scullin electorate-Vicki Ward, Danielle Green, Colin Brooks, Bronwyn Halfpenny and Lily D'Ambrosio-were all rewarded by very strong swings. I read today about the frosty reception that colleagues in this place from the other side got at polling places. I can say that that was not a reception that I experienced with my state Labor colleagues. People were so keen to support the re-election of the Andrews government and recognise the enormous investments that have been made in the north as well as the way in which the government has gone about rebuilding trust in politics-a matter that government members should pay careful attention to. The weekend's result was Daniel Andrews's victory and a vindication of his government, but it has significant implications for this place. There is a message here that government members should heed. It wasn't just the dysfunction in the federal Liberal and National parties that affected Victorian voters; it was the same nasty message that has been propagated here that the Matthew Guy opposition tried and failed to sell in Victoria. Government members should take note- (Time expired) Cairns Men's Shed",76
68,Mr ENTSCH,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," It gives me great pleasure to rise this afternoon to talk about the Cairns Men's Shed and the fantastic work they're doing in my community. The Cairns Men's Shed has come along in leaps and bounds over the past few years and is widely regarded as one of the best sheds around. During the recent break I had the opportunity to visit the Cairns Men's Shed to present the 1,750th Indian myna bird trap made in the shed by its members. The Indian myna bird trap, which is now used in countless men's sheds around the nation, was designed by Cairns man Ron Moon. It's been a wonderful initiative that has produced some great results in ridding this pest from our suburbs. It's estimated that well over 80,000 Indian mynas have been removed from our suburbs since the Cairns Men's Shed started constructing and selling their specially designed traps six years ago. These traps really work. People have told me that they're now seeing native birds returning to their backyards for the first time in many years. Indian myna bird traps aside, it's great to spend some time at the Cairns Men's Shed and have lunch with its members. Under the stewardship of both Clive Lee and Bob Lavington, and prior to that John King, the Cairns Men's Shed is one of the best in Far North Queensland. Victorian State Election Ms O'NEIL (Hotham) (13:51): I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate my state Labor colleagues in Victoria, and also to congratulate and thank Victorians who have just given the Daniel Andrews government a resounding victory on the weekend. It wasn't just any win; it was a down slide. It was a result that showed the power of a positive campaign, which focused on the issues that people really cared about. Labor in Victoria spent an election talking about our education system, about health and hospitals, about tackling climate change, and about funding the big public infrastructure that we need for a growing population.  Something that struck me during the election was that everyone I talked to-whether it was doing street stalls, whether it was my parents or whether it was mums that I'm friends with on Facebook-could point to a way that their life was being improved by Daniel Andrews's Labor government. That is what we aspire to be on this side of the chamber. On the other side of politics, we saw the Victorian public reject a campaign that was extremely negative. It had not a skerrick, not a shred, of a sense of vision for our great state of Victoria, and the voters punished the Liberals in Victoria for that. It was nasty and it was small-minded. We take nothing for granted on this side of the chamber, but that election shows you that if you think you can win an election on faux culture wars, and on internecine party conflicts that we see on the other side of the chamber, then the voters might just give you a kick in the pants. I'm very excited about what I see in Victoria and about the wonderful new members of parliament that I have representing my area of the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne. Brisbane Electorate: Christmas card competition",76
69,Mr EVANS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I see our schools as sitting at the very heart of our local communities. It's an exciting time of year right now for students, teachers and parents as the school year comes to an end and students graduate. I held my annual Christmas card design competition again this year for primary school students around Brisbane, and this year the chosen theme was Australian animals at Christmas. The quality of entries, as always, was very high and the judging panel had a very difficult task in front of them. I want to congratulate all the students who participated in the competition, and I'm pleased to announce the winners here again this year. The overall winner was Isis Bamman in year 3 at Newmarket State School. The prep/year 1 winner was Aadhya Singh in prep at Brisbane Central State School. The year 2 winner was Arwyn Feehely at Newmarket State School. The year 3 winner was James Ellis from Our Lady Help of Christians School in Hendra. Because of the high quality of entries, this year some highly commended certificates were also awarded to Finn Andrews in year 1 at Holy Cross School, Molly Bollard in year 1 at Windsor State School and Olivia Basile in year 4 at New Farm State School. Congratulations again to all the students who participated and the winners. The winners and highly commended entries will be featured again in my annual Christmas card that will be hitting every mailbox in the Brisbane electorate in the lead-up to Christmas. It's a great way of displaying the young artistic talent we enjoy in Brisbane. Victorian State Election",77
70,Ms RYAN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I'm really pleased today to join my Victorian Labor colleagues in congratulating the Andrews Labor government on their return. They are set now to deliver for another four years for Victorians. Like my colleagues, I want to congratulate the party and the broader movement on that victory, but I want to deeply thank the electors of Victoria, who've returned a government with a vision, a government that sees what needs to be done and sets about getting it done, a government that has worked on a first treaty in our country for our Indigenous communities, a government that held a royal commission into domestic violence and a government that is fearless in its approach to social issues. The opposition in Victoria went to an election this weekend with no statement on education. This was unbelievable. As a result, Victorians saw through that opposition and saw that they could not form a reasonable government that was going to deliver for people in my electorate of Lalor. When I'm talking to people in Lalor, those are the things that matter to them. They care about social issues. They care about the environment. They care critically about education and health. They want a government that is going to do the best for their families. I'm pleased to congratulate the Andrews Labor government and to congratulate Tim Pallas, Jill Hennessy and the new member for Tarneit, Sarah Connolly, on their election. Vietnam Veterans Federation of South Australia",77
71,Ms FLINT,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," On 14 December, the Vietnam Veterans Federation of South Australia's new home, in the heart of my electorate, will officially be opened. I recently joined President Mal Thiele, Vice President Bob Ellis OAM, members and guests for a sneak preview of their purpose-built headquarters and for their first barbecue there. The Vietnam vets had to find a new home as a result of the long-awaited Oaklands Crossing grade separation project. I worked very hard with Mal, Bob and the federation members to secure their new facilities. I think that, together, we made a very formidable team. The federation is now co-located with the Marion RSL, and I thank President Trevor Chapman and the RSL members for their support. It has been wonderful to see how both groups have worked together. It has been a time of friendship, healing and great activity. We now have the RSL, Vietnam vets, the Marion RSL bowling club and many community groups using the building and the war memorial, gardens and fabulous playground that I was  able to support with the federal government's Stronger Communities grant. I'm delighted that the Vietnam vets have been able to remain headquartered in our community where they do so much for so many people. On behalf of our community in Boothby, I would like to thank the Vietnam vets for the support and care they provide to so many people locally and across South Australia. I congratulate the Vietnam Veterans Federation on the opening of their new building, and I look forward to creating many new memories with them at their home in the coming months and years. Victorian State Election",77
72,Mr WATTS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," In Saturday's state election, Victorians rejected the Liberal Party's narrow and nasty campaign of fear and division and resoundingly endorsed the Andrews government's positive agenda of getting things done and making things fair in health, education, infrastructure and climate change. The election campaign exposed Liberal MPs who were completely out of touch with the electorate and a divided and chaotic party organisation that is not fit for purpose for modern Australia. Many of the architects of this state of affairs sit opposite-Liberal MPs who have spent more time pursuing so-called left-wing termites and socialists in their own party than they have pursuing the support of voters in their own electorates, Liberals who have spent more time trying to make the member for Dickson Prime Minister than they have trying to make our schools and hospitals the best in the world. In my community, the Liberal Party had nothing to say about rebuilding Footscray Hospital and nothing to say about rebuilding schools like Sunshine secondary college, renovating schools like Altona North Primary School or rebuilding much-needed new ones like the Footscray Learning Precinct. They had nothing to say about fighting climate change. In contrast, the Andrews Labor government took a positive agenda to the public, delivering on all of these issues for our community. I want to give my hearty congratulations to first-time Labor candidates in my electorate Katie Hall and Melissa Horne, who ran outstanding campaigns and will deliver for our community in Melbourne's west. (Time expired) Dolkar, Ms Pema",78
73,Mr FALINSKI,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Pema Dolkar last saw her family at the age of six, 20 years ago. Her father sent her to India, away from the dangers of their Tibetan home. They made the journey together, first climbing mountains to Nepal and then catching the train to a Tibetan settlement where Pema would live for the next 16 years. Although isolated, it was her home away from home. In her early 20s, Pema was offered a humanitarian visa to Australia. Initially unwilling to migrate a second time, Pema left India for Sydney, where she commenced a degree in media and communications. In her spare time, she works as a bilingual guide for the Tibetan community in Dee Why, volunteers for numerous charities and podcasts for the SBS. Pema well and truly devotes herself to improving the welfare of her fellow Tibetan migrants. In addition to assisting the Dee Why community, she started the University of Sydney Tibetan student association. However, having graduated a few weeks ago, she has passed on the torch. Despite the struggles and setbacks of growing up stateless, without a family and without the comforts so many of us demand as a right, Pema has displayed courage and a certain ferocity for her life in her community service. Her ultimate goal is to establish a newspaper for the Tibetan community in Sydney. It would be written in English so as to make it accessible for all Australians and would, at its heart, be a conduit for societal cohesion.",78
74,The SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"In accordance with standing order 43, the time for members' statements has concluded. NA",78
75,Mr MORRISON,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS," I table a revised ministry list. This includes the appointment of Minister Littleproud to the role of Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Drought Preparation and Response, which was announced at the National Drought Summit. The document read as followsThe document was unavailable at the time of publishing. NA Mack, Mr Edward Carrington (Ted) The SPEAKER (14:01): I inform the House of the death on Tuesday, 6 November 2018, of Edward Carrington 'Ted' Mack, a member of this House for the division of North Sydney from 1990 until 1996. As a mark of respect to the memory of Ted Mack, I invite all present to rise in their places. Honourable members having stood in their places",78
76,The SPEAKER,CONDOLENCES,I thank the House.  Reference to Federation Chamber  That statements by indulgence in relation to Edward Carrington (Ted) Mack be permitted in the Federation Chamber. Question agreed to. NA Melbourne: Attacks,78
77,Mr MORRISON,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE," Thank you, Mr Speaker, for your indulgence. On Friday, 9 November, a lone Islamic extremist launched a terrorist attack in Melbourne. The terrorist thought his actions would divide us and frighten us. Instead, he met the will and resolve of Melbourne and Melburnians: two brave police officers who stepped up and confronted the terrorist; bystanders who refused to be cowed; first responders who put themselves in harm's way; and every part of government, state, federal and local, standing as one. In a moment, a great city understood a simple truth: we are stronger together because we have each other. That strength is needed to deal with the grief, and we grieve for who and what was attacked on that day. We grieve for Sisto Malaspina, known to many in this place, a man who in so many ways embodies everything marvellous and wonderful about this great country; a man who came to this country as a young man and brought with him his Italian joy and an unquenchable openness of heart. We think of his family and we grieve with his family. Our thoughts go to those injured and those who are struggling with the violence they encountered on what should have been any other lovely day in Melbourne. That day, everyone was tested and no-one was found wanting, particularly the two police officers, who thought they were going to attend a traffic incident. Having met with both of them and their families, their families have every right to feel very proud of those two police officers, as we do today-one very early in their service and one very experienced in their service. As the son of a policeman, I could only look into the eyes of his children and see that same pride in their eyes for their dad. They should always feel incredibly proud-as should all children of police officers around the country feel proud of the great service police officers provide to our country, in our cities and our rural and regional areas. We can be proud of everyone acting as one on that day, the unflinching resolve of 25 million people. Sadly, we know enough about our modern world to know that we will be tested again. Last Tuesday, the Victorian Joint Counter Terrorism Team arrested and charged three men for undertaking preparations for a terrorist attack. I applaud the Victorian Joint Counter Terrorism Team for thwarting their heinous plan. ASIO has no information to indicate any further related threat following from this incident. Our overall threat level remains unchanged at 'probable'. This means, sadly, that there are groups and individuals with both the intent and the capability to conduct a terrorist attack on our soil, so we must remain vigilant. Since September 2014, our law enforcement and security agencies have undertaken 15 successful counterterrorism disruption operations in response to potential attack planning here in Australia, and they should be commended for doing so and thwarting those attacks. Ninety-three people have been charged during 41 counterterrorism operations. The Commonwealth is working closely with the states and territories to combat these threats. Though we will do everything-everything-to keep Australians safe, we must accept that being part of a free society means that what is targeted is our very freedom. The government has responded to the emerging threat. Since 2014 we have invested an additional $2.2 billion in keeping Australians safe and have passed 12 tranches, with the support of this House and the other place, of counterterrorism legislation. We are a free people from many nations and many faiths. In this House I want to thank and acknowledge the many brave and passionate Australians in our Muslim community for their leadership and their courage in speaking out against the things which would seek to corrupt their very religion and put their own families and their own communities at risk. These are brave Australians who deserve our support, and they have mine. Last week, I met with leaders from our Muslim community, and I'm committed to working with all in the community, in partnership with them, to tackle violent Islamic extremism. These have been testing days but days of strength as well. Last week, Melbourne and Victoria grieved at Sisto Malaspina's state funeral. I was pleased that Jenny was able to attend on that day, representing me, along with Assistant Minister Steve Irons. The Leader of the Opposition was also there, as many were. In cabinet that day we paused for a moment's silence during the funeral, and at the Ethnic Business Awards we also paused to celebrate an incredible life lived. As I've reflected on the events of recent weeks I've been reminded about a small thing, which I remarked on at the Ethnic Business Awards the other night, that Sisto said when he was interviewed a few years ago. As those of Italian heritage will verify, if coffee has a spiritual home, it is in Italy. In Italy they follow a bible when it comes  to drinking coffee. Italians usually don't drink cappuccinos after midday, I'm told, and it is unthinkable to have one after dinner. But in Australia Sisto didn't follow those rules. He'd say, 'People should drink their coffees how they like it; the way they like it, when they like it.' It might sound like a small thing, but that respect for othersthe tolerance and the acceptance of difference-is the foundation of modern Australia, the most successful immigrant country in the entire world. It is something we should be very proud of. Sisto got it. He lived it. He displayed it. He demonstrated it. Though his life was taken from him in that terrible terrorist act, he overwhelmed it and conquered it through the life that he lived and the freedoms that he enjoyed. It is a sad day, as we pause and reflect here again today, but it is a day when we can think about his great achievements as a migrant who came to this country and fulfilled every moment of freedom he had to make Australia a better place. We thank him and we thank all of those who stood as one on that day.",79
78,Mr SHORTEN,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE," I thank the Prime Minister for his words. The Bourke Street attack that cost an innocent man his life, injured two others and gripped Melbourne with shock was horrific and confronting and appalling. But it was also, sadly, familiar. Swirling rumours and shaky footage on social media; texts and calls between city workers and loved ones. The change from the usual, 'What time do you think you'll be home tonight?' to 'Are you safe? Are you okay?' The anxious wait for how many people might have been injured or worse. Then, of course, there was the genuine, spontaneous, limitless admiration for the police, the first responders, the courageous passers-by and especially, as the Prime Minister has said, the frontline Victoria Police officers. There's been constant coverage and speculation as to what drove this individual to inflict this senseless violence on strangers. And then later there have been the tears, the tributes, the flowers and the funeral. The world has known too much of this and Australians were reminded that we are not spared, that we too are not immune. And it is always important for us in this place to declare and affirm that terrorism is not and never will be part of the normal course of events. It is not the way of the world. We do not have to change who we are or how we live simply to accommodate terrorism. Instead, we must stand together to eliminate it: together as a parliament, as a people, as a country. I want to join with the Prime Minister in saluting the efforts of our national security agencies, including their arrest of three individuals just last Tuesday allegedly planning to do us harm. Every Australian is grateful for the work that they do to keep us safe. For five years now the Labor opposition has applied a straightforward principle to working with the government on national security policy: when it comes to fighting terrorism, we are in this together because, whether it comes cloaked in the form of violent Islamic extremism or in any other form, terrorism is an offence against every faith. I wish to make it clear that the actions of a few violent extremists and unwell people do not reflect the broader Muslim Australian community and all here understand that. Terrorism is an attack on all peoples, on the shared values of our humanity itself, and the toll it inflicts is not an abstract ideological concept. As we remember today, it's a human one. I recall, perhaps with some embarrassment, that as a nerdy year 11 student I took a friend to Pellegrini's for a date. I remember how proud I was to be acknowledged by Sisto and Nino with a friendly 'ciao'. I basked in the reflected sophistication. And then, when your coffee arrived in a glass, you were truly a peak cosmopolitan in early 1980s Melbourne! So many Melburnians have a Pellegrini's memory. When you popped into Pellegrini's for a coffee in the morning or a plate of pasta before the football, gelati after the theatre or, indeed, stretch across to the Spaghetti Tree, you never felt like you were ever witnessing a performance. You weren't just a number or a face in the crowd. Sisto's son, David, gave a wonderful speech at the state funeral. He described his father's philosophy in the following terms: 'When you enter the room, greet everyone in the room. You always say please and thank you. If they leave or you leave, you say goodbye. You treat everybody with courtesy regardless of their circumstance or their station in life.' This was his gift: making people feel welcome, radiating a genuine warmth and affection, a kind word, a smile, a laugh for all. It was on the Monday before this dreadful event, the Monday before cup day, and the top end of Bourke Street was beautifully quiet. I was walking past Pellegrini's. I popped in for a coffee. There was, of course, the Big Issue seller outside. Nino was sitting outside at one of the seats, talking to a friend. It was a typical crowd: there was a PhD student there, a couple of police officers, a couple of Salvos and a tourist or two-and of course Sisto himself. As usual, while I was there we talked a bit of shop before Sisto cajoled me to try a slice of his almond sponge. After gamely resisting for at least 10 seconds, I gave in. He then proudly told me that he'd become a grandfather the previous week, before insisting I eat some more of his baked cheesecake. I wish I could tell the parliament, and I wish I could recall, something profound from when we shook hands and we farewelled each other that day, but it was a casual goodbye. It was a friendly 'See you soon,' because you couldn't imagine what was about to happen. Indeed, it was so much the same as an earlier visit. With that twinkling in his eye, because he really liked the little children. Sisto offered my eight-year-old daughter, Clementine, a bowl of his minestrone soup. Clem politely said, 'No, thank you.' She was leaving room for dessert.  But in the days after we heard this terrible news, I went into her to read her a story before bedtime. She was sitting up and looking at me. She said: 'I'm so upset about Sisto. I should have tried his soup'. It made me think. Children pick up a lot about what happens in the world and the people who are affected. We have a responsibility to them to make them realise that it's not how it should be, this violence, and that the world can be better. I'm sure in the past few weeks thousands of Melburnians have been revisiting their last conversation, their final interaction, not realising it was indeed that. But for all of us it was probably nothing more than the usual brief, cheery encounter-a pleasant part of a normal day. You can't help think that that's the way he would want to be remembered: a proud son of Italy who gave so much to Australia, a man who lived the truth of the Australian migrant's story-long hours, hard work and sacrifice so his family would enjoy a better life-and a smile we'll all remember as we walk past that famous neon sign. Our love to his family: may he rest in peace. Reference to Federation Chamber  That further statements in relation to the Bourke Street terror attack be permitted in the Federation Chamber. Question agreed to. NA",80
79,Mr MORRISON,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS," on indulgence-The Minister for Home Affairs will be absent from question time this week, and the Attorney-General will answer questions on his behalf. NA Mr TONY SMITH (Casey-Speaker) (14:17): Just before we go to the questions without notice, I would like to inform the House we have joining us a delegation of Speakers and Deputy Speakers from Pacific parliaments, accompanied by former Speakers of this House Hawker and Jenkins. They're part of an inaugural interparliamentary study program for speakers. On behalf of the House, I extend a very warm welcome to you. Honourable members: Hear, hear! NA National Integrity Commission",81
80,Mr SHORTEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. Given that the government has now voted to support the establishment of a national integrity commission, what is the Prime Minister's timetable to establish a national integrity commission? Will he work with all sides across the parliament to make the National Integrity Commission a reality as soon as possible?  consistently low as a corruption jurisdiction. In fact, we maintain precisely the same arrangements as most countries that rank low as a corruption jurisdiction. We have what is known as a multiagency approach, with different specialised agencies responding to integrity and conduct issues in different parts of the public sector. That multiagency approach has proven, here and overseas, to be very successful. Agencies such as ACLEI, the public sector commissioner, the Inspector-General of Taxation, the AFP, ACIC, the Auditor-General and the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority-which, by the way, we created-work together very well. There is clearly, which we have acknowledged today and continue to acknowledge, a very live question as to how to improve on that system and whether scrapping it for a completely singular model of an integrity commissioner is the best way to go, or whether there should be consolidation and the creation of a new umbrella model. We are considering that. We are doing it in a dutiful and cautious way. But I might just note: for all of the grandstanding from the members opposite, would it surprise members on this side of the House that members opposite have not, themselves, always supported an integrity commissioner? Mr Dreyfus interjecting The member for Isaacs was asked the question of whether he agreed with a model of a national integrity commissioner, and he said, 'I'm not convinced there is a need for yet another integrity officer.' Now, the context of that is very, very interesting, because that question and answer was put in the same press conference where the member for Isaacs was under pressure for wrongly claiming travel entitlement for a skiing trip. So the questions went like this: first, we had questions about the travel claims issue. The member said, 'I should not have claimed for two nights because I went to Perisher to ski.' Then we had the next question: do you agree with a national integrity commissioner? And the answer was, 'I'm not convinced there is a need for yet another integrity officer.' The member for Isaacs and the Leader of the Opposition are questioning our commitment to improved  arrangements. The member for Isaacs is literally a fairweather friend of integrity commissioners-when the snow is falling, he's against them; when the sun is shining, he is for them. In fact, I am remembered of Banjo Paterson: Let us saddle up and goBack to support the commissionerAt the melting of the snow. NA The SPEAKER (14:20): I would like to inform the House that we have joining us in the gallery this afternoon former Speaker, former member for Mackellar and former senator, the Hon. Bronwyn Bishop. On behalf of the House, I extend a very warm welcome to you today. Honourable members: Hear, hear! NA Economy Mr VAN MANEN (Forde-Government Whip) (14:21): My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister outline to the House how the government is acting to build a stronger economy and why this is important to guarantee the essential services Australians rely on? And will the Prime Minister outline the risks to our strong economy?",81
81,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Forde for his question. He understands, like everyone on this side of the House, that it is a strong economy that is necessary to deliver the essential services that Australians rely on. That's how it actually occurs. A strong economy is not something you put on the shelf and admire from a distance as some sort of achievement. It is a strong economy that delivers for Medicare. It's a strong economy that delivers for the National Disability Insurance Scheme. It's a strong economy that has enabled this government to increase hospitals funding by 50 per cent since 2012-13. It is a strong economy-that is what guarantees the services, the infrastructure and the supports that Australians rely on from their governments at both the Commonwealth and the state level. Under our economic management of the last five years, the economy is stronger, and, under our plans for the future, it will be stronger. Under our economic management, unemployment has fallen to five per cent. There are 50,000 fewer people unemployed today than there were at the last election, as we promised. We have had record jobs growth and, in particular, the strongest growth in youth employment in Australia's economic history, with more than 100,000 young people getting a job in the previous 12 months to year ending 30 June. That is 1.2 million Australians who have gotten a job since we were first elected. And on top of that, female participation in the workforce is at record highs. The gender pay gap has been reduced under the policies of our government by driving the economy forward. We have companies doing better in this country as a result of the environment we on this side put in place for them to invest and employ people in, and we've got a budget coming back into balance in 2019-20-a budget that only this government could have been able to deliver following the financial wreckage of those opposite and the wreckage they left us with when they were last in government. That has enabled us to deliver the health services, the roads, the water infrastructure and the support for our farmers to respond to the drought in our rural and regional communities, to ensure we have been able to support our veterans and support the affordable medicines. We have the money in the budget because we are running a stronger economy, and it is no accident because our policies have been about lower taxes for businesses and households-taxes and relief that have been delivered and legislated by our government. Infrastructure is being built, delivered and rolled out over the next 10 years, as well-$77 billion worth-ensuring that we're diversifying our economy and opening up new markets. But the sort of revolution the leader of the Labor Party wants to bring about will change everything about our economy and how it is managed. There'll be higher taxes and big change for our economy if the Labor leader is elected-big change that Australia can't afford. National Integrity Commission",82
82,Mr SHORTEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. Given that the government has voted today to support the establishment of a National Integrity Commission, does the government actually support a National Integrity Commission? Yes or no?",82
83,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I refer the Leader of the Opposition to the answer given by the Attorney-General. The government has already been working on these matters for several months, and we are following our process through the cabinet process. That's how things should be done.  We're not going to engage in half-baked ideas from the opposition, whether it's what they're throwing around in this chamber or whether it's their new pink batteries claim. Remember pink batts? Now we've got pink batteries. That's what we've got from a Leader of the Opposition and a Labor Party who have learnt nothing during their time in opposition. All the failures of when they were last in government are just distant memories to them. They have haven't learnt a thing. They haven't learnt that if you",82
84,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Prime Minister will resume his seat. The Leader of the Opposition, on a point of order.",83
85,Mr Shorten,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,A point of order on direct relevance. The question was very specific: does the Prime Minister and the government support a National Integrity Commission? Yes or no?,83
86,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister has the call.,83
87,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I addressed the question. I said the cabinet has a process to deal with this measure in a way that is prudent, that is responsible, and that works through all the unintended consequences to make sure that we have a process that doesn't go around vilifying people who work for the public sector, whether they be journalists or public officials or anyone else. We have a calm, considered and mature approach to this issue. That's unlike the sort of wreckage and failed policies we saw from the Labor Party when they were last in office-everything from cash for clunkers to burning people's roofs down. We remember Labor's abominable failures when they were last in government, and so do the Australian people. They will wreak havoc on our economy. They will bring great changes to our economy which will put the economy at risk, whether it's $200 billion in higher taxes or taking the industrial relations system back to the 1970s. Under the Labor Party's industrial relations policies you'll need long hair and flares, because that's where they want to take industrial relations in this country-back to the days of conflict and division. You cannot lead a country that you only seek to divide, but that's the Leader of the Opposition's plan. Small Business",83
88,Mr EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer outline to the House how our government's economic policies are helping small businesses to grow and prosper, including in my electorate of Brisbane? Is the Treasurer aware of any alternative approaches that could harm this prosperity?",83
89,Mr FRYDENBERG,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Brisbane for his question. He strongly supports the more than 30,000 small businesses across his electorate, understanding that small business is the backbone of the Australian economy. There are 3.3 million small businesses, employing around 70 per cent of the private sector workforce, providing more than $300 billion a year in wages and salaries. I had the pleasure of last week visiting the member for Brisbane's electorate. Clayfield Seafood Markets have Nick and his 30 staff, including apprentices. He was benefiting from Liberal and National government policy, including the $20,000 instant asset write-off, which enabled him to purchase more equipment for his kitchen. Then there are our tax cuts for 3.3 million small businesses, our $300 million reduction in red tape and our expansion of the employee share ownership scheme to give people a stake in their business's growth story. The Prime Minister announced a change to payment terms to stop big business or government using small business as a bank. We will be the lead. We will ensure that all invoices under a million dollars will be paid from the government within 20 days. That's our commitment. We're looking for the states to follow suit and we also want big business to do so. Another major announcement we've made since the parliament has come back today is a $2 billion fund to increase small business access to finance to avoid a market failure and to enable smaller lenders and smaller banks to be able to provide more liquidity and more competitive terms to small business. There is, as well, a business growth fund, which will be absolutely critical in ensuring banks and other lenders can take passive equity stakes in small businesses if that is what the small business wants. At the end of the day, the Labor Party doesn't care about small business. And you know why? It's because it doesn't have a unionised workforce. That's the reality. The Labor Party ignores small business. We on this side of the House support small business. They are the farmers. They are the professionals. They are the tradespeople. They are the retailers. They are the backbone of the Australian economy. Their philosophical outlook is consistent with the Liberal and National parties' philosophical outlook, and we have put in place policies which ensure that small businesses are growing and employing more Australians. National Integrity Commission",83
90,Mr SHORTEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Prime Minister: Why did the government vote today to support a national integrity commission if it still hasn't decided whether it wants one? ,83
91,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," The government is considering its position through a normal cabinet process. When it comes to the issues, this is what responsible governments do. We are not opposed to measures which add and lift the integrity of the way government is administered in this country, and so we do not remain closed to those options and will be considering a range of options about what is the best way to go forward. But it says something about this Leader of the Opposition that, of the issues that he wants to bring into this chamber, when it comes to families and small businesses that are struggling to deal with getting access to finance or families that are dealing with electricity prices, the issues that he wants to raise don't relate to these. He doesn't want to come in here and talk about what is already his failed pink batteries policy-just a reheat of the failed policies that were happening the last time they were in government. He doesn't want to come here and talk about, explain or ask questions about what would be the impact of putting a 45 per cent reckless target on emissions reduction which would put in place a carbon price 10 times worse than the carbon tax that we had to abolish when we came to government. He doesn't want to talk about the higher subsidies that he wants to give to big electricity companies paid for by Australians, who will have to pay higher taxes as a result of what the Leader of the Opposition wants to inflict on the Australian economy. While the Leader of the Opposition is off on some sort of fringe issue, what we're focused on is the strength of our economy because that's what delivers the services, Medicare, disability insurance, support for veterans, Defence Force support-that's what delivers it. The Leader of the Opposition likes to come in and talk about anything under the sun other than what makes an economy stronger, because, when it comes to managing the economy, the Leader of the Opposition has no clue. What he plans to do for the economy is bring in the wrecking ball of a big change, a chaotic change: policies that will disrupt the smooth running of our economy, that will put Medicare at risk, that will put hospital funding at risk and that will put education funding and schools funding at risk-just like it did when they had to not list affordable medicines because they'd run out of money because they'd spent it all. You cannot trust Labor on the economy, and that's why you cannot trust them on Medicare, schools and hospitals. Climate Change",84
92,Mr BANDT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister: This Friday, many thousands of students across the country will go on strike from school, calling for emergency action on climate change. These brave and courageous kids are joining young people around the world who are angry at the failure of governments, including yours, to secure their future",84
93,Mr MCCormack,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,They should be in class. Are you supporting that?,84
94,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Melbourne will pause. The Deputy Prime Minister will cease interjecting. Don't have any hesitation: I'll take action if I'm ignored. The member for Melbourne will begin his question again.,84
95,Mr BANDT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister: This Friday, many thousands of students across the country will go on strike from school, calling for emergency action on climate change. These brave and courageous kids are joining young people around the world, who are angry at the failure of governments, including yours, to secure their future from global warming. Prime Minister, will you join me in praising these students for having a go, and will you meet with and listen to these kids, who are demanding action from your government to keep coal in the ground?",84
96,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Climate change is a very real and serious issue which demands the attention of governments at all levels. It has the attention of this government, through the Emissions Reduction Fund, the renewable energy target, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, our Snowy 2.0 initiative, energy efficiency measures, and our commitment to 26 per cent of an emissions reduction target, which we remain committed to. We're committed to all of these things. But I'll tell you what we're also committed to: kids should go to school. That's what we're committed to. We don't support the idea of kids not going to school, to participate in things that can be dealt with outside of school. Each day, I send my kids to school, and I know other members' kids should also go to school. But we do not support our schools being turned into parliaments. We think kids should be in school learning, whether it's about those issues or maths, science, English, literature, Indigenous history, Australian history. That's what they should be there doing. And so what we want is more learning in schools and less activism in schools. NA The SPEAKER (14:36): I'd like to inform the House that we have joining us in the gallery this afternoon a parliamentary delegation from Poland, accompanied by the ambassador. On behalf of the House, I extend a very warm welcome to you all. Honourable members: Hear, hear!  NA Economy Mrs WICKS (Robertson) (14:37): My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer outline to the House how the government is ensuring the economic security of all Australians, particularly older Australians in my electorate of Robertson, who have saved for their retirement? Is the Treasurer aware of any higher taxing alternatives?",84
97,Mr FRYDENBERG,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Robertson for her question. I know that she supports a strong economy, because a strong economy provides the services and the support for our senior Australians, including in her electorate of Robertson. The Australian economy's growing strongly-3.4 per cent growth through the year, its fastest rate since the height of the mining boom, with unemployment falling to five per cent, its lowest rate since 2012. Wages are starting to rise, as the Reserve Bank of Australia predicted, with their biggest jump in three years. Australia's AAA credit rating was reaffirmed by the leading rating agencies, and the budget is on track to come back to balance. That doesn't happen by accident. The Australian economy doesn't operate by autopilot. It has been the difficult, hard decisions that the Liberal and National parties in government have taken. And this is enabling us to support senior Australians through the pension work bonus, which allows them to keep the pension but also to earn up to $300 extra a fortnight, and by allowing senior Australians to downsize their home and put additional money into super. That is what we are doing to support senior Australians. But those opposite have a different plan for retirees and senior Australians. They have a plan to increase their taxes-a new retirees tax, a $45 billion tax grab from Australian retirees. As a result of Labor's policy, 900,000 individuals will be worse off, and 200,000 self-managed super funds and the holders of those will be worse off as a result of Labor's policy. On average, if you've got a self-managed super fund, you'll be $12,000 worse off under Labor's policy. If you're an individual with these franking credits, you'll be $2,200 a year worse off as result of Labor's policy. What's more, 84 per cent of those people who are currently getting the benefit of those franked dividends have a taxable income under $37,000-under $37,000! There are 300,000 of those people in Labor-held electorates. What about the 8,000 in the seat of Canberra, the 7,900 in Jagajaga, the 7,600 in Melbourne Ports and the 7,400 in Cunningham? They're all going to be worse off as a result of Labor's policy. Simon Crean, who was the then shadow Treasury spokesman for Labor, said of the government's changes, back in 2000: … it improves the current taxation situation faced by low income investors … These people have now been ignored by the Labor Party and left out of the benefits that they should enjoy. National Integrity Commission",85
98,Mr SHORTEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. As the Prime Minister believes that a national integrity commission is a 'fringe issue', why has he told the House today that his government has been working on it for months? Why did his government vote for a national integrity commission today if he thinks it's a 'fringe issue'?",85
99,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," This is a government that is able to deal with many, many issues. We'll continue to cover the field in the interest of all Australians. What's quite clear is we're yet to see a policy from those opposite that would do anything useful for the economy. That's why, as a result, Australians do not trust this Leader of the Opposition. It's been five years now. For five years they've had a good look at this Leader of the Opposition, and, after five years, they're not buying this Leader of the Opposition, because they know they cannot trust the leader of the Labor Party to run a strong economy. Water Infrastructure Mr O'DOWD (Flynn-Deputy Nationals Whip) (14:42): My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development. Will the minister update the House on how a strong economy allows the government to build better water infrastructure, back our farmers and help regional Australia grow? What are the risks for farmers from different approaches?",85
100,Mr MCCORMACK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Riverina-Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development and Leader of The Nationals) (14:42): Picture this: last Monday the member for Flynn and I were at a press conference, and in the background was the beautiful harbour at Gladstone. What a busy and industrious place that is. There were ships there, cranes there, workers in high-vis there-it was a picture to behold. Mr Rob Mitchell interjecting",85
101,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for MCEwen will cease interjecting! ,85
102,Mr MCCORMACK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It was an absolute picture to behold. And we-the Liberals and Nationals-want to make it an even busier harbour. We want to make it an even more industrious port. That's why, at that press conference, we announced half a billion dollars of extra money for the National Water Infrastructure Development Fund. The previous day, the member for Flynn and I were on a red, rocky, windswept ridge at Emerald. Picture this-I'm giving you great picture of what it was like: there we were, with Alan Stent-Smith, turning the first sod for a wonderful project-an inland port-taking in those rail and road logistics. What a wonderful project that will be. The minister for agriculture, the members of the National Party, the Libs-we all understand that to grow better food and more fibre, the very best in the world, all you need to do is add more water. That's why we're investing in flood mitigation projects, droughtproofing projects and projects that are going to store more water. This is so great for regional Australia. I know how onboard the member for Flynn is. Projects such as modernising the Fairbairn Dam at Emerald and helping to examine agricultural opportunities in the Burnett –these things have been championed by the member for Flynn and the member for Wide Bay. We're getting on. We are delivering. It's going to create more wealth, a better future and more jobs in regional Australia, but, indeed, it is good for the nation. That's why we're getting on and we're doing it. I'm asked by the member for Flynn: what are the risks against this? I see them right before me. They're not in favour. Mr Fitzgibbon interjecting",86
103,Mr MCCORMACK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I can hear the member for Hunter. Why would you be yelling out about us investing $500 million in more water-storage infrastructure? What would you have against that? I just don't understand that. You know what? People in regional Australia don't understand why you're not in favour of those things either. They do not understand. We're getting on and we're building it. You can point to the projects that we're getting on and building, such as the Rookwood Weir in the member for Capricornia's electorate-$176.1 million working with the Queensland government. We're prepared to work with state governments that want to work with us. The Scottsdale Irrigation Scheme in Tasmania-$25.27 million. It's good investment, it's going to create more jobs and you can do it because we've got a strong economy. That's when you can get on and build these things. When you've got a strong economy, you can do these things-you can build, you can develop, and you can increase wealth, prosperity and jobs. (Time expired) Prime Minister",86
104,Mr DREYFUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister voted against the banking royal commission 26 times before claiming it was his idea. He supported the National Energy Guarantee before opposing it. Now, he's voted for a national integrity commission without being able to say whether or not he supports it! How can Australians know when this Prime Minister is actually committed to something or if he's just pretending?",86

107,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I'm not going to be lectured on integrity by the Labor Party-the party of Sam Dastyari, the party of Craig Thomson, the party of Eddie Obeid, the party of Ian Macdonald, the party of Joe Tripodi, the party of WA Inc. This is the only political party in Australia that can open up branches in prisons, because they've got enough people in them from being convicted of corrupt conduct, which has sent them to prison. This is a Labor Party that know all about muck because they live their lives in it. That's the Labor Party that Australians have got to know over the last few decades and more-whether it was Rex Jackson all those years ago, going all the way through to Eddie Obeid. Mr Burke interjecting",86

We remember you going there, going: 'I just went there. We didn't really know. We're not that close. I just went down there to spend a bit of time at Eddie's place.' The Labor Party when it comes to integrity? Give me a break!",86

110,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Members on my left! The member for Gorton's already been warned.  Economy Mrs PRENTICE (Ryan) (14:47): My question is to the Minister for Women and Minister for Jobs and Industrial Relations. Will the minister please update the House on what action the government is taking to improve economic security for women and what attitudes to economic management would undermine their success?,86
111,Ms ODWYER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Higgins-Minister for Women and Minister for Jobs and Industrial Relations) (14:48): I thank the member for Ryan for her question. She knows, like every member of this side of the chamber, that when women do well, their families do well, and when their families do well, our nation and our economy prosper. That is why the coalition government delivered last week the first Women's Economic Security Statement. It includes practical measures that focus on ensuring more participation for those that want to join the workforce, increasing women's earning potential and ensuring their greater economic independence. One such measure is the flexibility of the government funded parental-leave payment. We know that there are more than 2,300 families that miss out on the government funded parental-leave payment because of the lack of flexibility. It is too rigid right now. You can't say to all families, 'You must only take it as 18 weeks.' You should instead give them the flexibility to make decisions that are right for them and their families, and that is precisely what we have done. In our measure, you can take 12 weeks up-front, but the next six weeks you can take as blocks or as one day at a time. This helps those women-particularly those women who are in charge and who run small businesses-allowing them to be able to return to work knowing that they have financial support behind them to make the decisions that are right for them and their families. It builds on the government's achievements to date. It builds on the fact that we have seen more women in work than ever before, and more women in full time work than ever before. And, as the Prime Minister quite rightly pointed out, under our government we have seen a reduction in the gender pay gap. It's down from 17.2 per cent under the previous Labor government to 14.5 per cent under us. That is still too large, but it's heading in the right direction. Sadly, those opposite simply pay lip-service to women's economic security. They refuse to get on with practical measures that will actually support women in building their financial security. They should support the government's catch-up contributions when it comes to women's superannuation payments and tax deductions, so that those people-no matter who employs them and no matter how they're employed-are able to have a level playing field in achieving their financial security through their superannuation. But those opposite have said that they would, in fact, scrap the catch-up contributions. They should stop the rorts and the rip-offs in the superannuation sector. That would add $2.5 billion to women's economic security, but, instead, they are opposing this. And, of course, they have their mega retirees tax that would hurt women the most. Thirty per cent more women will be impacted by that regressive tax. (Time expired) Prime Minister",87
112,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is addressed to the Prime Minister, and I refer to various answers he has given in this chamber to, 'Why isn't Malcolm Turnbull still the Prime Minister of Australia?'

The question went to that",88
123,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I don't need you to repeat every question you've asked; that's okay.,88
124,Mr Albanese,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, no, I'm just referring to the number of occasions on which it's been asked. That part of the question is certainly in order. I think he might want to have the opportunity to clear the air about the second part on why he lost his job.",88

The Leader of the House?  that questions that have a fig leaf of relevance-or in this case, a small tree frond of relevance-should not therefore be in order when the rest of the question is quite clearly not in order, and is really, in this case, designed to be a smear as opposed to a question.",88
127,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That's right. I'm glad that the member for Grayndler concedes that part of the question wasn't in order.,88

130,Mr CREWTHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Energy. Will the minister update the House on how the government's plan to lower power prices is supporting households and backing small business, including in my electorate of Dunkley? Is the minister aware of the impact of any alternative approaches?",88
131,Mr TAYLOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Dunkley for his question. He knows that this government's priority when it comes to energy policy is getting electricity prices down while we keep the lights on. That's why we're cracking down on the big energy companies' rip-offs, it's why we're creating a price safety net for customers and it's why we're underwriting new, reliable, 24/7 generation and pressuring energy retailers to make sure they have the supply in place years ahead of time to meet demand. Our pressure on energy companies is already yielding results. We've seen that AGL will protect customers on standing offers by implementing a price safety net from 1 January, which means more than 150,000 families and 27,000 small businesses will be better off. There are 150,000 households and 27,000 small businesses that will get a better deal across Victoria and New South Wales. Standing offer customers will get 10 per cent price cuts, with similarly large price cuts in other states. This shows that our policies are working. We're already yielding results. We've also seen interventions in gas networks, with prices down by up to 50 per cent. We're reining in the power of the network companies. If Labor had done this earlier, they would have saved Australian households $6 billion. That is $6 billion for Australian households that was left on the table. The member asked about alternatives. The Labor Party's reckless 45 per cent emissions reduction target will be a wrecking ball through our economy. It will hurt our manufacturing sector and our agriculture sector. It'll hurt our smelters, our refineries, our farmers and our transport industry. Which industry does the Leader of the Opposition want to shut down first? Is it aluminium smelting? Is it refining? Is it cement factories? Is it fertiliser factories? Is it the beef industry? Which regions does he want to shut down first? Is it Gladstone? The member for Flynn might have something to say about that. Is it Portland? The member for Wannon might have something to say about that. Is it Tomago? The member for Paterson should have something to say about that. Meanwhile, those opposite are sitting on the side of the big energy companies, throwing $15 billion worth of subsidies at the big energy companies while they refuse to support us on legislation to crack down on dodgy practices-legislation which they haven't even seen. We sit on the side of energy consumers. They sit on the side of the energy companies. (Time expired) Victorian State Election",88
132,Mr MARLES,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. On Saturday the people of Victoria rejected the Liberal Party's record on cuts to schools, hospitals and infrastructure. What lessons has the federal government learnt from Victoria? Ms Henderson interjecting",88

134,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," They're very cocky over there today, aren't they? They're very cocky-very, very cocky. The Leader of the Opposition's got that cocky swagger again as he's walking around. The unions are feeling pretty cocky too about what they'll be able to get the Leader of the Opposition to do if he ever occupies this side of the House. I congratulate the Premier of Victoria on his election. I said so on the night. I texted him on the night and I congratulated him. And I'll tell you why I did: because in Victoria an incumbent premier who has been presiding over a strong economy, which has enabled him to deliver services and infrastructure which the people of Victoria have clearly respected-a premier who was favoured to his opponent-has been re-elected. It is an incumbent government running a strong economy with a preferred premier and delivering services and infrastructure for the people they're intended to serve. Who does that sound like? Our government is running a strong economy. Our government is delivering infrastructure and services that the Australian people respect and want more of. Our government has a plan to continue that.",89

136,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As we listen to the jeers and the guffaws of an arrogant and out-of-touch opposition, they've put the cue in the rack. They think they're already there. They think they can do whatever they want. I'll never forget what Peter Garrett said back before the 2007 election. We all remember it. While they were all trying to pretend there wouldn't be anything dramatic, that they would just be John Howard-lite if Kevin Rudd were elected, Peter Garrett let the cat out of the bag when he said, 'We'll change it all.' That's what the Leader of the Opposition's plan is. That's what the Labor Party's plan is. They want to change it all. That means the economy. That means the very things that Australians depend on for their jobs and livelihoods. You won't hear from the opposition plans to support small and family businesses. You won't hear plans to ensure that we increase female workforce participation in this country. You won't hear that. What you'll see from the Labor Party is them taking the law-breakers in the union movement and turning them into lawmakers on their very benches. This is a cocky and arrogant leader of the Labor Party who thinks the job is already done. That's not our view. We will fight him every day to the next election because he will destroy our economy. Defence Procurement",89
137,Mr RAMSEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Defence. Will the minister update the House on how the government's strong economic management allows us to protect our service men and women through investments in the capabilities they need, and what different approaches might put this investment at risk?  his question. In the last few weeks we've made some very significant announcements and begun some very important projects in the defence industry and the defence sector. For example, a couple of weeks ago, we began construction of the Arafura class offshore patrol vessels at Osborne-12 offshore patrol vessels, the first two to be built at Osborne in Adelaide and the next 10 to be built in Henderson in Western Australia. It's a $3.5 billion to $4 billion project. The Prime Minister cut steel at Henderson about six weeks ago and about a fortnight ago we began construction of the first of the offshore patrol vessels at Osborne in South Australia. A couple of Fridays ago, I travelled out to Edinburgh and announced that we would acquire 12 to 16 reaper unmanned, remotely piloted aircraft UAVs, weaponised to give us the capability to take out targets on the ground from seven kilometres in the air, protecting our service men and women from danger, at a cost of $1 billion to $2 million. In the last month, we opened the bricks and mortar that represents the Naval Shipbuilding College at Osborne, a spoke-and-hub college that will use all the resources available to us around Australia to create the skilled workforce that we need, the thousands and thousands of workers that are needed-from tradesmen right through to engineers-because of this government's investments in the shipbuilding and submarine-building projects of the future. So we are investing in our capability with the largest build-up of our military in our peacetime history. Why are we able to do that? Why are we able to invest $200 billion in our military capability build-up across our nation? It's because of our management of the budget and the economy. If you don't have a growing economy bringing in the revenue, if you don't manage your budget in the way that we have been doing in the last five years where we have slowed the rate of growth of spending that existed under the Labor Party, you are not be able to invest in major military capability build-up. We know what happened the last time that Labor got into office in 2007. We know what happened last time. The first casualty of their spending cuts to fund their profligate programs was defence. They saw defence as a honey pot where they could go and cut constantly, even to the point that we had our lowest spending on our defence since 1938-the lowest level since the last year of appeasement. It was the lowest level under Labor. The highest level under the- (Time expired)  Victorian State Election Ms CATHERINE KING (Ballarat) (15:05): My question is to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister tell the parliament more about how Saturday was such a ringing endorsement of his government's policies?",89
138,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Again, all I note is the hubris and the arrogance of the Labor Party. Premier Andrews won the election in Victoria, not you. That's who won the election in Victoria. Premier Andrews won the election in Victoria. We have worked with Premier Andrews over the last number of years. We have our differences, but there's no doubt that at the election on the weekend they chose to return the incumbent government of Victoria. I congratulate Premier Andrews on that result. Why wouldn't you, Mr Speaker? That is a significant achievement with an increased majority. In Victoria, unemployment is at 4½ per cent. That is lower than the national average. In Victoria, we have been delivering record investment in infrastructure with the Victorian government. An opposition member interjecting",90

142,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It was the same when the Premier of Tasmania, Will Hodgman, was re-elected in Tasmania. It was the same when Premier Palaszczuk was re-elected in Queensland. People elected not to change their governments in each of those states. In South Australia they did choose to make the change. What is the Labor Party saying about that at a federal level? The truth is: if you want to win an election at a federal level-there's no state premier on the ballot. It is for the members who sit in this House. You can't go around relying on the achievements of a state government to prop up the failed policies of federal Labor. At the next election, there will be a choice. There will be a choice between the Liberal and the National parties, who stand for a stronger economy and who have the proven track record on keeping Australians safe; and, on the other side, the opposition-the Labor Party-who want to put $200 billion of higher taxes on people's jobs, savings, incomes and retirement and throw a big, wet blanket on the economy, which puts Medicare, disability services and affordable medicines at risk. There will be a choice at the next election, and it won't be involving any Premier of any of the states. It will be between me and you. City Deals",90
143,Ms FLINT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Cities, Urban Infrastructure and Population. Will the minister update the House on the progress of the government's City Deals and how they are bringing together local and state governments to unlock the potential of cities around Australia? Are there any alternative opinions that would jeopardise this progress?",90
144,Mr TUDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Aston-Minister for Cities, Urban Infrastructure and Population) (15:08): I thank the member for Boothby for her question and also for her commitment to the Adelaide City Deal. Indeed, just last Thursday I was in Adelaide, where I met with the Premier and the local mayors to discuss what the shape of an Adelaide City Deal might look like. We hope to sign that deal within the next few months. In the four weeks since the last sitting week in parliament we've rapidly progressed the government's City Deals agenda. As members would know, these deals are agreements with all three levels of government to make our cities more livable and to turbocharge local economies. We've already signed three City Deals and indeed are implementing those three. They have been the Townsville City Deal, the Launceston City Deal and the massive Western Sydney City Deal, which is centred around the Western Sydney Airport, which we are building. In the last four weeks, we've signed two more City Deals. First, the Prime Minister joined me, the member for Corangamite and the member for Wannon in announcing our commitment to the Geelong City Deal, which is a $154 million commitment to support the tourism economy in Geelong and all the way along the Great Ocean Road. Members might not appreciate that, outside of Melbourne, the Great Ocean Road and Geelong is actually the most visited part of Australia from a tourism perspective, but a lot of the infrastructure does need to be upgraded. We have made this huge investment and, consequently, will be completely rebuilding a new visitorcentre precinct at the Twelve Apostles. There will also be a redevelopment of the public spaces in Lorne, Apollo Bay and Skenes Creek; a brand new tourism walk along the Great Ocean Road; a new convention centre in the heart of Geelong; and so many other things . This was a deal that the Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said would boost business, boost tourism and boost jobs, and that is exactly right.  We then went up to Darwin, where the Prime Minister, the Chief Minister and the Darwin lord mayor signed the Darwin City Deal, which is a $200 million 10-year commitment to revitalise the CBD of Darwin. Our major commitment there is a huge investment to create a brand new university precinct in the heart of the CBD for 11,000 students to be in the centre of the CBD-to study there and to therefore spill out onto the streets and purchase things at the local restaurants and businesses. There are also green spaces, an Indigenous precinct, a new art gallery, the redevelopment of the harbour foreshore precinct and so many other things. This is a fantastic deal. We'll soon be announcing the Hobart City Deal, too. I'm asked about alternatives. Of all the work that the Labor Party have done, their main big development in the City Deal precincts is to change the name from City Deal to city partnership. (Time expired)",90

Question agreed to.",91
147,The SPEAKER,STATEMENTS,"Before I call the honourable member for Wentworth, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's first speech. I ask the House to extend to her the usual courtesies.",91
148,Dr PHELPS,STATEMENTS," It is an honour and a privilege to address this House today as the new member for Wentworth, and I thank the people of my electorate for the trust that they have placed in me to represent them. I want to speak today about the journey that brought me here and the truly special people that I want to acknowledge and thank, and to offer some reflections on the path ahead for our nation and the parliament's role in forging that future. Wentworth is a diverse and harmonious community. We hear a lot about the harbourside mansions, but the reality is that many people in Wentworth live in apartments, often renting their homes. They come from myriad backgrounds from all over the world. Wentworth has one of the largest Jewish communities in Australia: many families fleeing here from Europe around the time of the Second World War; others coming from Russia or South Africa. There are the surfers, the yachties, the young families, the retirees, the business men and women and a large gay community. Wentworth is home to some of the wealthiest people in Australia, but there are also those who struggle to make ends meet and the marginalised and dispossessed who live on the fringes of society.  I've been a general practitioner in my electorate for almost 20 years. I have the privilege of seeing it from a profoundly human perspective. I've helped to deliver my constituents' babies. I've guided them through cancer diagnosis and treatment. I've grieved with them for the loss of loved ones. I've helped them wrestle with depression, and I've celebrated their happy news. A career in general practice grounds you in reality like no other profession possibly can. It is a career that deals with life and death and all that lies in between. It is a career where what really matters in the world is presented to you every single day. As a doctor, I was trained to examine evidence and to draw careful conclusions. Doctors are presented with symptoms. We arrange appropriate investigations. We diagnose the problem, devise a management plan and see that plan through to a resolution. And we know when to call on a specialist for expert advice. Every decision we make must address the fundamental question: what will this mean for this person's human experience? This is the template for the human-centric approach I bring to the job of parliamentarian and member for Wentworth. Extraordinary events, personal and political, have coalesced to bring me here to take my seat amongst you in the House of Representatives at a unique time in Australian political history. I bring to this House a wealth of life experience as a doctor, a businesswoman, an author, a mother, a grandmother, a health advocate, and a marriage equality and social justice advocate. It is through this multifocal lens that I view the contribution I'm able to make in whatever time. I might be granted in this role. I have a strong belief in the principle of secular government. That said, it is a great honour for me to know that I am the first woman of the Jewish faith to be elected to the Australian parliament. I am Jewish by choice, rather than by birth, having converted later in life, about 20 years ago. This was a very conscious decision, and I bring this spiritual framework to my personal and my professional life. It is also a great honour to know I am the first woman to be elected to represent Wentworth in its 117-year history. While I stand here as an individual, I do not stand here alone. My journey to this place has come with the help of some amazing people. First, my family: my wife, Jackie Stricker-Phelps, as always, and quite literally, my other half-my partner in life, in love, in business, in parenting and in activism. To my children, Jaime, Carl and Gabi; my son-in-law, Rob; my grandson, Billy; the extended Stricker family; and our close friends, who have been there to give us strength and courage when we most needed backup: my love and gratitude. Of course, there's the army of volunteers who stepped up to help in my campaign for election. For almost every one of them, it was their first ever experience of an election campaign, and they brought a passion and a commitment and a belief that saw us make history. There were those who stood in the wind and the rain at pre-polls, or manned our pop-up campaign office, or even turned up to go door-knocking on crutches. It was the very essence of grassroots community politics. In particular, I thank our campaign chair, Wendy MCCarthy, my longtime friend, who naturally adopted the role of den mother for our campaign team. My own story began, as it does with all of us, with the prelude of my forebears. It is through the experiences and the stories of our parents and grandparents that we learn the lessons that inform our adult lives. My own family's history is a snapshot of the struggle of Australia's previous generations, who forged the path to create the opportunities for those who came after. It is also a reminder of the lasting legacy that we leave to our future generations. My grandparents were all born in Australia and made their homes in Sydney's western suburbs. My mother's mother was raised in an orphanage from the age of six, after her mother died in childbirth. She worked night shifts in a factory. My mother's father left school at the age of nine or 10, around the time of the outbreak of the First World War, and he headed north to ride boundary fences with his older brothers. My paternal grandfather, Thomas Phelps, was a carpenter. As a child, he told me, he would ride his bicycle into the city during the Depression to pick up rations to feed his family. Too old to enlist in the Second World War and unable to find work, he headed to the goldmines in the New Guinea Highlands, where he worked to earn money to send back to his family in Punchbowl, where my grandmother was caring for their four surviving children. When the war in the Pacific broke out, my grandfather was stranded in New Guinea. He was believed to have been killed during the Japanese invasion, but he had managed to escape on foot with other civilians. Trudging through treacherous jungle and mountain terrain, followed by a dangerous sea journey by raft and canoe across the Torres Strait, he eventually arrived back in Australia. You could say that I come from resourceful and resilient stock. My parents, George and Shirley Phelps, moved to the northern beaches of Sydney so that they could enjoy the Aussie beach lifestyle and so my father could be active in surf lifesaving. During my early years, my parents instilled in me the values of diligence, perseverance, integrity, hard work and financial prudence. Participation, the pursuit of excellence, a love of the outdoors, involvement in sport and lifelong learning also underpinned my childhood. I grew up in a culture of community engagement-of volunteering-and both of my parents were awarded an Order of Australia for contributions to their community.  Education was a strong theme in my childhood, fuelled by my own parents' lack of opportunity for advanced education. I attended our local state schools-Newport Primary School and Pittwater High School. Through high school, once I was old enough to work, I always held two or three jobs. That became my normal. I was the first in my family to go to university. In fact, I was the first in my family to finish high school. I decided on a career in medicine at a time when the Commonwealth funded university tuition fees. During my final year of medical school I married my high school boyfriend, Michael, and in the following year, 1981, I graduated from the University of Sydney; I had just turned 23. That same year, during my internship, I had my first child, Jaime. My son, Carl, was born two years later when I was a senior resident. So I had a very early insight into the challenges of managing parenting and work. My daughter, Jaime, is now a dietician and Carl is passionate about his work in aged care. It's probably no coincidence that they both ended up in healthcare fields, and I'm so proud of the adults that they have become. I bought my first medical practice when I was 27, and around that time. I also started working in the media. At the time, health promotion was a completely unknown new field-making health information accessible and understandable through mainstream media. The established medical profession at the time didn't approve of doctors working in the media, but the aim of improving health outcomes through health literacy was worth fighting for. At one stage, I worked at the ABC on a television series called EveryBody. Those years reinforced my determination for the ABC to be fiercely protected as our independent news broadcaster, free of political interference, and our national storyteller, helping to articulate the Australian identity. My first marriage ended in 1993. Four years later I met Jackie, and the following year we married in a religious ceremony in New York. On our return from the US, we were 'outed' by a Sunday tabloid newspaper. That word, 'outed', seems almost quaint and anachronistic now, but it was a feared and dangerous weapon back then. We could have chosen to hide, to wait for it to blow over, but that is not in either of our DNAs. Instead, we resolutely began our long battle for marriage equality. We sacrificed our personal privacy and Jackie her teaching career. We became accidental activists. I was already involved in medical politics, and just a year later I was elected president of the Australian Medical Association, first at state level and then for the federal AMA-the first woman to hold this position. It was an enormous privilege to represent the medical profession and to advocate for our health system during those years, which took me not only to Canberra but to most parts of Australia, including our cities, country towns and remote Aboriginal communities, to gain an understanding of the seemingly insurmountable pressures they were facing. I believed it was important to interweave public health and health promotion principles into the fabric of the AMA's core business, and for our policies to consider first and foremost the effects on our patients and their experience of the health system. We were facing an urgent threat in the medical indemnity crisis, with the future of several medical specialties, like obstetrics and neurosurgery, in doubt. We worked with members of the Howard government and state and territory governments to forge a complicated but, ultimately, successful solution. During my presidency, the AMA developed its first position statements on complementary medicine; on sexuality and gender diversity; and on the medical response to bioterrorism. For the first time, the medical profession formally joined the dots between the human cause of climate change and its human cost. We investigated problems in aged care and mental health. We advocated strongly for refugee children to be removed from detention and for a solution to the problems of health disparity and disadvantage for Indigenous Australians. My philosophy was then, as it is now, that the human experience must be at the heart of political decisions being made about health policy and health economics. Fifteen years on, these remain hot-button issues for our health system and for our national agenda. One issue that has arisen over the past decade-and there is no more important current issue for the future integrity of our public health system and the doctor-patient relationship than this-is of the security and privacy of personal health records. The people and the parliament must be confident beyond doubt that the rules and governance surrounding the centralised medical-records database are absolutely secure. It's better that we go slowly or not proceed at all rather than get it wrong and suffer the consequences. I will explain what I mean about the human experience. Government policies impact on people's lives positively or adversely. Human-centred government policy starts with the question: how will this impact on the quality of life of the people this policy affects? It goes without saying that we need outcome measures like a balanced budget and productive capacity and economic growth. I've owned and operated businesses for over 30 years, so I get this. I understand the risks and pressures of start-ups; the struggle to survive economically in the early stages; and the decision-making algorithms that determine whether a business will expand or not, employ  more people or not, invest in Australian enterprise or not. Government policies shift these decisions not based on the numbers but on sentiments like confidence in the future. It's also important for governments to frame policies that address the concerns of young people wanting to buy a home, raise a family, make decisions about the education of their children and manage their household budgets. Older Australians worry about protecting their retirement incomes and how to face old age with the confidence that they'll be able to get the care they need. Human-centred outcomes require us to think how policies will affect real people living real lives with an additional set of outcome measures: well-being, happiness, child development, optimism, job satisfaction, community harmony, being able to afford to rent or buy a home, the right to privacy, freedom of choice, a sense of security, and feeling respected and valued for who you are. Climate change has been described as the greatest moral, greatest political, greatest social and greatest public health challenge of our time. The time to take action is now. There can be no excuses for continuing climate change policy paralysis. Look at the symptoms, examine the evidence, turn to the experts. The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report warns of the catastrophic consequences of continuing down the current path of global warming. This is not about the numbers; it is about the people. We have to think about the human experience that will result from failure to take action: the imminent disappearance of island nations like Kiribati or Tuvalu, altered food supplies, drought, floods and increases in water-borne and insect-borne diseases. The people most likely to be vulnerable to the effects of climate change will be children, the poor, the sick and the elderly. We have an abundance of raw materials for renewable energy: sun, wind and water. What we are running out of are excuses for failing to act. We have to make sure we have a carefully planned, orderly transition to the renewable energy economy. What we do in this House, what we decide here, creates the world of our grandchildren. We all have a responsibility to them. It's not only our own children and grandchildren who matter and whose lives we have the power to impact. The stories of Jackie's parents, Alfred and Jutta, who escaped the Holocaust as children, as well as the stories of my patients and their families, who have escaped from areas of conflict all around the world, have impacted me deeply. I cannot be an idle bystander to the reports of the shocking mental and physical state of children held on Nauru, helpless victims of Australia's offshore processing policy. Australia's treatment of asylum seekers is a source of shame and sorrow for me and for many thousands of my medical colleagues and other Australians. This cruel treatment of asylum seekers asking Australia for help-to return to my earlier theme-ignores the human experience at the heart of policies of offshore processing and indefinite confinement on Manus Island and Nauru. No longer can we tolerate our government holding the lives of these children and their families to ransom to make a point about maritime arrivals. Yes, we need strong border protection. But it is not, and must not be, a choice between deaths at sea and indefinite offshore confinement. There is a mismatch between what the people of Australia want and what the Australian government has been doing, and this must be resolved. We must find a compassionate compromise. While the treatment of asylum seekers calls for urgent attention, we must also focus on Australians in vulnerable situations. This must begin with Indigenous Australians. How can it be that in this nation of opportunity being born Indigenous still means being born into disadvantage, and still means that our First Nations people are more likely to be sicker and poorer, to die younger, to suffer more mental health problems and to be incarcerated more than non-Indigenous Australians? What are we not learning, not seeing, not hearing? Together, surely, we can find a way to address the unforgivable and growing disparity between the Indigenous and the nonIndigenous experience. The Closing the Gap strategy must be fundamentally reworked because it is not working. The logical next step is Indigenous recognition in the Constitution. So, too, we must get our policy settings right on our response to family violence and to the murder, on average one each week, of a woman by her current or former partner. One woman every week! We must get the policy settings right on the tens of thousands of children living in out-of-home care, because their homes are not safe for them. I know that system well. Our youngest daughter, Gabi, who is now 19, came into our lives through the child protection system, initially as a foster placement, almost 10 years ago, when our lives took another unexpected turn. On her behalf, Jackie and I became advocates for children in foster care, leading us to contribute to the change in adoption laws in New South Wales to allow same-sex couples to adopt in advance of marriage equality. At that time, and still today, adoption of Australian children is rare and the process is prohibitive. It took a bipartisan conscience vote in the New South Wales parliament to change the lives of many children and families. That security enabled Gabi to thrive, completing high school last year as head girl of her school and now studying commerce/law at the University of Sydney. She makes me proud of her every day. For children like her, I am pleased to see progress on a national approach to adoption reform. It is so important to those children to have the security that they so deserve.  The protracted battle for marriage equality in Australia had my constant attention for the better part of 20 years. As time went by, and for many years, I saw at close quarters the dysfunctionality of the two-party political system that was able to deny my wife and me and thousands of other Australians the right to equality under the law. The political was again very personal. Political decisions were deeply affecting our lives, our human experience. Unlike the New South Wales adoption reform, federal parliamentarians were repeatedly denied a conscience vote. As advocates, Jackie and I were fortunate in that we had a voice. But there were also the frustrations of seeing this reform voted down time after time in the name of party politics. Politicians who I knew privately to be supporters of equality were forced by their parties to publicly speak out against their own conscience and beliefs, putting their party before the people or the principle, failing to understand or not caring about the human experience that would result from their politicking and deal-making. This was one of the most important influences on my determination to stand as an Independent. Along the way we saw the removal of more than 85 discriminatory federal laws, but the vision of marriage equality remained elusive until 7 December last year when we sat upstairs here in the gallery to witness the history-making vote, which instantaneously transformed the lives of countless thousands of Australians. All parties finally granted a conscience vote on this issue. As the overwhelming majority of parliamentarians in this House finally voted for this life-changing human rights reform, we celebrated and we sang, 'I am, you are, we are Australian.' And for that brief and magnificent moment in time it really did feel that we were one as a nation. Why couldn't that be our new normal? Let me pay tribute to all the dedicated campaigners, their supporters and allies who fought for marriage equality for so long. Then, on the heels of the traumatic and damaging postal survey campaign on marriage equality, we were plunged into yet another debate about our human rights-this time the rights of religious organisations to expel students or sack teachers because they are gay, lesbian or transgender. I believe that our federal parliament should be turning its attention to eliminating all forms of prejudice for all people, not turning its energies to finding new ways of entrenching discrimination and alienation. And then Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, my predecessor as member for Wentworth, was removed-still without explanation-triggering a by-election. He was a popular local member, and the shockwaves reverberated around the electorate and around the country. Enough was enough. No longer could I stand by as a commentator from the sidelines. This was my time to step up. I realised my chances of winning the by-election were slim. Some said it would take a miracle-indeed, a miracle it turned out to be, thanks to a massive grassroots movement of people with a shared vision. It was a historic vote in many ways that night, but mostly I believe it was a vote for a new way. There is an unmistakable mood in Australia that framed the Wentworth by-election result-a mood for change. Trust in the political system has reached a low ebb. The establishment of a national integrity commission will go some way to restoring that trust, and I will work together with like-minded colleagues to make that happen. But there is more to it. The Australian people are saying that they have had enough of the way party politics is being practised. They've had enough of the interests of the party taking over the interests of the people. One thing I know about Australians is that we have well-tuned radars for chicanery and deception. The people of Australia want and deserve authenticity. We saw during the Wentworth by-election campaign that voters want not only straight talk but carefully thought-out policies supported by evidence. More than that, they want to see action on issues that are important to them, their families and their communities. I said earlier that I take my place here at a unique moment in Australian political history; a time when the tectonic plates beneath the current two-party system seem to be shifting. Yes, it is a system that may have served us well in the past, but it is one that has evolved to turn inwards and primarily serve itself, at times silencing the voices of reason and compassion. People are saying they want politics done differently. If the major parties won't do that, Independents have already shown that they will happily fill that space. It has become something of a motherhood statement for politicians to say that we want a strong economy and financial security for all. We do. Of course we do. And yet we see constant meddling with superannuation rules, unsettling people at vulnerable times in their lives, and the gender gap in superannuation seeing women retire with about half the superannuation of men. The Australians I represent have said that they want more from their government. They want authentic voices. They want representatives who will focus on the future of our health system, for compassionate aged care and for lifelong education; representatives who will stand up for small business, who will fight for action on climate change, who will fight to ensure that women have equal political representation based on merit, who will fight for recognition of our First Nations people, who will fight for the humane treatment of asylum seekers and who will fight against discrimination, prejudice and bigotry in all of its manifestations.  Wentworth has shown that being positioned in what I call 'the sensible centre', meaning economically conservative and socially progressive, does have a home in the Australian political landscape. The people of Wentworth seemed largely unconcerned about the prospect of the crossbench having the so-called balance of power. I prefer to think of it as the power of balance. In a climate of politics moving uncomfortably to the right, the power of balance can be the insurance policy against extremes of political policymaking on the right or the left of the political spectrum. I want to see Australian politics move back to that sensible centre, and strong, local, independent voices can help to achieve that. I say to the people of Wentworth: I am here to represent you. I will support policies that encourage not only a thriving economy but also a thriving community. I want our parliament to unite us as a nation in equality, justice and opportunity. To achieve that, I will focus on the human experience that is generated by political decisions; a vision for the future we will be leaving for our children and our grandchildren. Thank you. NA Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training Report",91
149,Mr LAMING,COMMITTEES," On behalf of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, I present the committee's report, entitled Australian government funding arrangements for non-NHMRC research, together with the minutes of proceedings. Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).",96
150,Mr LAMING,COMMITTEES,"by leave-Australia enjoys a reputation for producing high-class-world-class-research. Australian researchers have contributed to significant discovery and development, including wi-fi, GPS and the Cochlear implant. The Australian government supports research through a range of funding mechanisms and through universities. Research funding is primarily administered through competitive grants and research block grants, the former comprising an application and assessment process based on merit and peer review. The context of this inquiry was researchers spend significant time, effort and resources applying for research funding and, with low success rates, it's often implied that this time and effort is wasted. Cognisant of reforms already underway in the Australian research sector, the committee sought to examine ways to simplify application and assessment processes, particularly for university researchers, and this report makes 15 recommendations designed to streamline and improve research funding arrangements. Four fundamental elements underpin the committee's recommendations. The first is to reduce the voluminous amount of information currently provided in support of grant funding applications. The second is to make use of existing data and information pertaining to researchers and research institutions, the third is to provide documentary uniformity as we can and the fourth is to level the playing field for under-represented research groups, including early and mid-career researchers, women, minority groups, independent researchers and rural and regional universities. The key recommendation of the committee is that a central online research management system be introduced for all Commonwealth grant programs, and to maximise the efficiency of that system it's recommended that the system be linked to existing data sources so that we prepopulate information whenever it's available. In addition, the committee recommends the introduction of a two-stage application process for research, which emphasises the strength and merit of the research ideas and the track record of those applying, while ancillary information that's unlikely to impact the decision or project ranking need only be submitted once an application is successful. Improving research funding arrangements is as much about supporting the next generation of Australian researchers as it is about the current funding process becoming easier to navigate. Earlyand mid-career researchers are the future of this nation's knowledge base. It is imperative that these researchers can be competitive in the funding environment. The committee considers that a range of strategies put forward in this report go a long way to better support and develop the research capacity of this cohort. As a final note, I'd like to acknowledge the opportunities for Australian researchers to contribute to more global research endeavours, whether or not that's through international partnerships with our major trading partnersgreater international mobility-there are always ways in which our researchers can be better supported internationally. While this issue was probably beyond the scope of this committee's inquiry, it's worth highlighting that potential for greater international collaboration. Australian research is strong enough and robust enough to be able to compete internationally for international dollars and those contributions will in turn align our research funding arrangements. This includes more strategic investment in areas that are national priorities for Australia. Just as I am grateful, as is my deputy chair, for the support of our committee and our committee secretariat, the committee itself is grateful to all the universities, research providers, government agencies and other stakeholders  who each committed time to our inquiry. Time spent preparing submissions and appearing at our hearings is something that isn't lost on our committee. Thank you.",96
151,Ms LAMB,COMMITTEES," by leave-Having only recently taken the role of deputy chair of this House committee into education, employment and training, I'd like to thank both the chair, the member for Bowman and the previous deputy chair, the member for Griffith, for their work on this inquiry. In his foreword, and further repeated in his statement just now made to the House, the committee chair recognises that researchers spend significant time, effort and resources applying for research funding. With low success rates it's often implied that this time and effort is wasted. I know that these low rates of funding success come after some five years of a coalition government. Under the Liberals, Australia's research effort has been undermined and its future put at risk. This report also notes the appalling track record of the Liberals, since they came to office, of cuts, chaos and policy failures. Australia needs a robust, strong research culture if we are to succeed in the Asian century. We cannot simply sit back and expect to succeed while countries in our region continue to invest more in science, research and education. That is why Labor has strongly opposed the cuts to our universities and research institutions. Just before Christmas last year, the government ripped $2.2 billion from universities by freezing the Commonwealth Grant Scheme funding. Our universities rely upon this funding to support the costs of undertaking research. Just this month the government announced more than $130 million in cuts to research block grants to pay for regional university pork-barrelling, which simply attempts to undo the damage they caused in the first place. This comes on top of the government's short-sighted decision to abandon the highly successful Education Investment Fund. Because of this poor decision, Australia's research institutions and universities have no access to specific funding for research equipment, new laboratories or renovation of existing facilities. The EIF was established to provide co-investment for critical infrastructure and research in Australia's research institutions, universities and TAFEs. The nearly $4 billion fund now lies dormant in the Future Fund. Research institutions, universities and TAFEs are now forced to fund infrastructure through vastly depleted operating grants. Labor on the other hand has an outstanding record of reforming Australia's research efforts. When we were last in office we nearly doubled university funding and made significant investments into research. Looking into the future, we will continue to invest. Our university funding policies will see more than $10 billion flow to universities over the next 10 years with uncapped places, funding for equity and pathways as well as infrastructure funding to flow from our new university future fund. We have committed to a goal of three per cent of GDP into research and development to bring us in line with other advanced economies and, critically, Labor will support academic freedom. In closing, I'd like to join with the chair to thank the many, many individuals, organisations and departments who made submissions and gave evidence at the hearings. I'd like to thank the secretariat for enabling the investigation and assisting with the reporting. I'd also like to note the committee's next inquiry into the status of the teaching profession, which in part will reference the attraction and retention of teachers and principals and the provision of appropriate support platforms for teachers. I commend the report to the House.",97
152,Mr LAMING,COMMITTEES," I move: That the House take note of the report. Question agreed to. National Broadband Network - Joint Standing Report Mrs PRENTICE (Ryan) (15:50): On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Broadband Network, I present the committee's report entitled The rollout of the NBN in rural and regional areas (2nd report of the 45th Parliament). Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e). Mrs PRENTICE: by leave-Only the coalition government is committed to completing the NBN effectively and efficiently to ensure all Australians have access to fast broadband as soon as possible at affordable prices and at the least cost to taxpayers. In late 2017, prior to my appointment as chairman, the committee agreed to conduct an inquiry into the rollout of the NBN in rural and regional Australia. Good communication is vital to the economic development and social participation of Australians living in rural and regional communities.  For those communities, the NBN provides a digital connectivity necessary to allow them to engage in those aspects of life that residents of metropolitan Australia take for granted-education, access to government and other services, and participation in the global marketplace. There is no doubt that the rollout of the NBN to regional and remote Australia is challenging. We are the sixth largest country in the world, with a landmass of more than 7.6 million square kilometres. The population density in regional and rural Australia is less than one person per square kilometre. This is the most complex nationbuilding infrastructure project ever undertaken. As a result of the approach from the coalition government, the NBN rollout is significantly more progressed in regional areas than in metropolitan Australia. At present, around 96 per cent of all homes and businesses outside major urban areas either can order an NBN service or have network construction underway. There are a number of challenges inherent in delivering the NBN to rural and regional Australia. However, to put the challenges of connecting regional Australia into perspective, we need to look at the history of the NBN project to understand the design decisions that were made by our predecessors. Back in 2010, under the former Labor government, the decision was taken to provision the network for a busyhour minimum of three megabits per second. Labor was completely clueless about the needs of rural and regional Australia, only factoring in a take-up rate of between 22 to 25 per cent across the entire satellite and fixed wireless footprint. This means Labor expected more than 700,000 premises in regional Australia to not take up an NBN service. In addition, the 2014 Fixed wireless and satellite review found the cost of providing improved services for satellite and fixed-wireless customers was $1.3 billion higher than projected in Labor's 2012 corporate plan. The review also found that while Labor had planned for just 1,400 fixed-wireless towers, the rollout would require 2,900 towers to meet demand. Only the responsible coalition government is investing more in regional telecommunications than any government before. With regard to the Sky Muster satellite, NBN Co continues to examine ways that satellite capability can be further improved. On 12 November NBN Co announced it was consulting about a new satellite product called Sky Muster Plus, which will provide regional Australia access to more data and higher speeds. Under the coalition government, the NBN will be completed nationwide by 2020-a full six years sooner than under Labor and at $30 billion less cost. Our government is committed to delivering ubiquitous broadband. Providing broadband access to areas that were previously deprived helps usher in new competition and reduce the tyranny of distance. The coalition's rural prioritisation of the NBN rollout has helped unlock social, economic and entertainment possibilities through access to fast broadband. Last financial year, the NBN access network is estimated to have driven $450 million in GDP and the creation of an additional 1,750 jobs in the regions. The opposition can harp on with inquiry after inquiry, but the fact remains that under the coalition government the NBN rollout is on track, is on budget and has more than 4.5 million premises connected and more than 7.6 million premises now able to order an NBN service. In closing, I wish to thank all the committee members and the former chair, the member for Farrer, as well as those who made submissions and the witnesses who gave their time to appear at hearings. I also place on record the committee's appreciation and thanks for the secretariat's diligence and hard work. Mr JOSH WILSON (Fremantle) (15:55): by leave-I'm glad also to make some comments on the report of the Joint Standing Committee on the NBN, a report focused, as the chair has described, on the rollout of the NBN in rural and regional areas. It followed from the work that the committee did on that topic in our inquiry and first report, tabled in October last year. It was clear from that report that this broad question of fair and proper, and effective and sustainable, access to broadband in rural and regional areas of Australia really did require further examination. Before I go to that, I will just note that some of the committee's work and recommendations from the first report on this topic did influence shifts by the government-most notably in the doubling of data limits from the Sky Muster service. That was one of the serious shortcomings we heard about in that first inquiry. But, sadly, a number of the sensible recommendations were ignored, and some of those things were revisited by this most recent inquiry. For example, the committee previously recommended that the Australian government set a benchmark for reasonable data allowance on the Sky Muster plans by reference to average data use across the  fixed line network. That goes squarely to this question of how Australians in rural and regional communities should be able to expect that their needs are assessed and then met by reference to what people in cities are able to enjoy when it comes to broadband, and yet that recommendation was not accepted or followed by the government. Equally, the committee recommended that the Australian government require the NBN to identify and disclose all areas that had been designated to be served by satellite connection that were previously set to receive the NBN by fibre to the node or fixed wireless. Fibre to the node and fixed wireless are higher quality technologies in terms of the service, and the committee thought it was really just a matter of basic transparency and good process for all of us, but particularly for Australians in rural and regional communities, to know when they had initially been set to receive those better-quality technologies-fibre to the node or fixed wireless-but were subsequently moved onto satellite. Again, the government didn't support that recommendation, which I think was a missed opportunity. Finally, in the 2017 report the committee recommended that the Australian government ask NBN to establish a rural and regional reference group to enable NBN to consult on Sky Muster services and changes to policies and rollout. Again, the government didn't support those recommendations. It really is important that we reflect on why broadband is so important outside our cities. On one level, it's really quite simple: it's important outside our cities for the same reason it's important inside our cities. Broadband is an essential kind of infrastructure. It is the best example of a genuinely 21st century infrastructure, and it's something that Australians, right across this continent, ought to be able to enjoy. It is basic infrastructure; it is critical to basic services and to channels of communication. If we think about the kinds of things that infrastructure supports, it goes right across all important areas of Australian life. There's often too much of a focus, I would say, on the entertainment uses of broadband, whether that's video streaming, internet searching, email and so on. When you think that it is actually critical to the delivery of banking services, interaction with all forms of government support, small business services, education and e-health, it's clear that broadband is not an optional extra. It's not an added extra. It's essential. The potential and promise of high-quality broadband is to reduce the gap that exists as a result of physical distance. That's the technological magic of broadband, really-that a person could be able to have an e-health consultation in Port Hedland or in Marble Bar just as they might have one in South Fremantle or Applecross. Yet, on the whole, people in businesses in rural and regional Australia get slower speeds, they get less data, they experience less reliability and they face higher costs. And so, as we watch the rollout of the NBN, particularly in rural and regional Australia, we confront the very real risk that, rather than decreasing the existing inequality and the tyranny of distance, it will, in fact, increase it. The committee, in our inquiry, heard from representatives from all corners of the continent about the importance of the NBN. The WA government described the way that: Western Australian farmers are embracing technology advances to improve efficiencies. However, they are finding it increasingly difficult to contend in a global marketplace without connectivity comparable to that of their international competitors. The New South Wales Farmers' Association emphasised that access to a reliable and competitive broadband network is essential for the Australian economy and society and said: This is especially the case in regional, rural and remote Australia where an access will be essential to overcome the tyranny of distance and provide unparalleled opportunities. Such steps are vital to drive the projected growth of the agriculture sector to $100 billion by 2030. Significantly, the government in Queensland made the point that: The 2017 Australian Digital Inclusion Index report ranks Queensland fifth for access across all states and territories and fifth for affordability, with our most digitally excluded Queenslanders being elderly people, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, rural and low-income people and people with a disability. So that gives you a sense of how important broadband is to rural and regional communities. We know through the evidence that was presented to this committee that there are some serious systemic issues. One of them is the growing congestion in fixed wireless service areas. That has occurred, at least partly, because people have been pushed off line broadband-fibre to the node, which I previously described-and pushed onto satellite and fixed wireless. That's why the committee has made two recommendations to government. Recommendation 13, again, goes to the provision of mapping for satellite services so that communities can understand the better options in relation to moving onto fixed wireless, if there's an adequate signal. Recommendation 14 recommends that: … nbn undertakes an assessment of those premises mapped for satellite that are adjacent to fixed wireless services and reports on how many premises allocated to satellite are capable of receiving a fixed wireless service …  I think those would both be meaningful improvements. In relation to the question of sustainability of funding, the committee recommends that the government review the existing cross-subsidy arrangements. In conclusion, I acknowledge the support we had from the secretariat and the input of all committee members. I particularly signal my colleague the member for Lyons, who was the deputy chair for a lot of this committee's work. He is an unstinting representative of his community. He represents a regional part of Tasmania. I thank him for his work. I obviously acknowledge the leadership of the chair and the input of all committee members. Mrs PRENTICE (Ryan) (16:04): I move: That the House take note of the report. Question agreed to. Treaties Committee Report",97
153,Mr BROADBENT,COMMITTEES," Before I start-I don't mean to be rude-a couple of things have been out of order during this small process of the committees presenting their reports. One was a deputy using it as a party political stance. This is usually where the chair gets up and makes a brief statement about the report, and we don't make partisan remarks about a report. Secondly, any other speakers are to be as brief as the presenter, but I don't want to set a precedent. On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the committee's report, incorporating dissenting reports, entitled Report 183: Aspects of the Peru-Australia Free Trade Agreement revisited.

157,Mr LEESER,BILLS," Peter Miles used a rifle to shoot Katrina Miles and his four grandchildren as they slept in their beds, before walking back to the farmhouse to kill his wife of more than 40 years. Mr Miles's daughter, Katrina, had moved in with her parents after the breakdown of her relationship with the children's father, Aaron Cockman. Ms Miles and Mr Cockman were also undergoing a lengthy shared custody battle in the Family Court. I had the privilege of meeting Aaron Cockman, a very brave man, earlier this year. Mr Cockman described how the lengthy and costly court battle over child custody rights was an expensive exercise, adding a high degree of emotional strain. The most recent tragedy in a string of mass murders and family violence occurred in a Perth suburb on 3 September, when Mr Anthony Harvey, aged 24, allegedly murdered his wife and his three children, murdering his mother-in-law the following day. There is never an excuse for family violence. There's never an excuse for murdering another human being. People must never take the law into their own hands. These extreme reactions highlight the additional stress placed on deeply dysfunctional and fragile families going through lengthy court hearings, especially when there are child custody matters involved. Family law proceedings can also create an increased risk of suicide. It's been  reported that there's a connection between family breakdown, relationship dissolution, separation, divorce and deaths by suicide, especially among men. Parents Beyond Breakup is an Australian charity operating Dads in Distress and Mums in Distress groups. They work with parents who are struggling with family separation. In 2016, Parents Beyond Breakup noted that 350 parental suicides were avoided as a result of their assistance and services. As the chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Suicide Prevention, I commend them for the important work that they do. I had the chance to visit a Dads in Distress group in my electorate, run by Campbell Lennox, to see first hand the work they do in sensibly navigating people through the issues that confront parents in the family law system. Many of the men I saw had been separated from their children for a long time. Many had terrible experiences with lawyers and the system. Dads in Distress helped them concentrate on getting through the system without getting angry about the injustices they saw. I was impressed with the level of sophistication of the program. Campbell described the stress and pain experienced by parents and children going through the Family Court. It's become apparent to me that the adversarial system is not the right tool for managing most marriage breakdowns, and that lengthy delays in process add additional strain. What we've done, effectively, is put an adversarial court system in the middle of a major social problem, and it hasn't worked. What the reforms in this bill try to do is to make the process less cumbersome and less painful. Family Court reform is required not only to mitigate extreme reactions but also to relieve the pressure on families experiencing the sadness, stress and trauma of family breakdown. ABS statistics show that in 2016 there were 46,604 divorces in Australia, with two divorces per thousand people. Of these divorces, over 40,000 children were involved. In the Berowra electorate, the census records that 7½ per cent of people are either divorced or separated. Improving the efficiency of the courts will reduce delays in the family law system and streamline the time it takes courts to process applications. This will considerably reduce the stress inflicted on families. The Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court deal with a significant number of disputes, with approximately 22,000 applications for final orders received each year over the past five years. However, the courts have struggled to keep pace and to finalise those applications. For example, in 2016-17, the family courts finalised 600 fewer final order applications than they received. This has led to the backlog in final order family law matters pending in the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court, growing from 17,200 to 21,000 over the past five years. Reducing this backlog will positively impact on separating couples and their children, because delays in the court system only extend the conflict between the parties. The longer a matter takes before the courts and the more legal costs incurred, the less likely the parties are to have an amicable relationship post separation, which has a significant impact on any children involved. Having two courts, the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court, responsible for family law has led to inefficiencies, confusion, delays, additional costs and unequal experiences for many families. Additional judicial resources and funding just won't fix the underlying structural problems here and the fragmented system. Deep structural reform is required to effectively expend taxpayer money and drive efficiency. The new system is designed to be simpler and faster and to help move 8,000 cases through the system each year. I commend the Attorney-General on commissioning the PwC report, the Review of efficiency of the operation of the federal courts, in December last year. That report found that the age of cases awaiting resolution has increased in the last five years. Approximately 29 per cent of Federal Circuit Court cases and 42 per cent of pending Family Court cases are now older than 12 months. The national median time to trial has also increased to well beyond a year in both courts. In the Federal Circuit Court, median waiting times have increased from 10.8 months to 15.2 months. In the Family Court, it's from 11½ months to 17 months. This is a dramatic increase, and this has real, negative impacts on families waiting for their cases to be processed. The current structure means each family has to go through a different court experience. Is it any wonder that families going through separation are confused? The family law application process varies significantly between the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court. This is due to a combination of the courts' legislative framework, including their respective acts, regulations and rules, and the operational and cultural practices that have evolved over time. Quite often, cases are transferred between both courts. In 2017, 1,200 families were the subject of transfer between the courts, some after 11 months of being in one court. These were 1,200 cases that had to start proceedings again in a new court, with new rules, procedures and processes. Clearly, this is wasting everyone's time and is a drain on court resources-not to mention creating considerable anguish for the families going through it. There also appears to be inconsistencies in appeals adjudication, with 75 per cent of appeals from the Federal Circuit Court being heard by a full bench of three Family Court judges, despite their legislative ability to be heard  by a single judge sitting alone. This contrasts with the Federal Court, where approximately 88 per cent of appeals from the Federal Circuit Court in general law matters are heard by a single judge. It's not hard to pinpoint the system bottlenecks and argue the case for the urgent need for a consolidated court reform. The retiring Chief Justice of the Family Court, the Hon. John Pascoe, knows only too well of the challenges and pressures facing the family courts in terms of funding; judicial resources; judicial health and well-being; growing jurisdiction; complicating social factors, like drugs and violence; and ever-increasing case filings. The Chief Justice was also Chief Judge of the Federal Circuit Court of Australia for 13 years. Chief Justice Pascoe came to the bench having had a distinguished career as a legal practitioner and CEO, with broad involvement in extracurricular life, including his work with the Duke of Edinburgh award and broader work on child protection in Asia, which was highlighted at the ceremonial sitting of the Family Court to mark his retirement a few weeks ago. I was working for my predecessor, Philip Ruddock, when he was Attorney-General and appointed the Chief Justice as Chief Federal Magistrate. The Chief Justice has always been an advocate for his court and sought to see the courts adequately resourced and respected. Under John Pascoe's leadership, His Honour developed what was the Federal Magistrates Court from a magistracy of 25 federal magistrates to a court of 65 judges. His appointment to the Family Court of Australia last year harnessed his administrative experience and jurisprudence, while allowing his new Chief Judge Alstergren to manage and further the success of the Federal Circuit Court. If the proposed reforms are enacted, Chief Justice Pascoe will have seen the two courts form into a single court of over 100 judges. His legacy will have been to ready a system of two courts that share one jurisdiction into a more streamlined model so as to better serve Australian families in distress and aid vulnerable children. I wish to pay tribute to Chief Justice Pascoe for his service to Australia in heading both of these difficult jurisdictions and for being a voice for court reform. This bill merges the Federal Circuit Court of Australia and the Family Court of Australia into an overarching unified administrative structure known as the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia. These structural reforms would create a framework for common leadership, common management and comprehensive and consistent internal case management. This will, in effect, create a single point of entry and a consistent pathway for Australian families in having their family law disputes dealt with in the federal courts. I also strongly support the proposal to fast-track appeals through a newly established family law appeal division in the Federal Court of Australia. This system will centralise appeals from the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia in family law matters. These structural changes will improve access to justice for families and provide greater certainty and consistency within the entire federal law system. These reforms will significantly improve the efficiency of the family law system, reducing backlog and driving faster, cheaper and more consistent resolution of disputes. It's important to understand the detail of what is and what isn't being proposed. There are five key legislative amendments. First, the reforms don't abolish an existing court. Second, an overarching unified administrative structure will be established, with the government's intention that the FCFC would operate under the leadership of one chief justice, Chief Justice Alstergren, to be supported by a deputy chief justice, the former Labor Attorney General Justice Robert MCClellan. Third, more importantly, there'll be a single point of entry into the family law jurisdiction of the Family Court system. The issuing of common rules of courts, practice notes and directions will create consistent and effective internal case management approaches to family law, with a renewed focus on resolving disputes as quickly, inexpensively and efficiently as possible for the court and the parties. Ultimately, the reforms ensure that appropriate expertise and specialisation is retained within the new court structure. Finally, this bill will encourage common rules, forms, and practices and procedures, as well as case management, between the courts. This isn't the first time Family Court reform has been discussed. Many family law experts, including judges, have welcomed the proposal of a single entry point. The split system and duplicated model with different rules, forms and processes have also drawn criticism. Despite the support for family law reform, previous attempts have failed. Reforms have been put on the backburner, meaning the suffering of families under stress has been even greater. We've reached a critical juncture, where the stakes are simply too high to ignore. We've seen the extreme reactions in the recent string of family murders. All these cases have common themes-lengthy child custody disputes in the courts. The backlog of cases waiting to be resolved, coupled with the current cases slowly moving through the outdated system, has reached a crisis point for the people experiencing it, and it presents a compelling case for urgent reform. Court reform focused on efficiency and fast-tracking processes and on streamlining those processes is well overdue. I strongly support the government's Family Court reform proposal and congratulate the Attorney General for tackling what has become an urgent issue in our country, in every community across our country, with  the over 40,000 marriage breakdowns that end in divorce every year. It's my pleasure to commend the bill to the House.",100
158,Dr FREELANDER,BILLS," I rise today to speak on the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2018 and related bills. It is a little daunting to speak after the member for Berowra-a very eminent lawyer in this House-but I think my perspective is slightly different. I will outline why I think that this bill has been rushed through and why I think we could do better. What the government is proposing through this legislation is the most significant change to the Family Court since it was first established in 1975 by the Whitlam government-one of the many reforms enacted by the Whitlam government that changed Australia for the better for many, many decades. Of course, one of the other outstanding reforms of the Whitlam government was the development of Medibank, later to become Medicare-again, another social revolution in my own personal field of medicine that changed Australia for the better for many decades. Because this legislation is a major change, it needs to be very carefully considered and carefully thought out. These bills, which total almost 500 pages in length, will subsequently make amendments to 125 further bills. As I have learnt over many years, in my work as a paediatrician, family law is a very complex matter, and the matters that family law deals with are themselves very complex and require expertise of a high level to resolve. As a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs, I've recently taken part in an inquiry that considers aspects of our judicial system and, in particular, the family law system. As part of this inquiry, the standing committee held a number of hearings all over the country, spoke to countless stakeholders and visited a number of different courts across the land. I must say that some of the evidence that we heard was quite harrowing and one could not fail to be impressed by the courage of some people and some of the difficulty they had faced in their family law matters, and by the enormous patience and expertise of the court officers and the judicial officers involved in the family law system. However, it was also apparent that there was clearly a need for reform. That reform will need to be in many different areas. The committee, through its investigations, uncovered some truly disturbing aspects of our judicial system and our family law system. Whilst we saw that the legal system in family law urgently needs reform, the Labor members of the committee want to ensure that this legislation is carefully considered and looked over with a finetooth comb. If it's not, and we are left with changes to the law that do not significantly improve how the system functions at the present time, we would have grave concerns for the families and, in particular, for the children involved in the family law system. This bill, put forth by the government, seeks to combine the Federal Circuit Court and the Family Court into one court, establishing the new Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia-the FCFC. This effort to streamline and further compact our justice system brings the courts into a single entity, having both covered under one umbrella. This means that two currently separate entities will be given a single Chief Justice and Deputy Chief Justice, a single set of rules and a single point of entry. While the two amalgamated entities will undertake the same roles and functions under this legislation as they currently do, it's worth noting that the Attorney-General has expressed an intention not to appoint new judges to FCFC division 1 as they retire. This is a division that, under this legislation, will effectively replace the existing Family Court. This is a major concern. What this means, in not so many words, is that this legislation would amount to a gradual abolition of the Family Court over time. This bill, as it stands, will result in the work of the Family Court being absorbed by FCFC division 2, which presently stands as the Federal Circuit Court. The Morrison government should come clean and own up to what it is clearly doing here. Through this bill, the government is trying to abolish the Family Court-one of the great legacies of the Whitlam Labor government. It is a great legacy. Whilst we saw evidence of need for reform, the Family Court system itself as a separate entity, we feel, is very important to preserve. What is truly disturbing is that the government is trying to do this under a cloak of secrecy. Disgracefully, it appears that those opposite haven't even bothered to consult with families currently in the system or with many of the judicial officers working in the system. They are effectively seeking to get rid of the Family Court and haven't bothered to consider the families who have used it or who are using it. As I said, my role in the aforementioned standing committee, my role as a local MP working with local constituents and my experience as a paediatrician have collectively shown me that our legal system is in dire need of reform. It's undeniable that the Family Court presently is in need of attention and is facing significant problems. Issues such as backlogs are increasingly unacceptable, because delays in the court system are not only not helping but damaging people who are caught up in the system. The reality is, though, that the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government is at least partly to blame for this. I don't think you'll hear those opposite admitting to this, but much of the existing backlog has arisen due to the failure of the coalition government to adequately fund the court system, their failure to adequately fund the legal assistance services and their failure to appoint replacements for  judges upon their retirement. I could say that the government have botched all due process, especially in their failure to consult the broader community on this proposed legislation. I think it's worth noting that the feedback that the government is now receiving from key stakeholders on its 500-plus page bill has been almost entirely negative. These, of course, are only the early responses, and I suspect that, with reflection and with time, the feedback will be even more caustic. Most of the feedback has been negative, and that's in the early days of this legislation, and I think that says it all, really. Once again, it appears that this government is engaging in policy on the run without consulting the experts. While the fact that these bills are around 500 pages long might suggest otherwise, the government's pathetic excuse of a solution to fix the ongoing issues of the Family Court speaks for itself. Under these bills, the government is planning to get rid of all the specialist expertise that presently exists in the Family Court. Yes, it is true that the majority of cases are heard and handled within the Federal Circuit Court. However, what the current Attorney-General, Christian Porter, is agreeing to do with this legislation is to hand over all legal matters pertaining to family law to the generalist Federal Circuit Court. The one thing we learnt with our committee work was that it requires a great deal of expertise to deal with some of these very complex family law matters. As I've said, many matters that are presently handled in the Federal Circuit Court are especially complex and are difficult to deal with unless someone has expertise in these areas. The court is appropriately presided over at the present time by personnel who are equipped to deal with such complex matters. They are specialist judges with the appropriate level of experience required to hear such cases. It's also partly because of the complex nature of these select cases that matters that are referred to the Family Court can take a long time to resolve. There are often no shortcuts. The specialist skill and detailed consideration that is required to hear such cases is no reason to simply get rid of the Family Court altogether. Here the government appears unwilling to acknowledge and accept the fact that specialist judges should be hired to consider complex family law matters in detail. This, it appears, is mere semantics to the government. With the swipe of a pen, they can approve the abolishment of a crucial establishment and with it its institutional knowledge and its capabilities. I just want to go back briefly to the government's complete failure to undertake the appropriate level of consultation. Be assured this legislation is significant. It is of major significance to many in my electorate, to many of the families I've dealt with over a long period of time and, in particular, to many of the childrensometimes they're not thought of in complex family law matters. The Liberal-National government should have at least attempted to get some input from the wider community and the relevant stakeholders. This has not happened. They've handled this whole debate and the development of their legislation very poorly. They've not even bothered to pretend to engage with the people and the groups who are in the family law system every day. They've neglected the family groups, the registrars, the legal assistance services, the lawyers, the judges, the family assessors, the psychologists et cetera that have a big role to play in family law matters. Seemingly aware of their complete and utter failure to consult key stakeholders, the government have tried to ram this legislation through the parliament. What they were doing was clear to all of us. The government were intent on making sure that nobody would have the opportunity to look into their proposals. They didn't want any oversight. They didn't want to have to consult. They didn't want any scrutiny of this major change to our family law system. That was evident through all their ill-conceived attempts to place restrictions on the time available to make submissions on these matters, which they initially wanted to be over and done with in just three weeks. I think that is appalling, given the complexity and the society-changing nature of this legislation. Labor saw this coming. We wrote to the Attorney-General back in June requesting that the government do the right thing and come clean with an exposure draft of the bill, but-surprise, surprise!-they refused to accommodate our request. We are firmly in favour of adequate consultation, especially on such significant matters. The issues that are presently plaguing our judicial system in family law should be addressed. The government cannot hope to do that without reaching out to stakeholders. Instead, they are abolishing the Family Court. I am firmly of the opinion that all stakeholders, whether or not they're in favour of the changes, should get the opportunity to have their say on these very complex matters. To me, the government's failure here demonstrates their laziness. Rather than actively engaging with the broader community, hearing about people's experience in the Family Court and having appropriate discussions with the experts, they've decided to rush this legislation through. It's appalling. Rather than trying to solve the underlying problems, the government appear to be attempting to brush the issues under the carpet in the hope they'll go away. Any discussion, or attempted discussion, from the Labor Party about family law matters is met with a whole range of cliches from the Prime Minister, who does nothing but shout and make very negative comments about any constructive attempt to address this legislation.  The Attorney-General and this out-of-touch government can pretend all they like that adequate consultation has been undertaken, but the evidence says otherwise. You only have to look at the Australian Bar Association and the Law Council of Australia, the two eminent bodies representing all legal practitioners in Australia, who provided the disturbing revelation they were given an early draft with only two days to respond and strict limitations on who they could discuss the draft with-again, another appalling piece of government manipulation. Indeed, it appears that the government's consultations were limited merely to the Chief Justice of the Family Court and the Chief Judge of the Federal Circuit Court. This is complex legislation that takes around 500 pages to outline, with amendments to 125 other bills, effectively axing an essential institution, yet it seems the government think it's okay to consult with two people. This is a travesty, and I would be highly embarrassed to be sitting among those opposite. I could liken this style of governance to a toddler having a temper tantrum, throwing his toy across the room because it doesn't work, and wanting to get another one. Make no mistake; that is what the government are doing. Rather than dealing with the issues facing the Family Court in a responsible, logical manner, they're choosing to throw the whole situation aside. As a member of the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs, I was part of the inquiry that looked into family law. The inquiry, though truly eye-opening, reinforced what I already knew to be true, which is that the government have underfunded the family law system for a long period of time, and that has contributed to most of the problems. As a paediatrician, I've had a great deal of exposure to the legal system; in particular, to the Family Court. I've known for years that our legal system is overrun, our judges are overburdened and our courts are under-resourced. We need to expand and improve our legal institutions, not merely abolish them. I doubt there was ever a more apt application of the phrase 'cutting off the nose to spite the face' than what we're seeing here. These bills represent the greatest changes to the family law courts since they were formed in 1975 and they need to be properly assessed.",103
159,Mr WALLACE,BILLS," The breakdown of a significant relationship and then the process of separation in a marriage or a long-term de facto relationship is widely acknowledged to be one of the most stressful and difficult periods of any individual's life. Repeated studies have found a direct association between divorce or separation, increased anxiety and depression and increased risk of alcohol and drug abuse. Other research suggests that any family separation can have a substantial impact on personal well-being for years afterwards. In many cases, unfortunately, mental illness in one or both partners is a contributing factor to bringing a case to the Family Court in the first place. Mental illnesses can be associated with irritability, hostility, a reduction in personal responsibility and withdrawal from others-all of which can put considerable strain on a relationship. A multinational study of mental disorders, marriage and divorce published in 2011 by the University of Groningen, among others, found that 18 different mental disorders studied increased the likelihood of relationship breakdown by between 20 per cent and 80 per cent. In fact, as many as 90 per cent of marriages in which one partner suffers from bipolar disorder end in divorce. Mental illness can also make disputes more difficult to resolve and increase the likelihood that a relationship breakdown will lead to court proceedings. Poor mental health is often evident among families who come to the Family Court before these proceedings even begin. The Family Court's website puts it very well, where it says: The reality is that by the time people reach the courts, stress, despair, anxiety, depression and other forms of mental illness are common, along with anger and frustration, and frequently a sense of powerlessness. However, the necessity in too many cases of going through an arduous, stressful, arcane, highly expensive and unnecessarily lengthy process of litigation make all of these mental health impacts considerably worse. Each year for the past five years, the Family Court and Federal Circuit Court have received a combined 22,000 applications for final orders in respect of family law matters. Yet the backlog of cases pending in the Family Court has grown over the same period from 17,200 to 21,000 applications, with the average age of those cases now older than 12 months. In 2016-17 alone, the two courts finalised a combined 600 fewer family law matters than they received. This deficiency has inevitable and highly damaging results for those with cases before the courts. Since 2012-13, the national median time to trial has increased from 10.8 months to 15.2 months in the Federal Circuit Court, and from 11½ months to 17 months in the Family Court. Vulnerable families, many going through the most stressful time of their lives, are waiting well over a year in limbo for their case to be heard. Now, I actually suspect that the reality is it's even longer than that. Importantly, these delays are calculated from the time the application is brought for a hearing, not from when the relationship began to fracture, and it doesn't include that long period of time when the courts are dealing with interlocutory matters. I think we can all easily imagine that when it comes to access to your children or to your future financial security, every day of uncertainty is intensely stressful. For children, who cannot fully understand the process, it's even worse. For too many, what can be years of this intense uncertainty, anxiety and stress is simply unendurable.  We must act to change this situation and to get cases resolved much more quickly. In this matter, as is so often the case in government, simply throwing money at the problem will not make a difference for families. It will not solve the underlying inefficiencies which are inherent in the structure of the current arrangements. We know this because, despite the number of family law applications for final orders remaining approximately the same over recent years, and without any material reduction in the courts resources, the rate of cases being finalised by the court has been in consistent decline. The government has identified clear and unambiguous inefficiencies in the system which would allow us to turn the situation around and make meaningful gains for families. It has been estimated that the structural reforms laid out in this bill would improve the efficiency of the court by as much as a third, with time for as many as 8,000 additional matters every year. Specifically, the bill before the House directly addresses four of the most important inefficiencies in the existing system and will also seek to set in motion cultural change which will pay further dividends in the years to come. The first and most striking of these inefficiencies is the huge delay and additional costs caused by the number of cases which are currently transferred between the two existing courts. In 2016-17, almost 1,200 families had their disputes transferred from one court to the other. In each of these cases, the individuals involved had to restart their proceedings from scratch, playing out the entire interlocutory procedures again, following the rules and procedures of the new court. In the case of those unlucky enough to be transferred to the Federal Circuit Court, they face an average delay of 11.1 months for the dispute even to come before the court. Not only does this dramatically extend the length of time taken to resolve the specific disputes which are transferred but it creates a substantial number of what are, in effect, redundant extra cases which were being heard unnecessarily in the wrong court. This uses up precious court time which could be deployed in hearing more disputes. This bill brings these two courts together under a single, unified structure: the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia, or the FCFC. This single administrative structure would retain two divisions, allowing disputes of different levels of complexity to be heard in the most appropriate venue. However, the bill allows that the two divisions would be led by the same Chief Justice and deputy chief, who would be able to make a single, early and effective judgement as to which division a dispute should be heard in. This would eliminate the need to transfer disputes between courts in the vast majority of cases and would also allow a single case listing to be managed efficiently from application to finalisation by a single registry. These reforms alone could result in the courts finalising up to an additional 3,500 family law matters every year. As I mentioned, presently the Federal Circuit Court and the Family Court of Australia operate under different rules of court, practices, procedures and forms. This not only is a source of considerable delay when cases do have to be transferred from one court to the other but it further increases the cost and complexity and therefore the length of the process for families. Family lawyers must be familiar with the processes and application requirements of two separate courts, and they must spend time assessing which of the courts is most appropriate for a given dispute. It is more difficult for families to know what to expect and what the process will cost, while in the administration of the court itself separate court registry staff are needed with expertise in each set of procedures, reducing overall capacity to deal with cases. This bill would deal with this issue by facilitating the appointment of a single Chief Justice and Deputy Chief Justice and would place into the Chief Justice's hands the ability to set the rules of court for both divisions. It would also require the appointment of a single chief executive officer with responsibility for the administrative affairs of both divisions of the court. The bill specifically provides that even if the Chief Justice and Chief Judge, being the heads of the two divisions, are different individuals, they must work cooperatively to achieve a common approach to case management, including common practices and procedures, rules of court and their forms. It's estimated by the Attorney-General's Department that these streamlined processes and single approach to the administration of the court could result in up to 3,000 additional family law matters being finalised each and every year. The bill also addresses the inequity, suffering and impact on children caused by one or other party vexatiously using the procedures of the court to extend the dispute beyond what is necessary. Though not common, the motives of revenge and the passionate desire to win at all costs, which can be uniquely inspired by a relationship breakdown, combined with the inefficiencies in the current court's operation, can leave the system vulnerable to intentional extension and unnecessary extension of proceedings. This bill will help to reduce the potential for these damaging behaviours by providing that the overarching purpose of practice and procedure provisions in both divisions is to facilitate the just resolution of disputes according to law and as quickly, inexpensively and as efficiently as possible. Further, the bill provides where a lawyer has failed to comply with his or her statutory duty to aid in the just resolution of disputes as quickly, inexpensively and efficiently as possible, the judge may order that the lawyer  bear the costs of certain proceedings personally. This change to the stated purpose of practice and procedure, the new provisions surrounding costs and the direction towards harmonisation of rules and of court and case management would, in my view, over time tend to encourage a cultural change in the conduct of litigation in these courts. This bill and the debate we have had in this place will make it clear that the FCFC and the practitioners who appear before it must be focused on resolving disputes as quickly, inexpensively and efficiently as possible. Finally, at present, despite the fact that appeals from the Federal Circuit Court to the Family Court can be heard by a single judge, 75 per cent are in fact heard by a full bench of three Family Court judges. There are inconsistencies with this approach. In the Federal Court, for example, 88 per cent of appeals in general law matters are heard by a single judge. This bill, therefore, amends the Federal Court of Australia Act to establish a new family law appeal division in the Federal Court of Australia and, critically, requires appeals from the FCFC (Division 2) to be heard by a single judge, unless a judge determines a full bench is required. It's estimated that up to 1,500 additional family law matters could be finalised each year through this streamlined management of appeals. If even just a quarter of the estimated efficiency gains from these measures are realised then the court will be able to return to finalising more cases than it receives. It will begin to reduce the huge backlog which is having such a detrimental effect on the well-being and mental health of tens of thousands of Australians. These reforms have the potential to transform the efficiency of our family law system and they'll do so at a net cost of only $1 million over the forward estimates. In the long term, these changes will ensure our family law system costs less. This is what good government is all about-cost effectiveness, efficiency and making a difference with practical and pragmatic reform for all Australians.",105
160,Mr HAYES,BILLS," I rise to make a contribution on the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2018 and the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2018. These bills represent one of the most significant changes proposed to the Family Court since its establishment in 1975 under the Whitlam government. The Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2018 contains the main provisions of the government's proposed changes. Basically, it will consolidate these two courts. The related bill will basically make consequential amendments to, as I understand it, 125 bills. In summary, this bill combines the Federal Circuit Court and the Family Court into a new amalgamated court, the FCFCA. Effectively, it involves merging two existing structures under the one umbrella, giving them to a single Chief Justice and Deputy Chief Justice; a single set of rules; and a single point of entry. So far, that all sounds quite palatable. The existing Federal Court will become division 2 of the new body and the Family Court will be division 1. While a separate Family Court has been allocated to the new amalgamated court, there has been an intention expressed by the Attorney-General that there'll be no new appointments to judges in division 1. In other words, no new appointments to judges in what would have been considered the Family Court. What we see is the gradual abolition of the Family Court; the winding back of what was ventured back in 1975, to have a specialised court to deal with issues of matters of the family. Further to these changes, the bill seeks to abolish the appeals division of the Family Court, transferring the appellate jurisdiction to the Federal Court. I want to make it clear: we will be opposing this legislation. We'll be opposing it on the basis that there has been inadequate consultation with the various stakeholders, which I'll go through in a moment. This is being rushed through. In spite of what the previous speaker just said, this is an economic drive. It does nothing to enhance the actual performance of the respective courts, and I'll deal with that as well. I want to make clear that we are opposing this legislation. The government has had the opportunity to review the performance of the Family Court. It has made various criticisms, as colleagues opposite are making at the moment. But, Mr Deputy Speaker Howarth, you have to look at how they have resourced the Family Court. The former Attorney-General, who's now ensconced happily over in London, went on for years refusing to replace judges in the Family Court. The dilemma of the Family Courts, the backlog, was partly due to the lack of resources. You see that in the appointment of registrars, court staff and, importantly, judges. I find this a little bit bewildering, wanting to rush this piece of momentous legislation through before it has had the opportunity for the appropriate stakeholders to be properly consulted. By the way, the only stakeholders that were consulted-except for PricewaterhouseCoopers, who wrote the 500 page report-were the Chief Justice and Chief Judge. It wasn't exactly going to the users of the court system: the people who are representing families; people who are engaged in the issues, particularly in the Family Court; those supporting the mental health welfare of participants; and the Law Council or the Bar Association. None of those were actually consulted. None of those were asked, 'What would make a more efficient court system for the end user?' I accept that those opposite see this as a bit of a cash grab: 'We can merge these two bodies together and, as a consequence, they'll spend less money on the Federal Court and the Family Court,' but I'm not sure that that is precisely what we want to be putting out there within the community. When I look around here, all electorates like yours and mine, Member for Werriwa-have families which have been impacted on by the Family Court. We all have families that have levels of discord, regrettably. It takes time. We all have families that have relied on the specialisation of that court to seek justice. This has all been fast-tracked, as I say, simply in respect to the economics of that Federal Court system-the Federal Circuit Court and the Family Court. This is not about what's best for end users. The government should take responsibility and own up to what they have done to the Family Court. This was a great initiative under Gough Whitlam. Regrettably, we understand what the divorce rate is in this country. Regrettably, many of those divorces are very contested and emotional dramas. The view in 1975 was, 'We do need a specialised court, with specialised judges, to be able to actually help people through this.' That is what they are trying to throw out now. Even though, as I say, in division 1 there will be the Family Court provision, if you aren't going replace any of the judges there, if you're not going to replace the registrars and if you're going to have a single set of rules and a single point of entry, it can mean only one thing. This is eventually going to be the Federal Circuit Court effectively doing all the Family Court matters. I know a lot of my colleagues appear regularly in the Federal Circuit Court, and I know it deals with a lot of family matters as it is now. But when matters get very complex and very specialised, they are then referred to a judge in the Family Court. That's the way it works in practice now. But this legislation will effectively put these into one court-the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia. It will diminish the specialists in the Family Court. They will be merged as effectively one new court without that level of specialisation in family matters. I'm okay if the other side want to come in and say, 'Family matters are less and less important to us now.' But they haven't been honest in doing that. They've said this is about efficiencies. It seems to me the inefficienciesthe backlogs-that we see in the Family Court have been very much at the hands of this government through the lesser allocation of funds. A good colleague of mine from my former days is Morry Bailes, who is now the President of the Law Council of Australia. He said: Australia's family court system today is under immense pressure but rushing through changes without proper consultation is not the answer. … … … We owe it to the people caught-up in the family law system not to give the most significant court changes since 1975 a mere cursory glance, or a simple tick-and-flick. I don't know what the government thinks of the Law Council of Australia these days, but I think Morry's view is quite right there-this is being rushed through. The lawyers weren't consulted on this. We acknowledge that there have been significant problems in the Family Court, but a lot of these unacceptable delays get down to the levels of resourcing and, as a consequence, this is at the hands of this government. We certainly don't hear the government talking about the backlog. We don't hear them talking about the inadequate funding. As I said, former Attorney-General George Brandis was quite forthright in his position that you didn't have to replace retiring judges. In other words, this government have actually contributed to the problems they're trying to escape from now by simply amalgamating these two legal institutions. Many of us participated in the debate earlier today about White Ribbon Day and the issue of domestic violence. Regrettably, that's something that impacts on all of our electorates. It's just a fact of life that matters of domestic violence disproportionately affect women. It has been one of the central aspects of the current Family Court because, invariably, domestic violence repeatedly is part of the more complex cases dealt with by the Family Court. If these matters were formally before the Federal Circuit Court they would be then allocated to a specialist judge in the Family Court. You all know the statistics on the prevalence of domestic violence, so you must understand the impact of not having matters of such gravity heard before a specialist legal institution. I want to read the words of the President of the Australian Bar Association, Noel Hutley SC: The Family Court of Australia and its specialist judges perform important work in difficult and complex family law cases, but the court has been under-resourced for many years. The ABA remains of the view that the court should not be dismantled after 40 years of operation without careful consideration of the value that maintaining a properly-resourced specialist family court would bring. This proposal from the government is based simply on what I would call the 'desktop research' of PricewaterhouseCoopers. They are a pretty formidable research based organisation, but it is their research that the government is relying on to say, 'If we do this, we're going to have that amount of greater efficiency within our court system.' The report, in my opinion, makes some far-fetched assumptions, including that there would be an equivalent level of complexity between the Family Court and the Family Circuit Court. As I said a little earlier, I think that's a ridiculous notion, but it's not surprising that those who are not directly involved in those respective jurisdictions would come to that conclusion. They did not talk to the Bar Association and they did not talk to the  Law Council of Australia, yet they have made that 'desktop conclusion', if you like, that the complexities in both those legal jurisdictions would be very similar. I just think that the notion of putting this through with this degree of haste is wrong. We do need the Senate to review this piece of legislation, and I think the reporting time of 15 April next year is a good time for the Senate to come back on this. It also gives us the opportunity to hear from the Australian Law Reform Commission's landmark inquiry into the family law system, which, I understand, is due on 31 March. We on this side are interested in having proper processes protecting family law matters. We've been critical of the way this government has treated the Family Court and the way it has inadequately resourced it, and we are very, very critical of the way this government's trying to ram this piece of legislation through, clearly without adequate consultation with stakeholders-whether they be for or against the change, for that matter. As a consequence, we'll be voting against this on the basis of reserving our position after reviewing this in the Senate committee. (Time expired)",107
161,Mr ALBANESE,BILLS," I rise to speak on the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2018, which, if successful, would see the Family Court of Australia, essentially, abolished. This bill comes without any real consultation, a pattern that we have become used to seeing from this coalition government, a coalition government that decides policy on the spur of the moment, that doesn't consult properly and that doesn't think issues through. This is a government that, each and every day, searches for something that it can dismantle or destroy. That's because it is a government with no ideas. It is a government that is frightened of the present but terrified of the future, a government that is liberal in name only. It is a government that is certainly not even conservative, because conservatives support institutions in our society. This is a government that undermines institutions, that is prepared to rip up decades of what have come to be seen as normal processes in which people have rights as well as obligations. The problem is the reactionary ideology of those opposite coupled with a lack of preparedness for government. When the member for Warringah, Mr Abbott, took office in 2013 he did have a plan to get rid of Labor. He certainly didn't have a plan to govern. He defined himself by what he was against, not what he was for. Likewise, Malcolm Turnbull had a plan to get rid of Mr Abbott as the Prime Minister.",109
162,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," Order, you'll refer to members by their correct title.",109
163,Mr ALBANESE,BILLS,But he also had a plan,109
164,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,Order!,109
165,Mr ALBANESE,BILLS,"Yes, yes.",109
166,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,Thank you.,109
167,Mr ALBANESE,BILLS,"He also had a plan to govern, and instead possessed-and you would know, because you've been a part of supporting the overthrow of prime ministers, Mr Deputy Speaker Howarth-and when Malcolm Turnbull was",109
168,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,"Order! I'm in the chair. Don't reflect on the chair, please. Just stick to the bill, thanks.",109
169,Mr ALBANESE,BILLS,"You sought to intervene in the debate, Mr Deputy Speaker.",109
170,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,I just want you to refer to the member for Warringah by his correct title.,109
171,Mr ALBANESE,BILLS,"And I have done that. He is the former Prime Minister, and Malcolm Turnbull is just Malcolm Turnbull.",109
172,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,"No, sorry.",109
173,Mr ALBANESE,BILLS,Malcolm Turnbull is just Malcolm Turnbull.,109
174,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,The shadow minister referred to Malcolm Turnbull and then referred to Mr Abbott. Mr Abbott is still a member of the House and he'll be referred to as the member for Warringah.,109
175,Mr ALBANESE,BILLS,"Malcolm Turnbull, the person who was removed by people, without proper process, people who were prepared to go into the caucus room, as David Speers outlines in his book, On Mutiny. If people aren't proud of their achievement in removing elected prime ministers, I'm not surprised, because that's what characterises why this government have a problem with policy direction and why they come up with legislation to effectively abolish an important institution, the Family Court of Australia, without proper process, without thinking through the implications, for women and children in particular, of such a measure. The fact is that the new Prime Minister can't even explain to parliament why he, rather than Malcolm Turnbull, is in that job, much less what he stands for. The bill before us today would see the most significant changes to the Family Court system since it was established by the Whitlam government in 1975. The Family Court is a proud Whitlam legacy. Like most of the  great reforms that have occurred in this nation, it is a Labor legacy, a Labor reform making a difference to the power relationships in society, transferring some of the power that existed prior to 1975 with men in relationships to women and children. That's what the Family Court's creation was about-to be something that made a big difference; something that reactionaries wouldn't work out why it's a problem, that it would simply be dismissed. As part of Gough Whitlam's focus on contemporary relevance, these reforms sought to bring the laws governing this nation in line with the reality of life in 1970s Australia and beyond. It also included, of course, nofault divorce, which prior to then didn't even exist. Prior to then, we had outrageous legal action in the courts of Australia, where women in particular were vilified and put through incredible trauma as a result of nothing other than the power relationships which existed in society and which were ratified by the court at that time. That's why this debate is important. This bill has been slammed by the sector, which is understandably furious about the lack of consultation beyond the Chief Justice of the Family Court and the Chief Justice of the Federal Court. Indeed, the president of the New South Wales Law Society had this to say: … the government should be condemned for going through what is clearly a sham consultation process. … You don't do this sort of thing on the run. The president of the Law Council of Australia said this: We owe it to the people caught-up in the family law system not to give the most significant court changes since 1975 a mere cursory glance, or a simple tick-and-flick And the president of the New South Wales Bar Association said: There should be no indecent haste to attempt to ram through the Parliament proposed legislation that should be carefully considered and assessed based on evidence. The fact is that when the experts themselves are telling you that you have it wrong then you're wrong. The government would be wise to listen to these leading legal voices who don't want to see this policymaking on the run. The fact is that these reforms are significant. They would fundamentally change the way that families, lawyers and advocates interact with the family law sector. The bill before us won't solve the present-day problems in the Family Court. There are unacceptable delays and backlogs which only add to the pain of those caught up in the system, but much of this backlog is a consequence of inadequate funding for the court system, inadequate funding for legal assistance services and the failure of the former Attorney-General, George Brandis, to appoint replacements for judges as they retired. We know this because former Family Court Chief Justice, Diana Bryant, has called on the federal government to boost funding. The former Chief Justice told the ABC: … while overall delays in the Family Court were about 17 months from filing to hearing, some people have to wait up to three years to get their case to trial. That is three years of stress for everyone involved-parents and children. As former Chief Justice Bryant said: There are very vulnerable people caught up in the system and at the moment we are powerless to do a lot about it. … I feel as though the Government doesn't understand the effect this is having on families. This bill won't fix any of these problems. What it will do instead is end specialist expertise in Family Court matters, handing all family law matters to the more generalist Federal Circuit Court. While the Federal Circuit Court currently handles a large number of these cases, the most complex cases are reserved for the Family Court. This court is presided over by specialist judges with appropriate experience, which is why these cases can take longer to resolve. It certainly is not a reason to get rid of the court altogether. The government also wants to abolish the specialist appeals division of the Family Court and hand that function to the Federal Court instead. That is in spite of the fact that the Federal Court has never handled family law before. Now, this government is trying to ram these bills through before its 1 January 2019 deadline. Firstly, it tried to restrict the time given for submissions to just three weeks, for bills that are nearly 500 pages long. Then, after the Senate inquiry period was extended, with the report date due on 15 April 2019, the government tried to rush the process, forcing a Senate committee vote to change the reporting date back to 26 November 2018. At the time, the Deputy Clerk said that even with the committee's resolution the bill cannot be put to the Senate for debate until after the 15 April 2019 date that has been set by the Senate. Thankfully, common sense has prevailed and the government has dumped its idea to have reporting before the end of the year, but even now the coalition is trying to rush the bill through the lower house even though it can't go through the upper house until after April of 2019. It makes no sense at all. It is just the latest example of a government that acts increasingly like an opposition in exile on the government benches. They're not worthy of being ministers. They're much more comfortable with being opposition  spokespeople, because they're defined time and time again by what they're against. The only thing that they're in favour of is various factional manoeuvrings on their front and back benches to try to manoeuvre different people into the highest offices of the land, including prime ministerships and deputy prime ministerships, and we've had three people in each of those positions. I now, as the shadow minister, have shadowed no fewer than nine different infrastructure or urban infrastructure ministers in the last five years. None of them can get on top of their brief before they're replaced. That's why you have this extraordinary circumstance whereby, even when this government has legislation it's putting forward before the House, it's not legislation in favour of something; it's legislation which is against the parliament. On this bill they actually had two speakers who participated along with over a dozen members from this side of the House. Next we have the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Housing Affordability) Bill 2017, on which there are eight speakers from the opposition and none from the government, and then we have the Fair Work Amendment (Family and Domestic Violence Leave) Bill 2018, on which there are 20 speakers from the Labor Party and one from the government. The fact is that this government has abandoned its responsibility to promote appropriate reform, to legislate, to make Australia fairer, to promote consensus and to ensure that the parliament represents the many and is not monopolised by the concerns of just a few. But this bill is consistent with the coalition's business model, which is one of division. Instead of working with institutions, they want to tear them down. They aren't interested in listening to experts. They aren't interested in working in partnership with the community. That's why we see this flawed legislation brought before the parliament to undermine and abolish an organisation that has done work since 1975. There they have been for the better part of half a century, doing this work. They have been starved of funds, they have been starved of appointments to the judiciary and now they're saying the solution to that is just to get rid of it completely. The coalition might think it's fine to get rid of prime ministers on a whim and to get rid of deputy prime ministers on a whim, and we can't do anything about what activity coalition members engage in with that, but we can oppose the abolition of this court, and the fact is that the government is out of ideas and out of time. What they should do is call an election. We heard today in question time the Prime Minister outline why, indeed, the Victorian state election result was a good one for the coalition. If that is the basis of their logic then they should, indeed, put themselves and the nation out of their misery, allow people to have a say on issues such as this and have a government that has a positive agenda.",109
176,Mr KEOGH,BILLS," The two bills before the House today, the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2018 and the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2018, seek to make the most significant changes to the administration of family law in this country since 1975, well before I was even born. Together these bills run to almost 500 pages and ultimately seek to convert two separate court structures into one single court structure. Before coming to this place I was a lawyer. Some say there are too many lawyers in this place, but in actuality, while there are many members of this House and the other place with law degrees, a much smaller number have practised law and a much smaller number again have practised and had experience outside of the area of industrial relations. I started my legal career working in a small outer-suburban practice. The office is on the same block as my electorate office is now. The majority of the work done in that legal practice in my formative professional years was in the area of family law. As a new lawyer in our community, I was also a member of the board of Starick Services, a local community service that runs refuges and other services for victims of family and domestic violence in the electorates of Burt, Swan and Hasluck in Perth's south-eastern suburbs. Subsequently, I was a member of the executive and then President of the Law Society of Western Australia and a Director of the Law Council of Australia. Across these roles I have worked with women and men navigating the family law system-women, children and even men that have had family and domestic violence perpetrated against them-the frontline staff supporting women and children fleeing family and domestic violence, and many experienced family law practitioners across Western Australia and Australia, as well as the Family Court judiciary both at a state and federal level. And, of course, this has been followed by many friends, family and constituents who have spoken to me about their experiences of navigating the family law system across Australia. So I think I make my contribution to the debate on this legislation with some insight. The first point to acknowledge here is one of process. Ordinarily, where a government is looking to effect significant legislative and structural change with detailed and lengthy legislation, you would see wide and lengthy consultation with all stakeholders. In this case you would assume that there would have been consultation with the legal profession, judiciary, court administrators and, importantly, Family Court user groups and representatives of the families who have to navigate the Family Court system-in particular, those who can give insight into navigating such a system when not represented by a lawyer, as is the case for so many parties of family disputes.  You would also expect consultation with those able to provide views on behalf of the so many children whose lives are affected by the work of the Family Court every day, and all of this would take considerable time. You would also think that, when considering the biggest changes since the introduction of the Family Court in 1975, some 43 years ago, the government would have been keen to ensure that it gets the changes right, but in this case-and I think you know where I'm going to go with this-no. The government's handling of these changes and these bills is so poor, and their contempt for the users of the family law system so high, that they haven't bothered to talk to any of these groups. Instead, they have sought to ram the legislation through the parliament before Christmas to have a new replacement Federal Circuit and Family Law Court of Australia up and running by January. Not only is this process too swift, but it ignores that the former Attorney-General of this government, Mr Brandis, had commissioned the Australian Law Reform Commission to conduct a landmark inquiry into the family law system, which is scheduled to report at the end of March next year. How on earth can it be a good idea to seek to rush through massive structural changes to the Family Court before the government has the recommendations for reform to the family law system from the Australian Law Reform Commission? I can tell you: it's not a good idea. The concerns about this, though, are not just mine. The Law Council of Australia has said that they are deeply concerned by the truncated three-week time frame for the public to scrutinise the recently introduced merger. The President of the LCA said: We owe it to the people caught-up in the family law system not to give the most significant court changes since 1975 a mere cursory glance, or a simple tick-and-flick. The Australian Bar Association have also stated the Family Court: … should not be dismantled after 40 years of operation without careful consideration of the value that maintaining a properly resourced specialist family court would bring. Key here, of course, is the emphasis on the description of such a court, whichever court, as being 'properly resourced', but I'll return to that later. In response to such process concerns, Labor and the crossbenchers in the Senate have voted to provide the Senate committee reviewing this legislation through to April to review and report. This timing will ensure that consideration can be given to the findings of the Australian Law Reform Commission's inquiry as well as to allow extensive consultations and hearings by that committee around Australia. Let's now turn to the content and effect of these bills, which is to abolish the Family Court of Australia and to rename the Federal Circuit Court-previously the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia-as the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia. But don't let that name mislead you. There will be the creation of a new division of the renamed Federal Circuit Court, division 1, which will have the original jurisdiction of the Family Court. Its judges will be transferred to that division. This will make the remainder of the existing Federal Circuit Court division 2 of the new court to be established. The appellate jurisdiction of the former Family Court will be transferred over to the Federal Court. The new Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia will have new rules and a combined registry. As someone who has been involved in the review of court rules, this is no trifling exercise in and of itself, and yet we seek to rush the legislation through. As a Western Australia, I can see merit in the merger of the work of the Family Court of Australia and the family law jurisdiction of the Federal Circuit Court into one court, because that is what we have in the Family Court of Western Australia. The benefits of that model are clear and it's easy for all to see. Indeed, the singular court of this nature was recommended by a review commissioned during the time of Attorney-General MCClelland about a decade ago. But that is not what is happening here. Instead, the government is proposing to make the current Family Court a mere division of the Federal Circuit Court, with the new merged court continuing to have the general federal jurisdiction. Many, including myself, would say that this is not a good model in and of itself. But it gets worse, because the Attorney-General has stated it is the intention of this government to no longer appoint new judges to the new division 1-that's the family division-of the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia as they retire. The effect of this will see not only the eventual removal of a dedicated family law division of the court, but also much worse. It will see a movement away from and eventual abolition of specialist family law judges. Just so this point is abundantly clear: understand that at present to be appointed a Family Court judge, not only must the usual qualifications for judicial appointment be met but also the person must be, by reason of training, experience and personality, a suitable person to deal with matters of family law. Let's be clear here: the Family Court and the practice of family law is a specialist area of jurisprudence and jurisdiction. It was created more than 40 years ago for a very important reason-that is, recognising the delicate nature of family proceedings. These are not commercial disputes. These are not criminal proceedings. These are  dealing literally with people's lives and with their most intimate relations, whether they merely continue to be married and it's for how they dispose of property between themselves or, more regularly, for how they will continue to care for their children and how their children will have access to their parents. In way too many cases, we have the overlay of family and domestic violence involved as well. So to remove the concept and to remove the idea of a specialist Family Court from our nation's jurisprudence is a significant and, I think, negative thing. But not only that, the government proposes to do it on a whim by creating a merged federal jurisdiction by no longer having specialist judges appointed in this area of law. One may say, 'Thank God for the Family Court of Western Australia,' where we will keep that separate specialist system. I've mentioned the concerns that have been raised by some in the legal profession. In fact, it's even the case that the judges in the Family Court have complained about this process and about what is proposed. Concerning to them, as I think it is concerning to many, is that the government has based its proposal for this merger of courts on a desktop review of statistics which does not in any way understand the fundamental differences of the two courts that are proposed to be merged or have any understanding whatsoever of the nature of Family Court disputes. As I said, I have sympathy for and can see the benefit of a singular Family Court in Australia as we have in Western Australia, but that is not what is actually proposed here. What is actually proposed here is the abolition of a specialist Family Court and, over time, the abolition of any specialist Family Court judges operating in a federal jurisdiction whatsoever so as to leave it to general law judges in the federal sphere, whether they be in the Circuit Court or on appeal in the Federal Court. That is an unacceptable situation, and I see no basis for it. No-one has put forward any basis for it. The government wishes to proceed with it without the benefit of any information coming from the Law Reform Commission, who won't proceed until March. While we're here, the government says, based on its desktop review, that there should be efficiencies and that the delays are too long. Absolutely they are right; the delays in the family law system are too long. They create injustices in themselves, they create retraumatisation in themselves and they make situations that are clearly already bad within a family much worse. But the key to solving that issue is fundamentally different. The issue there is one of resourcing. It's one of resourcing for the courts. It's one of resourcing for family mediation services. It's one of resourcing, critically, for legal aid and other legal assistance services. To give you a very solid example of the way in which family law and the administration through our courts has in no way been assisted and in which the funding has been constrained, in 1975, when the Family Court was established in Western Australia-it is a joint federal-state jurisdiction-there were five judges of that court. Fast forward 43 years. You might imagine there's been some population growth in that time, but how many judges are there in the Family Court of Western Australia? Five. We have seen no increase in the number of judges whatsoever in Western Australia. There has been an increase in numbers in some of the other Family Court registries around Australia, but in no way have those increases kept pace with the increase in population or the increase in the number, nature and complexity of the cases that are now being dealt with in family law courts around Australia. We also have a situation where this court, understandably, often-in fact, in probably the majority of casesinvolves at least one side not being represented legally. What that presents is cause for delay, misunderstanding and injustices. Despite some of the rhetoric that get from those on the other side of the House, on the government benches-you would think that at least the Attorney-General, of all people, would know better-particularly in the family law jurisdiction, it is the lawyers that are doing the hardest work in nearly all cases to try and make these matters come to resolution more quickly and more justly. They understand the system. They understand the issues. They understand the evidence that needs to be pulled out. They understand the work that needs to go into presenting a full case before the court and meeting resolution. Very often it's because of the work of those lawyers, when they're available to do that work, that these matters can be resolved by consent and don't require trial in the first place. But very often, because at least one of the parties can't get that legal representation and advice, many matters which probably could have been resolved earlier are dragged out, do have to be deferred, do have to be adjourned, and eventually still have to go to trial. There is a resolution available here, and it's about making sure that we have a properly funded legal aid and civil litigation system and that we are providing that legal assistance to those who need it. One of the most traumatic things that can happen in a person's life is having to go through the family law system, so the government should actually pay attention to the real issues instead of stuffing this around.",111
177,Mr NEUMANN,BILLS," I rise to speak on the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2018 and Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2018. These bills are the government's very big step towards amalgamating the Federal Circuit Court of Australia and the Family Court of Australia under the guise of resolving issues in those courts. Specialist judges within the family law system have a vital role to play in extremely complex family law cases, but the court is grossly under resourced. The court system is experiencing serious issues, with many families being denied expeditious, just and cost-effective resolution. And the government believes, wrongly I think, that this bill will make change to see cases finalised faster and with greater cost saving for users. The amalgamation will result in a single point of entry for all family law and general law cases through the new Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia. Appeals would be heard by a single judge of the Federal Court. Issues could have been resolved, as I say, through adequate funding of court and legal-aid support services. This bill is abolition of the family law system by stealth. Before I entered politics in 2007, I was an accredited family law specialist and partner of a Brisbane CBD law firm, so I come to this debate with a degree of interest and expertise having spent hundreds, if not thousands, of hours in the Family Court and Federal Magistrates Court, as it was then called. I support the purpose and intention of the family law system and any reformation which seeks to improve the family law system for the benefit of Australians. Most Australians are not charged with criminal offences. Most Australians don't go to court over civil actions, debt recovery or indeed personal-injury actions, but they interact with the family law system. About one in three first marriages break up; about one in two second marriages break up. It's in those circumstances that people interact most often than not with the family law system. And indeed it is the case that these bills seek to make very large changes to that system-the largest change since the Whitlam government introduced the Family Court of Australia in 1975. Following its election in 1972, the Whitlam government set about making changes to the archaic laws on divorce, custody, access and family law matters. In September 1973 the then Attorney-General, Senator Lionel Murphy, introduced the Family Law Bill into the Senate for consideration and comment. This bill proposed a 12month separation as the only grounds for no-fault divorce. This applied, of course, an historic precedent being established. Prior to that, there were shocking examples of private investigators being engaged and people having to prove all manner of things against each other. No-fault divorce was a seminal and important reform. Detailed provisions were made relating to property settlement, and custody and maintenance expanded beyond proceedings to include property, spousal maintenance, and, eventually, child maintenance and child support. We have seen a major expansion of jurisdiction from the Matrimonial Causes Act, which previously was confined to those aspects of divorce. It was originally intended these matters would be heard in the supreme courts of the states or a proposed superior court of Australia. However, the later establishment was defeated by two votes in the Senate in 1974 and a tied vote in 1975. The legislation provided options for the state to establish state family courts with federal-government funding. But by August 1975, Western Australia, as the member for Burt said, was the only state to take up the invitation. Following the dismissal of the instrumental and important reform in government-the Whitlam government-the incoming government attempted to revitalise the offer to the states to establish their own courts, but this failed. In January 1976, Elizabeth Evatt, Austin Asche, Kenneth Pawley and John Ellis were sworn as judges of the Family Court of Australia, a ceremony in Sydney presided over by what I am sure would be a very happy Justice Lionel Murphy, the main architect of the court. The Family Court was established with a view to having a specialised court so that complex legal matters could be presided over by specialist judges. Across the court's history, its role has expanded to include what was then called contact, parental responsibility, child support, leave to adopt, Hague Conventions on child abduction, and matters concerning sterilisation of children involving parental responsibility and also gender reassignment-a vast expansion of the court's jurisdiction, often done through COAG arrangements and agreement. The Senate committee which oversaw the initial process at the time that the court was established made a recommendation that judges be appointed where 'by reason of training, experience and personality, the person is a suitable person to deal with matters of family law'. This gave rise to section 22 of the Family Law Act, which is arguably one of the most important features of the court, ensuring cases would be presided over by specialist judges. The establishment of the Family Court of Australia has been one of the most significant improvements to our legal system in the last half century. It brought the legal profession of Australia to the forefront of reform and remains one of Labor's most significant achievements. It has been copied, internationally recognised and praised. In 1999 the Howard Liberal coalition government attempted to provide a quicker and cheaper option for litigants in family law matters and established the Federal Magistrates Court, which is the antecedent, of course, of the current Federal Circuit Court. I don't think that was a smart move. I have never thought it was a good move. I don't think it resulted in better justice for people. They then endeavoured to curb, by the way, the jurisdiction of the court in parenting issues in part VII of the Family Law Act by curbing and prescribing-indeed, meddling in-the court's jurisdiction and discretion with respect to parenting audits by imposing a prescriptive hierarchy of considerations for the court to determine, with primary and secondary considerations in terms of parenting orders that a court would make.  Now we have a Liberal government and a Liberal Attorney-General attempting to fix up the mistakes of his predecessors in underfunding and underresourcing legal aid, community legal centres and the Family Court system itself by arguing that this is a reform. It's not reform at all. It won't fix up the system, it won't make it cheaper and it is not better. There are many people who appear in the Federal Circuit Court and the Family Court who are self-represented, and judges painstakingly and with a lot of care and consideration assist those people in these matters to represent themselves to the best of their ability. It's not uncommon for any court listing in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Parramatta or whatever to find 40 per cent or more of people being self-represented in those cases at first instance. Many people can't afford the cost involved in litigation. But I can say-and the member for Burt is right-that my experience is that most lawyers try to settle cases. Most people come in with the best of intentions, and it is indeed the fact that 95 per cent of cases settle before getting to a final hearing. I personally did far more consent orders, agreements that were filed and approved by court, than court hearings that lasted, say, two, three, four, even 14 days or longer. The courts handle over 106,000 family law applications each year, and a significant portion of this number is the 43,800 divorce applications to the Federal Circuit Court. They are done more often than not by themselves. There were 14,200 consent orders made in terms of applications to the court last year. Twenty thousand, five hundred final order applications were received each year, with the vast majority of those received by the Federal Circuit Court. Currently, family law applications can be lodged in either the Family Court or Federal Circuit Court. Often cases of two days or fewer in terms of length and about less complex and simpler matters are lodged in the Federal Circuit Court, and matters can be transferred. Complex matters involving significant child abuseoften called Magellan type cases-are often dealt with in a separate list by Family Court judges with particular expertise. Quick, less complex applications, as I've said, are referred to the Federal Circuit Court, and I have seen and been personally involved in many cases where matters were transferred between courts. The report commissioned by the government and conducted by PwC over a relatively short period of time really was a complete failure of this government. The way they did it was a really bad mistake. The data wasn't sufficient to determine the complexity of how the courts varied. It was really a desktop arrangement. PwC were quick to infer the Family Court was less efficient. The Family Court is not without failings, faults and foibles. It's not without problems. Any lawyer who practised in the jurisdiction would get frustrated with delays and backed up caseloads, which contribute to the frustration and anguish of those caught up in the system. At times it seemed like the delays resulted in people going through the pain of divorce a second time. This was particularly the case if final orders weren't made expeditiously and with care by judges in relation to parenting issues. People couldn't get on with their lives in terms of property settlement. But often judges dealt with cases with real expertise, care and consideration. They understood the vagaries and frailty of human nature and understood the jurisprudence in this area. I'm very concerned that we'll have judges who are not trained and don't have long experience practising the jurisprudence of family law. Indeed, I've seen judges who've been appointed to courts exercising family law jurisdiction-fine lawyers in their own right and very capable in, perhaps, commercial law, building law or criminal law-struggle, from time to time, to get their heads around financial circumstances and complex property matters, or difficult Hague convention cases-very challenging cases involving the most horrible child abuse. The legislation before the chamber is not the way to go. It's unsurprising there's a backlog of cases. It could be addressed with proper funding of the court system and better funding of legal aid to make sure people have representation. One thing about having legal representation and going through a court system is that often it equalises the power imbalance for women who have been physically or sexually abused, who, understandably, feel they want to settle the matter and get on with their lives but will not achieve the kind of property settlement, spousalmaintenance support and child support outcomes that I would describe as a fair and just settlement under, historically, sections 79(4) and 75(2) of the Family Law Act. The President of the Law Council, in May this year, said: Further investment in the courts and legal aid is still required to deliver the best outcomes for children and Australian families. And I say: amen to that! Presently, as I said before, the majority of cases are handled by the Federal Circuit Court, and the most complex matters are reserved for the more experienced specialist judges who preside over the Family Court. I've seen circumstances in which people have been appointed to the Appeals Division of the Family Court and the government has not appointed a replacement for that judge, who deals with trial matters-matters at first instance, interim hearings and final hearings. That's one reason there are delays. If you appoint an experienced judge who's dealing with matters at the trial level, or the final hearing level, to the Appeals Division then you'll have a backlog. That's the trouble: they're not appointing the judges that they need and resourcing the courts the way they need to. This is a significant change to our court system. It is a big change that will have an impact on people.  Friday last week, across Australia, we marked White Ribbon Day, and yesterday, Sunday, was International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women. On Friday I was privileged to be at Ipswich State High School. I want to congratulate Sarah Lake, the year 7 student welfare officer, and Principal Simon Riley, a White Ribbon ambassador, as I have been, who made a fantastic speech on the issue of violence against women, about how men have to respect women and people need to change. Domestic violence takes place in many ways. It can be physical and sexual abuse, familial isolation, religious persecution, financial domination-there are a whole range of manners in which it can be exercised, and it's shocking; it's a disgrace. Men need to have a look at themselves, because it happens at all levels of our society. I also want to congratulate the Zonta Club of Ipswich. I was there yesterday, with the member for Ipswich, Jennifer Howard, for the launch of the club's 16 days of activism against domestic violence. I'll have an 'orange lady', as they call it, with slogans all over it in my office-I always have one. I want to encourage and congratulate the President, Pat Evatt, and all the members of the Zonta Club of Ipswich for their activism in this space. I want to finish on this note: these are very complex areas to deal with. The government are swiftly trying to introduce changes, which I think has been a farce from the start. They should listen to the Bar Association, the Law Council of Australia and other stakeholders, as the member for Burt mentioned. The government should have a look at themselves again and look at the history of this court. If they funded the courts properly and funded legal aid properly we wouldn't have the problems we're having in the system.",113
178,Ms CLAYDON,BILLS," I rise to join my colleagues in speaking on the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2018 and the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2018. If this proposed set of reforms was to proceed, it would represent the most significant change to family courts since they were created some four decades ago by the Whitlam government. Together, these would see the Family Court of Australia merge with the Federal Circuit Court. There would be a single Chief Justice and a single set of rules. If the government's plan is carried out in the way it has been outlined in these bills before the House, it would also see the end of specialist expertise within the Family Court. What this government effectively wants to do is hand all family law matters, over time, to the more generalist Federal Circuit Court. Concerningly, this would include family law specialists who are specially trained to deal with family violence from the system. Labor will oppose these bills, because the government has fundamentally failed to make the case that this change is indeed the best way forward. This government has been adamant that these changes will increase efficiency in the system. But it is utterly unclear how what the government is proposing will in fact reduce waiting times, create faster dispute resolution or reduce costs. There is no evidence that these reforms would result in an improved service or outcome for members of the public using these courts. We are seriously concerned about the government's appalling lack of consultation with stakeholders. It is hard to overstate what a seismic change this would be, and yet it's hard to understate the work that the government is putting into making sure it is the right way to proceed. Labor does not take our family courts for granted, and it is extremely worried about the consequences of such enormous change undertaken without due process or consideration. Labor understands that the family law system is under dire pressure at the moment, make no mistake. As many as 22,000 family law final order cases are filed annually across both courts. The number of cases awaiting resolution has grown from 17,000 to 21,000 under this government's watch, and median time to trial has ballooned from 10.8 months to 15.2 months in the Federal Circuit Court and from 11.5 months to 17 months in the Family Court. The personal impacts of this mess on the families caught up in the Family Court system are diabolical. People are left waiting in limbo, sometimes for years, for their cases to be resolved. This isn't just an inconvenience. It is a serious matter of community safety, given that we know that the majority of these families are facing tragic issues including domestic violence, substance abuse and extreme family breakdown. We also know that womenwho are most often the victims of this family violence-are at their most vulnerable when they actually take these actions against their abusive former partner. That is when they are in the most danger. Yet these cases now are dragging out for months and months, and, indeed, years. A fundamental driver of this backlog is that the government has utterly failed to adequately fund the Family Court system. Nor has it invested in desperately needed resources in legal assistance services. This is an observation that the Social Policy and Legal Affairs Committee made when it looked at the family law system and delivered a report to this parliament only months ago-a report that this government appears to be taking zero interest in, despite having designed the terms of reference and asked the committee to undertake the inquiry. The government is currently showing the same discourtesy to the Australian Law Reform Commission, which was asked to undertake a root-and-branch review of the system over a two-year period.  But this sentiment about the lack of funding and adequate resourcing is also echoed by the Law Council of Australia president, Morry Bailes, who said: Chronic underfunding for more than a decade has led to a court system which continually struggles to meet the needs of the community. And that is what is at stake. In March, the Law Council of Australia released an issues paper that acknowledged the growing complexity of family law cases and that the Commonwealth, as a bare minimum, needed to commit to a substantial funding boost to remedy the significant delays. The council also recommended a substantial increase in legal aid funding to improve justice outcomes and the efficiency of court proceedings. But you won't hear the government talk about this, and this bill demonstrates how completely deaf they still are to these critical concerns. Regretfully, but certainly not surprisingly, the measures in this bill provide no extra funding for the chronically under-resourced court system or associated support services. That is zero additional funding. Since it came to power, the government has consistently demonstrated that it's more interested in propping up tax breaks for high-income earners than properly investing in the Australian courts that tens of thousands of families in distress rely on year after year. Not only has the government ignored stakeholders and Australian families caught up in this fractured system but they've tried to overrule the democratic will of the Senate to ram their bill through the parliament. Recently, the Senate voted to extend the deadline for the legislative inquiry report until 15 April next year. This would ensure enough time for thorough consultation, and the Australian Law Reform Commission's review of the family law system could then be taken into account. But government members of the committee initially refused the Senate's demands and instead set their own reporting deadline of 25 November this year. This would have meant that stakeholders would only have had three weeks to make submissions to these bills, which stretch over 500 pages. Then the committee would only have had three days to consider submissions before the final report was published. To make these huge structural changes to the Family Court system before the commission had completed its report is both reckless and foolish. The Australian Bar Association president, Noel Hutley, has recognised the importance of parliamentary oversight, stating: The ABA remains of the view that any legislation to restructure Australia's family law system requires close and careful examination by Parliament. I am very pleased that the government has succumbed to the pressure from Labor and other stakeholders and backed down from this shameless attempt to ram this bill through the committee process and deny it the time it needs to undertake this inquiry properly. But this still leaves massive problems with the government's consultation process to date. Who did the government actually consult in the development of these bills? Well, the Chief Justice of the Family Court and the Chief Judge of the Federal Circuit Court. And that is it. Indeed, virtually the entire basis of the government's argument is a PwC report commissioned by the Attorney General which was the result of just six weeks of desktop research, and included consultation with only senior stakeholders. The government hasn't bothered to talk to the people and the groups who use the family law system every day-the family groups, the registrars, the legal assistance services, the lawyers and the judges. I've spoken to a number of legal professionals in my community about what these changes will mean, and I have to say that they've been unequivocal about the need to avoid damaging and reckless action without thorough consideration of the outcomes. Indeed, concerns raised locally reflect those raised by the Australian Bar Association-the lawyers there-around how this would remedy the known existing problems in the Family Court system. My colleague, the member for Blair, before me talked about the shocking delays in judicial appointments. My goodness, in Newcastle we've experienced that first hand over a number of years. There are also enormous workloads on these judges now, to the point where there are serious concerns around judges' mental health and well-being in this country. That's not a good place for our judicial system, by anyone's measure. If the government cannot take the time to do its job properly and can't be bothered to talk to the people and the groups who are in the family law system every day, I can bring them any number of stories of people that these changes will affect. I regularly hear from constituents in my community of a system that is under extreme stress and pressure. Complicated and difficult cases with issues of family safety are at stake. They're being held up all over the country, and the human toll is immeasurable. The government's plan, through these bills, would see an end to the specialisation provided by the Family Court. What the Attorney-General effectively wants to do is hand all family matters to the more generalist Federal Circuit Court by abolishing the specialist appeals division of the Family Court and, over time, the Family Court entirely. If such a broad, sweeping change is to proceed, the government must ensure that it is making the right decisions in the best interests of those Australians suffering under the current system. At this stage, it has  fundamentally failed to make the case. Indeed, the feedback from stakeholders so far would suggest that that's because the government's plan is 'deeply flawed', 'ill considered' and 'quite possibly dangerous'. A quick perusal of the submissions that this inquiry received illustrates the depth of concern stakeholders have and demonstrates how important it is that this inquiry is given the time it needs to do its job. I would like to share a few of these contributions with the chamber today. The Queensland Law Society said: In our view, the proposed reforms are significantly flawed and the Bills will not achieve their intended objective. Their submission went on to say: … this would see a court well-versed in sensitive family law matters abolished in favour of a court which handles multiple areas of law. We submit that this would be to the detriment of families who will not have the benefit of the expertise the Family Court currently provides. Women's Legal Services Australia was equally cautionary, raising its deep concerns, which include:  Lack of attention in the Bills to considerations of safety.  Lack of consultation with family violence experts and victim-survivors.  Unbalanced focus on financial efficiencies and 'desktop analysis' … All of this is gravely worrying. In the week of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women and in a year when 66 women already have lost their lives at the hands of violence in Australia, this government is proposing a move that might compromise their safety even further. This is utterly unforgivable. Sadly, that wasn't an isolated view. Indeed, the safe steps Family Violence Response Centre submitted to the inquiry that: … the Bills will result in a loss of family law specialisation, diminishing the courts' capacity to understand the nature and dynamics of family violence, and respond in a way that is trauma-informed and ensures the safety of victim survivors. In particular, it is not clear whether new judges appointed to the new family law division or the family law appeal division would be required to have specialist family law and family violence expertise. This was echoed by Domestic Violence NSW, which submitted: DVNSW is concerned that this will result in the loss of the current expertise and specialist features in the current family law system. Specialist knowledge of family law and family violence is critical in ensuring the safety of women and children experiencing domestic violence. These are not small quibbles. They are profound flaws that may point to a serious risk to the safety of women and children facing domestic and family violence. In summary, this bill demonstrates the Morrison government's arrogance. They have utterly failed to undertake appropriate consultation with stakeholders and Australians in relation to the most significant changes to the Family Court since its establishment. They have tried to ram these changes through with scant regard for their potentially massive impacts. Early feedback suggests that the responses of key stakeholders is almost universally negative, with serious concerns about women's and children's safety. I implore this government to give up this fanciful and ridiculous reform. (Time expired)",116
179,Ms TEMPLEMAN,BILLS," In the last few days, Elizabeth Evatt, the first Chief Justice of the Family Court of Australia, has shared her views on the decision by this government to combine the Federal Circuit Court and the Family Court into one. In a Sydney Morning Herald interview, she describes it as a 'personal disappointment' and points out: When we set it up the Family Court was provided with internal counseling and mediation services. It was meant to be a place where you would get your issues resolved without having to resort to litigation but all those services have been reduced and, as they say, privatised. She is absolutely right that many of the things that really were pivotal to this being a huge reform of the Whitlam government have been weakened in recent years. There is no doubt that there are problems and things need to change. The Family Court system is a source of pain to many of my constituents. The main complaints are the long time it takes to have matters dealt with and the huge cost involved in resolving child custody issues. It can take years, not months-years when people are in limbo before they get a resolution. I've seen dads in pain at the prolonged separation from their children. I've seen mothers in agony at this limbo in their lives. I've seen grandparents torn by the loss of contact or upheaval in their grandchildren's lives. The mental toll it's taking is unacceptable. At the heart of it all, while I don't personally get to see it because they don't walk into my office or email me or stop me in the street, I know there are children whose futures are being changed by the long delays and tortuous process  that their parents go through. I'm concerned about the dangers of doing things that will make the current situation worse. These bills, taken as a whole, represent the most significant changes proposed in the family law courts since they were created in 1975 by the Whitlam government. Basically, the Federal Circuit Court and the Family Court become a single structure under the one umbrella, with a single chief justice and deputy chief justice, and a single set of rules. While they now have separate divisions and, we understand, will carry on the same roles they have now within this umbrella structure, the Attorney-General has expressed an intention not to appoint new judges to the division handling Family Court matters. That amounts to a gradual abolition of the Family Court over time. The appeals division of the Family Court would also be abolished and transferred to the Federal Court. These are not minor changes. Let's be clear about this: this is abolishing the Family Court, a legacy of the Whitlam government, without even bothering to speak with the families who are currently in the system. Any changes really should require wide consultation because getting this wrong impacts so profoundly on so many lives. I do want to make it absolutely clear: I believe there are serious problems with the Family Court system. In May 2017, the then Chief Justice Diana Bryant said that the court was letting families down because of huge backlogs and lack of resources. At that time she said that, while overall delays were 17 months from filing to hearing, some people were having to wait three years to get their case heard. She also said the court was so under-resourced that it had no ability to provide post-order checks on whether family orders were even being complied with. The reality is that much of the backlog is due to inadequate funding of the court system, inadequate funding for legal assistance services and the failure of the former Attorney-General, George Brandis, to appoint replacement judges as Family Court judges retired. If the changes being proposed were part of a well-researched, well-examined process, I might not stand here with the concerns that I have. I am well aware that at the moment the Federal Circuit Court handles the majority of family law cases, but the most complicated and difficult cases are reserved for the Family Court, and it has specialist judges with appropriate experience to hear those cases. The only evidence the government has provided that their changes will work is the report it commissioned PwC to do, which involved six weeks of what's known as 'desktop research' and consultation with senior stakeholders. Let's be clear what 'desktop research', the management consultant jargon, is. It means you literally sit at your desk, you review data, you review information and you draw conclusions. It has a place, but not in a system like this. There was no requirement for these people even to walk into a court-let alone to sit through the intricacies of cases-to consult with families in the processes or to consult with the lawyers working on those cases. They haven't spoken with registrars, legal assistance services, the peak bodies of the professions involved or the organisations that advocate for victims of family violence, nor have they spoken to a wide range of judges themselves. I think this is really the Achilles heel of the plan: the lack of consultation with the people who are experiencing the current delays and challenges of the Family Court system. There's no doubt in my mind that we do need to vastly improve the way families navigate the system, so that they face fewer delays and much less trauma. But for this government to have tried to ram these bills through the Senate was never going to be in the interests of sound legislation. As the Law Council said back in August, the truncated three-week time frame for the public to scrutinise the bills was 'deeply concerning', and that puts it mildly. As Law Council of Australia president, Morry Bailes, said: We owe it to the people caught-up in the family law system not to give the most significant court changes since 1975 a mere cursory glance or a simple tick-and-flick. I couldn't agree more. I think the significance of the Family Court and the challenges its judiciary face in their determinations cannot be underestimated. There is no doubt that their decisions can be life changing and I, for one, would like to know that the expertise is deep in that bench, not dividing its time between the full range of Federal Circuit Court matters. There is no good reason to rush this through the House, and the Senate inquiry which is currently underway needs to be given the time to do the work this government has failed to do in writing the legislation. The Law Council and the Australian Bar Association have both called for much more thorough consultation, as has virtually every group involved in this part of the legal process, and we would agree on this side of the House. I'm pleased that the Senate has decided it would not allow this to be rushed through. This House should wait for the outcome of the Senate inquiry too, as well as the completion of the landmark Australian Law Reform Commission review into the entire family law system. I'm not a lawyer and I've never had personal involvement with the Family Court. My first awareness of the Family Court was a very, very public tragedy. I was a final-year university student when the aunt of one of my close school friends was killed by a bomb at her home in July 1984. Pearl Watson, the wife of Family Court judge  Ray Watson, was one of four people murdered in a series of attacks between 1980 and 1985 that targeted the judges of the Family Court and their families. A lawyer and another citizen were also killed. A trial is currently underway and a man has pleaded not guilty to the charges, so I don't intend to say any more about the actual events. All I know is that even in the very best of situations, judges of the Family Court carry a huge responsibility. As a parliament, we have an equally huge responsibility to make sure this system is well resourced, well structured and in the hands of experienced people so that families are safe and supported as they go through such difficult processes. These bills give me absolutely no confidence that that outcome would be achieved, and I cannot support them.",118
180,Ms HUSAR,BILLS," It's great to follow my colleague the member for Macquarie. She makes a very poignant point about the people whose lives have been lost through the Family Court system. In 1996, on the steps of the Parramatta Family Court, Jean Lennon was murdered by her then husband or ex-partner after they had been in the Family Court. We are not talking about something that is owed or deserves a tick-and-flick mentality. I rise today in complete opposition to the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2018. Anyone who has had any experience with the family law courts would agree that the need for reformation is significant, desperately required and overdue. However, there is absolutely no way that what this government has presented to us is anywhere close to the reform that we need. A generalist solution to some of the most complex legal issues facing our country will only cause greater risks for the children and families, like Jean Lennon, who are subjected to proceedings. The need for significant reform is great. Tinkering around the edges and taking a piecemeal approach is not good enough and will further risk the childhoods and the lives of those who are caught up. Labor members on this side of the House know how important the family courts are for protection and the outcomes for families who need it. It was Gough Whitlam and his government, after all, who in 1975 created the act, and since then it has remained unchanged with the exception of very minor amendments. Australian families now, though, look very different from how they looked in 1975. We have moved beyond those cultural and societal norms of families, and families today are made up of many different factors. We also now have a new epidemic flooring some families who find themselves needing the help of the Family Law Courts: domestic violence. Of course, it's not a new problem at all. It has existed for generations, but society has changed and formed the view that we no longer see domestic violence as a private matter. In 2017 the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs conducted an inquiry into family law and family violence and how the two are intersecting. I note that one of the members of this parliament who worked on that is sitting here at the desk. None of the 33 recommendations from our report have been actioned, none of the advice presented acknowledged and none of the committee's work-those people who gave evidence-supported. These recommendations were ignored by this government, yet they talk a big game when it comes to protecting those people who have found themselves on the receiving end of violence against women and the need to help and support women and children. Instead of acting on any of the recommendations, we find ourselves here, debating tinkering with a very complex system, and debating defunding a system whose entire jurisdiction is to support children who find themselves between parents who are at war. We know that not all family breakdowns end up before the Family Court needing such intervention, and I want to put on record my absolute applause for those adults who break up reasonably, respectfully and in a child-focused manner, recognising that, just because adult parties cannot make a relationship work, it should not mean the children in that relationship should suffer. When parents need the intervention, our system should be responsive. It should support the children and support them in a way that responds to their needs. The backlogs in the Family Court are causing serious issues and creating dangerous and painful situations for those who are stuck in the system. The solution is not to wipe out the entire system. It needs investment, it needs reform and it needs urgent attention. The delays are costing families huge sums of money and causing swathes of distress, and kids are being punished by having their lives placed in limbo by the ongoing delays. Take a family who has a child who is four years old. They break up. Custody over that child is contested. The child at some point over the next two years has to enrol in kindergarten, but the parents can't agree. They go back to court, each swearing an affidavit, each having representation, each facing costs. The court and the judge-a person who is not an expert on this child-make a decision in their life. That child now faces being seven or eight years old in the current system before their matter is completely resolved and they have any certainty over their lives. That is a quarter of that little person's childhood forever drained from their life because this government cannot be bothered to address the delays that we now see.  Our court officers, judges and those who work in the family system need to be shown more respect by this government and have their work valued and supported, not relegated to a cost-saving exercise. This legislation that is proposed by this hapless, incompetent government who fail to see the importance of family law in our society will leave families in further crisis. I have risen a number of times in this House to bring this to the parliament's attention-to no avail though. The proposed removal of judges who are specialists that preside over matters relating to children and complex family matters is a disgrace. When you need a script for medication, you go to the doctor, a GP, not a surgeon. When you need help with your family law matter, you need a family law practitioner, not a commercial lawyer. It is basic common sense but not for this government, who, sadly, see family law as a good place to scrape a few modest savings together at the expense of so many and our society at large. The Federal Circuit Court judges have broader experience and decide on matters as varied as trademark law, workplace relations and administrative law. Eighty per cent of matters in the Federal Circuit Court involve far less complex cases. The Family Law Court has carriage of 20 per cent of the family court matters. These are complex issues facing our society that require specialised skill and the experience of the judges that are hearing the case. These 20 per cent of cases are complicated and they can involve a range of social issues, including drug and alcohol abuse, child abuse, criminal matters, family and domestic violence, and mental ill health. These matters are serious, they are complex and they deserve the attention of judges who are specialised and equipped to deal with such things. This simplistic approach of rolling these two courts together, as proposed by this inept government on the other side, does not do anything for those families who have complex matters that require detailed and thorough hearings. These are the families who painfully and traumatically relived their experiences to give evidence at our inquiry. We've asked them for their input, but they have been ignored. The lack of consultation with regard to this bill has angered so many in the sector. Stakeholders have not been consulted. The Law Council, the legal assistance services and judges themselves have protested to the government on this matter. It is incredibly unusual to hear judges speak out on these matters, but they have been blowing their whistles as best they can in their positions. They're forced into defending themselves as they're accused by this government of not performing adequately. The consultation has been botched and Minister Porter owes nothing short of an apology to those who have had aspersions cast on them and their work. We then had the debacle over the consultation period and the changes to it, which came after the government announced the Australian Law Reform Commission would 'holistically and thoroughly investigate' and report back on the family law system. It's due next year. It's possibly the largest, most significant review of its kind to be undertaken in this complex family law system. This government is now not waiting for that inquiry to run its course and to make findings based on a thorough investigation-an inquiry, mind you, that it asked for. This inquiry will be wide ranging and will take evidence from many people who are currently in the system. This inquiry is landmark and is due to report on 31 March next year. It makes no sense whatsoever to rush or make any substantive changes before that time. Due process, adequate consultation and proper decision-making must take place given the scale of the changes that are proposed and the magnitude this court has over the lives of so many families. Family law is a serious issue. This government should be taking its responsibility to the people inside the system equally seriously. The bill needs proper consultation with input from the sector, and the government should not ignore the advice from experts that it already has in front of it. It is time to face reality and admit that it got this wrong; to listen to those who have had everyday experience of the family law system, who deserve to have their say; and to improve it for the next family who find themselves there. It would be pure arrogance for Minister Porter, the Attorney-General, to continue with the proposed changes, which are ill-conceived and illthought through. Sure, the government's proposed changes could streamline the system, but we know that there is not a one-size-fits-all square peg to the hole that is family law. Packaging it up neatly may work as a solution on a spreadsheet or to a bean counter or on Minister Porter's notebook but, trust me, in real life, it will not. I have a solution for him, since he seems devoid of any real ideas. How about we invest in the system? The solution is to provide the courts with the funding that they need, unlike the underfunded system we currently see. The member for Macquarie pointed out Chief Justice Diana Bryant's comments last year, where she was begging for more money and resources. This proposed bill smacks of cost saving, but it will cost our nation so much more in damages if the social fabric of our families and our communities is tarnished in this way. Ensuring that there is a large pool of judges, experienced and ready and able to fill the benches as our retiring judges leave, will provide the human resources to hear more cases in a more timely and effective manner. There is an economic and social benefit in getting through the backlog.  Minister Porter is suggesting that family law court judges would face certain extinction, slowly dying out as the government refuses to replace the retiring judges. Their solution to allow generalist judges to hear complex law cases is just simply not acceptable. All the government has as evidence that this will work is a report commissioned by consultancy PricewaterhouseCoopers, which took six weeks of desktop research as well as some consultation with a few senior stakeholders. That report made some very heroic assumptions, including that there was an equivalent level of complexity between the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court. That is patently a ridiculous assumption to make and it undermines the findings of this report, which, unsurprisingly, was that the Family Court was less efficient than the Federal Circuit Court-hardly surprising when you're dealing with such complex cases. The government has handled this bill incredibly poorly and has not bothered to talk to people and groups who are in the family law system every single day: the family groups, the charities, the registrars, the legal assistance services, the lawyers and the judges to name but a few. There are absolutely serious issues facing the Family Court right now. Delays are one part. The idea that you can give the courts less money to do more with is absolutely absurd. The government continue to run a flawed agenda with a process they do not comprehend and they are relegating families and, moreover, vulnerable children to lives on a waiting list-lives which are unstable and unpredictable. The government have the capacity right now to act by giving money to the courts and by replacing the judges who have recently retired, to enable more cases to be heard in a timely manner and get those families off the waiting list. Families should not be in limbo for four years because this government see them as a place to save money. This week I have the pleasure of arranging a briefing for members of the community who know too well the shortcomings of the family law system, who know what it's like to be affected by it and who work with children who have been devastated as a result of the inadequate process of the family law system. They will come to Canberra to advocate for a better, fairer system that is focused on better, more timely outcomes for families who need it. My great fear is that, 20 years from now, someone occupying these benches will get up and make a national apology to those families being disadvantaged by the current delays. We can stand up in this place and debate this and speak to the complexities of the delays, time frames and legal-speak but, at the end of the day, we are talking about our children. We are talking about their lives and their stability. All of us in here, each and every person, who haven't experienced the dog's breakfast of family law should be grateful. The government needs a laser-like focus trained on the outcomes for children who are subject to the Family Court. It needs a laser-like focus on bringing change that is needed and funding that is so desperately required. Anything less than that is an abject failure to do the exact thing government is supposed to do, which is protect its citizens. I applaud the work of all those people in the system and thank them for their tireless work on behalf of the families and children who find themselves there. It is not a choice that people voluntarily submit themselves to without good reason. The work that these people do is intense and the consequences are immense. I look forward to welcoming the delegation of family law activists this week to parliament and to working with them to ensure that the right and just outcomes are reached, not a cost-saving exercise that benefits nobody.",120
181,Ms OWENS,BILLS," When you are talking about the Family Court, you are talking about something incredibly important. Every member of this House has probably looked into the eyes of a parent who's said: 'Can I show you a photo of my children? I haven't seen them for six years.' You know, as they give you the photo, that it is going to break your heart-and it does. It breaks your heart looking at the photo, but the person giving you the photo lives with that every day. There are so many people-we all meet them every day-who struggle with the exceptional delays in the Family Court system and who are unable, even with the system that we have, to work through their relationship with their ex to do the best thing by the child and both parents. We all know this. It is a thing that breaks your heart. I am a grandparent and, if Grandad and I broke up-which we won't-I think I would just about die if I couldn't see my grandchildren. Grandad and I can't break up because I think it would kill me. It would kill me. So we're talking about something incredibly important. I'm not a lawyer at all. In fact, I'm a piano player. I'm a conservatorium graduate classical piano player. Ms Madeleine King: And parliamentarian.",122
182,Ms OWENS,BILLS,"And a parliamentarian now as well, but always a piano player. So I don't know a great deal about the legal language and legal structures that underpin our court systems. I don't. A number of speakers prior to me have spoken very eloquently about those systems. What I want to talk about today is the process-or, rather, the lack of process-that this government has embarked on in dealing with one of the most important things in people's lives, which is the welfare of their children, at one of the most difficult times in their lives,  which is during the break-up of their family. What you see when you look at the process that this government has embarked on is an extraordinary lack of care. The only way to describe it is a shocking lack of care. The two bills that we're looking at today-the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2018 and the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2018-effectively abolish the Family Court, which was established back in 1975. The legislation doesn't do it in one step. Initially, it combines two courts-the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court-into one court which effectively will remain two separate courts. But the minister has admitted that, over time, the government won't reappoint Family Court specialists. So eventually the Family Court as we know it will disappear altogether into the Federal Circuit Court. If the government had approached that idea with the proper consultation with the people who are affected by this decision, if the consultation had taken place over a long time, if there had been input, if it had been debated and discussed and if the sector had come to some agreement about the way this should be done, I probably wouldn't be up here speaking about this in the way that I am. But that hasn't happened. What we've had instead is basically a six-week desktop review by a firm that did a desktop review of the courts and decided this would bring efficiencies, and that's it. The consultation has been virtually nil. There are serious problems with the Family Court at present. There are unacceptable delays. We know that. But there are ways to deal with that, and one of them is to appropriately appoint justices. We know, for example, that back in 2016 in Parramatta we had a situation where one judge was handling 600 cases. We had the Family Court in Parramatta waiting 560 days for the replacement of a judge who had retired. We had people waiting up to three years for a settlement. Your six-month-old child is 3½ in three years. Your 10-year-old boy goes through puberty in that three years. Your 15-year-old daughter is dating. In the life of a child, three years is a long, long time, and three years in the life of a parent without a settled relationship with their child is almost unimaginable. The consultation has been so poor that, essentially, the government didn't consult with any of the people we would have expected them to consult with. They tried to push these changes through so quickly that initially they gave the sector only three weeks to comment on a bill that is some 500 pages long. As a result of that, we've had judges speaking up against these changes. Judges are usually pretty conservative in the comments they make. In this case they've been quite vocal. Virtually every association and organisation that represents the legal fraternity have had something to say about this. Organisations that represent people fleeing domestic violence have had something to say about this. Right across the board, we've had commentary after commentary on the lack of consultation by this government. The Law Council, for example, has said: The Law Council is deeply concerned by the truncated three-week time-frame for the public to scrutinise the recently introduced court merger bills. The two bills, if passed, will merge the current Federal Circuit Court of Australia and the Family Court of Australia into the new Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia. The bills signify the biggest changes to Australia's justice system in decades. On Thursday, the same day the bills were introduced in the lower house, the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee reduced the reporting deadline from 15 April 2019 to 26 November this year. The Committee also fixed a submission closing date of 14 September. Law Council of Australia President, Morry Bailes, said the peak body already held significant concerns about the proposal to merge the courts, and a three-week deadline to scrutinise the bills would short-change a court system already at breaking point. … … … ""We owe it to the people caught-up in the family law system not to give the most significant court changes since 1975 a mere cursory glance, or a simple tick-and-flick,"" Mr Bailes said. … … … ""A reporting deadline in mid-April 2019 would allow the Senate to consider the recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission's Family Law Review. The final report is due on 31 March 2019. That's worth commenting on as well: there is actually a Law Reform Commission family law review due on 31 March, one that was commissioned by this government-by former Senator Brandis. It's due in March 2019. To make this change before that commission review reports is quite bizarre. One really has to ask: why is there the rush here? What is going on here that this government feels they need to rush this through in this way, before they even have all the information? The Senate inquiry isn't due to report until next year. Again, it's irregular for a government to try and push bills through before the Senate committee's report. It's hard to figure out exactly what is going on here, and why the government feels it's necessary to push such an extraordinary change through without proper consultation.  The Australian Bar Association president, Noel Hutley SC, says: … the ABA remains of the view that any legislation to restructure Australia's family law system requires close and careful examination by Parliament. The structure and implementation of any reform of the area can only be determined if all interested parties have access to and appropriate time to consider, the most up-to-date information available and particularly the PwC report which the Commonwealth Attorney-General has referred to as being the basis of the current proposals. That PwC report was the short desktop analysis of the role of both courts, and it's that report that made the recommendation to combine the two courts. PwC is not a body with expertise in both courts. It is certainly not a body that you would expect to make a considered assessment based on the complexity of family law, particularly since family law in Australia, as we all know, is getting more complex by the day, as we have more and more families where the broader family is split across continents. There are significant family violence issues. What we see with this combination of the courts and the government's intention, eventually, to not replace the Family Court judges is a move towards a court that does not have specialist expertise in family matters-a court that does not have expertise in the matters before it. Shockingly, perhaps that is why this government thinks that its changes will be more efficient. It seems to be adamant that this merging of the two courts and the removal of the family expertise will actually increase the efficiency of the court. The minister states that there will be up to 8,000 extra cases per year cleared because of this merger. Yet there's no additional expenditure. There are no additional dollars-zero additional dollars-and no additional justices. No extra money, merging two courts and removal of expertise in family law gives you efficiency only if the only thing you care about is the speed and the cost of the decision. If all you care about is the speed and the cost of the decision relating to a child's future and their relationship with their parents then maybe this is fine. But for most of us, if we think about it, we know that when it comes to family break-up, with all the complexity, anger and difficulty that people have in resolving those issues and the complexity when you add family violence, when you have extended families across continents, when you have careers that move interstate-all the things that affect it and all the complexity before you even put the emotion into it-the decision needs to be the best one, not the quickest one. It needs to be the best one, not the cheapest one. There are some cases in policy, and health is one, where what is best for the patient is almost universally cheapest for the taxpayer-you intervene early, have a person stay home, all those things. In nearly every case when it comes to health, if you treat the patient in the best way possible, the cost over a lifetime is less for the taxpayer. In this matter, this is not the case. This is not a case where reducing the cost and going for efficiency rather than outcome is a good result for the community or the family. It is simply not that. I also want to point out that, given this is the most significant change to the Family Court in nearly 50 yearsactually, it's effectively the abolition of the Family Court after 50 years following an eight-week review and a very short consultation process-there are two speakers, I think, on the other side on this bill. I'm just going to doublecheck; yes, two. This is one of the most significant changes in 45 years, and there are two members of the government who have decided to speak on this. They're hardly proud of it; I suspect they don't even know about it. Two government members are speaking on this-so no consultation, a review which the sector hadn't even seen that was the basis of the decision, very short time frames, and two people on the government side getting up to speak on it. There are 12 or 13 members on this side speaking on it. But that's not unusual. Following this we will do the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Housing Affordability) Bill-an incredibly important issue-and there are no government speakers. On the Fair Work Amendment (Family and Domestic Violence Leave) Bill, there is one. So they're not exactly into their own work at the moment-certainly not in this chamber. They're off doing heaven knows what, but they're certainly not in here to make the case for this bill. If this is such an important bill that it needed to be pushed through in this kind of time frame-it's the most significant change in 45 years and, according to the government, it's going to result in an extra 8,000 cases going through every year-you'd think that some of them would be in here actually speaking about it and explaining it, because the criticism of it that has come from outside of this place is overwhelming. The speeches that are made by this side of the House also make a number of extremely valid points. I would expect that a government that was proud of this bill would have people prepared to speak on it and prepared to argue it. I would like to hear the arguments that the government makes for pushing this through at this kind of pace and for making this extraordinary change. I would like to hear the argument that says that a removal of expertise in the Family Court system provides better outcomes for families and for children. I would like to hear members on the government side actually make that case. I would like to hear how you get 8,000 extra cases cleared without additional funding. I would like to actually hear that. I would like to hear how, rather than put extra money into the Family Court system so that it can function properly, you wear it down until it starts to break and then you abolish it. I'd like to hear the government members make a case for that, because it's very hard to see when what  you essentially have is very little consultation with the community, rapid decision-making, unreasonable speed and pushing it through the House when the Senate can't consider it for several months anyway. It's a very strange position that we find ourselves in on this side of the House today, looking at government legislation that the government itself isn't prepared to defend. We won't support this. I look forward to seeing the results of the Senate inquiry. I look forward to reading the report when it finally comes down in March, and then we'll see what is needed in the Family Court. Ms O'TOOLE (Herbert) (18:42): I am luckier than many in this place to speak with some understanding of the negative impact of this bill. I say so because my sister Janice Mayes is a family law barrister in Townsville. In speaking with her I have become very aware of the processes and procedures that affect the family law court. I am aware of how busy the family law court is and the pressure it is under in regional Australia because of the conversations I have had with my sister. I am aware how detrimental these changes will be for family law judges, barristers, solicitors and, importantly, the families themselves because of the LNP government's bill and what this means on the ground, all thanks to the skill my sister has as a family law barrister. In due respect to my sister, I will provide an open and honest account of the government's changes to a system that is already under massive pressure. At the heart of this bill are vulnerable people and, particularly, in most cases, children. The question must be asked: are these changes in the best interests of vulnerable families and children? Efficiencies that harm people, especially children, are not efficiencies. In fact, it is simply a cost-shifting exercise. And, possibly, the cost shifting will go to the health budget, and in particular the mental health budget, for years to come when we consider that many of the people negatively impacted by these changes are children. The government should own up to what they are doing here. They are in effect abolishing the Family Court, a legacy of the Whitlam government. Even worse, they are abolishing the Family Court without even bothering to ask the families in the system for their point of view. It is absolute arrogance. These two bills run for more than 500 pages. If passed this will implement the most radical change to the family law system since the Family Law Act in 1975. The bills will alter the current structure of the courts. They don't merge the two courts. There will still be two distinct divisions. The Family Court will become division 1 of the new Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia and the Federal Circuit Court will become division 2 of the new FCFC. Family Court judges will remain judges of the division 1 court and Federal Court judges will remain judges of the division 2 court. The LNP are trying to hide what they are doing by not being open and honest about these changes. The Attorney-General has stated publicly that he will not be appointing or replacing any Family Court judges, essentially killing the family law court by stealth. This is a radical reform. Moreover, the Appeals Division of the Family Court will be abolished immediately. Appeals will be moved to the Federal Court. Only appeals from the soon-to-be-extinct division 1 would be heard by three judges. All appeals from division 2 would be heard by a single judge. Let's be very clear about this: the government wants to hand this function over to a court that has never handled family law before. These are huge and fundamental reforms and fly directly in the face of the purpose for which the family law courts were created in the first place. The Family Court of Australia was set up in 1975 as a specialist court, with specialist judges, to resolve the most complex of family legal disputes. It was a Whitlam Labor government policy and reform. The Family Court of Australia is a superior court of record. When the Family Law Bill was progressing through the parliament back in 1974, it was also sent to a Senate committee. That committee made significant recommendations, including a recommendation to establish the Family Court of Australia. It also made a recommendation about the way in which Family Court judges would be appointed. The committee recommended that appointees must be, 'by reason of training, experience and personality, suitable to deal with matters of family law'. Nearly all of the committee's recommendations were given effect, including these two examples. Section 22 of the Family Law Act, which is still in operation, gave effect to what has become the essential feature of the Family Court: specialist judges. The Senate committee considered that the creation of a specialist court would: … put Australia in the forefront of family law reform and … ensure that other facilities and remedies provided in the Bill can have effective implementation. The Australian government, more than 50 years ago, recognised the unique issues and specialist skills needed to address and work in family law issues, so why is the current LNP Morrison government ignoring this? Are the government so out of touch that they do not understand that one of the most complex areas of law is family law, and, in being one of the most complex areas, it requires experts in family law to understand and comprehend the unique and individual issues presented to its court?  Family law deals with people at their most vulnerable. They are often in a distressed state and they need and deserve relevant and appropriate expertise. Yes, there are serious problems with the Family Court at present. There are unacceptable delays and backlogs, which are adding to the pain of those caught up in the system. These backlogs are due to inadequate funding of the court system, inadequate funding for legal assistance services and the failure of the former Attorney-General, George Brandis, to appoint replacements for judges as they retired. These are failures by an LNP government, not failures of the court system. This year, Federal Circuit Court judge Joe Harman blamed the severe court delays affecting families on the shrinking number of judges. According to a report in The Australian: Federal Circuit Court judge Joe Harman told his court at Parramatta, in Sydney's west, the number of judges had dropped from five to four, and at one point was down to ""effectively two"". This has contributed to a blowout in waiting times for litigants to three years. His Honour's eloquent judgement read: It is well known that the delays before this court and, in particular, this registry, are severe with great disadvantage, particularly in parenting proceedings, occasioned to parties who wait three years or more for a determination of their business. It continued: Some part of that delay may well be connected with an absence of resources. Certainly, the number of judges in this registry depleted between 2014 and 2015. The registry, in 2014, was staffed by five judges. The registry now has four judges although having dropped, at one point, to effectively two judges. This is clearly a scathing review of the current LNP government and their handling of family law. The option is there for the government to appoint more judges to deal with the large volume of matters before the family law court, but instead of the government providing more support to these courts, instead of the government listening to the experts and acting on what is needed to address these issues, the government says that abolishing the court entirely is the solution. This will only increase waiting times, add pressure to judges and magistrates, and lose the specialists and experts in the family law court. If the government does not understand the importance and the complexity of the matters before the family law court, then clearly they have not done their homework, because the only evidence, reason or excuse the government is using regarding these radical changes is a report that it commissioned from consultancy PwC, which took six weeks to do a desktop review-hardly thorough evidence. Family law judges, barristers and solicitors are going to just laugh at the part included in the six-week review report which outlines an equivalent level of complexity between the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court. Anyone who has one iota of understanding of the courts will know how laughable and ridiculous that notion truly is. I know what many lawyers, barristers and judges are thinking in listening to this speech and seeing the reforms the LNP government are suggesting. They are asking: why? Why is this happening? The Senate committee into this bill is coming to Townsville in the middle of December, so why is the bill being presented here today? The simple answer is because of the dirty deals being done with One Nation. That's right. The government are agreeing to lose a specialist court, to lose specialist judges, to create longer waiting times and to create more havoc for distressed families during a very difficult time in their life, all to do backroom deals with One Nation. The LNP government are in such chaos that sneaky deals are being done to the detriment of hard working Australians. Until February 2017, the One Nation website included a policy which said, 'The Family Law Courts will be abolished and replaced with a Family Tribunal.' Here lies the real reason why these radical changes are being rushed. It certainly raises the question. There is an election to be had and backroom deals to be done before the election. These dodgy deals lack transparency and fail the fair go and pub tests. All around, they stink and are rotten to the core. It appears this LNP government is prepared to turn its back on families during the most difficult and stressful time in their lives, all for some dodgy backroom agreement, as it may appear. The LNP government is demonstrating to the Australian people that they are no longer working in the best interests of Australians; they are working for themselves. Earlier this year I spent a full day in the family law court in Townsville. I wanted to better understand the processes, procedures and complexities. I wanted to ensure that when bills relating to the family law court are presented to the parliament I, as a lay person with no legal background, knew what these changes would mean to vulnerable families on the ground. From what I saw over that day, I know wholeheartedly that these changes will negatively impact on my community. At the invitation of Judge Coker, I spent a full day listening to interim hearings regarding matters before the family law court. I witnessed an incredibly professional and caring approach to what is in fact a very complex and distressing environment. I was surprised at the number of people who present to the court to self-represent or who are unrepresented. This takes much more of the judges' and courts'  time. I witnessed a very effective court process where procedural fairness was delivered to all parties. I also witnessed a strong focus on the needs of powerless children who are, sadly, caught up in this complicated process. What I also witnessed is how incredibly underfunded and under-resourced the family law courts are. I am deeply concerned about the amendments in this bill. The approach does guarantee that a negative impact will be had on family law and regional Australians. The LNP government are ignoring key stakeholders to rush this bill through. The government has not bothered to talk to the people affected and the many stakeholder groups associated with the family law system every day-the family groups, the registrars, the legal assistance services, the lawyers, the barristers and the judges. The Law Council of Australia have said how deeply concerned they are by the complete lack of consultation. The Australian Bar Association have also outlined their serious concerns. Today I outlined my serious and genuine concerns, as well of those in my community. But, importantly, I am very concerned about the motivation behind this bill as presented today. I cannot and will not support a bill in this place where due process and consultation have not occurred. In the current form, as this bill is presented, it would essentially put an end to the Family Law Court and specialist practitioners. From speaking with the Townsville legal community and knowing the detrimental effects this bill will cause, I cannot support this bill.",122
183,Ms SHARKIE,BILLS," Before I discuss the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2018 in detail, I want to make it clear that, while Centre Alliance will support the passage of this bill through the House, that should not be interpreted as an acceptance or approval of the proposed reforms. My Senate colleagues and I have not yet formed a position on these bills, but we accept without reservation that the need for careful and considered reform of the family law system is needed. I say again that our support today should not be read as an endorsement for these reforms but rather as an acknowledgment of the importance of the Senate committee process. Our Senate colleagues fought hard to ensure the committee could conduct a thorough investigation of the bills, unfettered by arbitrary reporting deadlines initially proposed by the government. We make no apologies for disrupting the government's proposed timeline. These bills will impact on everyday families, and we need to satisfy ourselves that the reform is required and that it is indeed appropriate. Having campaigned long and hard for a proper process of scrutiny, we will now closely monitor the submissions to the inquiry, the evidence adduced during the public hearings and any recommendations of the committee. In that regard, these bills are no different from any others that we consider as a party, but family law disputes are unlike any other form of litigation. These disputes are not a result of commercial failures, questionable taxation practices or criminal misadventure. These disputes are the consequences of abandoned plans for a life shared, and at the centre are individuals struggling to come to terms with the breakdown of their family unit and all of the emotional, financial and logistical complications that flow from that. These are families at their most vulnerable, and because of that we owe it to them to ensure that the family law system is working as efficiently and as effectively as possible. Given the deeply personal nature of the disputes, it is unlikely that any family court system can win the praise and approval of the parties subject to its rulings, but to prolong a family's journey through the family court system only serves to further inflame the conflict. Delay may be costly and frustrating for adults, but the continued exposure to conflict can have a profound and lasting impact on children-particularly young children. And we know that that is happening now. We know that too many families are left waiting for their matter to be heard and determined by a judge with the appropriate skill and that these delays are causing much harm to many Australian families. In recognition of the challenges facing those who rely on and work in the family law system, the former Attorney-General directed the Australian Law Reform Commission to undertake the first comprehensive review of the family law system since its inception in 1975. The review was welcomed by the legal profession, the judiciary and those who work in the family violence space. That report is due to be completed in April 2019. I've also made a point to move beyond the legal sphere and talk at length with my constituents who have first hand experience of family law litigation. Divorce does not discriminate. I spoke with men and women, both young and old, and many of them shared the same concerns: costs, delays and conflict. The government says that this package of bills will significantly reduce the delays experienced by Australian families, which in turn will help to reduce the costs incurred by parties. It is intended that structural reform will achieve improved case management efficiencies, resulting in an additional 8,305 matters being resolved each year. The veracity of that claim is yet to be tested. There are a number of proposed changes, but I want to address two points-namely, the future of the appellate function of the Family Court and the relationship between the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court. First, appeals from the Federal Circuit Court and the Family Court are currently heard by specialist appeal judges, who sit on the full court of the Family Court. The bill will in effect remove the appellate function of the Family Court, with appeals to be dealt with by the single judge of the Federal Court instead. It has been suggested that there is a  real and significant risk that such a measure could lead to an erosion of the specialist knowledge developed by the court over many decades. This specialist knowledge goes beyond the legal reasoning that is to be expected of a superior court of record and extends to the unique understanding of family violence and how it permeates every aspect of a case. Second, and in broader terms, the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court would become division 1 and division 2 of the proposed new Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia, the FCFCA, to create a single point of entry for parties looking to commence proceedings. The Attorney-General has indicated that further appointments to the division 1 court, currently known as the Family Court, are unlikely, with the practical effect being that, as Family Court judges retire, the Family Court will eventually cease to exist. There are many vocal critics of the bill, including current and former judges, who say that too much weight has been given to efficiency statistics alone, without having regard to the complex nature of the disputes, the current resourcing constraints or the quality of justice delivered. For example, the International Framework for Court Excellence assesses a court on a broad range of indicators-quality, fairness, impartiality, independence of decision-making, competence, transparency, accessibility, timeliness and certainty-yet the reports commissioned by the government, in particular the 2018 PricewaterhouseCoopers report, focused almost entirely on efficiency, being the rate of disposals. Any serious restructure or reform of the family law courts should be the product of evidence based policy. The primary purpose of such a policy must be to improve the experience and outcome for parties rather than simply as a way for government to save money. This is a significant reform and one that should not be undertaken lightly. I can think of no other court that interacts with all sections of our society on such a regular basis or on such intimate terms. Without proper considerations, any possible repercussions from the loss of a superior specialist court restructure may not be known until the Family Court is barely operational or no longer exists. In our view, the proper consideration will occur through the Senate committee process, and, for that reason, we support the passage of the bill in this House and wait for the outcome of the Senate committee. Thank you.",127
184,Mr HOWARTH,BILLS," The Family Court system very much needs a major overhaul. I support the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2018. It is a step in the right direction. Those who go through divorce or separation will often tell you that it is the hardest and most stressful and frustrating time in their lives. The issue facing our courts today is that people are being referred to either the Federal Circuit Court or the Family Court of Australia. Having two court systems isn't working. Currently there are many cases that are heard in the wrong court. It is wasting our courts' resources and, most importantly, the mums and dads of Australia's time and money, and affecting their well-being. The wait time for the family law system and Federal Circuit Court has increased by a third, blowing the wait time out to over 15 months. According to come of my constituents, their first mention, and then it's mention after mention after mention-it can take between three to six months before each one before the matter is listed for trial. I've had constituents come in and say it has taken over five years to finalise, which is incredibly long. The Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2018 before the House today aims to unite the two courts, with one governing chief justice. This will make it simpler for families and lawyers to navigate the Family Court system, reducing stress and financial pressure. Of course, this may not fix all of the issues faced by the families and constituents that come to see me, but it is a step in the right direction to fix many of the concerns that have been raised. Constituents have contacted me over the years and they have had all sorts of issues. I've had men in my office saying that they want to suicide, just in tears. I've had grandparents in my office saying how terrible it is that they can no longer see their grandchildren and that their son or daughter is under significant financial stress and emotional stress. I've had women in my office as well who have been in DV situations and who say they haven't actually been believed when they've gone to the court. Why is that? I've had other constituents in my office who have actually told me that when they went to their lawyer the first thing the lawyer told them they should do is to take out a DVO against their partner, and that has created the issue for the previous constituent who came to see me and said that they weren't believed. The whole thing is an absolute mess, and it's one of the biggest issues that people come to talk to me about on a regular basis. I know we have a lot of lawyers and legal people in the parliament here. I'm not a lawyer, but this issue is a real concern. In the five years that I've been here in this place, I've continued to talk to our government, our attorneysgeneral and others about how we fix the Family Court system, because whatever is currently working isn't working well. What we hear from those opposite is that all they want is the status quo, 'Let's not make any changes; let's not support this bill.' That isn't a solution at all. People have spoken to me about their desire for a royal commission  into the family courts too. They have spoken to me about that many times. I know we already have a couple of royal commissions going on in relation to banking and aged care, but that doesn't necessarily give an excuse for not having another one if it's a major issue that can't be resolved. The federal Attorney-General, Christian Porter, has put up this bill. He has a lot of experience in this area and I trust what he has to say. I think this is a step in the right direction, and I call on the parliament to support it and not to continue to delay and delay. This has been going on for years. If the system needs to be reviewed and rebuilt to restore justice and hope, and to protect children as well from the devastating and lifelong trauma involved with this, then let's do it. There are just so many issues that I want to get on record, to say to my constituents that I've spoken about this and been listening, and that I'm definitely passing this on to the parliament here. There has been consultation. Will this bill help? Yes, I believe it will. It will streamline the way matters are heard. There are instances of cases starting in the wrong court and appeals being heard by three judges of the Family Court. They will now be heard by one judge in the Federal Court, freeing up two other judges to get more of the backlog done. There are parliamentarians who have spoken with barristers and with Federal Circuit Court judges. They've said that these steps are a good thing. So, for every member of the opposition who has said, 'Oh well, there hasn't been enough consultation,' there has been consultation. I've spoken to a number of members on my own side, as well as to the Attorney-General, about that consultation being done. The Federal Circuit Court and the Family Court operate under different rules of law, and cases are often referred from one to the other, which draws out the process. That adds considerable cost and stress to families. The Attorney-General has advised that these changes will finalise an additional 3,000 cases every year and eliminate 35,000 cases being referred to the wrong court. That sounds like a step in the right direction to me. It's time to rewrite, rebuild and restore a system that protects children, strengthens families and ensures that cases are being dealt with in an efficient and timely manner. We heard all sorts of accusations from the member for Herbert a minute ago, who wanted to make this about politics. That's what she did-she wanted to make it about politics. Every member in this place-it doesn't matter whether they sit on the opposition or the government side-would know the number of people who come before them to talk about the Family Court and some of the failures with it. I call upon those sitting opposite to support the bill. By reforming Australia's family law system we'll reduce the stress on families and help to reduce the lifelong mental consequences for those involved. I am proud to stand here and support this bill today.",128
185,Ms BUTLER,BILLS," I want to take issue with something the member for Petrie just said. He said that the opposition is calling for the status quo in relation to family law, and that's just not the case. We have at the table the member for Corangamite, who, along with the member for Newcastle, led a bipartisan process looking at reform of family law, particularly for people who are victims and survivors of family violence. That bipartisan process that the member for Corangamite and the member for Newcastle undertook was excellent. They did great work together in a bipartisan or, in fact, non-partisan way-because the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs has crossbenchers on it as well. That committee report looked at a range of ways that family law could be improved for victims and survivors of family violence. So it's just not the case that the opposition have a position of keeping the status quo when it comes to family law. We certainly don't. In fact, I was the shadow parliamentary secretary in relation to domestic violence at the last election. We announced a suite of policies, the most important of which, in my view, at the time was family law reform to protect victims of violence from being personally cross-examined by their abusers. We did that. I think it was a very sensible policy position to take. It reflected a recommendation made by the Productivity Commission in 2014. We have been calling on the government since that report and throughout this term to implement this measure. We did it in a way that would include, with the policy announcement, some $43 million worth of additional legal aid funding because, if someone can't cross-examine personally, you can't deny them natural justice. The parties should then have lawyers to do the cross-examination. They should have people who have ethical obligations to the court and who can be disciplined if they don't conduct themselves ethically to do the questioning for them. It is a very different proposition to the abuser personally grilling the victim or survivor of domestic violence throughout the course of the case. We were very proud to make that announcement. I know that the government has, this year, in recent sitting weeks, brought forward its own cross-examination law reform legislation in relation to family law. It is something that we welcome, but I have to say that we are concerned about the absence of additional legal aid funding for the parties in that situation. But it was a step in the right direction. It's an example of a situation where all parties have acknowledged the need for law reform in relation to family law.  You certainly can't stop there. One of the other announcements that we took to the last federal election was on appointing more judges. I'm very concerned for all judges in the Federal Circuit Court-not about them but for them. They're asked to do a massive amount of work in a variety of disciplines. They might have an industrial law matter. They might have a human rights law matter. They might have a matter of immigration, bankruptcy or, of course, family law. Some of them do specialise, and that's a great thing. But, even in those situations where you're seeing judges in that court trying to do this work, even those who are doing mostly or exclusively family law, they still have a lot of impediments to being able to move things through quickly. Some of them can have hundreds of cases on their dockets. When judges aren't replaced after they retire, that puts a greater workload on existing judges. And I am aware that a large proportion of the people who appear before them are unrepresented. Of course, people have a right to appear unrepresented if they can't afford lawyers, but that does tend to slow things down a little bit because you're dealing with people for whom it is an unfamiliar environment. Weird forms, difficult rules and hard-to-understand requirements mean that people struggle to come to grips with what they're doing in the Federal Circuit Court when they're unrepresented. Of course, there are discrepancies in power in the courts when one party is able to afford expensive lawyers and the other party isn't. I've got a constituent in my electorate whose daughter is in constant family law battles because her ex is himself a lawyer, has plenty of money and has many friends. It's really the kids who suffer when they have these protracted, drawn-out applications and directions hearings which are, whether intended or not, bleeding her dry of money as she puts up with this constant, repeated use of legal practice and court forms to delay, obstruct and obfuscate the real issues. It is not the case that all is well in Federal Circuit Court land. Of course it's not. As I said, it is not a reflection on any judges or any judge's professional conduct. They, though, face structural and resource based impediments to being able to run things in a quick way. There are structural access-to-justice issues that affect parties before the Federal Circuit Court in family law proceedings. If the government wants to look at what can be done, I would suggest the bipartisan report of the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs, led by the member for Corangamite and the member for Newcastle, would be a really good place for the government to start. I'd also suggest that looking at the understaffing of the courts is really important. Of course, that means making sure we have enough judges, and not just enough judges in the cities but also enough judges who can service the Federal Circuit Court obligations in regions and in non-metropolitan areas. In my view, it's also important that judges become a little more diverse. We have had a historical problem with women being under-represented amongst the judiciary in the Federal Circuit Court. That, of course, can be improved. Similarly, it being a generalist jurisdiction, judges can be taken from any discipline. They might have been a barrister or a solicitor, but they might have been practising in commercial law or something entirely unrelated to family law. I was a lawyer for a long time, but I wouldn't purport to be able to understand family law. It's never something I practised in; it was never something that I sought to involve myself in. I can imagine that, for someone who goes onto the bench, it's a massive responsibility to then have to pick up and understand family law. It would be very daunting. I congratulate the judges who are doing a good job, of course, but it would be useful to continue to make sure that there are people with family law backgrounds when they are in practice, before they go into the judiciary, represented amongst the Federal Circuit Court. You don't need to merge the Family Court with the Federal Circuit Court to make that happen. In fact, one of the risks we're concerned about with the merger is that you might end up losing speciality and expertise in relation to family law through the failure to replace Family Court judges with senior judges with a family law background. It is something that we do think is concerning. There must be a good representation of judges with family law experience on the Federal Circuit Court. Similarly, we need our judges to have a better understanding of the dynamics of family violence. If you've been a lawyer in private practice for a long time and then you go onto the bench, you don't necessarily have the cuttingedge knowledge of the dynamics of domestic violence. We have a great national organisation in this country, Australia's National Research Organisation for Women's Safety-ANROWS. I think there would be a great opportunity for judges to keep their non-legal knowledge of family violence and what we know about family violence up to date if they had the time to do that, if they had the opportunity to do that. But with crushing workloads and unrepresented litigants, and a failure to come to grips with access to justice issues, that is a pretty big ask of judges. So if we could deal with the issue of judicial workloads, if we could deal with the issue of judicial expertise prior to going into the judiciary and if we could build up those links between those in the research and social sectors and judges and other court officials then that would help to make the court a better place for people who are victims and survivors of family violence, and also a better place for everyone. Of course, it's never going to be wonderful going to the Family Court. It's the sort of place you only go after a family breakdown. It's already a difficult time and, by definition, if you're in a protracted legal battle in the  Federal Circuit Court or the Family Court of Australia then you have been unable to reach agreement with your former partner. These are tough cases-tough, emotional, personal cases-mostly involving children. It's never going to be an easy thing to make the experience of going to that court a good one. But the problems of access to justice-the unlevel playing field between people who can afford expensive lawyers and people who can't, the difficulties of being a self-represented litigant in that court, or an unrepresented litigant in any court-all of those things can make a difference. I also wanted to say that I think it's really great that the Family Court of Australia and the Federal Circuit Court worked on family violence principles a few years ago. The last time. I looked, those principles were out of date. Sorry, the principles were not out of date. That's not really an accurate way of describing it. The principles were unrevised. It would be great to see some work going into revising those principles and keeping them up to date with current knowledge. The courts also had a family violence action plan, which is out of date-it has expired-so of course it would be really wonderful to see the courts continuing to work on their action plan in relation to responding to family violence. But we have to remember that, for all of these things that we ask the courts to do, we as a parliament do need to make sure that they're adequately resourced to be able to do them. I would think those things would be a fairly rich field of options for a government to look at if it were looking for ways to make family law work better for everyone-especially people with particular vulnerabilities such as victims and survivors of family violence, whether as partners or as children of a relationship. We do have concerns about the prospect of the abolition of the Family Court of Australia. It is the court that deals with the more complex family law issues-the more complex law or the more complex situations. They are longer trials. They take more intensive work. And so it is the case that cases take longer in the Family Court of Australia than in the Federal Circuit Court, but that's because the lower court handles the matters that can be dealt with more promptly, more efficiently, more expeditiously. So we are quite worried about what this will mean for the ability of the court to deal with those complex matters. You don't want to end up making things worse and more expensive because expertise leaches away and there is not the availability of a specialist jurisdiction. You actually don't want that to cause greater cost to the parties instead of what this is intended to do, which is reduce costs or at least make the proceedings more efficient. So we are concerned about that. We will look forward, of course, to making sure that stakeholders get an opportunity to have some feedback, some input into the Senate process. You'd be aware that most of the stakeholders reacted very negatively towards this proposal-some very vehemently and very negatively. I saw the Women's Legal Service on the south side of Brisbane soon after the proposal was made public. This was not quite in my electorate; it was in the electorate of Moreton. They were very concerned about what they saw as the abolition of the Family Court, and I'm sure you would be aware of some concerns raised by the Law Council of Australia and others. There must be an opportunity for adequate consultation. I understand that the government at first tried to restrict the time given for submissions to the Senate process to just three weeks. The bills are nearly 500 pages long, so a three-week submission process is just not fair to stakeholders. It's not appropriate for something so detailed. So I'm pleased that there's now a 15 April 2019 reporting date that must allow for consultation to occur with stakeholders. Stakeholders have much greater expertise than, frankly, anyone in this chamber right now, with the possible exception of the member for Blair, in terms of the way the courts and family law work, so we do need their input in relation to this bill, and the government really needs to do its homework in terms of that stakeholder engagement. I suspect that, if the government does continue to talk with women's legal services, family violence prevention organisations, lawyer groups, law consumer groups and people who are currently involved in litigation themselves or who have got experience, they will find that there is a great appetite in the community for reform in family law. I think it's fair to say there's a great appetite across this parliament for reform in family law. So we're not in a position where we don't want to see reform in relation to family law, but this reform seems not to be directed towards the problems that have been most clearly articulated to us by stakeholders. It seems to be trying to solve a different problem. The real problems are the processes of the courts, the resources of the courts, the ability of judges to keep themselves up to date in relation to family violence dynamics and thinking more broadly and, of course, all of all the access-to-justice issues that are forcing people to be self-represented, which leads to greater inefficiency but, more importantly, to really distressing experiences for people in the family law system. It needs to be improved and, if we work together, we can find ways to improve it. We look forward to the Senate process being reported upon.",129
186,Ms CHESTERS,BILLS," This is just another example of the government not listening to key stakeholders in the sector, most importantly our legal fraternity. The criticism of what the government is trying to do in the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2018 has been substantially reported in the media, even in regional areas like Bendigo, my own home town. As others have outlined, this bill, which basically  abolishes the Family Court-which is a legacy of the Whitlam era-gets away from those founding principles of the Family Court, which include a focus on the children and what's in the best interests of the children. Nobody is denying that these matters are complex. It is heart breaking as an MP to have meetings with constituents who are frustrated by delays; who are heartbroken about family breakdown; who may not have seen their kids for many, many months-sometimes years-who are caught in the system. But we would be doing them a disservice by saying that this bill will fix their problems. We would be doing them a disservice by making a decision based upon statistics and saving money as opposed to best practice and law. It is disappointing. I share the concerns of the legal community who say: 'Just wait. There is a major review going on into this very area that will hand down its report in March 2019.' Why is the government pushing forward with this? Why are they so arrogant and out of touch with the people who are helping to try and do this work? For a long time there has been call for reform but not this kind of reform. I believe that the government is being incredibly ambitious when they say that this will help families. A lot of the families that I know who have been to Family Court have complex issues. Putting aside the people who might have a horrible divorce and are going through that process, there are lots of people-vulnerable families-who are caught up in the legal system that need wraparound services. There are cases of DV. There are cases of theft. There are cases of quite complex social structure issues that are going on within the family unit. They need wraparound services and support. By saying that they'll be able to fast track their issues through court, I don't believe that will actually help those families in many ways. There's a real challenge when it comes to access to justice. Many in the legal fraternity, particularly in my part of the world, are really sceptical of any reform that has been put forward by this government when it comes to the Family Court, because of the way in which this government has repeatedly gone after community legal services. From the 2014 budget onwards we have continued to fight for renewing the funding-well short of what's actually needed for the sector. Our community legal centres work very closely with both these courts to help people where they can. In my part of the world, which is Loddon Mallee, basically their entire budget goes towards supporting people in the Family Court space, because they just don't have the resources to help outside of that. Other community legal centres have been able to assist people when it comes to Fair Work Australia and the Federal Court, or they have been able to assist them in other elements of federal law. But in regional communities like Bendigo community legal services generally focus specifically on this area. What they're saying is: 'Don't push ahead with this reform. Don't abolish. Let's work together. Let's wait. Let's consult properly. Let's actually wait for the review to come out and make some recommendations.' There needs to be bold reform here but not this reform. It needs to be done in a way which is inclusive, is constructive and will deliver better outcomes for families-making sure that we help relieve some of the very complex associated problems. I know many people that work within the system and one of the issues that they say has been really frustrating has been the lack of appointment of judges. That is blowing out waiting times. What we haven't seen from this government is any kind of focus on how we reinvest in these courts to make sure that we get better outcomes for people, that people's cases are heard in time. It is a stark contrast to what we are seeing in Victoria by the Labor government, who during the recent state election campaign announced $152 million investment into Bendigo to build a new law court facility. We're an old town. We have one of the oldest buildings in the country where they still practice law. It has not been updated. When I've been into those facilities and- (Time expired) NA The SPEAKER (19:30): I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Victorian State Election Tasmania: Health Care Mr BRIAN MITCHELL (Lyons) (19:30): It is with great pleasure that I rise to offer my sincerest congratulations to the Victorian Labor team: Daniel Andrews, his colleagues, the Labor Party supporters and, indeed, the army of volunteers. It wasn't entirely surprising to see that the Andrews government was re-elected. It has been a government that has demonstrated good governance in Victoria, and its strong, progressive and positive campaign platform was inspiring to those of us across Bass Strait. Watching Daniel Andrews' victory, as well as the annihilation of the Victorian Liberals, made for a rewarding Saturday. Indeed, it was made only more rewarding by the fact that the very next day the Australian women's Twenty20 cricket team beat the Poms, so it was a very good weekend indeed!  Daniel Andrews and his team have vision. They focus on positive policies and service delivery. They tell the truth. They put people first. That is not just a slogan; it's a pledge. To steal a reference from the new member for Wentworth's speech this morning, Victorian Labor's approach to government is human centred. It puts people first. It puts people at the centre of everything they do. Government should, after all, bring people together, not drive them apart. However, the Victorian Liberals, just like their national counterparts in this parliament, were focused on fear and on hate. They encouraged exclusion and the entrenchment of poverty and vulnerability. Their campaign was wholly negative. Too much energy was spent focusing on the Labor Party and not enough on how they intended to improve the lives of Victorians. Victorians saw right through those tactics. They were too clever to fall for what are now very well worn tricks, and they voted instead in support of Labor and positive policies that improve lives. We shouldn't be surprised. The Victorian Liberal Party's actions were almost identical, I'm sorry to say, to those we now see in every state and territory. Across the country, we see a once mighty Liberal Party that is falling apart, victim to its own chaos and dysfunction, too busy inciting hatred and discrimination to actually help people and provide the services people need. This country does best when the two major parties in this country come towards the centre, not deliver issues on the fringes. I would exhort those opposite to get back to the centre, to get back to where people want you to be. Victorian Labor's priorities were simple. They wanted to prioritise an investment in basic services and visionary infrastructure projects. The $50 billion, 30-year project to build a high-speed suburban rail loop is demonstrative of Daniel Andrews' plans for the state. I was pleased to see this ambitious project was matched by support from the opposition leader in this federal parliament. Victorian Labor also announced $1.5 billion for a new hospital, which will complement the $526 million upgrade to the Frankston Hospital, as well as hundreds of millions of dollars going into hospitals at Morwell and Maryborough. We can talk about how much these things cost, but these are investments in the community and investments in the future. Victorians will see $200 million for 1,000 new public-housing properties, massive public road upgrades worth hundreds of millions of dollars, 100 new schools, free dental care for children in public schools, new parenting centres, and paediatric wings at multiple hospitals. The list of positive, life-affirming and community-changing policies goes on and on. The reason I raise these things about Victoria is that it is so different in my own state of Tasmania, which has a Liberal state government. It would be reasonable to assume that the state government in Tasmania would be working hand in hand with its federal counterparts, who are of the same political stripe, to deliver similar policies to benefit Tasmanians. But no, we have one of the worse hospitals in the country. We have about 6,000 people on waiting lists. One-in-four Tasmanians will wait outside the clinically recommended times-the worse in the country. Ambulances are ramped every day. In my own electorate, the average GP visit results in out-of-pocket costs exceeding $35 for people on lower incomes. More than 2,000 people are avoiding going to the doctor because they cannot afford it. The country can learn from what happened in Victoria over the weekend: put people first. MCMillan Electorate: Prom Country Lodge",131
187,Mr BROADBENT,ADJOURNMENT," I have a good story to tell. On the occasion of meeting a constituent at Foster and making the meeting place Prom Country Lodge, I had the pleasure of meeting the owners, Kim and Victor Bradshaw. In the outcome of the discussion that I had with them, they had a terrific story to tell. Having made their investment in a rundown Prom Country Lodge, these two set about renovating the facilities and creating a really comfortable, five-star, welcoming place to stay on the Prom Coast. They've now become leaders in local tourism. They made the journey from Melbourne after leaving Rhodesia and South Africa 20 years ago. Their South African heritage is evident in the accommodation and the standard of it. Victor's dream since arriving in Foster during 2015 was to upgrade Prom Country Lodge and to create a pleasing experience for each of the guests. They've done this in spades. They now directly employ 15 people, with their 29 rooms welcoming many people from the Prom Coast. But 70 per cent of them are international visitors. Of course, they're visiting Wilsons Promontory; the Great Southern Rail Trail from Leongatha to Welshpool; Agnes Falls, Victoria's highest single-span waterfall; and Port Welshpool, home of the Long Jetty, which is currently under redevelopment courtesy of this government. There are also the local beaches, Sandy Point, Waratah and Venus Bay-fantastic places to go. But they had the inspiration to take what was a rundown, older-style motel and turn it into something unique. They've even given people the option of another place to have dinner in Foster, where at night-time they only had the pub. Don't get me wrong-the pub is great! But it's pub food, and this is quite an upgrade on that at Cafe Max Foster.  I love to tell this story because small business in my electorate is so important to me and tourism is so important for what we're doing in South Gippsland. We can see these people take an idea, push it and make it work, and then grow it to the point where they are actually employing chefs full-time and supplying breakfast, lunch and dinner. Whilst we were there-we happened to be there at lunchtime and we didn't have time to eat, of course, to do the business that we all do as local members-it was important to see the number of people in the restaurant and the busyness of the place. I have to say this was the first time. I'd been there, and I've been the member down there for a long time. So I went in and experienced this, and now I know that what's happening in South Gippsland is good for Foster, the Prom, the international visitors and the people who work at Barry Beach-the contractors who go down there. They need somewhere to stay and they need this type of accommodation. They need to get there and back and they need to have the proper provisions, otherwise we don't get the engineers and workers that we need down there at Barry Beach to fulfil those contracts. So they have a place to stay and we have somewhere we can be proud of. It's people like Kim and Victor who make these things happen. Businesses don't just happen without leadership. There has to be some leadership in a community to make things happen. Now there are 15 people getting work in that place, and that's gold to our community. Those are 15 jobs pouring their money into the local schools, football clubs, tennis clubs and cricket clubs. That money gets spent within the community by locals who work there and who are contributing through the enterprise of these two people. Mr Speaker, you know I'm from small business. You know my background. You know it all very well. I get so excited when I see people doing really well in business-when they're working hard and paying taxes, and all the people around them are paying taxes and making a huge contribution to their community, to tourism, to the activities around the place. That makes everything else better. Their standards are up, so everybody else's standards rise to the occasion. These people lift people up. They are lifters, not leaners, and they've made a great contribution to Australia since their arrival. Victorian State Election Mr ROB MITCHELL (MCEwen) (19:40): What a huge weekend it was in Victoria. I'd like to take a moment to congratulate the Andrews government on their landslide win over the weekend. A special mention to my state colleagues for their hard work in the re-election: Danielle Green, Mary-Anne Thomas, Ros Spence, Fionna Deppeler-Morton, Sally Brennan and Josh Bull. Josh Bull deserves a double congratulation because I hear his wife, Jas, is now pregnant and they're expecting their first child. From day one the campaign of the Victorian Labor and Liberal parties were miles apart. On the one hand, Daniel Andrews took his bus and his team out to visit a school. They were going out there, talking about building communities, and chatting to teachers, students and families about their plans for better education. Meanwhile, on the other hand, where did Matthew Guy go? He went straight to a prison. Fear is what drove the Liberal Party of Victoria. Mobster Matty used scare campaigns and dog whistles, while Andrews promised to deliver for all Victorians. The difference is tangible. The Labor win goes to show what Australians want from their representatives. They want positive policies, not divisive politics. I hear the giggle from those who got five per cent primary in Victoria-one of those who was involved in why the National Party doesn't have party status in Victoria. The Andrews government win in Victoria was a rejection of the Liberal and National cuts to schools, TAFE and hospitals. It was a rejection of their refusal to invest in renewables and work against climate change. It was a rejection of small-minded and nasty politics. It was the embrace of progressive values. MCEwen is one of the fastest-growing communities in the nation. While the federal Liberal government ignores the needs of Victorians, this weekend our growing north sent a very clear message: the communities in MCEwen will not accept second best. Both federally and on a state level, Labor is about delivering generational infrastructure projects, investing in health and investing in schools and recreation centres. The Andrews government is providing funding for new schools and kindies in the south of Gisborne, and overdue upgrades to recreational spaces in Sunbury. We as a Labor movement recognise the need to deliver for our community's growing needs. The Andrews government is committed to building new community hospitals in Sunbury, Craigieburn and the Whittlesea growth corridors. They are undertaking and planning to fix the Kilmore and Melbourne Road intersections at Gisborne, meaning families across MCEwen will no longer be at risk of dangerous accidents, giving them the freedom to travel to work or school and to visit friends and family in safety. The Andrews government will deliver stage 2 of the Hurstbridge line upgrade, which will include a new train station and bus interchange at Greensborough. On top of that, we'll see the duplication of the track between Diamond Creek and Wattle Glen, which will see a train every 20 minutes between Hurstbridge and Wattle Glen. Thanks to the Andrews government the residents of Gisborne, Kyneton, Trentham, Romsey and Lancefield will  see extra buses connecting their towns as well as providing much-needed funding for the long-awaited Macedon Ranges Regional Sports Precinct. Labor is working hard on policies that will deliver better lives for everyday Australians. It means getting the infrastructure and public transport up to scratch to meet the demand in booming areas like ours. What we've seen over the past few months via the Morrison government and the state opposition is that cuts, chaos and division do not and cannot win an election. Coalition cold-hearted fear campaigns are divisive and discriminate against members of our communities. It's nasty politics, and Australians have had enough. They want to see policies. Labor are about keeping their promises. We're backing TAFEs, hospitals, schools and services across growing communities so that each and every Australian has the opportunity to grow and thrive across the nation. We're committed to handing a better deal onto the next generation. We want them to be able to secure an apprenticeship. We want them to be able to afford their first home. We want a cleaner environment for their future. A federal Labor government will bring universal preschool for threeand four-year-olds. We'll uncap university places and give every young Australian the opportunity to reach their full potential. We believe that a good education shouldn't be reliant on mum and dad's credit card. All Australians deserve a fair go. We on this side of the House are committed to focusing on the Australian people and strengthening our schools and hospitals. As a united team, Labor consistently delivers policies, cohesion, infrastructure and sound social values-building together, not tearing apart. That is the difference between us and the conservatives opposite. A Shorten Labor government will bring unity, stability, economic success and social progress. We're about making Australia a better place for all Australians. (Time expired) Murray Electorate: Aged Care",133
188,Mr DRUM,ADJOURNMENT," Last Friday I had the opportunity of hosting the Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care and the Minster for Indigenous Health, Ken Wyatt. Aged care is particularly important in Murray, given that 21.5 per cent of the population is over the age of 65. As Minister Wyatt is very quick to point out, in the nation of Australia 10 million of the country's population of 25 million are over the age of 55. We are certainly an ageing nation. The minister's visit was threefold. Firstly, we had to announce the fact that $963,000 of additional funding is finding its way into the Murray electorate, assisting us with Commonwealth Home Support Program placements. Currently we have around 8,000 of these placements, which are allowing aged people in the Murray electorate to stay in their homes-close to their community and close to their loved ones and family. Now we've had this injection of nearly an additional million dollars into the area of Commonwealth home support packages throughout the Murray electorate. This is part of $100 million of additional funding that has found its way into the $5.5 billion dollar Home Support Program. Obviously, this is what local seniors need. It gives them more independence and lets them get the support they need. The support comes in a myriad of ways: with home maintenance, meals, assistance with showering and even cleaning around the house. There are a whole raft of different areas, and our senior Australians are able to get the assistance that they need-they can get the help but also stay at home. The second stage of the visit was to take Minister Wyatt out to visit the magnificent 120-bed, state-of-the-art Maculata Place, the new retirement village at Tarcoola. We were able to take Minister Wyatt there to officiate at the opening of this new $34 million facility. It really is an amazing place. It has open areas. It's got indoor/outdoor living. It has a whole raft of courtyards, and every room looks outside to the wonderful birds and the river that is nearby. There are action-packed opportunities for all the residents there to really enjoy the community. This new facility is complete with a gymnasium, a doctor's clinic, a hairdressing salon and a cafe, really making everyday life at Maculata Place more like a normal day in a community rather than a normal day in an aged care facility. There are state-of-the-art televisions that are able to connect with families: the family can be on an outing somewhere and in real time can send photos through that will appear on the TVs in the rooms of the residents. I'd like to congratulation Kerri Rivett for inviting Minister Wyatt to be part of this opening. It really was an amazing ceremony. The third aspect of the visit was to put Minister Wyatt in a room full of around 45 aged-care administrators from about 35 different aged-care facilities throughout the Murray electorate. Again, Minister Wyatt showed why he's doing such an amazing job and why the government is able to put the support that's needed in place. Again, because this government is running a strong economy, we're able to invest in aged care. Yes, we need to find more money to invest in aged care, because we're right at the very start of what's going to be a tidal wave of needs in aged care. Both in keeping people at home and for people who need to go into facilities, it's going to cost this country more and more. Luckily, the government, at this stage, are able to provide the aged-care assistance that is needed.  With these 40-odd administrators asking Minister Wyatt about the finances, about the regulation, about some of the reviews that have been taken on, he's shown he's a very impressive minister, able to converse with those who are working so hard to make sure the aged-care sector in Murray is operating as well as it possibly can. I congratulate the minister. Immigration Detention",135
189,Mr NEUMANN,ADJOURNMENT," In early November I travelled to Nauru to see first hand the conditions for asylum seekers and refugees living in the Pacific island nation and the conditions in the Australian funded regional processing centres. The facilities on Nauru, as well those on Manus Island, were set up as temporary offshore regional processing centres. They were never intended to be places of permanent and indefinite detention. But that is exactly what's unfolded under this Liberal government. Mr Speaker, you can understand how this is a situation that is not in the best interests of vulnerable people, either physically or mentally. Five years in detention is simply too long. I want to make it clear: if Labor had won either the 2013 election or the 2016 election, these people would not have been subject to this migration limbo. They would have been resettled in third countries-something the Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison governments have failed to do for far too long. The Nauruans are an independent and proud people. They have welcomed close to a thousand refugees and asylum seekers into their community. The asylum seeker and refugee cohort on Nauru equates to close to 10 per cent of the country's population. The majority of refugees and asylum seekers on Nauru are now living in the Nauruan community in Australian funded settlements. They're being supported by Australian government funded services as well as Nauruan services. Nauru's Department of Multicultural Affairs runs settlement services and programs, including employment assistance, community integration programs and school enrolments. Many refugees are employed and some have even started their own small businesses on Nauru, such as restaurants and hairdressing salons, or they're working in a range of other businesses, including government offices and the local hospital. During my time in the country I met the President of Nauru as well as his cabinet and other governmental officials, including from the Department of Multicultural Affairs. I met refugees and asylum seekers at numerous locations across Nauru and visited all three regional processing centres, which are open centres where people come and go. I inspected the accommodation and health services available at the Australian funded clinic at RPC 1. There are many hard working, committed medical professionals working to ensure asylum seekers and refugees are receiving the medical and mental health treatment they require. The same goes for the medical professionals at the Republic of Nauru Hospital. However, when medical treatment is not available on Nauru and is recommended by appropriate medical practitioners and clinicians, Labor believes that medical transfers to alternative treatment locations should be made available. The Liberal government's haphazard approach has made the job of doctors recommending medical transfers more difficult. More must be done to improve accommodation and road infrastructure at RPCs 2 and 3, and the Australian government must work with their Nauruan counterparts to address these issues. Secrecy about conditions on Nauru-something the Liberals so often opt for-is not a solution. I heard stories of refugees who wish to permanently settle in Nauru, and I believe Australia can work with Nauru to help make that possible. The reality, however, remains that asylum seekers and refugees, both on Nauru and in PNG, have been left in limbo for too long. They need permanent resettlement options. The failings of offshore processing fall directly on the current Liberal government, which has been in power since 2013. It is possible to have offshore regional processing as a policy and still oppose indefinite detention. Successive Liberal governments have failed to negotiate third-country resettlement options. That includes the Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison governments. Liberal prime ministers have all rejected New Zealand's generous offer to resettle eligible refugees, which has been on the table since 2013. This is something Prime Minister Morrison even considered before the Wentworth by-election. Labor offered bipartisan support to work out a solution, before the offer was quickly ripped away by the Prime Minister. It is time Prime Minister Morrison accepted New Zealand's generous offer to end indefinite detention on Nauru and in PNG. Labor have said that, in government, we would accept New Zealand's generous offer to resettle eligible refugees and negotiate conditions to prevent people smugglers exploiting vulnerable people. I want to thank the Nauruan government and people, including their government officials and medical staff, for the work they do. I thank the Australian government officials and Border Force officials for the work they do in Nauru in a very difficult situation. Labor, if elected, is committed to resettling eligible refugees on Nauru and in PNG in third countries whilst ensuring that Australia's border security is maintained so that more vulnerable people aren't exploited and led to risk their lives at sea.  Dunkley Electorate",136
190,Mr CREWTHER,ADJOURNMENT," If there's one thing I'm proud of in my time so far as the member for Dunkley, it is delivering-in particular, delivering for our young people and ensuring they have the best facilities and services possible. I do this particularly as the youngest representative in the government to ensure that our young people are engaged in positive activities in education, work, sport and the community and so that they have the best chances to achieve their best in life. It's so important that we keep investing, for example, in local sporting clubs and community groups so that we can make sure everyone has access to quality facilities, no matter where they live. Investing in our sporting facilities helps our local clubs grow while giving our communities better access to facilities for a longer period of time. So I was very proud to recently announce two major funding commitments in Seaford, at RF Miles Recreation Reserve, and Langwarrin, at Lloyd Park. Both of these announcements involve budgeted federal funding. That means they aren't election promises and they won't depend on an election to go ahead. This money is being delivered by the federal Liberal-Nationals government and is available now. The commitment of $3 million in budgeted federal Liberal-Nationals government funding for Lloyd Park in Langwarrin is the biggest individual commitment ever seen at Lloyd Park. It is fantastic for the Langwarrin community as a whole. I'm very proud to have worked with the federal government to have secured these funds. This project will see Lloyd Park redeveloped for the benefit of local community groups, including the Langwarrin football, netball, cricket and tennis clubs, as well as the Langwarrin Scouts. I partnered with the Liberal member for Hastings, Neale Burgess, who was recently re-elected, on this project and who had secured an extra $3 million from an elected Liberal state government. Unfortunately, they weren't elected, meaning this funding has been lost, leaving just our federal funding of $3 million still on the table. But I still look forward to working with council and the clubs to deliver this project and to advocating for state Labor to also come to the table. This project will also encourage greater participation and attendance to the ground and provide a local hub for the wider Langwarrin community to enjoy. The redevelopment will see the construction of new, state-of-the-art multipurpose facilities, including new sporting and social rooms overlooking both ovals. It will include new netball courts, seating, lighting, shade sails, a car park reconfiguration and a playground. New male and female change rooms and amenities will also be built to support the growth in female sporting participation and enable all sporting codes, along with Scouts, to be able to access and use the facilities at appropriate times. It is my hope that the state Labor government will match the commitment that had been made by the state Liberals in the Victorian election and fund the missing $3 million to give the Lloyd Park community certainty the project will be built. I also invite Frankston City Council to lock in their part of the funding as well to ensure that construction can get underway. Last week I was also proud to announce to the Seaford community that the federal Liberal-Nationals government would provide a budgeted $2.6 million for RF Miles Recreation Reserve to join the earlier contribution of $300,000 I secured in the past. This commitment comes on the back of months of strong advocacy for the RF Miles Recreation Reserve. I must acknowledge, despite the fact she wasn't elected, the significant advocacy around this project by the liberal candidate for Carrum, Donna Bauer. Unfortunately, she didn't get up, but our budgeted federal funding of $2.6 million for this project remains on the table. Our budgeted federal funding is the last piece of the puzzle completing funding for this project, combined with state-level funding, council funding and LXRA compensation money in play. This is a great opportunity for Seaford and for the netball, football and cricket clubs. I am proud to support this project. This funding ensures the delivery of the new multipurpose sports pavilion and netball courts at RF Miles Recreation Reserve in Seaford, benefiting the Seaford football, netball and cricket clubs. This is a great win for local footballers, netballers and cricketers, both male and female, boys and girls, and the wider Seaford community. Again, this $2.6 million of budgeted federal Liberal funding is available now. It doesn't rely on a federal election. That means we can start with the project as soon as possible. The federal Liberal-Nationals government is delivering for the locals in Dunkley, in Seaford and Langwarrin, for example, in the two projects that I've raised this evening, but I am also delivering for various clubs, community groups and others across the electorate. I look forward to seeing these clubs and community groups expand even further due to getting the facilities they deserve.

191,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOTICES, took the chair at 10:30. NA Federal Election,139
192,Mr BURKE,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," Mr Deputy Speaker Laundy, I acknowledge you and I acknowledge our former Speakers. We have two former Speakers present here in the chamber today. I rise today to refer to what ethnic community functions are going to see happen over the next few months. After we have had a government that has run fear campaigns around people of Chinese background, fear campaigns around people of African background and fear campaigns around people whose faith is Islam, we now go through the season in the lead-up to an election where members of the government turn up to function after function and say, 'By the way, we weren't talking about you.' This is where they turn up, function after function, and say: 'Oh, no, no. When we say we're going to do all these things to immigration, we are talking about those other people, not about you.' I simply want to make clear here in the House today that no-one should think that dog-whistling works anymore. The concept that you can give a coded message and it will be heard only by certain people in the community is not how things work anymore. They're not dog whistles; they're foghorns. Everybody knows what the government is up to when it uses those so-called coded messages. People will not forget a government that tried to introduce, as a condition of citizenship, that you would have to pass a university-level English test-but not everyone is going to have to pass a university-level English test. If you came from an English-speaking country, you might have to pass a university-level English test; you might not. There are about 50 countries in the world where English is an official or regular language, but only five of those countries were exempt from the university-level test, and they just happened to be the five white English-speaking countries: Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland and New Zealand. You can be speaking English your entire life and come from Singapore and you'll need university-level English under the law that those opposite all voted for, but, if you come from Canada, you won't. That is how they have behaved this term. When people go to vote at the next election, they need to remember not the fact that the government, over the last few months, will have suddenly said all the right things at community events but the fact that this government has behaved this way the entire term and will be trading preferences with Pauline Hanson at the election. NA",139
193,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS," I would like to add my welcome to former Speakers Jenkins and Hawker-my apologies; I didn't notice you in the gallery-and their parliamentary studies program for Pacific islander speakers. I welcome everyone to the House today. Honourable members: Hear, hear! NA Taxation",139
194,Mr CIOBO,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," Can I, too, acknowledge the former Speakers that are with us: it's great to see you both again. I'd like to raise Labor's retirees tax 2.0. This is part of Labor's tax grab to do what they can to try and prop up their budget with their profligate spending, an approach that the Australian Labor Party continues to pursue notwithstanding the fact that, as outlined in today's Australian, it sees Labor's retiree tax policy 2.0 stealing money from low-income earners in this country. Labor's proposed changes around franking credits will see more than 870,000 Australians worse off. It's interesting that the shadow Treasurer is here: he needs to hear what people are directly saying and what the impact of Labor's theft from people's retirement savings will be. Take my electorate, for example: I've got around 5,973 people that will be affected as a result of Labor's policies, and around 5,500 people in each of the neighbouring electorates of Fadden and MCPherson-in total, around 17,000 Gold Coasters will be adversely affected by Labor's tax grab to pay for their reckless spending. I have had around 80 people contact my office directly, expressing their concern at Labor's plans to steal money from them. Take David, who's 69, and Margaret, who's 61, of Southport. David has worked for 45 years, paid his taxes and accumulated enough for a modest pension. Without franking credits he now stands to lose around one third of his income. That is a direct impact of Labor's policy. Make no mistake: Labor's policy will see one third of his income, which he worked hard to provide, going as extra tax revenue to pay for Labor's spending. Or take Christine, who's 53, and Garry, who's 66, from Benowa. Christine and Garry own a small family business in the construction industry contracting local tradies, and they also employ their daughter. A big part of their retirement strategy, which they've been planning now for more than 15 years, was to use the retained profits in their business together with the associated franking credits as their income stream. They didn't take home hefty pay cheques; instead, they decided to invest the money back into their business so that they could gain more work. By doing this, their business grew. It meant there was more work in the pipeline, and they were able to hire more local tradesmen and give them more consistent work, even when the construction industry wasn't as vibrant as it currently is. They epitomise the everyday Gold Coast family who are having a go and starting a family business, working hard and putting in tireless hours so that they could get ahead and provide for themselves. Labor's proposed changes to the franking credits will significantly impact their retirement. Garry's just turned 66. They're both still working and were hoping to retire within the next year. But now, this will all be up in the air. The fact is that Labor's tax grab on franking credits will mean that older Australians will have to pay more to pay for Labor's reckless spending, and it entirely up-ends their plans around retirement. Civil Aviation Safety Authority: Project Wing",139
195,Ms BRODTMANN,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," In June this year, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority authorised the operation of Project Wing's drone delivery trial in Bonython, a suburb in my electorate, with a number of exemptions from existing regulations. These exemptions allow the service to operate within five metres of people, over populous areas and outside of CASA's documented practices and procedures. They allow Project Wing to deliver burritos and coffee and croissants. CASA required Project Wing to document and report against a number of technical and safety related matters at the end of each month. It would be nice to actually see those reports, in the interests of transparency. The exemptions instrument provided by CASA authorises the operation of the trial in Bonython to May next year, but Project Wing can apply to CASA for a renewal of the exemption prior to this date. When I raised the concerns my community has had about the trial with CASA, the federal agency that provided the authority for the exemptions from the regulations, the chief executive advised: CASA only deals with the aviation aspects of the Wing operation with privacy, security and noise issues being outside of CASA's remit. So CASA cannot consider issues of privacy and noise, which are the top two concerns raised by my community, nor do they want to. At no stage has community feedback or impact been considered in the regulatory arrangements around the trial. I wrote to the Privacy Commissioner after I received that letter from CASA, asking the commissioner whether she was consulted about the privacy aspects of this trial, and I'm still awaiting a response. I asked CASA whether it would undertake an independent review of the delivery trial arrangements. The CEO's response was to refer to CASA's development of a road map to integrate drone systems into Australia's aviation system. In other words, there was no response from CASA's CEO. That road map was going to be developed without considering the impact on the community. Whole-of-government consideration should be given in the lead-up to trials like Project Wing, which are planned to roll out right across Australia, especially where the approving regulatory authority does not have sufficient delegation to consider the full scope of regulations and issues. A fortnight ago we heard that Project Wing had commissioned an economic impact study by Alphabet on the drone trial, declaring it would boost business by $40 million in Canberra. So, Project Wing can find the cash to stump up for an economic impact study but can't find the cash to stump up for a community impact study or an environmental impact study or an independent review of the drone trial. And where is the study? I've gone to the Project Wing website and I can't find it there. I've gone to the AlphaBeta website and I can't find it there. Why hasn't Project Wing or AlphaBeta publicly released the study? What have they got to hide? Boothby Electorate: Disability Support Groups",140
196,Ms FLINT,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," Today I would like to recognise some of the wonderful disability support groups and organisations in our community in South Australia. This year is a very special anniversary for Technology for Ageing and Disability (South Australia) Inc., or TADSA, because it's celebrating its 40th anniversary. It is a not-for-profit volunteer organisation. TADSA has been serving the South Australian community for four decades with one goal: to improve the quality of life for South Australians who experience barriers in their lives due to disability or age. Formerly called Technical Aid to the Disabled (SA), TADSA specialises in modifying equipment as well as the design and manufacture of customised equipment to suit an individual's needs. The organisation's dedicated  volunteers, with a wide range of specialised technical skills, have assisted thousands of South Australians to live more independent, dignified lives. For people who experience disability, having the right equipment in place makes a big difference in helping them to be independent and stay connected to their family, friends, workplace and community. The fantastic TADSA volunteers can build or modify just about anything to make life that little bit easier, including wheelchairs, tables, workstations, clothes lines, walkers, cutlery, gardening tools or even fishing rods, to name just a few of the things that they do. A major community access program conceived by TADSA is the Freedom Wheels program, which provides modified bicycles for children who, through disability, are unable to ride a regular bike. Because of this program, these children can experience a new kind of independence and participate in activities so often taken for granted by others. I congratulate and thank all of the volunteers at TADSA-in particular, founding members John Cappo, Andrew Downing, Kevin Neylon, Alan Short and Terry Cody. A special mention goes to Ken Lawson, Richard Jackson and Julie Peak, who have each contributed 20 years of service. A very happy 40th anniversary to TADSA. I also want to speak about some other amazing organisations in my local area, one of which is the Suneden Specialist School, at Mitchell Park, which was the first special school in South Australia and does a truly wonderful job supporting students with intellectual and multiple physical disabilities. It also supports their families. I also have Kilparrin Teaching and Assessment School, in Park Holme, which provides on-site school programs and a statewide support service for students with sensory impairment and disabilities, including early intervention programs, which we know are absolutely crucial. I have Bedford, in Panorama, which provides supported employment, training and day care options that foster independence, socialisation and inclusion for our community. I also have Novita, in St Marys, and Minda, down at Brighton. I would like to recognise and thank all of the volunteers and staff at these incredible organisations for everything that they do. MCMahon Electorate: Diwali",140
197,Mr BOWEN,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," Millions of people around the world recently celebrated Diwali. In our country many hundreds of thousands of people celebrated it as well, and in my electorate we celebrated our fifth local MCMahon Diwali celebration. Many honourable members will have attended Diwali celebrations. I have now for five years hosted my own Diwali celebration, and I want to thank all those many MCMahon locals who came to celebrate with me. Diwali, as honourable members know, is the Hindu festival of lights, about the triumph of light over dark, of good over evil, of knowledge over ignorance. They're all very fine things to celebrate, I would have thought. We began our celebration in Greystanes with a prayer from Pandit Jatin Bhatt, a representative of the Sri Mandir temple in Auburn. He invited me to participate in that, which was a great honour. Of course, the Sri Mandir temple was the first Hindu temple formed in Australia. We then had members of the Rasika Dance Academy, who wowed the crowd with a wonderful performance, and we also had a performance from the Nartan Institute of Performing Arts, an Indian dance school specialising in the Bollywood style and folk dances from India, which, again, was very impressive. We were also treated to a performance of Carnatic music, which is a mainstay of Indian classical music. Of course, the night wouldn't have been complete without the serving of delicious Indian food. I thank the providers of that food. It was great to have so many local families come along to Greystanes. I want to thank the mighty Greystanes Goannas AFL club for making their clubrooms available to me and to the community to hold the celebration. It's a wonderful facility and they always make it available to me. I want to thank my friend Councillor Suman Saha for helping to arrange the evening. He also arranged a selfie corner with a particular frame, the MCMahon Diwali celebration photo frame, to have selfies in, which was a big hit. I want to thank my friend Arunesh Seth for helping to coordinate the program and arrange it with my office, and I want to congratulate and thank the two MCs of the evening, Ms Arunita Seth and Ms Grace Bowen, two teenage girls who made their MCing debut and did a fantastic job of MCing the evening. I look forward to next year's event. It gets bigger and bigger every year. I again thank all the MCMahon locals who came along to celebrate Diwali with me. It's fair to say it has become a highlight of our calendar. Diwali has become an important celebration. We hold Diwali every year. We hold Holi every year. The MCMahon Holi festival is completely different. It is a very colourful event, which we hold during the day, where we all get ourselves very colourful. Diwali is a very enjoyable yet also solemn night. It has long been-for five years nowan important part of my calendar and will always continue to be so. Q Fever",141
198,Mr COULTON,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," The drought continues to bite across regional Australia in the eastern states, particularly in my electorate of Parkes, the just  under 400,000 square kilometres that I represent in this place. There has been some relief in the north-eastern part of the electorate, and we're starting to see some summer crops go in, which is good, but over large parts of my electorate the drought's continuing to bite. There are actually some other problems coming through that probably weren't foreseen and need some attention. One of the issues with drought is that people probably tend to be working more closer with their livestock than they would normally during a normal season-dealing with sick and dead animals, pulling kangaroos out of dams and the like-so what we are seeing is an increase in Q fever. For anyone who doesn't know, Q fever is an insidious blood-borne disease that is quite debilitating to people that come into contact with it. In the Nyngan area, up to half-a-dozen cases have been identified. I was speaking with the mayor of Nyngan, Councillor Ray Donald, a couple of weeks ago. He's concerned about the fact that people are vulnerable to Q fever. One of the catches is that the vaccination is quite expensive, so farmers who are quite financially stressed are finding the cost of the vaccine prohibitive. It's not an automatic thing; you have to have a blood test to make sure that you haven't already had Q fever before. Then, if you haven't had it before, you are eligible to have the vaccination. It costs about $300, which is quite expensive. We already have mandatory Q fever vaccination for meat processors, veterinarians and others. I have written to the agriculture minister, Minister Littleproud, and the health minister, Minister Hunt, asking for assistance and guidance on how we might be able to offer some relief to these farmers and encourage them to take the blood test if they're eligible to be tested. I know people personally who have had Q fever, and it is an insidious disease. It tends to recur at regular times. I've actually known someone whose body became so weakened battling this disease for, probably, the 20 years that I knew him that he finally passed away because of the effects that Q fever had on his body and the organs within his body. So I am working on behalf of the farmers who are concerned about this disease. Hopefully, we'll get a response from the minister soon. Diabetes",141
199,Ms BIRD,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," Can I also extend my welcome to our visiting former speakers in the Chamber today. I want to talk to the Chamber today about an issue that I and many of my colleagues across both sides of the Chamber have been pleased to support for a number of years, and that is addressing juvenile diabetes. There is a fantastic program, the Kids in the House program, where young people who are living with juvenile diabetes come along to talk to MPs about the importance of research in addressing juvenile diabetes. This year was no different. I was very pleased to meet with some young people. Ethan, who is nine, and Mia, who is five, are from Bellambi in my electorate. They came along with Grace, who is 16 and is a local Canberra young lady. They all live with type 1 diabetes. They came as part of the Promise to Remember Me campaign that Kids in the House are running this year. I felt it was a really powerful message to have young people speaking on their own behalf of their lived experience and to be advocating for improvements in research in this very important area. They reflected to me that that constant battle 24 hours a day, seven days a week-there are no days off-affects not only them but their whole family. It has financial, emotional and visible impacts. I want to commend them on the really important work that they are doing in this space. As a follow-up to that, about a month or so later, I was pleased to officially open the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation's One Walk in Wollongong. It was at Fairy Meadow Beach reserve this year. It was thankfully a very nice day. There were lots of locals there, particularly in family groups, coming together to raise funds for research. I want to acknowledge Catherine and Craig MCInerney, who are key organisers of that local event. They put a very strong message to everybody in the community, including those of us who are elected representatives, about the importance of this fundraising. I was joined by the Labor Deputy Mayor David Brown on that occasion. I think it's a reflection of the power of communities when they come together. I can certainly say that I will remember the request that was asked by us of young people that we continue to do more not only in health services but also in raising money for important research in juvenile diabetes. There are 845 constituents in my area dealing with diabetes, and we need to be supporting these young people. Dunkley Electorate: Remembrance Day",142
200,Mr CREWTHER,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," For the past 100 years at 11 am on the 11th day of the 11th month, we as a nation have stopped to remember the fallen. This year, Australians commemorate the hundredth anniversary of the armistice of the First World War, a day of special significance marking a century since the weapons on the Western Front fell still after more than four years of horrendous carnage. Remembrance Day is a day to acknowledge the service and sacrifice of all Australians killed in wars, conflicts and peacekeeping operations. This year, on the centenary, we pause for a minute's silence as we reflect on the toll of the First World War in particular. We remembered the 150 servicemen in World War I who once called Dunkley home and paid tribute at Frankston Memorial Park. The final resting place for over 200 ex-servicemen is at the cemetery in Frankston.  Many who came from what is now known as Dunkley contributed at a young age to the defence of Australia and Australia's interests. We have a rich military history. Sixteen soldiers from Frankston were killed in action in World War I and are listed on the honour roll at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, and there are numerous recognised at the Frankston War Memorial as well. Langwarrin Flora and Fauna Reserve also brings history to our doorstep, having hosted both a prisoner of war camp and a military hospital, contributing much to our knowledge in the form of research into wartime afflictions. Most of us have stories of our own relatives or their friends and neighbours; 100 years may seem a long time ago but it is only three generations for many of us. Both my father and grandfather served in the Australian defence forces on the Mornington peninsula, in the Army and Navy respectively. I mention in particular this year my great-grandfather who served in World War I on the battlefields of France. He passed away from the effects of mustard gas poisoning, several years after the conflict, and my nanna as an only child was put through school by Legacy. Each year in my local electorate the community therefore honours the fallen across many days and many locations. I had the privilege of attending the Langwarrin Community Centre remembrance service and the Frankston RSL service. Also holding commemoration services were Mornington RSL, Mornington Secondary College, Langwarrin Naval Memorial Club, Seaford RSL-a service for school students-and the Ahmadiyya Muslim community, amongst others in my electorate. At the time. I was also able to announce the giving of an Armistice Day grant for the housing of World War I memorabilia for the Mornington & District Historical Society at their premises down in Mornington. All these services recalled the heroism, the pain and the sacrifices of those who have served this nation, and we must continue to honour the fallen and we must continue to serve the living. The best memorial is how we serve and support our veterans and their families, who are with us each and every day. To our veterans and their families: we thank you and we remember you. City of Wanneroo Business Awards 2018",142
201,Dr ALY,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," On 16 November during our break from parliament I had the privilege and honour of attending the Wanneroo Business Association awards. The Wanneroo Business Association is such an active association within the city of Wanneroo and services many of the businesses in my electorate of Cowan. It was a fantastic event, honouring and recognising the work of small and medium enterprises within Cowan. I pay heed today to the board and the entire committee of the Wanneroo Business Association but I also take this opportunity to commend and congratulate the finalists and winners of the Wanneroo Business Association awards for 2018. The Innovator of the Year award went to Burdens Australia, which is a fantastic family-run business that does some fantastic work in developing the manufacturing industry within the electorate of Cowan. Tourism & Hospitality Business of the Year went to The Marina, Mindarie. Start Up of the year went to Grafton St. The Customer Service Excellence award went to the Kingsway Community Bank Branch, a community bank within the Kingsway City Shopping Centre, where my office is also located. The Online & Digital Excellence award went to Appliance Parts Solutions, who also took out the Trades Excellence Award. Best Home Based Business went to Office Overload Solutions Pty Ltd. Congratulations to the Employee of the Year, Bianca Crompton, from Cherished Cherubs Babysitting-what a fantastic name!-another great family-run home-based business. The Best Business: 15 & Over Employees award went to Resolute Security Services, who provide not only security services but also a lot of employment opportunities for people within the Cowan electorate. The Best Business: Over 5 & Under 15 Employees award went to Bizwize Business Solutions. The Best Business 1-5 Employees award went to Captain Electro Pty Ltd, another small family business. Congratulations to the 2018 Business of the Year (Judges' Choice), which was announced on the night and went to Resolute Security Services. The Mayor's Visionary Award, which was also announced on the night, went to Bev Errington from Kingsway Community Financial Services. I congratulate all the finalists and winners, and all businesses in Cowan, who do fantastic work employing people and contributing to the community not just economically but also in the work that they do. National Day for War Animals",143
202,Mr BUCHHOLZ,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," I also acknowledge the eminent former speakers in the gallery today and welcome them to the Australian parliament. We often, and rightly so, as a community pause to remember brave Australian men and women who have sacrificed it all for this country. Earlier this month on the 11th at 11 am, we came together to remember those who served from World War I through to modern conflicts. At a small ceremony later that day, in Canungra in my electorate, other servants of the Australian military were receiving tributes for their centuries of service. Today I rise to pay tribute to these often overlooked servants of the Australian military. Throughout history in war and peacetime, animals and mankind have worked alongside each other. Animals have served our nation in times of war as beasts of burden, messengers, protectors, mascots and friends. I'm wearing this red-and-purple poppy pin gifted to me by the Australian War Animal Memorial Organisation. The purple poppy symbolises all animals who have died during the conflicts. It's a great honour, on behalf of the  Australian War Animal Memorial Organisation in federal parliament, to dedicate 24 February 2019 as the first National Day for War Animals in Australia. On 24 February every year, Australians will be able to pause and pay tribute to those animals that have served in our country's wartime and in peacetime. I want to thank and acknowledge both Nigel Allsopp, a local constituent of mine, and the Australian War Animal Memorial Organisation he runs for their tireless dedication and pursuit of this recognition for war animals. I met with Nigel earlier this year again to gain a greater understanding of the work that he undertakes under the Australian War Animal Memorial Organisation banner. Over eight years ago, the Australian War Animal Memorial Organisation began donating care packages to operational military working dogs in East Timor, the Solomons and Afghanistan. Today they continue the great work and seek to raise the profile of animal services in war and peace. From the United Kingdom to New Zealand, countries around the world honour Australian war animals with a national day of their own. Now Australia can join in honouring them. As the Australian War Animal Memorial Organisation has said: These war animals have demonstrated true valour and an enduring partnership with humans. The bond is unbreakable, their sacrifice great … I call on all Australians to join with me in honouring Australian animals in war on 24 February.",143
203,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," In accordance with standing order 193, the time for members' constituency statements has concluded. PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS Vietnam: Human Rights",144
204,Mr DICK,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," I move: That this House: (1) notes that: (a) Brisbane's southside hosts a vibrant Vietnamese-Australian community; and (b) Vietnamese migration is a successful case of multiculturalism at its finest and has strengthened the social fabric of Australian society; (2) recognises that: (a) Australia must continue to advocate for freedom and the respect of human rights for the people of Vietnam and for all people around the world; (b) international human rights organisations such as Human Rights Watch, have become increasingly concerned about abuses to human rights in Vietnam; (c) Vietnam's prisons currently hold at least 140 political prisoners; and (d) during the first five months of 2018 alone, at least 26 rights activists and bloggers were put on trial, convicted and sentenced to long prison terms; and (3) calls on the Australian Government to: (a) exert pressure on the Vietnamese Government to allow thorough examination of claims of human rights abuses; (b) seek the holding of those responsible for these abuses to account; and (c) help protect vulnerable citizens from human rights abuses in Vietnam. At a time when those opposite, the members of the current government, would seek to polarise the Australian public with their alarmist and dog-whistling statements on immigration, the motion I put before the House today is one that celebrates and embraces our multicultural heritage and, in particular, the flourishing Vietnamese community in the south side of Brisbane which I proudly represent. With almost 10,000 people born in Vietnam and a further 15,000 tracing their ancestry to Vietnam, my electorate of Oxley has one of the largest Vietnamese communities in Australia, and we are all the better for it. Alongside those in the electorates of Fowler, Maribyrnong, Blaxland, Gellibrand, Moreton and Bruce, our local Vietnamese enrich our society with their culture, their food and their dedication to Australian values. It was under the leadership of former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser and the bipartisan politics of the day that, between 1975 and 1982, Australia welcomed about 200,000 immigrants from Asian countries, including nearly 56,000 from Vietnam alone. Fraser said in later years that one of the reasons for the enormous success of the Vietnamese migration in the seventies and eighties was that Vietnamese people and other refugees, wherever they came from, were warmly welcomed with assistance and generosity. Perhaps members of the current government could learn from those decades-ago achievements. I want to be very clear in the House that that is a lesson that we must hear and a lesson that is relevant today. I'd like to particularly acknowledge my friends in the Vietnamese  community who have given me so much support, first as a Brisbane city councillor and now as a member of this place. Today, I acknowledge the President of the Vietnamese Community in Australia, Queensland Chapter, my great friend Dr Cuong Bui OAM. Dr Bui for many years has devoted his life and worked tirelessly to improve the lives of local Vietnamese communities as well as those living abroad and suffering under the communist government of Vietnam today. He serves as President of the Queensland Chapter of the Vietnamese Community in Australia and has held the role of National President of the Vietnamese Community in Australia. He has been a member of the Ethnic Affairs Advisory Council, Chairman of the Migrant Settlement Council, a member of the Australian Refugee Advisory Council and Chairman of the Vietnamese Family Group Home. I'm privileged to call him a friend and to thank him from the bottom of my heart for his service to our community, alongside his hard working executive, volunteers, members of the community and a range of organisations in my electorate that provide so much cohesion, direction and inclusive behaviour that our community has embraced. I also want to acknowledge the secretary, Bac Lam-originally from the Northern Territory and now doing so much work for events and activities to provide a bridge between Vietnamese Australians and the wider community. I also acknowledge amazing advocates like Quang; my great friend Phuong Nguyen, who has given me so much support and inspiration over the years; Tuan Le; and my own Vietnamese mother, Ma Chum. They have been responsible for holding so many inclusive community events, including the Children's Moon Festival, the Tet Festival and the Women's Festival. However, sadly, many Vietnamese people remain oppressed and denied their rightful freedoms. One of the great joys I have had is learning from and understanding my Vietnamese friends. Whilst they have embraced Australia and contributed so much to our economy and vibrant community right across this country, they never forget those family members, friends, comrades and those people who have stood alongside them, fighting against the brutal, evil Vietnamese dictatorship. Human rights violations are continuing to happen every single day, and we must stand up and fight for those Vietnamese people. We know that during the first six months of 2018, the Vietnamese government has convicted and imprisoned at least 26 human rights bloggers and activists under communist laws. We know that these activists remain strong, but they need our support here in Australiaprisoners of conscience that every day are persecuted alongside their families. It was only a few weeks ago I attended a community candlelit vigil in Inala to pray for those suffering in Vietnam today. So, today, I acknowledge and celebrate the wonderful community that I represent and the Vietnamese Australians right across this country, who have given so much to Australia. But today I pledge to keep fighting for the Vietnamese people in my community, in Australia and in Vietnam.",144
205,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS, Is the motion seconded?,145
206,Mr HILL,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," I second the motion. I will pick up where my friend the member for Oxley left off. I could not imagine modern Australia without the contribution of Vietnamese Australians. They are the very best of multicultural Australia. So many families fled the fall of Saigon seeking a new life based on freedom and dignity. As refugees, they were welcomed by Australia. They worked hard, they formed community, they got involved in the community, and, like so many migrant families to this nation, they understood that the key to a better life for their children was education. Through that educational attainment that we've seen, they now occupy leadership roles in every field of society. This motion talks of Brisbane, but, of course, I'm from the state of Victoria. Deputy Speaker Laundy, it is a great day to be a Victorian, after the Andrews Labor government's re-election; I know we've conversed before saying that we both represent Labor seats, as it turns out! Certainly, the Vietnamese-Australian community has transformed suburbs in my electorate-Springvale, Noble Park, Keysborough. In that vein, I congratulate Dr Tien Dung Kieu on his election to the Victorian upper house in the electoral results. He gained the third spot out of five in the South-Eastern Metropolitan Region-he's actually a world-renowned mathematician, so he'll certainly raise the average IQ in the Victorian parliament, as he would in any room he chose to enter!-also led by Councillor Loi Truong, a long-serving Vietnamese-Australian councillor in the City of Greater Dandenong. In my electorate, around 10,000 people were born in Vietnam. It is the most common non-English language spoken at home-around eight per cent of people speak Vietnamese at home. I thank the member for Oxley for moving this motion to honour the contribution of Australian-Vietnamese people, but also importantly to speak out for Australian values of human rights in support of democracy. I visited Vietnam in July on the Australian parliament's annual ASEAN delegation. We went to Vietnam, Thailand and Brunei. It was ably led by the member for Grey, and I was, in fact, the only Labor MP, which was an interesting experience!  I've been to Vietnam before and seen the energy of Ho Chi Minh City and the beauty of the Mekong Delta, but this was an opportunity to spend time in more formal settings in Saigon, in meetings with the Vietnamese government, assembly members, academics, businesses and so on. Modern Vietnam is truly a paradox. You have to acknowledge the growth and the success in recent decades in lifting millions of people out of poverty. It really is an impressive achievement. I will acknowledge that they do have a capable government, strong governance in many areas, great discussions in many portfolio areas and the wonderful, industrious Vietnamese people, but it is a government that is intolerant of dissent. It silences critics, and it is utterly selective in its application and discernment of human rights. Delegations are an important part of our work. It is an opportunity to see and learn first hand and to exchange views on issues of concern. There is often a lot of polite formality but there can be great moments of authenticity once you've got the pleasantries out of the way. One of the curious moments came when some of the Vietnamese senior officials said to me very seriously, 'We want you to pass a law to stop people'-Vietnamese-Australians'burning the Vietnamese flag.' I gave an appropriately polite response, but then they raised the issue again, which is usually a sign in diplomacy that they really want a deeper conversation, and so we had that. I did my best to explain to them what I saw as the psyche of Australians: if the Australian parliament passed the law banning the burning of flags, most likely it would lead to an outbreak and an increase in the burning of flags, such are our antiauthoritarian tendencies. In turn, I raised with senior Vietnamese officials the issue of human rights. I was the only member of the delegation to do so, and I did that in respectful but firm and constructive tones, because I think it is incumbent upon Australian parliamentarians to back the work of our diplomats and to reinforce the work of the Annual Human Rights Dialogue between Australia and Vietnam to speak up on these issues and not be silent. So, as we maintain our growing and deepening partnership with the Vietnamese people and the Vietnamese government, where we have so many issues of economic interdependence but increasingly converging strategic interests, we also have to remember to continue to speak up in support of human rights. I do believe that, with the maturity of our relationship, we can do both. The United Nations has criticised Vietnam for human rights violations-for the violations of citizens' basic freedoms of expression and of peaceful assembly. The Australian-Vietnamese Victorian community has raised numerous cases in recent years, such as that of Nguyen Van Dai and five activists, who were imprisoned. Human Rights Watch and their global campaign saw him released, eventually. I know that the member for Fowler was instrumental in that. Amnesty International and many other human rights organisations have implored the government. While we deepen our partnership and maintain our friendship, we must also continue to put pressure on our Vietnamese friends to do the right thing and not to be scared of dissent from their people.",145
207,Mr WATTS,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," Between 1975 and 1985, over 80,000 Vietnamese people came to Australia seeking asylum from persecution in their home country after the Vietnam War. Before coming to Australia, some were in jail and in re-education camps where they were starved and forced into labour merely because they had worked with the previous government. Fearful for their safety and hopeless for their future, especially for the future of their children, they fled Vietnam to neighbouring countries and, ultimately, found their way to Australia. Many of the Vietnamese refugees who came to Melbourne settled in my electorate and many more took their first steps on Australian soil in my electorate. They lived in temporary accommodation like the Midway Hostel near Footscray but soon found employment and started rebuilding their lives. There are now over 200,000 Vietnamese-Australian people living in our country, and there are almost 10,000 in my electorate. The land on which the Midway Hostel formerly stood in Footscray is now governed by a council that has a long representation of Vietnamese-Australians. Indeed, the previous mayor in Maribyrnong is my good friend Councillor Cuc Lam. On this occasion, I would like to congratulate the newly elected member for the South-Eastern Metropolitan Region, Tien Kieu, for being elected for the first time to the Legislative Council for the Labor Party. In just over 40 years, the Vietnamese-Australian community has played a significant role in transforming Melbourne's west into a vibrant multicultural hub, enriching our society and our identify. We couldn't imagine it without them. Indeed, my children attend a bilingual, Vietnamese-English primary school. New ideas and innovations from the Vietnamese community have strengthened our businesses, hospitals, schools, cuisine, literature and culture. We learn from the values revered in the Vietnamese-Australian community, values like hard work, the pursuit of excellence, and community and familial obligation. The contribution of the Vietnamese community to our society is so visible in the social fabric of my electorate, and it is one that we appropriately celebrate here. That's why I support the Vietnamese community in Australia's efforts to build a new VietnameseAustralian museum in my electorate, in Footscray. I welcome the Andrews Labor government's commitment of $2.5 million to make this project a reality-a museum to showcase the many ways in which this community has enriched our state, our community and our nation, a museum where all Australians can learn about the  Vietnamese-Australian community's experiences, achievements and values, a museum to remind us that the personal freedoms that we take for granted-freedom of association, freedom of religion, freedom of speech-are not universal. In Vietnam, personal freedoms and rights are in fact deteriorating. As the Vietnamese community built their lives here in Australia, they saw with anguish their brothers, sisters, cousins, family and friends left behind, suffering at the hands of the same government they fled. In September this year over 100 members of the Vietnamese-Australian community came to Parliament House to voice their concerns about human rights violations in Vietnam. The delegation expressed concern about the lack of protection for religious freedoms, a draconian cybersecurity law used to surveil the Vietnamese community, law enforcement brutally acting against people conducting peaceful protests, and the horrifying treatment of people who are imprisoned, including deaths in custody. Respect for human rights, embodied in the concerns shared by the Vietnamese-Australian community, is fundamental to Australian values. The shadow minister for foreign affairs recently said in a speech: … in all foreign relations, we should have a clear understanding and articulation of our interests. … … … Our national interests are firmly grounded in our values – and we will always seek to protect them. This includes defending and promoting democracy, free speech, the rule of law, and protection of rights, including freedom from intimidation. We need a museum in Australia that documents the Vietnamese-Australian community's history, and their journeys to Australia, to remind all Australians why defending democracy and human rights is in the national interest for all of us. We need a museum that celebrates the success of multiculturalism in Australian society, particularly at a time when the Morrison government is preaching the politics of division and seeking to sow fear and suspicion in our suburbs-when the coalition's contribution to multiculturalism is to tell us 'it's okay to be white' and to blame traffic on immigrants in our community. We need a Vietnamese-Australian museum so that the community can have a place to call home, a place where they can look back with pride at their arduous paths to Australia, their hard work, resilience and persevere to rebuild their lives, and a place where they can advocate for a better future for all Vietnamese people in Australia and abroad. There is no better place-with respect to my parliamentary colleagues here-to do that than in Footscray, in my electorate, the home of the Vietnamese community in Victoria. I want this to be a place where we can celebrate a thriving, multicultural success story that is my community and the broader nation's.",146
208,Mr HAYES,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," I would like to start by acknowledging the member for Oxley for bringing this important motion to the House today. The human rights situation in Vietnam is something that, unfortunately, I've had to speak on in this place on a number of occasions, particularly as the human rights situation continues to deteriorate. My electorate of Fowler is the biggest home in the country to Vietnamese Australians, as you well know, Deputy Speaker Laundy. I've had the pleasure of seeing first hand Vietnamese migrants who have worked very hard to build a strong home here in Australia and raise a generation of young Vietnamese Australians to make a positive contribution to our country. Among them are many of our doctors, lawyers, dentists, engineers, lots and lots of teachers, and artists-young Australians whose dreams have been built on the backs of their parents' sacrifice and hard work in their newly adopted country. On top of these achievements, organisations such the Vietnamese Community in Australia, the VCA, Australian Health Humanitarian Aid and the Australian Human Rights Relief Foundation not only come together to celebrate their Vietnamese culture and heritage but also dedicate themselves to bettering lives in our community and for those here and abroad. As I've had the opportunity of representing such a large and spirited community, it is certainly disheartening, if not infuriating, to see that the human rights situation in Vietnam has continued to worsen, with a crackdown on basic human rights and freedoms very much intensifying. Those who are brave enough to speak out against the Vietnamese government are being charged under vague national security laws and are being thrown in prison without a fair trial or, in many cases, access to defence lawyers. On top of this, those who have been jailed are facing very poor conditions in detention and mistreatment by the authorities. It was only last August that activist Tran Thi Nga was beaten and threatened with death by another inmate in an attack which was widely believed to be orchestrated by prison authorities themselves. It is true that the Vietnamese government has become accustomed to oppressing peaceful activists, both inside and outside the prison. Last week I had the pleasure of hosting the a human rights forum in my electorate, with organisations such as Oxfam, Amnesty International, Action Aid and the Family Court Registrar, Registrar Dinh Tran, who is very active in the human rights scene. They all came to speak about human rights issues occurring within our region. I  was extremely encouraged to see more than 150 people turn up from many different communities. They came together to discuss human rights concerns in Cambodia, Vietnam, Myanmar, the Philippines and the Middle East. This was an image that displayed how much members of my community genuinely care about the welfare of others, and it was a stark reminder that there is much more that needs to be done to hold those who violate human rights accountable. In particular, it was Registrar Tran that noted the release of activist Nguyen Ngoc Nhu Quynh, better known as Mother Mushroom, as being a very small victory. She was released after only recently being sentenced to 16 years in prison. She was given her freedom at the expense of being exiled from her home country and flown immediately to the United States. This was also the case for prominent human rights lawyer Nguyen Van Dai and his colleague, Le Thu Ha, who have now been exiled to Germany. Vietnam remains one of the most prolific jailers of human rights activists in the South-East Asian region. The Vietnamese government have shown themselves unwilling to adhere to the rule of law and are keen to oppress, jail and exile those who simply advocate for the most basic of human rights: freedom of speech, the right of association, the right to practise the religion of their choosing and, importantly, equity before the law. The economic relationship between Australia and Vietnam is good, yet this should not be at the expense of individuals whose human rights are being so flagrantly violated. Debate adjourned. Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies",147
209,Mr EVANS,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," I move: That this House: (1) recognises that the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS): (a) is a cultural institution of international renown; and (b) has been central to the development of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander studies; (2) notes that on Monday, 15 October 2018 AIATSIS unveiled its Strategic Plan 2018-2023 in Parliament House; (3) congratulates the dedicated team at AIATSIS for its ambitious strategic plan; (4) commends the work of AIATSIS in helping to forge a national identity that embraces, celebrates and preserves the unique cultures of Australia's First Peoples; and (5) encourages honourable Members to raise public awareness of the institute's collections and the great work being done by AIATSIS to assist and promote the study of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages and culture I've been here before to talk about the amazing and important work that is being done by AIATSIS, the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies. AIATSIS has been absolutely central to the development of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander studies as a distinctive, unique and substantial field of study here in Australia. This work traverses many disciplines, including anthropology, education, art, health, linguistics-you name it. Through its work, AIATSIS has truly become a cultural institution of international renown, so it deserves to be better known here and for there to be better awareness of it amongst as many mainstream Australians as possible. In my work with AIATSIS, I have seen the intimate knowledge that First Australians have of these lands that connect all Australians to what are the oldest continuing cultures on the planet. This year, working together with the member for Indi and other colleagues, we've established a parliamentary friendship group to foster better collaboration and communication between AIATSIS and this parliament. Our hope is that, through this friendship group, we can raise greater awareness of the priceless collection of cultural and resource materials that are cared for by AIATSIS, and celebrate the dynamic Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures. The materials of AIATSIS are quite critical to recognising the immense knowledge and the diversity contained in Australian Indigenous languages and culture. Last month, AIATSIS came here to Parliament House to unveil their strategic plan for 2018 to 2023, and I was pleased to attend the launch event. It was really fitting, actually, given that one of their major focuses going forward is building engagement with governments and with a broader range of people right around our community. The member for Indi was at the launch; I'm pleased to see here in the chamber the member for Groom, who also attended the launch; and I'm also pleased to see the member for Dunkley here, given that he once worked at AIATSIS, some years ago. Underpinning AIATSIS's strategic plan is a determination to be part of helping all Australians re-imagine what it means to be Australian, and to forge a national identity that embraces and celebrates the unique cultures of Australia's First Peoples. The vision of AIATSIS is a world in which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's knowledge and cultures are recognised, respected, celebrated and valued. As the strategic plan highlights, AIATSIS occupies an incredibly important place in this capital and in our nation. It's a unique institution that works at the intersection between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, governments, the academy, and the cultural sector, along with the Australian and international publics.  AIATSIS is the only national institution with an exclusive focus on the stories of 65,000 years of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures. The four priorities set out in its strategic plan are discovery, transformation, resurgence and extending its reach. Each of these priorities centres on the opportunities and possibilities of this time in the institute's history, as we are approaching AIATSIS's 60th birthday in the year 2024. Their strategic plan also sets out the underpinning commitments that define the institute and characterise its long-term approach to its work. Those commitments include AIATSIS's technical expertise and capability being sustained for national and regional impact; AIATSIS being characterised by an Indigenous voice in all that it does; AIATSIS being a financially sustainable organisation; and AIATSIS operating cohesively as a single entity, embodying the concept of yindyamarra-that's a Wiradjuri word meaning honour and respect; more broadly, it implies thoughtfulness, graciousness and kindness. The commitments also include AIATSIS being positioned to influence across a range of sectors, having an innovative and flexible institution, and also, as I mentioned earlier, being proactively engaged and being an outward-looking institution. Since AIATSIS relocated to the Acton Peninsula here in Canberra in 2001, it's now in a prominent location. This has created a real opportunity to showcase Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures and the richness of the collections of AIATSIS in a manner never before possible. I commend the AIATSIS strategic plan 2018-2023 to the parliament.",148
210,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS, Is the motion seconded?,149
211,Mr Crewther,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS,"I second that motion, and reserve my right to speak. Ms O'TOOLE (Herbert) (11:28): I am very proud to represent one of the largest discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities in this country, Palm Island. Palm Island is home to the traditional owners, the Manbarra people. As Palm Island was used as a penal colony, it is also home to the Bwgcolman people, the Aboriginal name for 'one people'. There are approximately 47 language groups on Palm Island. Palm Island is a beautiful tropical island with a resident community that hovers between 3,500 and 5,000 people. The settlement has been known as Palm Island, the Mission, Palm Island Settlement or just Palm Community. The history of Palm Island must be told to be believed. This year we celebrated the centenary of Palm Island. In a series of events throughout the year, we reflected on Palm's history, present day, and the future. The people of Palm Island are strong and resilient, and the truth of their story must be told. Palm Island has a bright future. The young people who are the leaders of the future have a vision for their communities. The Bwgcolman people have shown their endurance and resilience over the past hundred years. The Palm Island centenary celebration provided an opportunity for the people to speak truthfully about the past and the challenges and adversities that they have faced and overcome. As Palm Island looks towards a brighter future with the assistance of the Palm Island Aboriginal Shire Council, led by Mayor Alf Lacey, it is vital to share their stories with the broader community in order for us all to work together for better outcomes. The Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies does remarkable work in collecting stories and doing research on the island. For those who are unaware of AIATSIS, it is a world-renowned research, collections and publishing organisation. AIATSIS promotes knowledge and understanding of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures, traditions, languages and stories past and present. The organisation cares for a priceless collection, including films, photographs, video and audio recordings, as well as the world's largest collection of printed and other resource materials for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander studies. AIATSIS undertakes and encourages scholarly, ethical, community based research in a variety of sectors, including health, native title, languages and education. This research has also been done on Palm Island. I believe the AIATSIS CEO, Craig Ritchie, said it best when he described the organisation, saying, 'For more than 50 years, AIATSIS, a national cultural institution, has been the nation's best-kept secret.' Recently, the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies unveiled AIATSIS strategic plan 2018-2023. The plan is underpinned by a determination to help Australia forge a more inclusive national identity. We are at a pivotal point in Australia with our First Nations people. We are at a pivotal point in Australia also where it is critical that we as a nation engage in a truth-telling process that will reveal our nation's real history. I believe, personally, that AIATSIS has a crucial role to play in this process. The organisation has incredible resources, collections, research and information about Australia's history and our current First Nations landscape. It is only right and fair that the organisation's next phase is to communicate, educate and engage with the wider community. To realise these aspirations, the organisation has set a series of initiatives as priorities for the life of the plan, which include a new state-of-the-art home for AIATSIS that is a national forum for transformational cross-cultural engagement and sharing; the songlines project, working with communities to secure song traditions; resources for the teaching of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures and heritage in schools; a leadingedge, engaging web presence; and potential physical presence beyond Canberra. This is an ambitious plan, and rightly so in our current climate. AIATSIS is a national treasure, and I am proud to support the organisation and  recognise the excellent work that they do for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and the country in this place.",149
212,Mr CREWTHER,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," I'm very pleased today to be here to support this motion from the member for Brisbane. I note that the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies is a magnificent organisation that does a terrific job not only locally here in Canberra but for our Indigenous people, culture, languages and more across Australia. It aims not only to look at the history, culture and languages of our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people but also to strengthen the culture, traditions and knowledge-such as language-for generations to come. It supports and facilitates Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultural resurgence and is helping to reshape the national narrative. Established in 1964, the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, AIATSIS, focuses on preserving, enhancing and bringing awareness to as many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander traditional cultures, languages and traditions as possible, particularly to ensure that they are not lost and that they are maintained and enhanced for future generations. Fortunately, 54 years on, the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies has proved the importance of continuing the story and vibrancy of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and the importance of their part in Australia's history. As the member for Brisbane mentioned, I formerly worked at AIATSIS, managing a team of six people on a research project for a number of months, covering Indigenous communities across the Northern Territory and Queensland. I learnt a lot in this role and it greatly helped to shape my understanding of Indigenous culture, languages and traditions and also of the important role AIATSIS has in influencing and informing government policy. I congratulate AIATSIS also on the release of their strategic plan 2018-2023, which they unveiled in Parliament House on 15 October. Their strategic plan is ambitious, and I applaud them on the dedication and effort they have put into the development of it. I trust that from here on it will continue going from strength to strength. Together with the Australian government, the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies are furthering the understanding of Australian Indigenous cultures past and present through undertaking and publishing research, preserving the history of their remarkable collection and more. That includes, in my electorate of Dunkley, with the Boonwurrung of the Kulin nation. We are proud of our local Indigenous community. As many people would know, the percentage of our electorate made up by the Indigenous community is higher than the state average and, indeed, higher even than the national average. I am very proud to have supported locally the Bunurong Land Council Aboriginal Corporation-for example, with a $50,000 grant recently through Landcare Australia as well as a stronger communities grant for Nairm Marr Djambana for a wet room and other resources-to help preserve our local Indigenous culture, traditions and community. I note also the friendship created through the Parliamentary Friends of AIATSIS. With our co-convenors, this has resulted in great advocacy from and with the institute and more understanding by colleagues across the parliament and beyond. The Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies' plan has also outlined their strong plan going forward. That includes a new state-of-the-art home for AIATSIS that is a national forum for transformational cross-cultural engagement and shared learning; the Songlines project, which is working with communities to ensure and secure song traditions; resources for the teaching of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures and heritage in schools; a leading-edge, engaging web presence and potential physical presence beyond Canberra; and more. I congratulate all who are part of AIATSIS and those who are working with it to raise awareness of the great work that is being done. I note in particular some of the amazing work that I saw when working there, in the language space and in preserving the songs, languages and more, which I hope we can enhance and teach, going forwards, not only in Indigenous communities across Australia but in the wider community, so we can gain a better understanding of Indigenous languages, as well as of Indigenous cultures, right across Australia. Lastly, I commend the work of AIATSIS and the way they're helping to forge a national identity that embraces, celebrates and preserves the unique culture and traditions of Australia's First People. I thank once again the member for Brisbane for moving this important motion.",150
213,Ms MCGOWAN,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," Member for Brisbane and other colleagues, it gives me great pleasure to rise in support of this motion. Today, I'd particularly like to call out the last part of the motion, which calls on our colleagues here in parliament to better understand the work of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies so that we can work together. Why it's so important for me is that as a member of parliament I have so much to learn, and I know my community is so keen to learn. If I could just put it in the context of a settled history that's 60,000 years old-that's mind-boggling: 60,000 years past. There's no reason to assume that we won't be a settled community for 60,000 years into the future. If you put that together and say, 'At  the moment, we're in the middle of it,' we're now in an absolutely fantastic space to ask, 'What sort of nation do we want that brings our history with us and our unique understanding of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander stories, language and culture?' and to make a nation that's proud of it. AIATSIS is exactly the organisation to help do it. I'm so pleased to be here today and to be one of the co-chairs of this friendship group, because I know my electorate of Indi needs all the help it can get, not because we're desperate but because we're so keen to continue the work that has already been done-such as Bright P-12 College, which is teaching the local Dhudhuroa language as a year 12 subject and has an exchange program with Wadeye in the Northern Territory. I get invited up there to music festivals, the football game they play and the gathering of local Aboriginal people that takes place. There's a lot happening, but we have a long way to go before we have a better understanding of the settlement history of the last 200 years so that we can move forward into a different future. What I know about north-east Victoria is that Governor Gipps was very keen to get settlement happening in the country areas. He forged a route from Melbourne that eventually went to Sydney, which is now the Hume Highway. He built white settlement towns and eventually bridges on each of the major rivers in my electorate, from Benalla on the Broken River to Wangaratta on the Ovens and Albury on the Murray. With those settlements came serious dislocation for the people who lived there. The white settlers brought their animals, built their towns and did what they had to do. I've heard a famous story of Lady Franklin's trip up the highway and its consequences for the local Indigenous people when the army and the colonisers came through in great numbers. Consequently in my electorate of Indi it is very hard to understand that settlement history and find the traditional owners. We have two recognised Aboriginal groups, which is how Victoria works, but while the maps as we know them in theory cover north-east Victoria, the local people say they are not accurate in the description of the people who live there. We need to better understand our history, talk with the local communities and bring that history together. I call on the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies to come to my electorate and work with us on our history, our culture and particularly our languages so that not only one school does local languages in year 12 but that, as we progress into this next 60,000 years in front of us, all our schools will begin and continue to teach our traditional Australian languages. We will become proud of not only our culture but also our history. We will learn the lessons of 60,000 years and then weave it into the future. In bringing my comments to a close: I love your strategic plan, I love how you've presented it and I love its design and its clarity. What it gives me, as a member of parliament, is a chance to work in partnership with you to do some of the things that I know you want to do, collaborating with communities and government. Member for Brisbane, I'm looking forward to continuing to partner with you on this to do lots more activities and to bring to the floor of the parliament what a wonderful institution this is and, much more importantly, how we need to integrate our traditional cultures into the future of this great nation.",150
214,Ms CLAYDON,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," I too thank the member for Brisbane for bringing this important motion before the House today. I am very pleased to stand in support of this motion, which highlights the significance of the work of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies-or AIATSIS, as many of us know it. AIATSIS occupies an incredibly important role and place in our nation. It's a unique institution that sits at the nexus between First Nations peoples, the government, the cultural sector, academia and the broader Australian and international communities. AIATSIS is a critical national cultural institution-very deserving of additional support and resources from the government, I'd suggest. Its critical role in the protection, preservation and promotion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture and heritage can't be understated. The Australian story is indeed the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander story, and that story is, of course, 65,000-plus years of continuity. We are in that incredibly unique place in the world where we have the world's longest continuing cultural practice. Sometimes that is taken for granted in Australia, and the work of AIATSIS reminds us why that should never be the case. AIATSIS is responsible also for providing significant leadership and undertaking the premier Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander research that is taking place in Australia. It maintains the most extraordinary collection of work, both academic and non-academic. In fact, as a young anthropologist, I spent many, many hours in AIATSIS reading collections that are so precious and require a place like AIATSIS to ensure their safekeeping. One of the great things that I admired at the time as a young researcher was that AIATSIS had some very strong protocols around who should access, and for what purposes, those cultural materials. Later in life, as an anthropologist undertaking my field work in Fitzroy Crossing, I submitted much of my work into the mapping of the Bunuba land boundaries and culture, and that sits within the AIATSIS institution. Again, there is a very strong regime of protocols around that, where permission must be sought from traditional owners in order to access that information. It's not owned by me. I might have been the person writing it at the time, but it is, in fact, owned by the traditional owners, and AIATSIS have always respected and enforced the wishes of the traditional owners in  that regard. So I've always had the utmost respect for the work of AIATSIS, both as a student and later as a researcher in my own fields. AIATSIS also, of course, has attached to it a magnificent publishing house, the Aboriginal Studies Press, and has published really outstanding works in Australia promoting First Nations cultures. There is such a rich body of material there now for Australians to learn what is, as I said, that national narrative for Australia, which is 65,000plus years in age. The collection plays a really key role in recording languages and oral histories, and those are really precious documents that sit within that institution. There is some great work being done on the reclaiming of endangered languages, of which there are many in Australia. I'm very pleased that the Awabakal, Worimi and Dhanggati peoples in my area have all been very active in restructuring and re-creating languages. I absolutely encourage all members to take time to learn about the work of AIATSIS and promote it in your electorates.",151
215,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," There being no further speakers, the debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Executive Remuneration",152
216,Ms KEARNEY,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," I move: That this House: (1) notes that: (a) a recent report into CEO remuneration found that the average total pay of ASX 100 CEOs rose by 9 per cent last year-4 times the pace of average wage growth; (b) the median ASX 100 CEO earned more than $4 million, and the average pay for ASX 100 CEOs was 75 times the average pay of full time workers, meaning a CEO takes home in a single year what it would take the average worker nearly two careers to accrue; (c) excessive remuneration was not always the norm, given in the late 1970s, the BHP CEO was earning only around 6 or 7 times what an average Australian worker took home; and (d) there is widespread public concern about inequality, and in particular that CEO salaries are growing at an unfair rate and leaving workers behind; (2) recognises that: (a) large firms in the United States and the United Kingdom are required to report ratios between CEO pay and workers in their firms; (b) excessive CEO pay makes firms less profitable than they should be, with experts noting that an excessive gap can hurt employee morale and reduce productivity; (c) remuneration ratio transparency is not an affront, but rather a complement, to a market economy; and (d) extending current market reporting requirements for public companies helps inform investors as they calculate risks and decide where to invest their money; and (3) calls on the Government to support Labor's plan to implement reporting rules requiring large listed firms to publicly release the ratio of total CEO remuneration and median worker pay. This motion calls on the government to support Labor's plan to implement reporting rules requiring large listed firms to publicly release the ratio of total CEO remuneration and median worker pay. CEOs' salaries are growing at an unfair rate and are leaving workers behind. Our plan will promote fairness and tackle inequality in the workplace. We on this side of the House have long been concerned about rising inequality and the consequences for the common good of our society. As a nurse, I saw the impacts on the health outcomes of people with little means. The social determinants of health are well documented and it has been well proven that those with little means suffer much worse health outcomes than those with a lot of money. Inequality breeds ill health. It is a nobrainer that poor health outcomes are not desirable for a strong economy or a good society. As a nurses union official I worked hard with nurses right across the country to ensure nurses, predominantly women, earned a decent pay rate and had fair conditions that afforded them a decent life. This was not only good for the working women and men in the nursing workforce but also for the whole community, who use our hospitals and our health system. A workforce that is valued and cared for is a productive workforce that strives to offer good quality services or products. So it is in everyone's interests to have a healthy and happy workforce. As president of the ACTU-my goodness!-I saw inequality in our society in its worse forms: from working with the Australian Unemployed Workers' Union, representing people languishing on the pitifully poor Newstart, to the NUW, which represents exploited workers in agriculture, supplying goods to the massive food chains like Woolworths and Coles, and the FSU, fighting to stop the big banks' executives forcing punitive sales targets on the lowest-paid workers in the industry, resulting in outcomes that are not good for customers or the workers themselves. The banking royal commission is shining a light on some of the darkest outcomes of that industry.  Now, the advent of the gig economy has deepened concern about the impact low and unfair wages are having on equality and the lives of those who are unfairly or illegally paid low wages. Despite what those on the other side of the House will try to tell us, inequality is alive and well and growing in Australia. One of the starkest examples of this is the discrepancy between the massive salaries of CEOs and executives and those of the workers they employ. My colleague the member for Fenner has pointed out that the average pay for ASX 100 CEOs is 75 times the average pay of full-time workers. In a single year a CEO takes home what it would take the average worker nearly two lifetimes to accrue. Put another way, the average ASX 100 CEO earns an average worker's salary every five days. This has been a worsening trend over the last 30 years and it's no coincidence that this has paralleled the advent and rise of neoliberal trickle-down economics. The word 'trickle'-and maybe that's the clue-is just that: a painfully slow, almost imperceptible, flow of earnings from the wealthiest in our economy to the mass of the population, who are the workers. I'm so proud to have either been a member of unions or to have worked for unions all my working life. Unions are a force for good that do their best to turn the trickle into a decent flow. It's well documented that, when it comes to pay, unionised workforces fare much better than non-unionised workforces. Injuries are fewer in workplaces where unions have a strong presence and, where workers are valued and involved in decision-making, productivity is higher. But laws in this country impede unions from doing their job properly, and they do not make it easy to join. Unfortunately, we hear of unions having to consider breaking those laws, but it's always in the context of trying to get decent pay rises for their members, or to protect the safety of workers in the workplace, or to bring some justice for their members in an unfair economy. When banks break the law or behave unethically, it is simply for more profit and more money to the lucky few with little consequence. It is rarely to make anyone's life better. This time, I rise to move a motion that I hope will change some of that, a motion that will force companies to be transparent about their CEOs' pay and how it compares to that of their workers. We have all seen the outrage of the behaviour of the banks, as exposed by the royal commission, and poor reputation is a risk. Greed is now a reputational risk. At last, sheer greed will be exposed by this transparency initiative, driving behavioural change that just might help to stem the flow of rising inequality by increasing the flow of wealth to the workers. I commend this motion to you.",152
217,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS, Is the motion seconded?,153
218,Mr GILES,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," I second the motion. I'm very pleased to join my friend the member for Batman in supporting this very important motion on CEO remuneration, which touches on wider issues of inequality: inequalities of income, inequalities of wealth and inequalities of power. This motion reminds us that inequality is fundamentally a political choice. It shows that this side of politics is committed to remaking the choices, to remaking the neo-Liberal framework of decision-making to restore equality in Australian workplaces and in Australian society. This motion tells us that there is indeed a moral imperative to change how remuneration is functioning, how stagnant wage growth for ordinary workers is being exacerbated by extraordinary incomes and earnings connected to capital which are being taken in by CEOs and other executives. We also recognise that this moral imperative carries very, very significant practical consequences for the sort of society we want to live in. On this side of the house we reject the notion that greed should drive our workplaces, but we also appreciate, as do the OECD and the IMF, that this excessive level of inequality is actually bad for economic growth. We see inclusive growth as key to a functioning Australian economy as well as a decent Australian society. I'm very pleased to have the opportunity to litigate these issues and to talk about Labor's approach because this is an issue of deep concern to me. In fact, two years ago I moved a very similar motion. Since then, in the past two years we have seen this issue of the gap between CEO remuneration and that of ordinary workers get worse, not better, and we've seen inaction on the part of the government. I am indebted that elsewhere there has been action. I'll talk about Labor's response but I note, in particular, that earlier this year The Guardian, through the excellent journalists Greg Jericho and Gareth Hutchens, produced an excellent series on the pay paradox, looking at the challenge of declining wages in Australia. We have 26, nearly 27 years of consecutive economic growth where the labour share of the economy continues to fall. There is also a disconnection between labour productivity growth in the economy and growth in wage rates. This is a complicated challenge. The member for Batman touched on one of the critical responses, which is, of course, to restore the imbalance of power between workers and unions on the one hand and employers on the other. She said it far more eloquently and based on far more experience than I can bring to bear to this. There are some other things that we can and should be doing as well beyond this, and this motion highlights that. We can look to the biggest gap between productivity in Australian enterprises and pay, which is where it comes to CEOs and executives, whose remuneration bears no relationship whatever to the work they do and the contribution they make to the enterprises they are charged with running and, indeed, to the well-being of the Australian economy  overall. Today in the banking royal commission we see yet more evidence of that, when the CEO of the National Australia Bank spoke today of the problem of executives looking at oneand twoand three-year returns, not about the wider metrics. That builds on a much bigger basis of concern about how our banks are operating. I'm so pleased that, thanks to Labor's advocacy, we have seen this side of corporate Australia and executive greed exposed. I'm also pleased that Labor has responded to this wider issue and has a response which makes clear, as Greg Jericho did in The Guardian again earlier this month, this notion of the gap between CEO pay and performance and CEO pay and that of workers in their businesses. A society where it takes the average CEO less than five days to earn the average full-time annual wage is of concern to me and, I suspect, all Australians. That is one of the reasons why the member for Fenner, the shadow minister, has put forward the proposal for disclosure. These ratio disclosure proposals haven't come out of the blue. They come out of work that Labor did when we were last in government, including introducing the two-strikes provisions. It is so important we offer more transparency so that Australians, including shareholders, can look at this and judge for themselves the gap between CEO pay and CEO performance. We can ask ourselves, as a society, is greed good and how much is enough? I think that when Australians look at these questions they will ask themselves why the government is not responding. Why is the government not even putting up a speaker on this most important debate? It shows, once again, that we have a government that is completely out of touch with working Australians, completely out of touch with any sense of a decent society and a decent economy.",153
219,Mr KEOGH,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," I'm very proud to rise today to speak in support of this motion on CEO remuneration. This motion fundamentally goes to the issue of inequality. The Australian people need to understand, when we discuss the concept of inequality and the growing inequality that we are seeing across the Australian community, that the government hasn't even shown up to debate it. The government has abandoned the field when it comes to addressing issues of inequality in this country. You don't need to hear me say that to understand it. If we look at what is happening in Australia now with the rising levels of inequality, it is writ large when we look at the growing disparity between the remuneration of Australian workers and the remuneration of those who run some of the biggest companies in this country. Average total pay of ASX 100 CEOs last year rose nine per cent. Australian workers would cry to get anywhere near those sorts of wage rises. In fact, that nine per cent was four times higher than the growth in average wages that we have seen in Australia. The median pay for a CEO of an ASX 100 listed business is more than $4 million. But, remember, that's just the median. We've got examples across the Australian corporate landscape that are far higher. The CEO of Domino's, who of course employ some of Australia's lowest paid workers, made $37 million last year. The former CEO of the Commonwealth Bank earned $12 million. That $12 million for the CEO of one of Australia's biggest companies, Australia's biggest bank, made the remuneration of the other CEOs pale into insignificance. There was not even, truly, a market justification for paying a bank CEO $12 million, let alone a consideration of all the misconduct and the destruction of people's lives that have happened at the hands of Australian banks. The $4 million median salary for ASX 100 CEOs is 75 times the average pay of a full-time worker in those companies. It would take someone two full careers to get close to earning what a CEO earns in a single year. It wasn't always thus. We only have to go back to the 1970s to see that the CEOs of our then-largest companiescompanies like BHP-were being paid only six to seven times more than the average for their workforce. This motion is not about cutting wages. All this motion is about is calling on the government to ensure that we have transparency in reporting on the inequality that we are seeing in Australian workplaces, making it clear just how highly, in comparison to their own workers, CEOs are being paid. That is something of which we should take note. We don't need to cut company profits. We don't need to cut dividends to the shareholders and the investors in those companies. But what companies need to think about and what their shareholders should be made very well aware of is just how much of their profit, their revenue-which is used to pay for their workers, their management teams, their consultants and everything else-is going to one individual at the top of the chain, as opposed to the many, many workers that those companies employ. The crux of it is this: if we want to see real economic growth in this country, ordinary Australians need to have money in their pockets to spend. I wouldn't even know how to spend $12 million of annual salary, but I would certainly not be spending it through the economy if I were earning it. It would end up in other investment vehicles. But, if that money goes into the pockets of ordinary working Australians, it will be spent. That will see real economic growth occur and it will start to see this growing inequality addressed. It will mean that we become a more equal place to live, because we will close that ratio as people become more and more aware of just how much of this money is going into the pockets of CEOs and not into the pockets of ordinary working Australians. Debate adjourned.  Local Government Consideration resumed of the motion: That this House: (1) recognises the important role that local government plays in Australia; (2) notes the continuing support that the Australian Government provides to local governments around Australia including: (a) Black Spot Program funding; (b) the Bridges Renewal Program; and (c) the Roads of Strategic Importance initiative; and (3) recognises that strong local government is important for strong and healthy communities.",154
220,Dr MCVEIGH,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," It is a great honour and, in fact, a pleasure to speak in support of the motion that was moved by the member for Mackellar recognising the important role that local government plays in Australia. In moving this motion, the member for Mackellar spoke of the fact that many in this House have a background in local government-he mentioned his own-and I, too, have enjoyed such a background, in my case in the Toowoomba Regional Council, brought about by the significant amalgamation in 2008, in Queensland, of the Cambooya, Crows Nest, Jondaryan, Pittsworth, Millmerran, Rosalie, Clifton, and, of course, Toowoomba councils at the time. I had the great honour of being elected via a by-election in late 2008, following the passing of the late councillor Ian Orford. So I began my career in local government almost exactly 10 years ago. It was tremendous to have the opportunity to serve, alongside others, the people of the Toowoomba region, through local government-as they say, the level of government closest to the people. In more recent times, I've had the great honour of being the federal minister for local government. So I support this motion, and I speak to this motion from the perspective of one who has had a fair involvement in the local government sector over many years. I'm particularly proud that the coalition will provide more than $2.4 billion in untied grants to 546 local councils under the Financial Assistance Grants program, and the fact that the government have provided more than $11 billion under this program since 2013-14, underlining the fact that we've been very much focused on delivering local services and building vital community infrastructure, and one does that best by supporting the local government sector. From 2013-14 to 2021-22, the government has set about ensuring that $4.8 billion will be provided under the Roads to Recovery Program; almost $745 million to the Black Spot Program; and $480 million from 2015-16 for the Bridges Renewal Program-not to mention the more recent initiative, some $3½ billion for our Roads of Strategic Importance initiative. These programs are important right across the country, nowhere more so than my own region around Toowoomba. Black spot funding in Toowoomba, for example, has seen us assist the Toowoomba Regional Council on the intersection of Hogg and Tor streets in Wilsonton Heights in the north-west corner of our city. Just over $1.05 million from the federal government has assisted the council, who also contributed $250,000, with that particular black spot that was identified. The Roads to Recovery Program has involved the allocation of just under $30 million to the Toowoomba Regional Council, including $1.8 million for the gravel sealing of Pierce Creek Road, and the Linthorpe Road reconstruction, with almost $1 million in contributions there. There is the Bridges Renewal Program. I can refer to the Mally Road culvert, the latest Groom project under this program. There was some $350,000 for that. It is in Hodgson Vale, where those culverts are being replaced. Most importantly, the Roads of Strategic Importance initiative has great promise for the future. I'm already on the record as recommending to the government that the Brimblecombe Road, particularly with its intersection with the Warrego Highway, be a focus there. When I talk about risk management from the regional council, I'm very proud of flood mitigation through our city since the tragic 2011 events. To be part of a government that has supported the Toowoomba Regional Council is very satisfying, in that regard in particular. But local government is not just infrastructure; it is about understanding the local community. I acknowledge that Toowoomba is a refugee-welcome zone, led by our mayor, Paul Antonio. I acknowledge that he and other councillors today, in Clewley Park in Toowoomba, have led a White Ribbon breakfast. I am unfortunately not able to be there, with parliament sitting, but that's what our council does.",155
221,Ms SHARKIE,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," I stand to voice my support and recognition for the role of local government, particularly when it comes to local roads in regional Australia and certainly in my electorate of Mayo. The poor state of our country roads is a regular complaint to my office and an issue that comes up time and again. When I did an electorate-wide survey, which I mailed out to everyone in my community and where we had thousands of responses, certainly our local roads were in the top 10 issues for people. It is why, with my Senate colleagues in 2017, we fought so hard to secure the two-year funding of $40 million for local government roads in South Australia and why I'm advocating for the continuation of the Supplementary Local Road Funding program.  This program addressed the anomaly that South Australia experienced: we have 11 per cent of the nation's roads and we have seven per cent of the nation's population, and yet we were receiving less than five per cent of the funding from government to maintain our roads. That was one of the budget cuts of 2014. Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott took that $40 million from South Australia. I was very pleased to get that reinstated, but it does run out next July. I'm already in conversations with the government, with my team, about reinstatement for that, because it is critical for our roads. I welcome the black spot funding for another three years, but I do call on this government to examine its long term commitment to local road funding in South Australia. I believe that piecemeal black spot grant applications for projects that may or may not be successful are just not enough. I know that from the work that my office did with the Parliamentary Library. We mapped the electorate of Mayo: the casualties, the injuries, the major crashes and where the black spot projects had been funded. When you look at that across the nation, the data of where the crashes are does not always marry with where the funding goes. I believe that the black spot funding is one of those projects that is always at risk of pork-barrelling, and this reinforces my belief that local councils need the financial autonomy to place upgrades for the roads where they know that they need them most. They are on the roads every day. When I recently raised Supplementary Local Road Funding program with the Prime Minister, his response was that further investment in South Australia will be 'considered as part of future budgets'. This was after the Prime Minister spruiked South Australia's share of the Financial Assistance Grant program. Let's not forget that the indexation for this program was frozen again back in 2014 and only resumed in September 2017. We have a lag there in real terms for council, and yet council is expected to deliver more and more each year. Funding for local government should not be alms for the poor. We need to properly equip our local governments. They deliver on our roads, but they also deliver on a whole range of well-being programs throughout our community. More and more, state and federal governments are expecting councils to do more and more with the little money that they have. In Mayo, we have challenging terrain and we have, sadly, a very high level of fatalities in our region. Right now, my community is deeply mourning the loss of two teenagers in a crash between Strathalbyn and Wistow. It is a state government road, but one with limited passing opportunities and it has failed to keep pace with the population growth and increased traffic in my community. I know that the Alexandrina and Mount Barker councils have made numerous appeals in recent years to the South Australian government to invest in safety improvements. I also raised the condition of this road with the former state Labor government. I understand that the new state Liberal government is now considering upgrades; however, we have lost two more people. This is a road that needs urgent-urgent-attention. As the member for Mayo, I am more than familiar with all the roads across my electorate that need upgrading-Victor Harbor Road, Main South Road and the Adelaide to Mannum Road. My fellow members would know the needs in their regions. Local councils know their roads. Fixing local roads is usually the biggest part of their annual budgets, which is why it's so important that we adequately fund them. So I call on this government for South Australia: please continue the supplementary road funding and not just the $40 million over two years. We need this to be properly indexed. I would also call on the government to catch up with the federal assistance grants. The freeze was in 2014. We had three years of no increase. I think government needs to work on this immediately.",155
222,Dr GILLESPIE,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," I fully support this motion. The support that the federal government gives to local government is quite substantial, whether it's the Roads to Recovery funding, the Financial Assistance Grant funding, the Black Spot funding, the Bridges Renewal funding or the Roads of Strategic Importance funding. There is another one which we help them with, and that's the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program. To put things in perspective, I'm very proud to stand here and outline some of the bridge work that has happened in the Lyne electorate as a result of these policies. I would like this House to recognise the contribution of former Deputy Prime Minister John Anderson, who, in the Howard-Anderson government period, introduced Black Spot and Roads to Recovery funding, and also to acknowledge the work of Warren Truss, who initiated the Bridges Renewal Program and the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program. In the Port Macquarie-Hastings Council alone, there was financial support for three bridges, totalling $1.24 million. In the MidCoast Council, which is a merger of the old Greater Taree City Council, the Great Lakes Council and the Gloucester Shire Council, there was financial support for 11 bridges, totalling $5.57 million. In the old Taree City Council, which was in existence in my first term of representing Lyne in the parliament, there was another $800,000 for two bridges. I am very pleased to say that I also fought for and delivered a bridge across Dyers Crossing and one on the Moto Road over Dickensons Creek. These sound like names that don't resonate with people in this chamber but they certainly resonate with people in the Lyne electorate, because beef trucks and  dairy tankers couldn't go over these regions. They had to make 10and 15-kilometre diversions to get raw product out of these valleys. The old timber bridges that are being replaced are the lifeblood of regional Australia, and there are so many more planned: Abdoos Creek; Kellys Creek; Possum Brush Road Bridge No. 2 replacement; Milbai Creek Bridge; MCQueen Bridge, which is also in the MidCoast Council; Kundle Creek Bridge; Emu Creek Bridge; Diamond Bridge; Little Cedar Party Creek Bridge; Burrell Creek Bridge; Bulga Creek Bridge; and Bobin Creek Bridge. The Black Spot funding is a really important source of funds for local government. They rely on this extra funding from the federal government, which is granted on a points-by-points basis. Unfortunately, a black spot often means a death, a fatality, or a very severe injury, but some of the roads that have been improved have been quite substantial. To put things into perspective, in 2018-19, the Australian coalition government provided over $2.4 billion in untied funds to 546 local councils under the Financial Assistance Grant Program. That is another huge help that the Commonwealth government gives to local councils. I put the state governments on notice. A lot of them do cost-shift. All of you here would appreciate that. They cost-shift to the federal government and they cost-shift down to local government. Back in the early nineties, the state government of New South Wales, in their wisdom, bequeathed approximately 16,500 kilometres of hitherto state roads to local governments, and that's why areas that I have in the Lyne electorate are now suffering with huge road and bridge burdens that used to be the responsibility of the New South Wales state government. It's an absolute scam, and we need to call out our state colleagues to step up to the mark and support a lot of regional Australia, because they do need all the funds. In addition to the Financial Assistance Grants program, the Building Better Regions Fund is a great help to local councils. $200 million went towards the third round of the Building Better Regions Fund. That's being extended out to 2021-2022. Many members here use the Stronger Communities Program to support a lot of the volunteer organisations, amateur sporting organisations and social groups that have nowhere else to turn. There's $22½ million in the fourth round being delivered as we speak. Whether it's Rotary clubs or people who have got groups together for bridge, for community support or for loneliness organisations, all these sorts of community groups come to look for help. This fund is vital. (Time expired)",156
223,Ms STANLEY,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," Before I represented the people of Werriwa in this parliament, I was a councillor for eight years at Liverpool City Council. One thing you learn quickly as a councillor is that local government is far more than the three Rs of rates, roads and rubbish. Local councils build communities. They consult and provide great services and facilities. They play a critical role in community engagement, facilitating and bringing together residents, community groups and important services to build stronger, healthier communities. One such project is the 2168 Children's Parliament, which had its fourth and final sitting of the current parliament last week. As I've spoken about in the House previously, I had the great privilege of being an ambassador. The initiative is delivered under the Commonwealth government early intervention and prevention initiative and is part of the 2168 Strong Children and Communities Project, supported by Liverpool City Council, the NSW Department of Education and Mission Australia. The 40 student parliamentarians come from local primary schools in the 2168 postcode in my electorate. They've met regularly over the school year in workshops, presentations and parliamentary sittings. The children took advantage of their unique position and audience to tackle the big issues of traffic, bullying, drug and alcohol abuse and renewable energy. While the program has already delivered some great outcomes, I think the full benefit of the program will only be realised in the years and decades to come. Who knows? We might see future councillors, mayors and MPs amongst these bright, inquisitive leaders of tomorrow. Local government also plays a key role in the arts. In my home community, they fund and resource important cultural institutions, such as the award-winning Campbelltown Arts Centre and Casula Powerhouse Arts Centre. There are venues that host theatre of an exceptional quality-from world-class names to hard working local volunteer ensembles, from modern suburban comedies to Shakespeare and the classic myths and sagas from the many cultural groups that make up my electorate. On Saturday, the Casula Powerhouse announced the winners of the Mil-Pra AECG Award, which acknowledges and celebrates the significant Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture in my region. I'd like to congratulate Leanne Tobin and Shane Smithers for respectively winning the acquisitive Maria Lock Award and the acquisitive Mayor's Choice Award. The weekend before, Hedar Abadi took out the top prize in the Liverpool Art Society exhibition. Hedar arrived in Liverpool as a refugee and now regularly exhibits his works. Councils, through their arts and cultural programs, help us tell our local stories. Through doing this, they build stronger local communities. This is despite the cost shifting and inadequate funding to the arts, especially in Western Sydney. While Western Sydney has 10 per cent of Australia's population, it attracts only one per cent of federal and just over five per cent of New South Wales cultural, arts, heritage and events funding. This is simply  inadequate. As the work of the Campbelltown Arts Centre, the Casula Powerhouse and artist like Hedar Abadi show, the stories of Western Sydney aren't second-rate or inferior. They are richly diverse, they are important and they need to be told. In addition to inadequate funding, council also faces cost shifting from both tiers of government. The peak body for councils in my state, Local Government New South Wales, estimates that cost shifting by state and federal governments cost councils upward of $800 million for the financial year 2015-16. A recent report found that the total amount of cost shifting comes in at about $30 million for Liverpool and $8 million for Campbelltown City Council. Further, councils in my region have been hit hard by the freeze between 2014 and 2017 on the financial assistance grants from the federal government. Liverpool City Council lost just under $3.5 million, Campbelltown almost $3.8 million and Fairfield just over $3.7 million. Initiatives like the Black Spot Program and the Bridges Renewal Program make a contribution, but the federal government can and should do more to assist our local councils. The need is made more acute in New South Wales, where the local government sector has faced the additional challenge of a hostile state government. The New South Wales government has forcefully merged councils, stripped away decision-making powers of councillors and overridden local government controls in the name of progress and reform. Local government is the closest form of government to the people. It does fantastic work building strong and healthy communities, but it could do so much more, more effectively, if it was properly resourced and supported by other levels of government, especially the federal government. Mr JOSH WILSON (Fremantle) (12:26): I'm very glad to be part of the debate on this motion. I'm well aware of the vital role that local government plays across Australia and I'm particularly familiar with the role it plays in my electorate. The cities of Cockburn, Fremantle and Melville, and the Town of East Fremantle all contribute to the distinctive culture and character that is a feature of the various landscapes and neighbourhoods within the federal electorate that I represent. On Sunday I was at the George Street Festival in East Fremantle, which has been going for nearly 30 years. On the Friday before that I was at Yangebup Family Centre in Cockburn, which provides both child care and social inclusion programs for seniors. Earlier in the same week I met representatives of Friends of Monument Hill, which of course is the principal commemorative site for veterans and for those who lost their lives or suffered in their Defence Force service. All of these activities, facilities or locations are operated and sustained by local government in partnership with the local community. I had the privilege of representing the Beaconsfield Ward as councillor in the City of Fremantle for nearly seven years, including five years as Deputy Mayor. I loved that work. It was challenging work and taught me a great deal. I want to take this opportunity to recognise two aspects of the local government world that might sometimes get overlooked. The first is the quality and commitment of local government staff, from the CEO, directors and managers right through to the workers who staff libraries and recreation centres, manage our parks, deliver essential services and run cultural programs. All these people provide critical public services, and I know that those who work for local governments in my electorate often do so because they find community work compelling in itself. They are drawn to building resilience and vitality and creating a sense of shared well-being in our neighbourhoods. I applaud that. The second aspect I want to mention is that layer of community and resident groups and organisations whose volunteer work is essential in guiding, supplementing and partnering with local government. There are dozens of these across the Fremantle electorate, from the Aubin Grove residents group in the south-east to APACE in North Fremantle by the coast. They include groups focused on history and heritage, like the Fremantle Society and the Heritage Guides, through to surf life-saving clubs at Leighton and Coogee Beach, and of course organisations that protect local amenity and environment like Native ARC, Save Beeliar Wetlands and Friends of Woodman Point. I say to all of those volunteers and office bearers at the end of another big year, well done and thank you. Traditionally there has not been a lot of direct involvement between the Commonwealth and local governments, but that has gradually changed. Of course it was the Whitlam government which took a direct interest in the delivery of essential local services like sewerage. Since that time Labor has made sure to look at how the Commonwealth can partner with and enable local governments and local communities. Indeed, people will remember that during the global financial crisis it was a hallmark of Labor's world-leading approach that stimulus funding was directed through the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program, which produced the double benefit of underwriting local employment and creating community infrastructure of lasting benefit. In the Fremantle electorate that resulted in fantastic and enduring projects like the restoration of Locke Park rotunda in East Fremantle, the new community and recreation centre in Hilton and the brand new Coogee Beach Surf Life Saving Club in Cockburn. I've been glad to subsequently build on those community facilities through the Stronger Communities Program-for example, with $20,000 for the new first responder training room  at Coogee Beach and with $7,000 for new lights in the PCYC at Hilton, among a range of other local improvements. I'm grateful to the member for Mackellar for bringing this motion and for highlighting the programs through which the Commonwealth supports local road improvements and other amenities. I do need to point out that the outcomes under these programs vary and, as I've noted in the past, Western Australia rarely gets a fair share. The Bridges Renewal Program is a good example. I'm glad to have supported the successful application from the City of Cockburn, which is currently delivering the much-needed duplication of the Spearwood Avenue Bridge. But, within the program as a whole, WA has fared poorly. Of the 375 projects supported so far, only 12 have been in WA-that's three per cent. Of $341 million in total funding, only $28.5 million has been directed to WA, which is about 7.5 per cent. You can't say that we're getting a look-in when WA is 10.5 per cent of the national population and a full third of the Australian land mass. Local government is the most accessible and responsive layer of government in Australia. It reflects the services and landscape of our neighbourhood. It reflects our local character. For all those reasons, I'm supportive of measures to increase the ways in which the Commonwealth can engage with and fund that vital work. Debate adjourned. White Ribbon Day Consideration resumed of the motion: That this House: (1) notes that 23 November 2018 is White Ribbon Day (WRD) followed by the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women on 25 November; (2) recognises that WRD aims to prevent violence against women by increasing public awareness and challenging attitudes and behaviours that allow gendered violence to continue; (3) supports the United Nations UNiTE to End Violence against Women and the 16 days of activism campaigns which are held internationally from 25 November to 10 December each year; (4) understands that: (a) this year, as of 15 October 2018, 55 women have been killed by violence in Australia; (b) one in three women have experienced physical and/or sexual violence perpetrated by someone known to them; (c) each week on average one woman is killed by a current or former partner; and (d) domestic and family violence is the principle cause of homelessness for women and their children; (5) acknowledges the high economic cost of violence against women, which is estimated to cost the Australian economy $21 billion a year; and 2 No. 148-26 November 2018; (6) asks all Members to show their support for the principles of WRD.",157
224,Mr HAYES,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," On 23 November, we commemorated White Ribbon Day, and on 25 November we commemorated the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, set by the United Nations. By now, I imagine we're all pretty familiar with the statistics: one in five women will experience physical or sexual violence in their lifetime and, tragically, currently on average one woman is being murdered each week by a current or former partner. Although community awareness of domestic violence has greatly increased over recent times, this long standing and very complex issue, domestic violence, remains a major issue in most of our communities. I know that 50 per cent of all assaults reported to my local police are domestic violence related. I'm also aware that 60 per cent of boys growing up in abusive households are likely to become abusers themselves. What I find very, very confounding is 50 per cent of young women growing up in abusive households are likely to take an abuser as a partner, and, therefore, the cycle goes on. Domestic violence remains one of the principal causes of homelessness for women and families. Adding to this and the far-reaching social ramifications to our communities, the cost of domestic violence is estimated presently at more than $21 billion a year. If the social costs don't alarm everybody, there is an economic cost-an imperative as to why we must act in respect of domestic violence. These statistics make it clear that on domestic violence, we cannot afford to put our heads in the sand and simply say, 'This is a matter for the authorities.' This clearly is a matter for all our communities. We must all work together to help develop an integrated and coordinated multiagency response. For me, the issue is personal. As you know, Deputy Speaker Vamvakinou, I'm married, I have a daughter and, of my 10 grandchildren, six are girls. For me that becomes very personal because according to that statistic, one is likely to become a victim of violence. Violence against women is real; it's happening in our neighbourhoods. It involves women no matter how successful, strong and resilient and no matter their ethnic or religious beliefs. Still  we see a very staggering underreporting of domestic violence cases, probably principally out of fear of reprisal or harm to children. We need to empower women to be able to engage with the authorities, deal with our police and certainly hold people accountable. In fact, we need more men standing up and saying, 'This is not acceptable.' We need more men promoting education within our communities about violence against women. In fact, we probably need just more real men. Today we should remember those women who have lost their lives to domestic violence, and also their grieving families. Tragically, so far this year 63 women have been killed as a result of domestic violence. It's not enough to simply give speeches around White Ribbon Day. It is an imperative for our community to take responsibility, to look out for families and friends and workmates and neighbours. Over the past week I've had the opportunity to attend a number of White Ribbon functions in my electorate, including at Liverpool railway station, organised by Ragini Naidu; at the Bonnie Support Services candlelit vigil for victims of domestic violence, put together by Executive Officer Tracy Phillips and her team; and at a school assembly at Prairiewood High School, initiated by Gemma Evans and the student leadership council. While I was unable to attend today's White Ribbon Day walk in my electorate, I'd like to thank all the volunteers for their tireless efforts in coordinating this and, in particular, Superintendent Peter Lennon and his team of the Fairfield Local Area Police Command. As a White Ribbon Day ambassador, I urge all men to take the oath never to commit, never to excuse and never to remain silent when it comes to violence against women. Take the oath but live by the pledge. We must break this cycle.",159
225,Mr CREWTHER,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," Today, I stand in support of White Ribbon Day. Today, I pay my respects to those who've experienced or have been a victim of harm or abuse at the hands of another. I pay my respects to the-as at 15 October 2018-55 women who have been killed by violence this year alone in Australia. As the father of a daughter and as a husband, brother, son and grandson, it has always been instilled in me to do whatever I can and need to do to help end men's violence against women, to be an example in myself, and to oppose violence more generally, whether it's against our young boys and girls, our elderly men and women, or others. Abuse and violence can occur in many different ways, not just physically. It can involve emotional or psychological abuse, verbal abuse, financial abuse and, unfortunately, sexual abuse in some cases as well. It isn't just contained within the home; it extends to social settings and workplaces. It can happen anywhere and often many don't see it. Abuse and violence of any kind often result in psychological and physical harm. This issue has always been one of great significance to me, particularly as my wife and I are about to bring another child into this world. It is another opportunity for me to reflect on the history of violence against women, as well as to envisage a world without it and hopefully a world without violence altogether. I am sure many of us here today, as members of parliament, have at some point been involved in situations where constituents have come to us about domestic violence, whether for help, advocacy or direction. Some of us may have experienced domestic violence ourselves in our own households now, or as children. It is through these situations where we are in a privileged position to be able to refer them to the appropriate departments, organisations and pathways. These situations show us first hand not only the level of harm that domestic violence does but also the long-term effects and the impact of dealing with these experiences. I want to acknowledge, specifically, the great work done in my local electorate by many who are working to tackle domestic violence. When I hear the statistics, it often gives me chills. As I read in the motion moved by Ms Husar, one in three women have experienced physical and/or sexual violence, perpetrated by someone known to them. One woman on average each week is killed by a current or former partner, and domestic and family violence are the principal causes of homelessness for women and children. These statistics are and always have been too high. In my opinion, our work is not done until the statistics are zero. As a society, we need to continue to do more. We have made a lot of progress in relation to education, raising awareness and changing attitudes. We have also taken away the stigma of calling out inappropriate remarks or harmful actions, raising the standards of respect expected. We need to stop all domestic violence, as highlighted by White Ribbon Day, against women in particular, but against anyone, whether they be children, the elderly, men or women, people of different faiths or backgrounds, people with different ethnicities and so on. I stood in parliament last year and do so again this year, and I stand firm in my position of condemning those who commit, excuse or stay silent about violence against women in Australia and around the world. Those who would condone violence against anyone should be condemned. I take the oath that I will always stand up, speak up and act to prevent men's violence against women, and I will never be a bystander.",160
226,Mr GEORGANAS,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," I rise to speak in support of this motion. White Ribbon Day, followed by the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, provides all Australians with  an opportunity to step up and to stop and think about the scourge of domestic violence that is in our community. Like a lot of people in this place, I've been a proud White Ribbon ambassador for a very long time. I was one of the first ambassadors in South Australia. Like all of us, I deplore acts of violence against anybody but particularly acts of violence towards women. Statistics show that, despite all the efforts, the message is just not getting through, and it is a stain on our nation. We have seen far too many cases this year where women have been killed in random acts of violence and attacks where the victim had never interacted with the culprit before. We've heard some horrendous stories. These kinds of attacks increase the already intensified fear that women have of simply walking by themselves or being out late at night-all simple acts of living and all things that most men almost certainly never stop to think about. I personally can't remember the last time. I thought, 'I'd better not walk a certain way for fear of my safety.' I can't remember the last time. I thought, 'I'd better pretend to be speaking to someone on my phone in the hope that it might deter unwanted attention.' And that's not because I'm special but because it's largely not an issue for men. These random attacks are all too regular, but what's more shocking and truly frightening is that, on average, one woman is killed by a current or former partner every single week. One in five women will experience physical or sexual violence from the age of 15. This is what our statistics show. This is absolutely disgraceful and it needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency. To address this problem of violence against women, we need to deal with the source. It's about the attitudes that some men have towards women. It's about the examples that parents set their children and the examples that fathers set their sons. It's about the way children see men treating women. And it's not just about seeing violent behaviours. It's also about seeing how men treat women as the more inferior sex in some cases and hearing people using sexist and demeaning language such as, 'You throw a ball like a girl,' or 'Don't be such a girl,' or 'Don't cry like a girl.' They're some of the things that we hear, and those seemingly innocuous comments matter. They all matter because they affect the thinking of children and provide them with the false impression that boys are better than girls. This starts at a very early age. The other important issues that need to be addressed, and I think they needs to be addressed by all of us, are the frequency of sexual harassment within our community and the importance of calling it out-in particular, the importance of men calling it out when they see it. Almost all the women I know in my life have some kind of story of having experienced some form of harassment. Most of us men do not have such stories. I think we, as men, have a big role to play in calling out harassment when we see it and in setting the right example. And I'm not saying that all men behave like this, but, clearly, we are hearing far too many stories and seeing far too many statistics, and it's up to us to do something about that. We need to call it out and not just be bystanders when we see these actions, which are unacceptable. We need to continue to work hard to ultimately eliminate violence against women. It is something we all need to be involved in. We can lead it from this place, but, ultimately, all of us as individuals right throughout society need to be involved in this. I am certainly committed-as are, I know, many others in this place-to ensuring that this happens. Ms O'TOOLE (Herbert) (12:44): I have spoken many times in this place on the terrible statistics regarding violence against women. I think we all know the statistics. We all know the rates at which women are being killed and/or are living with debilitating injuries, physical or emotional, as a result. We all know the incredibly low statistics of how many women actually report the violence that they have experienced. We all know the statistics about the impact that violence against women has on children. The statistics are in our face on a regular basis. But what do most of us know about the stories of these women? Chances are everyone does know a woman who has been or is a victim of violence but has never told her story. So today I want to share a story with you. For the purposes of protecting this woman's identity, I will call her Sarah. Sarah is an amazing woman. She has two children, both in their teenage years. Sarah has a law degree and an excellent professional job. She has a vibrant, warm and bubbly personality and can fill the room with laughter. I have known her for only a few years, but a couple of years ago I was saddened and horrified to discover that she was the victim of domestic violence by her now ex-husband. Sarah has described some of the attacks she endured. She was repeatedly beaten within an inch of her life, and the final straw came when she was thrown across the room and knocked unconscious, but the beating continued. She woke up in hospital, and the first thing that concerned her was the safety of her children. Thankfully they were both safe. The second thing she thought about was how she was going to explain the broken bones and bruises to her work colleagues. Her make-up could not hide it this time. Sarah left that relationship, but in the years to come, whilst going through the divorce proceedings, Sarah would lose multiple jobs. She lost jobs because she had to take time off from work for Family Court responsibilities and to fight for the custody of her children. She lost multiple jobs because her ex-husband would come to her workplace and threaten her work colleagues as they were leaving. She lost multiple jobs because she was forced to constantly move, because her  ex-husband would eventually track her down and find her new location. Two years on, and after 50 breaches by her ex-husband of his AVOs, Sarah has finally been able to move on. Her ex-husband was finally arrested. He was imprisoned for a physical altercation with another male, not for the multiple attacks he had made on Sarah. But, either way, Sarah now has some sort of peace. As difficult as it is, I tell her story in this place so that we can understand the human stories behind the statistics-not just that this is an issue that has become an epidemic but the actual turmoil that women and children, sadly, face, often every day. When I asked Sarah about the services she sought when she needed assistance most, I wasn't shocked to hear that it was the same organisations that I hear of so often being utilised in Townsville. The Women's Centre was the place Sarah first told her story. The Women's Centre is a place that has been a continual source of refuge for Sarah, as it has been for many other women in my community of Townsville. But, like most services, the Women's Centre struggles on in a building that needs desperate renovation, and the funding for the services that it offers has been reduced or cut. It is not good enough for us to acknowledge the statistics that are associated with violence against women. It is not good enough for us not to consider that those services require ongoing support and adequate funding. They also need to have facilities that are up to standard for services being offered in 2018 in any community across this country. I commend the work that the Townsville Women's Centre does and I pay my deep respects to those women who have survived domestic violence and have made a safe life for their children. I hope that, as a community, we pay deep attention to the stories of these women, not just the numbers that make up the statistics. Debate adjourned.",160
227,Unknown,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS,Sitting suspended from 12:49 to 16:03 NA Climate Change,162
228,Mr BANDT,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Last week I met with members of the newly formed Australian Conservation Foundation Community Inner Melbourne group. Core members of the group include chair, Don Vogt; secretary, Jennifer Burger; Nikhil Sobti; Meredith Budge and Pauline Sheehan. They've formed because they know that we are facing a climate crisis and they want to see an end to the mining and burning of coal, with a shift to 100 per cent renewable energy. They also want to see coal communities supported through this transition. They're canvassing community support for these actions and specifically pushing for politicians like me to take action. I'm inspired by the work that they're doing to keep our climate safe for all of us and for our children. They're working in our local Melbourne community to build a movement for real climate action. The group has had hundreds of conversations with local Melburnians. They've held stalls, made phone calls and are screening 'stop Adani' documentaries. I'm proud to say that the Melbourne community is backing them. Over 80 per cent of the people they've spoken with at market stalls have signed their petition and have backed their call to replace polluting coal with renewable energy. Today, in parliament, I say that I also back that call. We must quit coal, and we must make the rapid transition to clean renewables. To the ACF Community Inner Melbourne group and everybody who is taking action for a safe climate, thank you. It's people like you, and countless others around Australia and the world, who will ensure that we can protect our planet and our way of life. Telecommunications",162
229,Mr GEE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Mobile black spots are a real source of irritation for our country communities. They are also an impediment to the growth of country communities, including being an impediment to decentralisation and also business expansion. They can also be downright dangerous in an emergency. The residents of the Lowther and Kanimbla Valley communities have been pushing hard for a new mobile phone tower in the area for many years now. But, despite the site being nominated for funding through the federal government's Mobile Black Spot Program, Telstra has so far not made an application to co-fund the site. The whole aim of the Mobile Black Spot Program is for government to partner with telcos in order to clear up some of these black spots. However, in order for all of these bad areas and black spots to be cleared up, the telcos have to actually want to build the tower there. Unfortunately, to date, neither Telstra nor the other telcos have put in any application for federal black spot funding at the Lowther and Kanimbla Valley site. The bottom line is that without an application from Telstra or one of the other telcos a new tower simply will not happen. I have been working with the Lowther and Kanimbla Valley communities for some time now. We have an opportunity to get funding for this location and other locations in Calare. One location is Wattle Flat, which is north of Bathurst. That community has been pushing for a new tower there for many years. However, the issue is that Telstra and the other telcos need to play their part and show some interest in these sites. Round 4 of the  government's Mobile Black Spot Program is now open. I'm calling on Telstra and the other telcos to come to the party and make an application for this site and others. Canberra Electorate: SouthFest",162
230,Ms BRODTMANN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," On Saturday, Tuggeranong exploded into life with the inaugural SouthFest festival. SouthFest started out as an idea to bring life into the streets, the laneways and the lake foreshore area of the Tuggeranong Town Centre and, most importantly, to connect with the local community. It did that in spades, with an estimated 20,000 people coming through the event during the course of the day. There were over 200 market stallholders, food vendors, street performers, musicians, Etsy Made Local and free inflatables for the kids. The day was a huge success-an unparalleled success. This was all made possible with the help of five major partners, including the ACT government, and the enormous support of community partners, including: the Tuggeranong Community Council; YWCA Canberra; Tuggeranong Arts Centre; My Tuggeranong; The Vikings Group; Communities@Work; Valley FM; Meeting Place; Southpoint, or the old Hyperdome; Independent Property Group; Needhams Financial Planning; OSKY Interactive; and Interact Collaborations. We all know that the success of events like these is only made possible with an engine room running at full steam in the background. In this case, it was the subcommittee formed out of the Tuggeranong Community Council. I want to give a big congratulations to Taryn Langdon, who drove the vision, and to the rest of the SouthFest committee. Drew, Catherine, Glenys, Beverly, Peter, Louise, Daisy, Didi, Alison, Rachel and Taimus, thank you so much for realising that vision and bringing Taryn's idea to life. Wheelchairs For Kids",163
231,Mr GOODENOUGH,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Wheelchairs for Kids is a charitable organisation which is doing remarkable work in the manufacturing and distributing of wheelchairs for needy children in developing countries around the world. They are supported by Rotary, the Christian Brothers and private donors. Approximately 340 wheelchairs are produced every month, which is approximately 3,550 per year or more than 42,307 since its establishment 20 years ago in 1998. The wheelchairs are locally designed, specifically to conform to World Health Organization guidelines. They are built specifically for rough terrain and are adjustable to a child's size, with postural supports, a headrest, a harness, a waterproof cushion, a tray and a toolkit, as well as a knee rug and a knitted toy. For every $200 donated in support of the Wheelchairs for Kids program, a child gains a new wheelchair, giving him or her this new experience of freedom of mobility for the first time in their life. On behalf of the Australian parliament, I commend the work of more than 220 volunteers, led by Gordon Hudson, Brother Olly Pickett, Trevor Canning and Bob Sheridan. They regularly give up their time, putting in hundreds of hours to build and distribute wheelchairs. I advocate for the federal government to provide recurrent funding grants to support the operation of this very worthy charitable organisation. Beaton, Dr John Mark",163
232,Dr LEIGH,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise to pay tribute to the life of Dr John Mark Beaton, who passed away in his sleep on 6 November 2018, at the age of 74. A successful anthropologist, John joined the Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia in 2001. As others have noted, he has not just been at the academy but was the academy. In my own experience with him, he was gentle and generous, warm and funny-somebody who brought life to an institution that could otherwise have been terribly stuffy. At the memorial service for him at the Shine Dome, Bruce Chapman spoke about the fact that he was that rarest of men, an American who had fallen in love with cricket, as it happened when he walked passed the nets at the South Oval in the 1970s, when he was at the Australian National University doing his PhD. Glenn Withers acknowledged John with a posthumous honorary membership as a Fellow of the Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia. I imagine it was an honour that John would have treasured almost as much as his 2014 life membership at the ANU Cricket Club. He'll be missed dearly not only by us, his friends, but also by his children, Laura Beaton and Daniel Beaton, and his house-wolves, Rusty, Walter and Odie. Vale, John Beaton. Cowper Electorate: South Coffs Community Garden",163
233,Mr HARTSUYKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I take the opportunity to commend the great work of the South Coffs Community Garden at Bruce King Drive in Boambee East. It's a great facility that allows people to enjoy gardening, to grow vegetables, fruits and flowers-whatever they please-in a communal setting. It being on the north coast, many people have moved to the area quite recently and many of them are living in units and don't have the opportunity to enjoy gardening as they don't have the land available. Coffs community garden does the work of providing that opportunity.  I was delighted to announce a Stronger Communities grant of some $10,000 to help the community garden build a new community centre. This will provide a place for members to meet and enjoy each other's company. It will also provide a water supply, because, regrettably, there is no water immediately available and they will depend on tank water to provide the water for all of the produce from the garden. The produce that's grown is often sold in local markets. So it's a great facility. May I commend the work of president, John Higgins, garden coordinator, Chris Higgins, and regular volunteer, Doug Whaley. Without people like them, a great community facility such as the community garden could not go on. There are still sites left, Deputy Speaker. If you feel that you want to turn your hand to gardening, there's a great opportunity at Coffs Harbour to get yourself a plot and perhaps increase Australia's exports. South Australia: Roads",163
234,Ms RISHWORTH,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Over my time as the member for Kingston, I have fought many fights to improve roads in our community, including the most recently-improved road, South Road, from Seaford to Aldinga. We will enjoy that road going all the way to Sellicks. Then there is the duplication of the Southern Expressway, a road, which, under the Liberal government, went one way and now it goes two ways. All residents in southern Adelaide deserve roads that cater to the needs of their community. A local road that I believe urgently needs addressing is Commercial Road. Seaford is a fast-growing area in my electorate and home to many young families. The neighbouring suburb of Port Noarlunga is also a busy tourist destination. Commercial Road is the main arterial road that passes through both of these suburbs. Currently, it has one lane each way. Ask anyone who lives in Seaford or Port Noarlunga and they'll tell you about the congestion along Commercial Road. You can often see cars banked up along the busy road, particularly during peak hour or when a community event is on. You also see many families and others trying to get out of their suburb to get to the next suburb, and they are just not able to do so. I believe that the state government must make the duplication of Commercial Road a priority, including the duplication of the Salt Creek Bridge. This is critically important to cater for the future needs of our community. Canning Electorate: Employment",164
235,Mr HASTIE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," The Liberal-National government has taken measures to fight unemployment in Canning. Over the past three years, we have funded a dedicated Mandurah Employment Facilitator, delivered $10 million to assist retrenched workers in the Peel region and supported small businesses like Madora Bay Glass, through the PaTH program. In recent weeks, the Morrison government has announced further measures to support jobseekers and local employers in Canning. First, we delivered $21.75 million to make the Peel Business Park a reality. This is a game-changing initiative driven by the Shire of Murray and the Peel Development Commission. It's designed to grow local jobs by fostering industry, export and innovation in agriculture. Second, the Peel region is one of only 10 regions in Australia to have been selected to participate in the Regional Employment Trials. Under this program, local stakeholders can apply for grants of up to $200,000 to help upskill local jobseekers. Finally, employers in the Peel region will next year be eligible to apply for the government's new wage subsidy trial. Under this program, rural small businesses will be able to subsidise the wages of apprentices in areas such as plumbing, mechanical, electrical and hairdressing. This will help young people in rural communities enter trades and careers without being forced to move to the city. Work gives people dignity and purpose. While there is still much to be done, I'm proud to be part of a government delivering practical solutions for jobseekers in the Peel region and Canning. Techfugees Sydney Hackathon",164
236,Mr HUSIC,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Over the weekend, Techfugees held its fourth Sydney Hackathon. Techfugees was designed to bring the tech start-up and NGO communities together with refugees settling and building new lives in Australia. Blacktown was the perfect place to host Techfugees, given that it's a city that has become home to people from nearly 188 different birthplaces. The teams were set a challenge to create tech solutions for settlement difficulties identified by Settlement Services International, the largest not-for-profit humanitarian settlement organisation in the country, with key themes including access to services beyond settlement eligibility periods, the need for disability and aged-care support, domestic and family violence support and education and training support. The teams worked together on their ideas and pitched them to judges. The third prize went to a team of young men who had put to gather a chatbot to help young refugees get connected with a buddy who is experiencing mental health challenges. The second prize went to a team helping map out pathways for refugees wanting to go to university and find scholarships, bearing in mind that young refugees can't qualify for HECS, which is an important barrier. The first prize went to Team First Path, who designed an online game to help young refugees navigate subject choices when they arrive, which can be really daunting. It takes a lot of work and there are a lot  of volunteers who help bring this together. I particularly want to give a shout-out to Anne-Marie Elias, Annie Parker and Nicky Williamson, who always put in such a huge effort to make this a great success. Congratulations to everyone who was involved. Page Electorate: Carney's Shoes",164
237,Mr HOGAN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," After Mackelly's clothing store and Sid Jones's butchery, Carney's shoes is Maclean's third-oldest family business, recently marking its 70th year. The store owners, Marcia Carney, Patricia Skinner and Stephanie Tunstead, have decided to call it a day and have put the business on the market. The family-run store has been at its 247 River Street address for all but six months of those 70 years, when Maria and Patricia's father, Bill, knocked the shop down to build the Carney Arcade. Long-time family friend Stephanie was appointed as manager before Marcia and Patricia bought out the other family members. Their focus and understanding of their community has seen the shop go from strength to strength. Located in sugar cane-growing country, the shop offers monthly accounts because the owners know that growers and farmers don't always get a weekly pay cheque. Quite often, family and friends of older members of the community who are living in retirement villages will take a selection of shoes for their elderly relatives, to see if they want to buy them. Marcia says simply, 'We support the community, and they support us.' My wife has commented often on the great selection of shoes they have. I'd like to congratulate Marcia, Patricia and Stephanie for being the heart and soul of Carney's Shoes. I wish them all the best. Franklin Electorate: Centenary of Armistice",165
238,Ms COLLINS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," What a privilege it was on 11 November this year to attend commemorative services around my electorate for the centenary of Armistice. I spent the day firstly down at Huonville, at a very sombre service, talking to locals as we commemorated the loss in World War I of many Tasmanians and talked about the impact that had had on history and on many families in Tasmania. I then had the real privilege of unveiling a memorial at the Waverley Flora Park in my electorate. This memorial has been crafted by a local craftsman, and the memorial walk lists all the locals who served and died during World War I. For their families, the Armistice was very significant indeed. It was a very lovely service. Many locals attended, and it was interesting to hear local family members talk about the impact on their family of their ancestor going off to World War I. It was a remarkable ceremony, and I was very pleased to be part of it, through the Armistice Centenary Grants Program. I thank the Clarence City Council, who organised the memorial. I thank the locals and the artists involved for creating a remarkable memorial. I particularly thank the locals and the families who were involved in the unveiling. I also want to thank the council for their application. Petrie Electorate: Schools",165
239,Mr HOWARTH,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Last week I was thrilled to visit the C&K Aspley East Community Kindergarten in Aspley with great news. With a proud 52-year history, the kindy's playground was well and truly showing its age, and so the excitement was at an all-time high when I was able to announce that the federal government will provide the grant to upgrade the playground and ensure that there's a new playground in 2019. Earlier this year, when I visited the kindy, director Marie White spoke to me about the need for a new playground. The old playground had suffered damage during last year's high rainfall events. The kindy has always been supported by local businesses to ensure they are contributing to the local community. However, the cost of the new playground was way beyond this small community's resources. Many local children have been students at the kindy, and their parents were also students of the kindergarten. At the new kindergarten playground there'll be new slides to slide down, climbing frames to swing on and new obstacles to explore. I want to particularly thank all the staff, committee president Casey Wood, all the committee members and everyone involved there, including all the parents. Your dedication to ensuring our up-and-coming generation has the best possible start is to be commended. To all the parents, thank you for signing my petition. The $100,000 grant from the government will go a long way and be great for the community. Macquarie Electorate: Anniversaries",165
240,Ms TEMPLEMAN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," When a lyrebird interrupts your journey, you know you must be in Mount Wilson, at the top of the Blue Mountains, in the beautiful electorate of Macquarie. On the weekend, the Mount Wilson and Mount Irvine communities gathered at the glorious Dennarque property to mark the 150th anniversary of the surveying of Mount Wilson. Surveyor Edward S Wyndham found the easier route to Mount Wilson via the Darling Causeway and the ridge along which you still travel to get to this basalt-rich hamlet. His survey was completed in 1868, creating 62 portions from seven to 45 acres in size. Two years later, when they were auctioned, there was little or no interest, but of course it now boasts some of the most wonderful homes and gardens in the region. Congratulations to all those involved in marking this anniversary, and thanks to Bill Moss for hosting the celebrations.  Another high point of the Blue Mountains last week, at a physical highpoint, we marked the 150th anniversary of Mount Victoria Public School, the oldest school in the Blue Mountains. It opened in 1868 to educate the children of workers building the railway and also those of local farmers, beginning in a small stone cottage which today houses Possum's Patch preschool. Still a small school of 69 pupils, Mount Victoria celebrated big with songs and music at a special assembly and a fair under the guidance of Principal Gerard Elms. The students sang their totem song in the Dharruk language, and the four year 6 students acted as MCs. It was a lovely event for a very special school. Nur, Mr Bashir Mr VAN MANEN (Forde-Government Whip) (16:23): I'd like to take this opportunity to congratulate one of the fantastic young students in my electorate of Forde. Bashir Nur, who has recently been selected to join Logan Lightning FC, is an example of a great local sporting champion. The Forde electorate is indeed fortunate to have so many up-and-coming young sporting champions. Mr Nur, who has now completed his senior year at Marsden State High, grew up playing football in Africa. He didn't have the sporting programs and facilities, such as the government's Local Sporting Champions grants that we are so lucky to have here in Australia. Nevertheless, he found a way to play. After migrating to Australia in 2010, his dreams of playing this sport began to develop and grow. Bashir was selected for the Super Youth League Under 15 team and then, in 2017, after some setbacks, he obtained a scholarship to play in the under-18 BPL team. This year, he has accomplished some of his biggest achievements. He represented the metropolitan east region at the state championships, where he was selected for the Queensland Schoolboys side, and travelled to Sydney to compete in the tri-state tournament against Victoria. The tournament in Sydney saw him named a shadow player for the Australian boys team, the first Marsden State High representative to do so. I'd like to congratulate Bashir on his success and wish him all the best for the future. Scullin Electorate: Seniors Forum",165
241,Mr GILES,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," It's a pleasure to get the call from you, Mr Deputy Speaker Laundy-an unexpected one in a couple of senses. Like most of us, I'm very fortunate to have very active seniors groups in the Scullin electorate. On Thursday I brought a number of them together in a seniors forum. This is something I've been doing regularly so that I can get the benefit of their wisdom and share some learnings. Unfortunately, for those present, I also shared my incompetence at linedancing, which I don't propose to make a regular contribution to at any gathering. I'm particularly appreciative of the contribution of the two keynote speakers at this event, both of whom dealt very effectively with important issues. I thank Belinda Nixon from Dementia Australia for an important and effective contribution that engaged all and also Jeff Ryan from the Stroke Foundation, who gave a range of practical tips based on his own personal experience. It was a pleasure to be there with so many other community organisations. I acknowledge in particular the Whittlesea U3A not just for their linedancing and choir but the spirit of community that they bring with them always and their contribution to building a more inclusive society for older residents in the city of Whittlesea. They were there alongside Victoria Police, Yarra Valley Water, the Metropolitan Fire Brigade, Centrelink, the Continence Foundation, the Heart Foundation and DPV Health. This event brought together the community, with more than 250 citizens present on Thursday. European Carp",166
242,Mr JOYCE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Cyprinus carpio, the European carp, is one of the worse pests in Australian waterways. At times it is up to between 80 per cent and 90 per cent of the biomass. That means that, if you weighed everything in the river, between 80 per cent and 90 per cent of it would be carp. It's a great disappointment that I hear of the loss of Matt Barwick, who was in charge of the carp eradication scheme. I now feel that this scheme is stalling, and that is a very bad outcome. We were looking at the release of the CyHV-3, the carp herpes virus. It has 65 per cent and above mortality. This would have had a decisive effect on reducing the environmental pressures on so many sections of the river. They believe that because of the remarkable fecundity of carp this could be a one-hit wonder. I would like to note that, if we had that attitude with rabbits, we wouldn't have released the calicivirus or myxoma virus-and for prickly pear we wouldn't have released the moth. We have to at least give the rivers some chance of revitalisation. It's better to have a one-hit wonder than no hit at all. I note the mutation of viruses. If a virus does become ineffective because of herd immunity, you can always find the next strain to take over. Indonesia",166
243,Mr GOSLING,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Darwin is Australia's gateway to Asia and the growing markets there. For Darwin, Indonesia offers great opportunities. It's obvious that people in the Territory want to see further  connectivity between Darwin and eastern Indonesia. We want to see more flights and more competition on the Bali route. We also want to see flight routes opened up into west Timor and a place called Kupang. Earlier this year I led an ALI delegation to Jakarta. We met with a number of Indonesian political parties. Our host asked us to look beyond Bali into eastern Indonesia in particular. I have travelled throughout Flores to Labuan Bajo-the diving there is incredible-and west Timor near Kupang and to an island called Rote, where there's incredible surfing. I know the beauty of eastern Indonesia and the opportunities that are presented. It was great to meet with former foreign minister Marty Natalegawa in Jakarta and also great to meet with him today in Parliament House, where we continued our discussions around the need for greater connectivity between Northern Australia, particularly Darwin, and eastern Indonesia. There are entrepreneurs both in Indonesia and Darwin ready to jump on the opportunities that exist. I want to acknowledge some of them-Tony Haritos and Carmel Bates. Their passion has already seen great connections with Timor-Leste and will see great connections with Kupang and eastern Indonesia. Road Safety Mr CRAIG KELLY (Hughes) (16:29): We recently commemorated the 100th anniversary of the Armistice, recognising the end of the First World War, where over 61,000 Australians lost their lives. Two decades later, a further 39,000 Australians lost their lives in World War II. In those two conflicts alone, 100,000 Australians lost their lives, every one of those deaths a tragedy, with grieving by family and friends. But, since the end of World War II, 150,000 Australians-50 per cent more than we lost in both World Wars-have been killed on our roads. This is simply not good enough. There is some good news amongst those numbers: since 1970 we've seen a significant decline in the road toll, from 3,780, or 30.4 deaths for every 100,000 people, down last year to 1,225 deaths-that is, down to just five deaths for every 100,000 people. But that is still far too many. To have a thousand Australians a year die on the roads-men, women and children that are just going about their everyday business-is completely unsatisfactory. We as parliamentarians all need to work on road safety, and one of the best ways we can do that is to make the cost of motoring cheaper. The statistics show that newer cars are safer. If we're able to reduce the cost of cars, we can get that road toll down. ParlyFOF",166
244,Ms OWENS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," It's that time of the year again, when ParlyFOF takes over the halls of parliament: each November, the 'Parliamentary Friends of Aussie Fashion', also known as ParlyFOF, encourage members and senators to don their best Australian fashions in support of shopping locally. Once again, ParlyFOF will patrol the halls of parliament this week, checking members and senators' clothing labels to make sure they're wearing Australian-designed clothes. We all know that shopping locally helps build our local economies and local jobs. Many people don't know, though, that I've been wearing locally-designed clothes and jewellery-and I am today-almost every day in parliament since I was elected in 2004. And it's easy to do, because Western Sydney has some excellent local designers. Some of those I've been privileged to find include Ruth Fattal, Melange Chic, Indie Colours, Seewa Collections, Evaloka, Ilham A Ismail, Mash Accessories, and Maa, but there are plenty more, and I hope to find them all in the near future. This week, I encourage members and senators to Facebook, Tweet and Instagram photos of themselves wearing Australian-designed clothes, preferably ones from their own electorate. I'll be sharing the results on my social media accounts, too. As always, it is a bit of a competition, so let the FOF-off begin.",167
245,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I'm proudly wearing clothes from my electorate, too. I give the call to the member for Bowman. Bowman Electorate: Hospitals Local Government",167
246,Mr LAMING,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Forty million dollars ripped from your local hospital service, courtesy of Kim Richards and Don Brown, the local state members, is nothing to be proud of. Nor do I derive any great pleasure in riding these MPs like a donkey to make sure they give every cent of that $40 million back. The community deserves that money, and we don't want to see massive Labor cuts like this. It is exactly what we're facing up in Bowman; they've even preselected a decoy doctor, in the hope that that will defend and deflect some of the criticism for ripping off our hospitals. What happens on the weekend, on a Sunday-you'd think they'd be getting penalty rates, these state Labor MPs-is they sneak up to the hospital to do a little announcement: they're putting $1.7 million-of the $40 million they ripped out a couple of weeks ago-back in. Yep, they're doing a trip to Bunnings and putting in four more emergency beds, a bit of a renovation, and putting in a hoist and a tub in the maternity suite. A trip to Bunnings does not qualify for returning $40 million of funding ripped out of our hospital. Nor does solving the parking problem. This is a hospital grinding under the lack of car parking-and the solution is a business study that will take just over a year to do! That's right, half a million dollars of hospital  money spent planning a car park-for goodness sake. We could get it wrong; you might make the car park too big! This will probably be a privately run car park in a hospital that deserves it, and yet they're taking a year to think about it and wasting half a million dollars. This is a Labor Party lost in their own incompetence. They're a government that should know better, but, clearly, Redland Hospital and those that use it are the victims of poor policy. Werriwa Electorate: Public Transport Local Government",167
247,Ms STANLEY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Labor is for a fair go in south-western Sydney. As their local member, it's my job to stand up for the residents of the south-west, and I stand in this place to help give them the best possible circumstances to thrive. We in the Labor Party want south-west-Sydneysiders to have the maximum time with their families and minimal time commuting. That's why state and federal Labor will invest in commuter carparking infrastructure at major railway stations in Werriwa. We will invest $18 million in new spaces at Edmondson Park station. We're investing $16 million in new spaces at Leppington station. Just as Labor are invested in minimising commute times for residents of south-west Sydney, so, too, are we committed to improving the home lives of our hard working constituents. I continue to be appalled at the fact that suburbs in my electorate, like Denham Court, a mere 30 kilometres from the Sydney CBD, are yet to have full sewerage link-ups. Denham Court has many businesses, a large childcare facility and a large shopping complex, all operating without connection to suburban sewerage systems. We want the health and well-being of residents, along with waterways such as Cabramatta Creek, to be protected for years to come. This is why Labor will continue to fight to give a fair go to the home and working lives of residents. It is appalling that, as the member for Werriwa in 2018, I have to bring up sewerage that the previous member brought up in 1972. Vocational Education and Training",168
248,Dr GILLESPIE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise to congratulate Kye Beisler from Dungog, who is a retail baking apprentice. He has been chosen to represent Australia in the WorldSkills competition in Kazan, Russia, next year. Apprenticeships and vocational education and training are critical for our economy. We are supporting them. There has been a focus around the nation on getting more people to university, but VET qualifications are just as important to individuals and the economy as are university graduates. In fact, I feel many more young Australians should look at the skills sector rather than going to university because work prospects and income at a young age are actually much better at the moment. That's why we've had so many skilled migrants come to this country-we haven't been growing our own. But we do have lots of incentive programs. We have commencement and completion incentives for the employers. We have created the Skilling Australians Fund. We have recently announced a trial for a regional and rural wage subsidy scheme for 1,630 new apprenticeships around rural and regional Australia for trades that are on the National Skills Needs List. That will allow employers of certificate III and certificate IV apprenticeships to have 75 per cent wage subsidies for the first year, 50 per cent for the second year and, then, 25 per cent. The takehome message is that the coalition government values skills and vocational education and training, and we want to support more apprentices in Australia. WestConnex",168
249,Mr ALBANESE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise once again to expose the pathetic lack of planning and proper community consultation that has plagued the WestConnex project. Due to the underground construction of tunnels that are required to complete the project, large cracks have started appearing in the walls, columns, tiling and doors of residents' homes. WestConnex has been sending their own contractors to assess the damage-a process that has been deemed unfair by residents, and rightly so. There's serious concern that internal contractors and engineers will favour the concerns of WestConnex over the public. New South Wales shadow transport minister Jodi MCKay has requested that an independent property assessment panel be introduced to help alleviate the concerns of residents and supervise the remediation, reparations and independent appeals, if required. This is common sense, and the New South Wales government should come on board this common sense proposal. It follows, of course, the underpayment of people who had their properties compulsorily resumed for the project. It follows, of course, the New South Wales coalition government continuing to refuse to consider filtering the exhaust stacks being built in the inner west for the project, while they say that exhaust stacks will be necessary for any road on the North Shore of Sydney. Berowra Electorate: Mt Wilga Private Rehabilitation Hospital",168
250,Mr LEESER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I was honoured to open the Eileen Perrottet Therapy and Wellness Centre at Mt Wilga Private Rehabilitation Hospital at Hornsby on Wednesday, 7 November. Mt Wilga played an important  role in the founding of the Australian Paralympics movement, driven by Dr John Grant, a member of the hospital's medical advisory committee, remedial gymnast Kevin Betts and the senior physiotherapist Eileen Perrottet. Eileen was passionate about utilising sport as a rehabilitation method for patients recovering from spinal injuries. In 1959, she organised the first paraplegic games in New South Wales, at Mt Wilga. She recruited, trained and fundraised for the talented athletes from the 1959 team for the first Paralympic Games in Rome in 1960. The three New South Wales athletes-Gary Hooper, Daphne Hilton and Ross Sutton-were all former patients of Eileen's, and they won three gold and five silver medals between them. The hospital previously honoured Kevin Betts and John Grant. Now, with the naming of the Eileen Perrottet Therapy and Wellness Centre, another important person is remembered not only in the history of Mt Wilga but in the broader history of the Australian Paralympics movement. The opening coincided with Mt Wilga's 65th anniversary celebrations. I would like to congratulate Mt Wilga's past and present staff, and in particular their outstanding CEO, Lorrie Mohsen, for providing specialist services to our local community and beyond. Mt Wilga provides rehabilitation and therapy services to people in our community as well as the cutting edge, globally relevant work on lymphoedema among other specialised treatment in neurological, orthopaedic, musculoskeletal and cardiac rehabilitation. Congratulations, Mt Wilga! Australian Breastfeeding Association",168
251,Mr DICK,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise to give my support to the Australian Breastfeeding Association. Recently, I met with ABA adviser Kay Whitby, who told me about the support for mothers, babies and families in my electorate of Oxley. ABA provides qualified, volunteer breastfeeding peer support via the Commonwealth-funded National Breastfeeding Helpline and its new LiveChat service and face-to-face counselling by a network of local support groups. ABA provides health professional education and development, and has a well-established Breastfeeding Friendly Workplace Program. ABA also provides specialist breastfeeding support for services for Aboriginals, Torres Strait Islanders and other priority groups. Through the telephone interpreter service, a community mentor program and translated literature, ABA is providing breastfeeding support to women in the Vietnamese and African communities in my electorate. I was delighted to hear that the ABA is starting up a Vietnamese-speaking breastfeeding group in the Inala-Darra area. The science tells us breastfeeding reduces infant mortality and protects children against childhood illnesses. Breastfeeding contributes to better health for mothers. It protects them against breast cancer and depression and is likely to protect against ovarian cancer and diabetes. Breastfeeding contributes substantial savings in health costs by reducing disease burden, and breastfeeding is a smart and cost-effective investment in society because it enhances human capital. But women and babies need support. I call on the government to make sure they continue to support the association in its important work. I would like to acknowledge the Australian Breastfeeding Association, Alison Boughey and breastfeeding counsellor Kay Whitby for all their hard work. Lilly Pilly Mr VAN MANEN (Forde-Government Whip) (16:42): I would like to take this opportunity to highlight the great work of Lilly Pilly, a supervised children's contact centre in my electorate of Forde. Two years ago, Darren Caulfield, together with his mother, Pamela, an experienced community and social worker within the Indigenous migrant and community services sector, founded Lilly Pilly, which aims to provide a private, safe and neutral environment for supervised visits to occur between children and their parents. Darren and Pamela's goal is simple: keep families together. They recognise that contact visits are important not only for the child but for the parents, who are often experiencing difficult times. For a lot of parents just an hour with their children can be the one-on-one time they need to get through. Time with the family is invaluable, and Lilly Pilly is keeping children connected to their parents and extended families regardless of their history. Lilly Pilly facilitates a need for visits after hours and over weekends, and Darren is proud to see the centre fill up every weekend with approximately fifty-fifty mothers and fathers arranging visits to see their children. It's great organisations like supervised children's contact centre, Lilly Pilly, that go above and beyond to reach out and offer support to families experiencing hardship while changing the lives of parents and children in our local community. I applaud Darren and Pamela for their hard work and dedication to bettering the lives of families in my electorate. Mining",169
252,Ms BIRD,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," On Friday, I met with four wonderful young people-Rosie, Claire, Nicholas and Michael-who are members of the Australian Youth Climate Coalition branch at the University of Wollongong. They had come to talk to me about their campaign to stop the Adani coalmine and, more broadly, the call for people to take action on climate change, including this parliament. I appreciated the opportunity to  have a chat to them. I did reflect to them my own scepticism about the future of the Adani coalmine but, most importantly, made it clear that Labor's policy is that there be no federal funding provided to that mine and also that we feel that it needs to meet the environmental requirements that are proposed. I drew their attention to the comments of the Labor spokesperson, Tony Burke, on concerns about the government's decision not to look at the water trigger issues most recently around that project and to his point that the test which determines to whom the water trigger applies is clear, whether it involves a coalmine or other infrastructure. I was pleased to update them not only on that but also, importantly, on the significant announcements made by Bill Shorten and the Labor team last week on renewable energy and how the importance of a good transition is for the future of this nation and for its youth. Rotary Jacaranda Festival 2018",169
253,Mr MORTON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," In Tangney you know when the jacaranda festival is coming because those jacarandas start to bloom. The jacaranda festival in Applecross village attracted record numbers last weekend for this great community event: 160 stalls with amazing food, live performances, Christmas presents for sale and activities for everyone. The best thing is that the Applecross Rotary Jacaranda Festival raises money for great causes like True Blue Dreaming, which supports and strengthens young lives in rural and remote Australian communities, and Australian Rotary Health, one of the largest independent funders of mental health research within Australia. Well done to project director Kenn Williams and his fellow Applecross Rotarians. They were backed by volunteers from the Waylen Bay Sea Scouts, the SES and Rotaract. They transformed Ardross Street into a bustling fair early on Saturday morning and then packed up all the tents, stages, chairs, signs and fencing again late in the afternoon. I was so pleased to recognise the hard work and contribution of our volunteer members of service clubs like Rotary, Lions and many others in my electorate at a recent afternoon tea hosted at my electorate office. Thank you to all members of service clubs within the Tangney electorate for what you do to make our community vibrant, successful and compassionate.",170
254,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS, In accordance with standing order 43 the time for members' statements has concluded. PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS Open Arms - Veterans and Families Counselling,170
255,Mr CHRISTENSEN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I move: That this House: (1) notes that: (a) the Veterans and Veterans Families Counselling Service was renamed as Open Arms: Veterans and Families Counselling Service, by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs on 19 October 2018 to coincide with the Invictus Games; (b) veterans of the Vietnam War were the first to recognise the need for specialist counselling services for Australia's returned service personnel-their lobbying resulted in the establishment of the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service, or VVCS, in 1982; (c) since its establishment, VVCS has assisted thousands of veterans and their families with mental health and relationship issues, as well as building resilience and well-being; and (d) over the years, the focus of this service has expanded to include veterans of all conflicts, their families and other members of the veteran community and the new name recognises this broader focus; and (2) acknowledges the significant legacy of Australia's Vietnam veterans who have ensured that future generations of serving men and women will have access to specialised mental health and well-being support.",170
256,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS, Do you have a seconder?,170
257,Mr Gosling,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,170
258,Mr CHRISTENSEN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"This is the first parliamentary sitting day following the Centenary of Armistice commemoration services and events which have been conducted across the country. I'm sure most, if not all, members and senators in this parliament have been present at events which have brought to front of mind the sacrifices of our serving men and women in many theatres of war. What also must remain fresh in our minds is the need to support our serving and ex-service men and women. They need our support while they serve overseas, when they return home and, often, for many years after their time of active service has passed. It seems surprising now to think that the need for more specialised counselling services was recognised only 36 years ago in 1982. We have such services in place now because of the efforts of Vietnam veterans who lobbied for support, which finally led to the establishment of the Vietnam Veterans' Counselling Service, VVCS. Over time it has evolved to become a service for all veterans and currently-serving personnel and their partners and families. In keeping with the changing nature of that organisation, a name change was needed, and on 19 October my colleague, the  Minister for Veterans' Affairs, announced that the VVCS would change its name to Open Arms - Veterans and Families Counselling to coincide with the Invictus Games. In noting that name change I acknowledge some of the individuals and organisations in my electorate of Dawson who offer support to our veterans in a range and variety of ways. Mackay is home to my good friend and Imperial Victoria Cross recipient, Keith Payne. The bravery of this man in saving the lives of so many of his comrades is well known. While he was commanding troops in Vietnam, his company came under heavy attack. Keith-wounded himself and under heavy fire-organised his troops into a safer position and then spent three hours scouring the area for isolated and wounded soldiers. He found 40 wounded men, bringing some in himself and organising the rescue of others in enemy dominated terrain. Keith is now 85 years old, but he still wants to help others. He has only recently started his own advocacy service, the Keith Payne VC Veterans Benefit Group. I want to say to Keith Payne VC: well done and thank you for your service and your continued service. Another Vietnam veteran who lives in Mackay is George Newton. George knows the struggles of adjusting to civilian life only too well, because he lived it himself. He now spends countless unpaid hours working as an advocate on behalf of other veterans, and he is a force to be reckoned with in that field. I'm sure the Department of Veterans' Affairs knows that! I want to say to George Newton: well done and thank you for your service and your continued service. I have also recently met some members of another support group, the Patriots Australia Military Motorcycle Club. Their Shoalwater Bay branch, which covers a lot of my electorate, travelled to Proserpine to attend the war grave commemoration service for one of our light horsemen, Harry Herth, whose final resting place is at the Proserpine Cemetery. I commend the Patriots for the respect that they showed to a brother in arms from a different theatre of war, and I commend them on the way they support each other through their shared experience, through their love of motorbikes and also through their service for other veterans. Well done and thank you to the Patriots. I note the member for Herbert here, who also covers as a representative, as I do, the garrison city of Townsville. Last month in Townsville-and I'm pretty sure the member for Herbert was there as well-I joined the Minister for Veterans' Affairs at the rededication of Zac's Place. Purchased by Vietnam Veterans Association Queensland Branch, this house provides veterans with emergency accommodation. The centre recently received $14,274 under the Supporting Younger Veterans grants program. Well done and thank you to all of those at Zac's Place. Also in the garrison city is Phillip Thompson OAM, the LNP Candidate for Herbert. He works tirelessly with ex-service organisations, including the Royal Australian Regiment Corporation and the Bravery Trust, as well as government, to promote meaningful engagement and employment for veterans. I recently joined up with Phil and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs at a round table for young veterans, to ensure their voices are heard on the real struggles that follow complex injuries from battlefields such as Afghanistan. To everyone who provides support: thank you for your service.",170
259,Mr GOSLING,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I want to support the motion and commend the member for Dawson for it. I also acknowledge Australia's Victoria Cross winner Keith Payne, his service to our nation and his continuing service helping veterans. We take our hats off to all those Vietnam veterans who really paved the way for VVCS, for the support not only that the Vietnam veterans receive through that service but that their families, importantly, also receive. As the son of a Vietnam veteran, and being a member of the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia NT as a service member-obviously not a Vietnam veteran-I want to acknowledge that organisation. In particular, I acknowledge the current president, Bob Shewring, a Vietnam veteran who, in a first for Australia, removed the word 'Vietnam' from the name of the organisation in order to become more inclusive of younger veterans. They are now Veterans Australia NT, and I commend them for doing that. The change of name from VVCS, as we've always known it, to Open Arms has been met with-dare I say it!open arms. I want to recognise all those that do that important counselling and support work for our serving and former serving people and their families. I want to also quickly acknowledge the younger veterans and the work that they're doing to support their brother and sister comrades. Recently we had the great success of the Invictus Games and I want to acknowledge again the competitors that went from Darwin: Sonya Newman, Tom Foster and Samantha Gould. I also want to acknowledge people like Mark Reidy from The Road Home, in Adelaide, whose Invictus Pathways program-from the time that I spent there looking at the effect that it was having in that community-is a great thing. When it comes to veterans affairs, we like to think-we hope-that there is always bipartisan support for our veterans. I'm proud of some of the initiatives that Labor has already announced. I'm glad that the Military Covenant is receiving bipartisan support but I will say that it's important that there's going to be regular reporting  to parliament on how we're meeting our commitment to veterans through that covenant. The $120 million Veterans' Employment Program that the member for Kingston has announced is really important, as well. Jobs are crucial. It's not just about financial security. It's about structure, it's about community sense of purpose, it's about belonging and it is also about workplaces-companies, not for profits and governments-having awesome employees, which former service members, if I do say so myself, tend to be. In Darwin, the capital of the North, I haven't just been talking. For years now I've been working with my colleagues and I have been consulting with our veterans and their families and with the first responder community. I am very proud that the member for Kingston joined me during this last couple of weeks to announce that federal Labor, in government, will commit $4.9 million to the Scott Palmer Centre, which will provide first responders and former and current serving defence members and their families with the support that they need. If there's one thing that I am keenly aware of, it's the fact that up until now we have not had enough support for our people and some of our people and their family members have been falling through the cracks. I'm really thankful also to the family of Scott Palmer. Scott was a commando with 2nd Commando Regiment and was killed in Afghanistan. His parents, Ray and Pam, continue to this day to put in so much time and effort, and they are literally saving lives. To hear Pam say how proud she was that now-should the Scott Palmer Centre go ahead, and we really hope it does-our young men and women will have the support that they need in Darwin. Mr TED O'BRIEN (Fairfax) (16:57): I'm delighted to rise today in support of the motion from the member for Dawson. I also acknowledge the words of the member for Solomon. It is indeed important to ensure we have bipartisanship on this motion. We owe an enormous debt of gratitude to our Defence Force personnel, both past and present. It's a debt that we can never fully repay, especially to those exposed to the horror of war. But we should try-we should damn well try. In the catalogue of outstanding service provided by Australians to Australia, surely no sacrifice is greater than that of the men and women who commit themselves to the defence of our democracy and its citizens. The personal cost of military service, especially operational service, is incredibly varied and complex. Many injuries are deep-seated, and at first appear quite subtle, often taking years to manifest themselves. Yet these injuries are no less real or cripplingly painful-at times, even fatal-than those caused by a bullet or shrapnel. As the member for Dawson's motion notes, last month the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, following extensive consultation, updated the name of the Veterans and Veterans Families Counselling Service-which itself was renamed in 2007 from the Vietnam Veterans Families Counselling Service-VVCS, to Open Arms - Veterans and Families Counselling. Open Arms is committed to providing the highest-quality specialist counselling and support in the best traditions of the VVCS to current and ex-serving ADF members and their families. This confidential support service is free to anyone who has served even one day in the ADF and to the wider veteran community across Australia. The scope of the services offered by Open Arms has expanded significantly since the establishment of the original VVCS 36 years ago to now include specialist counselling and support for ADF personnel transitioning to civilian life, together with relationship issues and problems of anxiety, depression, anger management, sleep disorders, alcohol and substance abuse and, of course, post-traumatic stress disorder. Despite its wider focus, Open Arms will always remain a service founded by Vietnam veterans when, in 1982, the Australian government established the VVCS after 10 years of hard lobbying by veterans following Australia's withdrawal from Vietnam. The new Open Arms branding honours that legacy with the acknowledgement that Open Arms is a service founded by Vietnam veterans for all veterans. The name Open Arms itself holds great meaning for our Vietnam veterans as a symbol of support, safety and security. Reminiscent of that conflict, the name evokes the image of a soldier standing in a clearing with open arms to signal the helicopter pilots, who provided a lifeline to ground troops, and show them where to land to bring supplies and evacuate the wounded. The Vietnam War was Australia's second-longest conflict, exceeded only by the current war in Afghanistan. The tragedy of Vietnam tore at Australia's social fabric, perhaps more than any conflict since the First World War, and damaged an entire generation of young Australians. The true nature and extent of that damage was not widely understood or acknowledged at the time and so it took more than a decade for the pain and stress associated with that combat experience to be meaningfully addressed by the establishment of VVCS. The Open Arms of today and the VVCS that preceded it is the enduring legacy of those veterans and is their gift to future generations of men and women who serve in the defence of our nation Ms O'TOOLE (Herbert) (17:02): I rise in this place today to stand up for the veterans, ex-serving personnel and their families not only in my electorate of Herbert but for all those who have served our nation. These are the very men and women who selflessly put their lives on the line so that we can live in the freedoms and democracy that this great nation offers our citizens. These brave men and women fought for our freedom and, as elected representatives, we have a responsibility to fight to ensure that they receive the services that they deserve and need.  I come from Townsville in North Queensland, the home of the largest garrison city in the nation and home to a very large veteran and ex-serving community. Our current and ex-serving members, veterans and their families contribute enormously to the Townsville community both socially and economically. Our community recognises and values their ongoing contributions and service to Townsville, and we are very proud to be a garrison city. We can never fully repay our veterans, ex-serving personnel and their families, but what we can do is ensure that they have access to effective counselling services. If changing the name of the counselling service to Open Arms means that more veterans and ex-serving personnel get access to much-needed counselling then that can only be a very good outcome for these men and women. Labor is committed to ensuring that veterans and ex-serving personnel and their families are supported. Labor has listened to our current and ex-ADF community, and we have acted. A Shorten government will establish Australia's first military covenant, a formal agreement that will ensure that the nation's Defence Forces are fully supported during and after their service. We will legislate for accountability via regular reporting to the parliament. Labor will deliver a $121 million comprehensive veterans employment strategy to provide greater support to our defence personnel as they transition to civilian life. Labor's policy will have four main platforms that are designed to assist veterans into meaningful employment post their ADF time. Labor will deliver a family engagement and support strategy for defence personnel and veterans. Labor took note of the recommendations in the National Mental Health Commission's 2017 review to ensure that support for families at known stress points occurs. Labor also pushed to establish the Senate inquiry into antimalarial drugs to ensure people's voices were heard and recognised. Labor have supported the calls to include the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation in the banking royal commission, because we understand that our veterans and their families deserve the right to have their super fund under the same scrutiny as every other Australian. When I was first elected into my role as the member for Herbert, one of my primary priorities was to establish a mechanism that would enable me to engage meaningfully with the defence community in Townsville. Hence, I established the Townsville Defence Community Reference Group, which has successfully supported and informed the veteran suicide prevention trial being conducted by the Northern Queensland Primary Health Network, which I note is one of the most successful suicide prevention trials in the country. The group has also been instrumental in the formation of the leading veterans and ex-service personnel defence hub, known as the Oasis. I want to thank everyone in the Townsville Defence Community Reference Group for their dedication and commitment to improving the lives of our current ex-serving men and women, veterans and their families. I'm proud to stand in this place as a representative of the largest garrison city, and I will continue to stand up and fight for defence communities. We can never fully repay our debt to veterans, but we can give them long-term gratitude, respect and support. For many veterans, the freedoms that we currently experience were important enough for them to endure long separations from their families, miss the births of their children, freeze in subzero temperatures, bake in deserts, lose limbs and, all too often, lose their lives. Military spouses have had to endure career interruptions, frequent changes of address and a disproportionate share of parental responsibilities. Children have often had to deal with changes in schools, separation from friends and, hardest of all, the uncertainty from not knowing whether mum or dad would return from their next tour. Whether their service was in Afghanistan or Vietnam, we need to make sure that our veterans and ex-serving personnel are served well. Veterans don't ask for much and the very least we can do is provide them with a counselling service that meets their needs in a timely manner.",171
260,Ms CLAYDON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," It's with pleasure that I rise to join with my colleagues in support of the motion before the House today, moved by the member for Dawson. The motion acknowledges the extraordinary work of veterans counselling services and celebrates the recent transition from what was known as the Veterans and Veterans Families Counselling Service to what is now referred to as the Open Arms-Veterans and Families Counselling Service. As many of my colleagues have said, it is a terrific move. When I think of all the veterans I have known throughout my life, I can't imagine any one of them not supporting the opening up of the fantastic counselling services to a broader range of serving and ex-serving personnel from any theatre of war-so, regardless of the particular conflict-and whether or not their trauma is a result of conflict or service. Many of my colleagues before me have spoken of the history of the setting-up of the counselling service and the instrumental role that the Vietnam veterans played in those early, formative years of its establishment. I'm the daughter of a Vietnam veteran and remember very well my father going to Vietnam and returning. Many, many years passed before my father and, indeed, our family needed to access those counselling services. I am one of 27,000 people who participated in the Vietnam Veterans Family Study that tried to shed some light on what the intergenerational impacts of deployment and war are not just on the serving veterans but, indeed, on family units as a whole.  The proposal that these counselling services should be opened up to accommodate the many people impacted by deployment life is something that we on both sides of the House all support. Indeed, we have horrifying statistics around suicide for ex-service personnel. We also have some particularly disturbing evidence around the ongoing impacts of post-traumatic stress disorder. The legacy left by the Veterans and Veterans Families Counselling Service, in the two areas of suicide prevention and the treatment of PTSD in particular, is something that the Open Arms organisation will, hopefully, be able to expand on, and it will, indeed, deliver even better, more improved services to more people. There has always been greater demand than there have been services and resources. We know that, and anything we can do to address that is absolutely worth supporting, in my view. Open Arms, as I said, will be a lasting legacy of the Vietnam veterans who identified from day one the psychological impacts of war and also of military service itself. These impacts often last decades, well after the physical wounds have healed. I would like to take this opportunity to really give thanks and praise where it's very much due: to the many people in my community who give so much of themselves in ways to support both serving and ex-serving personnel in the Newcastle region. I think first and foremost of Mr Stephen Finney and Ken Fayle, who were both involved in various ex-service organisations, including the Newcastle RSL sub-branch and the TPI Association, which is now based out at Wallsend. I have RSL sub-branches not just in Newcastle; there is Waratah-Mayfield, Merewether-Hamilton-Adamstown, Stockton and Wallsend and District sub-branches, to name just a few. I also pay tribute to Gerry Bailey, who is one of a very active men's health peer group that look after each other. I also want to acknowledge the partners of veterans and, indeed, the long standing effort of Mrs Pat Cleggett, the former national secretary from Newcastle. Debate adjourned. Automotive Industry",173
261,Mr DICK,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I move: That this House: (1) notes that: (a) there are approximately 1,500 new car dealers in Australia that operate 3,500 new vehicle outlets; (b) 85 per cent of new car dealers are private or family owned businesses; and (c) the Australian Automotive Dealer Association is the peak industry body exclusively representing franchised new car dealers in Australia; (2) recognises that: (a) the economic impact of the new vehicle retailing sector to Australia is significant, contributing $14.91 billion dollars to the national economy and employing almost 70,000 Australians; (b) vehicle manufacturers in Australia are increasingly behaving in a way that makes it very challenging for new car dealers to run a viable business; (c) relations between manufacturers and dealers is currently governed by the Franchising Code of Conduct; and (d) this code has failed to protect dealers as it does not account for the highly technical nature of the automotive industry and the scale of both dealers and manufacturers relative to regular franchisees and franchisors; and (3) calls on the Government to support Labor's plan to implement an industry-specific auto dealership code that will deliver clear ground rules for manufacturers and dealerships, including obligations under the Australian Consumer Law and consumer complaints, warranty and repair processes, dealership agreements and the ability to make variations to them, and termination notices. The Australian car industry has seen a shift and change faster than perhaps any other industry in Australia. It wasn't long ago that you could bet your bottom dollar that Holden and Ford would be battling it out at the top of the sales chart. It was one of Australia's longest rivalries and it was between two of the greatest cars our country has ever produced. But, as we know, sadly, those days are long gone. An influx of imported models and the need to adapt to constant change has meant that the pressure placed on dealerships continues to grow. This is not helped by the uneven playing field, which is tipped heavily in favour of the multinational manufacturers whilst local family-owned dealerships do it tough. Earlier this year I sat down with the CEO of the Australian Automotive Dealer Association, David Blackhall, and communications and policy director James Voortman here in Parliament House. They told me about the struggles that dealers across the country are facing. We spoke about the association's submission to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services' inquiry into the operation and effectiveness of the Franchising Code of Conduct and the huge impact that this has on dealers. This inquiry is currently in its final stages, with a report due in about 10 days time, on 6 December. I, like many of my Labor colleagues, will be keeping a close eye on the government report and response.  We also spoke about the power imbalance in the automotive industry between car manufacturers and franchised new-car dealers and how this disadvantages both dealership businesses and consumers who purchase new vehicles from dealers, and we spoke about how the Franchising Code of Conduct offers very limited protection for dealers. I'm delighted to say that a future Shorten Labor government, if privileged to be elected, will implement an industry-specific, auto dealership code to better support new car dealers. I'm really proud to have worked closely with members of the opposition including the member for Fenner on this important issue, and I thank him, particularly for his leadership and determination to see a better deal for franchise car dealers through an industry code, a code that will deliver clear ground rules for manufacturers and dealerships including obligations under the Australian Consumer Law and consumer complaints, warranty and repair processes; and dealership agreements, the ability to make variations to them and termination notices. The huge contribution that new car dealers make simply cannot be underestimated. I want to bring the attention of the House what this means. In my electorate, this means over $400 million worth of sales, 420 direct employees and a further $100 million contribution to the local economy alone. Nationwide, this means $65 billion in sales, 70,000 direct employees, and a contribution to the economy of more than half a billion dollars. This is a serious industry. I'm delighted that my colleagues will be speaking on this issue today, and I am shocked that members of the government could not even be bothered to speak about this. To the members in the chamber today, I say to you: these are mum-and-dad dealers in your electorates. This is small-business heartland that the Liberal Party should be taking an interest in. I know people have been lobbying ministers and members of the government, only to be dismissed-to be told to go away. When I addressed the national conference on the Gold Coast, you could hear the frustration in dealers. These aren't big businesses. These are mum-and-dad operators, employing mechanics, employing after-sales services, and employing admin staff-and yet not one member of the Morrison government will give their voice to those businesses in Australia. They couldn't be bothered to rise and use their voice in this debate today. I'm the son of a small-business owner, and I've seen first hand the impact of what the big players mean, when come in and change the landscape and disrupt. And, as we see is the case now, the little guy is left to fend for themselves while the big players muscle in. The local dealer is known to the community; that's who people rely on to provide them with fair value and a safe car of choice. These are the businesses that support the football clubs, the netball organisations and the community outreach, and provide the vehicles to Meals on Wheels. Even considering all of this overwhelming data, we know that the dealers need more support to fix the power imbalance. I'm really pleased that, if privileged to be elected, a future Shorten Labor government will give them certainty. I'm proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with dealers, and will continue to work towards fixing this so that more dealers are given the protections that they need and the support they need.",174
262,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS, Is the motion seconded?,175
263,Dr LEIGH,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I second the motion. It is one of those things in sport: you at least expect the other side to take the playing field. But today we are seeing the coalition abandon the playing field. If you look at the speaking lists for the main chamber and for the Federation Chamber, it's like they've just given up and gone home, putting their tail between their legs. In the Federation Chamber today we're looking at a list with something in the order of 20 Labor or independent speakers and just a handful of coalition speakers.",175
264,Mr Dick,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,And they've given up governing.,175
265,Dr LEIGH,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"And they have given up governing, as the member of Oxley so aptly puts it. It is particularly striking that the coalition has given up governing on an issue such as protecting auto dealers, because the coalition so often like to say they are the party of small business. The fact is that Labor has the stronger claim to that. At the next election, both parties will go into the election offering the same headline rate of company tax, but, on top, Labor will offer the Australian Investment Guarantee, allowing more-rapid depreciation of investments in excess of $20,000. At the next election, the coalition will go to the Australian people without an energy policy, meaning that small businesses are going to face massive uncertainty on the prices of one of their key inputs. Labor will go into the next election with a carefully constructed energy policy which has been commended by the sector. And Labor will go to the next election with a plan to boost wages. We know that retail spending is in the doldrums. One of the reasons for that is that workers haven't had a real pay rise since 2012. Don't just take my word for this. This was Philip Lowe, Reserve Bank Governor, speaking last week about the fact that wages are barely advancing ahead of inflation. So, at the next election it will be Labor that has the more powerful offering for small business. This brings me to the matter of this important private member's motion. It is the hard work of the member for Oxley that brings us here today, because it is his strong advocacy which has led Labor to make the significant step of saying that under a Shorten Labor government auto dealers will get a better deal. There will be an industryspecific code governing the relationship between auto dealers and manufacturers. We don't take this step lightly.  Industry-specific codes are rare. We have them in areas with major market power imbalances, such as the horticulture industry and the fuel-retailing industry. Through our shadow agriculture spokesman, Joel Fitzgibbon, Labor has called for such a code to be implemented in the dairy industry. We've got 6,000 dairy farmers selling to a handful of milk processors and retailers. We're calling for it in the area of auto dealers because of a report from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, which had examples such as the multinational car manufacturer who told 25 car dealers that their franchise agreements wouldn't be renewed, despite the fact that they hadn't broken their agreements and in many cases had been profitable. There are about 3,500 new vehicle outlets, mostly owned by individual operators or family groups. Indeed, car selling is one of the few industries in our economy where the top four firms account for less than one-fifth of the market. But the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has acknowledged, as they put it: Commercial arrangements between manufacturers and dealers can constrain and adversely influence the behaviour of dealers in responding to complaints. So, a Shorten Labor government will implement that industry-specific auto dealership code-an announcement which has already been welcomed. I draw the attention of the chamber to the comments by the CEO of the Australian Automotive Dealer Association, David Blackall: We believe an industry specific code regulating behaviour between new car Dealers and offshore vehicle manufacturers is necessary to protect consumers, dealerships and their employees. Currently new car Dealers are locked into one-sided agreements with vehicle manufacturers which restrict our ability to run a profitable business and protect our consumers. It's backed by the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman, Kate Carnell, who said: The power imbalance between vehicle manufacturers and car dealerships is a major issue that is consistently raised with us, in both our dispute support area and our policy work. Manufacturers continue to use their market power to constrain car retailers, which in turn disadvantages customers. The CEO of the Franchise Council of Australia, Mary Aldred, has said: The Franchise Council of Australia has welcomed the announcement by the Federal Opposition that if elected it would introduce a separate automotive industry code of conduct. Putting fairness back into the system lies at the heart of the Labor mission. Australia has too many monopolists and too few start-ups, and that's why Labor is committed to this industry-specific code.",175
266,Ms VAMVAKINOU,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise today to speak on this very important private member's motion that's been raised by the member for Oxley. I want to congratulate him for doing this, and I want to add my support to Labor's plan to implement an industry-specific auto dealership code that will finally deliver clear ground rules for manufacturers and dealerships. It aims to make the industry fairer and to be of benefit to local businesses and consumers in general. In 2017, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission handed down a report on the new car retail industry which estimated that there were 1,500 new car dealers, 3,500 new car retail outlets and around 1.1 million cars sold in the year 2016-17 alone. One of the biggest purchases for families will be a new car. As the ACCC estimated, buying a car and its ongoing maintenance accounts for around five per cent of average annual household expenditure. The car retailing industry reportedly earned an estimated $64 billion in revenue during the same financial year of 2016-17. In Calwell alone, the electorate I represent, we had a turnover of nearly $558 million. However, the report also highlighted some serious issues regarding the imbalance of power in favour of the big manufacturers, which leaves the dealers and repairs powerless in assisting the consumers in the way that they would want to. This is a situation that also imperils the viability and the future of local car repairers and car dealers. This year, I did get the opportunity to meet with many of the local dealers and car repairers in my electorate. In particular, I want to talk about Damien and Debbie Theuma of Active Motor Repairs in Craigieburn. They and other local business owners detailed to me the difficulties they were facing with the advent of car dealerships monopolising the repair and warranty market. The lack of data sharing, in particular, has affected their businesses and highlighted the importance of legislating a mandatory code for data sharing. Business owners like Damien and Debbie feel that the ACCC's report should be adopted in its entirety. This report concluded that vehicle manufacturers that sell into the Australian market limit access to service and repair information for independent repairers. The report also found that the 'predatory behaviour'-that is how Debbie described it-of the manufacturers created an artificial monopoly and allowed manufacturers to inflate the mark-ups on servicing and repairs. This was creating a problem for their business locally. The ACCC's report also further concluded that independent repairers were experiencing issues in gaining access to the technical information needed to repair and service new cars. Access to technical information held by  car manufacturers was becoming increasingly important as repairing and servicing new cars relies on access to electronic information and data produced by car manufacturers. If those local businesses don't have access to that information, they can't then do the business that they are set up for. That creates a whole series of other issues for them. Car manufacturers had previously committed to providing independent repairers with the same access to technical information as the manufacturers' authorised dealers on commercially fair and reasonable terms. However, the ACCC discovered problems with the level of detail that was being provided and timeliness of the technical information given, which further disadvantaged the smaller car repairers and dealers locally. The ACCC considered that independent repairers having access to this technical information was importantand my local constituents have emphasised that-to ensure competition and, ultimately, to benefit consumers. The ACCC proposed a mandatory scheme for car manufacturers to share technical information. It is this mandatory code recommendation that is supported by Labor and all of the independent repairer associations; the consumer bodies; the auto associations, such as the NRMA and the RACQ; the insurance industry; the Australian Automotive Dealer Association; and all of the major auto repair chains, including Kmart Tyre and Auto Service, Repco Authorised Service and Bridgestone. There is a large network of dealers and repairers who are crying out for this code. I'm very pleased to be supporting the member for Oxley today in this private member's motion and in highlighting the need for the government to move on this issue. I have written to the Treasurer, and I still await a commitment.",176
267,Ms TEMPLEMAN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," When you walk into a car dealership in Hawkesbury or the Blue Mountains, you are generally walking into a small business that has been in the area for quite a long time. Someone's parents might have bought their car from it; their son or daughter might be buying their car from it. Everyone who works there is part of the community that they live in, because these are small businesses who are employing locals. Aside from a house and any building related purchases, this car that you bought is probably the single biggest purchase that you will make in your local community. As I rise to support the motion of the member for Oxley, I am struck by the challenges that these small businesses face. As the Australian Automotive Dealer Association, which represents these businesses, says: There is a Power Imbalance in the Automotive Industry. [There is a] structural power imbalance between car Manufacturers (franchisors) and franchised new car Dealers (franchisees) [that] disadvantages both dealership businesses and consumers who purchase new vehicles from Dealers. Many Dealers enjoy good relations with their respective Manufacturers and work in a mutually beneficial partnership, but there remain many instances where Dealers are subjected to treatment resembling a master/servant relationship. Any small business knows that it's not healthy to have a dynamic like that for their business. It doesn't just impact on you and your business. As a small business owner for 25 years, I absolutely understand the power imbalances that small businesses face in all sorts of ways. This one is peculiar to the major car manufacturers. At the core of the issue is the terms of dealer agreements: the basic contract between the manufacturer and the authorised dealer that establishes the obligation for each side of the transaction in relation to sales, parts or service facilities. Every one of those things is set by the manufacturer. They are the big guy in this relationship. It means that dealers can face pressure about the terms of the dealer agreement. The dealer risks huge costs if the manufacturer decides not to renew the agreement. This is a business with a high cost of entry. It is not something you just suddenly decide overnight to do. They have huge investment in their sites. The manufacturers set the rules of engagement and exert a high degree of control over how dealers resolve consumer complaints. It can often be the case that the manufacturer's policies don't include claim handling processes that specifically address or even comply with responsibilities under Australian consumer law. This is something that impacts not just the business but also their customers. The manufacturers can impose complex and onerous warranty claim processes. Prior approval from the manufacturers may be required before repairs can be undertaken, which leads to delays for consumers. Those are issues we could actually help deal with so that these businesses have an easier way of doing business. I notice that those opposite or all for getting rid of red tape and regulation. Here is a place where we can actually help make a difference. What is our proposal? A Shorten Labor government would implement an industry-specific auto dealership code. This goes to the issue of the Franchising Code of Conduct, which works in this area. We have the view that this has been absolutely unsuccessful in protecting franchised new car dealers or dealing with the industry-specific issues that this sector faces. An auto dealership code will deliver clear ground rules for manufacturers and dealerships, including obligations under the Australian Consumer Law on consumer complaints; warranty and repair processes; dealership agreements, including the ability to make variations to them; and termination notices. An independent code will create a set of rules that both the manufacturers and the dealers must be mindful of when establishing expectations around dealer conduct. Ultimately the consumer will benefit once dealerships are  able to conduct negotiations with manufacturers in the context of a clear set of overarching rules. That's really all small business ever asks for: clear rules and some sort of level playing field, an even playing field, even with the big guys. When we are talking about cars, this code really will be drafted parallel to Labor's your car, your choice policy, which is all about allowing independent car mechanics access to the technical data they need to deliver the best service to their consumers. All in all we are very focused on allowing small businesses to get on with what they do best, and that is running a business with as few constraints as possible.",177
268,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," There being no further speakers, the debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS Volunteering Consideration resumed of the motion: That this House: (1) recognises the fantastic contribution that volunteers make to the community of Bonner, and to Australia in general; (2) notes there are 8.7 million volunteers around Australia in organisations like sports clubs, charities and schools; (3) congratulates the Government for allocating $20 million in funding to support volunteering; and (4) notes that volunteering efforts make an estimated annual economic and social contribution of $290 billion. Mr VAN MANEN (Forde-Government Whip) (17:34): I would like to take this opportunity to speak on the very important topic of volunteering and the terrific and wonderful role that volunteers play in bringing the Australian community together. I would like to pay tribute to the many groups of volunteers in my electorate of Forde, such Nightlight, Twin Rivers Community Care, Brigalow Country Community Club, and our men's sheds at Pimpama and Beenleigh. In addition to these and many other great community organisations, our sporting clubs are run very successfully thanks to the tireless efforts of our volunteers. Nightlight provides help, care and support to the homeless and people in crisis. Nightlight goes the extra mile, providing anything from a coffee to transportation to and from detox and rehab centres. Nothing is too big or small for the team at Nightlight. It was a great privilege to attend their thanksgiving dinner over the weekend, which acknowledged the great work of all the volunteers who make Nightlight such a success. I know, from speaking with John and Michaela during the week, the number of calls they've had in the past week from those in crisis, looking for accommodation. Last week, I also met with Twin Rivers Community Care, where the Minister for Families and Social Services, Minister Fletcher, and I announced that they would receive $220,000 in funding over the next 4½ years to provide emergency relief to residents in the Logan-Beaudesert area. Twin Rivers is a food co-op in my electorate, providing affordable food and household products for those in need. In addition, they also provide traineeships, hospitality courses and employment opportunities to disadvantaged youth. I thank the many volunteers who contribute their time at Twin Rivers Community Care, and in particular Noel and Gayle Roberts for the terrific work they've done over many, many years now, in building the food co-op. I also thank Reuben and Michelle Roos, who are the senior pastors at Twin Rivers Church. Brigalow Country Community Club hosts two Saturday social events every month for those with disabilities. Not only does it provide a place for the community to get together, but Max Noble, the club president, helps those in our community who have fallen on hard times however he can. Whether it's providing an electric wheelchair, a scooter, products to assist the disabled or furniture, Max and his team at Brigalow Country Community Club will always look to find a solution to a problem. Our men's sheds in Beenleigh and Pimpama and also the Make and Do Association at Loganholme are other incredible organisations in my electorate. I recently had the privilege of awarding the Pimpama Men's Shed with $3,750 as part of the government's successful Stronger Communities grant program. The contributions of the men's sheds often go unnoticed-restoring furniture, building a cubby house or stools for local schools, while providing a space for retirees to stay connected. We discussed at Pimpama Men's Shed the importance of mental health for many of these gentlemen who have left the workforce, sometimes involuntarily, and have not had the opportunity to recommence meaningful work. The men's shed gives them an opportunity to talk to fellow men and share their concerns and worries and allows them to deal with the issues that they're facing. With over 8.7 million volunteers across Australia in organisations such as sports clubs, charities and schools, we, as a country, should be very proud of those organisations, because they do so much to make our local communities what they are today.  I've mentioned a couple of my local organisations, but I'd also like to pay special thanks to a number of other groups in my electorate, including Quota International, the Rotary Club, the Queensland Country Women's Association, our local Lions clubs and-as I noted in my earlier comments-our many and varied sporting clubs for the terrific work they do each and every weekend and through the week in the sporting fields around my electorate to ensure that the kids in my electorate have the opportunity to play sports and be part of our community. I'd like to thank our volunteers. Thank you.",178
269,Ms MCBRIDE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," The theme of International Volunteer Day, on 5 December, is 'volunteers build resilient communities'. The more than 8.7 million volunteers across Australia make an enormous contribution nationally and in my community on the Central Coast of New South Wales, from fighting fires and clearing storm damage, to helping vulnerable people in crisis, to running sports clubs and keeping people safe on our beaches, and along the way helping to build resilient communities. The recipients of this year's New South Wales Volunteer of the Year Awards for the Central Coast give some idea of the breadth of volunteer work and the value of their contribution in our community. The Young Volunteer of the Year, Madeleine Clark, volunteers at the Cerebral Palsy Alliance's Tuggerah therapy centre. Madeleine, who is studying speech pathology, uses her skills to assist young children in bonding with their parents and in developing social and cognitive skills, via the Mini Musician Group and School Readiness Program. The Adult Volunteer of the Year for the Central Coast, Christine Lavers, has spent 25 years helping to keep the Umina Surf Life Saving Club afloat, working at carnivals, registration, officiating at events, and promoting beach safety. The Senior Volunteer of the Year, and overall volunteer of the year for the Central Coast, is Barbara Galvin, who founded, and volunteers with, Shirley Shuttle Cancer Outpatient Transport Service. Over the past decade, Barbara has personally contributed and raised funds to buy four vehicles to transport cancer patients to their treatment, and home, all around the Central Coast. Finally, the team of 20 volunteers at We Care Uniting was recognised as the Volunteer Team of the Year for the Central Coast. We Care Uniting collects and distributes essential care and safety items to vulnerable children across our region. I'm pleased that my electorate office is one of the several collection points for donations for this valuable service. As many volunteers will tell you, volunteers can benefit just as much from volunteering as those that they help. It is increasingly recognised that a sense of belonging improves well-being. Volunteering can be that connection between you and the community. Jo from We Care Uniting told me that she feels like she is making a difference through volunteering. She said, 'I feel like I'm making a change to someone's life and I think I'm making a difference to people around me.' This feeling is shared by Karen Hickmott, who coordinates the Stingray Nippers Inclusion Program run by Toowoon Bay Surf Life Saving Club, which provides one-on-one support to children with disabilities for joining Nippers on the Coast. Karen told me, 'It means the world to me to be able to pull together a team of volunteers that enables children with additional needs to participate in an iconic community activity.' And volunteers like Bob Ihlein from The Entrance Men's Shed, who took up volunteering when he retired, joining the shed movement, which works shoulder to shoulder to support their members and the wider community. Bob told me that being retired and with plenty of time on his hands he decided to join the local men's shed. As a member of the shed movement, he said, 'I volunteer my time to help other shed members, and we, as a shed, all volunteer our time and expertise to help our community, which is very gratifying.' And Chris Miles, secretary of the Wyong District Netball Association, who started volunteering with the Kanwal Netball Club in 1978 and has been on the executive of the Wyong District Netball Association since 1983. Chris has been recognised with both the Wyong Shire's award and New South Wales Premier's award for volunteering, but she tells me that it is the friendships she has made that mean the most to her. Today, Chris said to me: 'It is the friendships you make and the sense of achievement. If people don't volunteer, then that school or sports club wouldn't make the same achievements without us. When I started volunteering, everybody volunteered. Our parents volunteered-it keeps you young.' While volunteers often look like superheroes, the truth is that they do need support. The truth is that we need to do more to help those who are helping others. Many volunteer organisations rely on governments to help provide their services and it can be extremely disheartening for volunteers working with a program that is successful, supporting vulnerable people and supporting our community, only to find that their funding has been cut or won't be continued. Funding of community services in our community should be sustainable, should be focused on collaboration rather than competition, should support local and diverse service provision and should recognise that not-for-profit organisations are often better placed than for-profit corporations to provide these crucial frontline services.  Finally I would like to give a shout-out to the SES, who helped my sister when she was 39 weeks pregnant and a flash flood left her stranded at home. I'm pleased to let the SES know that my sister and her new baby are now doing well. Thank you.",179
270,Mr GEE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Volunteers are the lifeblood of our communities and in particular our country communities. They make vital contributions to our success as a nation. I would like to pay tribute to a number of volunteer organisations in the Calare electorate who contribute so much to our Central West communities. The St John Ambulance Molong Cadet Division has been operating since 1995. They are one of two cadet divisions this side of the Blue Mountains, the other one being at Broken Hill. The Molong Cadet Division consists of about 45 members, with a recent boost in the number of young people getting involved. The youngest member is just eight years old. Members hail from Molong and surrounding towns and villages such as Manildra and Euchareena. They hold weekly meetings every Thursday at the Molong Central School hall. During their meetings, badge work and first aid training is undertaken. The Molong cadets can be seen at almost every local event, including local shows at Cumnock, Manildra, Cudal, Molong and Canowindra-I've seen them in action helping the injured at country shows; their work is outstanding-sporting events such as martial arts in Dubbo and Orange and rugby in Walla; and communities events such as the Canowindra International Balloon Challenge, the Molong Advancement Group markets, the SMARTS Festival at Molong Central School. Australia Day, ANZAC Day, Christmas carols-you name it; the cadets from Molong are there. Ten members also recently travelled to Dubbo for the royal visit, where they provided assistance to royal watchers from right around Australia. I would like to mention the St John Ambulance Molong Cadet Division members tonight, including divisional superintendent, Julie Dean; grade 5 officers, Kerry Burchett and Elizabeth Newstead, who is 80 years old and has been a member for more than 30 years; cadet leaders, Jade Kirk and Annalise Livermore; senior cadets, who assist with the training of junior cadets, Rebecca Geddes, Christalin Drady, Rebekah Livermore and Thomas Livermore, who will be travelling to England in 2019 for a gap year and will work with local St John Ambulance groups during his stay; John Burchett, who is the treasurer; Les Dean, Charlotte Cassell and Deb Lytton; and Jake Clarke, who assisted with an emergency at the Orange Centrelink office earlier this year. A number of cadets received awards at the St John Ambulance annual awards ceremony held at Sydney University's Great Hall recently. Awards were presented to Molong cadet members in a number of different categories, including: bronze commendations to Betty Newstead and Kerry Burchett, for outstanding service to the Molong Cadet Division; the Save a Life Award to Jake Clarke, who, as I've mentioned, helped resuscitate a lady at Centrelink in Orange recently; the 2nd bar to the Service Medal, for 22 years of service, went to Julie Dean; and the Western Region Cadet of the Year went to Rebekah Livermore. At the Cabonne Daroo Business Awards recently, the division was highly commended in the Community Organisation category, out of 23 nominations. At the recent Molong Rotary Club meeting, the Youth of the Year Award went to Annalise Livermore, and its Community Group of the Year also went to the Molong Cadet Division. Congratulations to everyone at the Molong Cadet Division. We certainly value your work. The Cudal Red Cross has been working hard for our local area for many years. It has 11 wonderful members. They are working on a number of projects. I would like to mention those members here tonight: the president, LeeAnn Hazelton; the secretary, Melissa Aylward; the treasurer, Marion Gosper, who was recently presented with a 40-years-of-service bar; Marianne Mac Smith, who was presented with a gilt rosette to mark 60 years of service, having joined the Red Cross when she lived in Hastings, New Zealand, as a child, and, when she married Lance Mac Smith and moved to Cudal, joined the Australian Red Cross in 1958-her mother and grandmother were both committed to charity work, and she has followed in their footsteps; during her time with the Cudal branch she has been president, secretary and treasurer, and is currently patron of the branch-Janet Norton, Fiona Hall and Donald MACFarlane, who was recently presented with a 40-years–of-service bar; and Belinda Hough, Dorothy Balcomb, Kim Pattinson and Laurel Hazelton. The current project which the Cudal branch of the Red Cross is involved in includes a collection of old chairs which will be painted by renowned artists and local school students and will be auctioned, raising money to support the work of the Red Cross. I thank all of our volunteers in the Central West and right around Australia for their wonderful contribution. I think in this House tonight we would like them to know that we as local members value their contribution, appreciate them and love working with them.",180
271,Dr FREELANDER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise today to speak in favour of the motion put forward by the member for Bonner. I take great pleasure in following my good friend the member for Dobell and, indeed, all my colleagues who have already spoken and those who are yet to speak on this motion in the future, as it is something where there is bipartisanship. It really is something which we all agree on.  The first point of this motion recognises the fantastic contribution that volunteers make to the community of Bonner. On indulgence, I would like to inform the House of some of the fantastic work being done by volunteers in my electorate of Macarthur and in electorates all around Australia. Volunteers are the backbone of the Macarthur electorate. Across Australia, many millions of Australians volunteer every year, and I'm proud to say that many of these wonderful people come from the Macarthur electorate. Everywhere you go across Macarthur, you see wonderful local residents volunteering their time, their hard work and their expertise for the betterment of our community. People volunteer across Macarthur to help out their neighbours, to lend a helping hand to those in need and to contribute to our local schools, sporting organisations, charities and not-for-profits. In light of International Volunteer Day, which will take place next Wednesday, 5 December, I had the privilege of holding a volunteer award ceremony and afternoon tea in my electorate office last week. Over the last couple of months, I had been accepting nominations for worthy Macarthur residents to receive my volunteer award, and I was pleased that so many wonderful local residents were nominated by their respective organisations. Many of these people I knew first hand had worked in developmental support organisations, in places like Lifeline, in organisations feeding the homeless and in a whole range of other different organisations which I've been involved with. I wish to take this opportunity to mention the many wonderful people who became recipients of my award and who contribute so much to the Macarthur community. They include Julie Murphy, Shila Thomas, Janet Shiels, Eric Third, Valerie Avery, Mia Asuit, Jan Domanski, John Bates, Larry Fuller, Charmaine Fowler, Sally Anne Hurley, Jonas Pereira, Michael Atkinson, Jayden Wilkie, Anna Sabalj, Lee Turner, Skye Betts, Kevin Wilkie, Chantelle Wilkie, Annette Johnson, Jan Drenth, Amanda Axisa, Brian Meleng, Ruth Brown, Christine Padilla, Michelle Morn, Elise Marcus and Kate Banister. We owe a debt of gratitude to these people, along with many, many others, who selflessly give their time, their energy, their resources and their expertise to improve our community of Macarthur. I'm immensely proud of the volunteer effort in Macarthur. There are many organisations which are vital to our community, which are run off the backs of our generous volunteers. I see first hand how hard they work and also the fruits of their labour. There are countless other individuals who contribute so much as volunteers, who weren't named and who haven't been nominated but probably should be. If I were to name them all in my community, I would be here all day. In my career as a paediatrician, I've had the distinct privilege of working alongside many volunteers in our community, in our hospitals and in our health services. It is my distinct pleasure to be able to continue to do so now as their federal member of parliament. The services these people provide for our community are invaluable and deserve to be recognised. From the lovely women whom I see volunteering at Campbelltown Hospital and whom I've gotten close to over the many years of working there, to the parents who volunteer in our local special schools, to the people who volunteer for their local footy club at the weekend-these volunteers enrich the lives of each and every one of us and add so much to our community. There are too many volunteers to name them all; however, it would be remiss of me to forget to mention one of our local Tax Help volunteers, Joseph Mascarenhas. My office as been the site for an Australian Taxation Office Tax Help program for quite a long time now, and over that time we have got to know Joseph very well. He is a really outstanding citizen. He is now retired, though he dedicates his time to give back, as he says, to our local community, by helping low-income earners complete their tax returns every year. I look forward to continue to offer my office over the coming years to host this wonderful service, and I thank Joseph so much for his selfless contribution to our community. I note from the member for Bonner's motion that volunteering efforts make an estimated annual economic and social contribution of $290 billion to Australia. This is a truly remarkable contribution, and it's pertinent that we support the efforts of our volunteers wherever possible. Thank you, volunteers, for all you do in Macarthur and around Australia. We are gathered here today as elected representatives to serve our communities and are given generous compensation to do so, yet you provide community support for no financial compensation. The many volunteers who we pay homage to today serve our communities selflessly- (Time expired)",180
272,Ms HUSAR,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I follow the member for Macarthur in thanking the wonderful volunteers in his community. I'd also like to thank the member for Bonner, who brought this volunteer motion forward. I rise very proudly today in this House to pay tribute to some of the tireless volunteers in my electorate of Lindsay, which I'm so privileged to represent. Lindsay is an exceptional part of the world. Over 20,000 people in my electorate volunteer. From sporting clubs and service groups to school canteens and reading groups, we have it all-and lots and lots of it. It's that special glue, that magical glue, that makes a place a home and fills you with a sense of purpose and belonging. Volunteering is part of the fabric of Australia. We get in, give a hand and get it done. Research has also shown that volunteering is a two-way relationship. The OECD Better Life Index found that volunteers enjoyed life more  due to the sense of satisfaction that comes from interaction, goal setting, achievement and learning new things. Giving makes you happy. There is scientific research to prove it. People who give time or money are 42 per cent happier than those who do not. I love the term prosocial behaviour. It's often the crux of volunteerism. There are a number of organisations in Lindsay, like the Penrith Valley Chamber of Commerce. They have recently been given new life thanks to the outgoing president, Wayne Willmington, and his board. I'd like to personally thank Wayne and the team at Penrith Valley Chamber of Commerce for their generous support of our business community. I would also like to congratulate the incoming board, made up of Simon Gould, Anil Puri and Mary Donnelly-big shoes to fill, but I know you're up for the challenge. On Melbourne Cup Day, I was thrilled to attend the fundraising breakfast for the Penrith Community Kitchen, organised by Julie Lonard from the Nepean Business Network. This amazing event almost raised $40,000 to keep one of the volunteering institutions of Lindsay pumping out over 2,000 meals for the homeless every single week. This is no mean feat from either of the organisations involved, and I'm so filled with pride for both of these organisations. They are both organised and supported by volunteers, and both will be seen into the future by volunteers. Last week I was thrilled to be able to secure and distribute some federal grants for some of the wonderful local volunteer groups in my community. The Luke Priddis Foundation, which supports children with autism and their volunteers and therapists, will now have a new kitchen to teach kids life skills thanks to the grant we were able to secure. Paying it Forward is a charity that I have personally volunteered with for many, many years, headed up by Gen and Rob Jagt, the founders of this charity. It was my pleasure to help them fund a vehicle which will enable them to continue to expand on their support for the most socially marginalised through delivery of goods and services using their new wheels. We also have the Nepean Food Services in my electorate, possibly the largest volunteer organisation, who now have a new family table to share many delicious and happy meals from. They provide countless meals to older people in our community and also those who are on the fringes. I want to say a massive thank you to Nepean Food Services for all that they do and thank every single one of the volunteers I've been proud to interact with over the last three years. Mama Lana's Community Foundation, who was recognised as New South Wales Volunteer of the Year in 2017 for her work in my electorate helping to feed the homeless and vulnerable, has received a commercial-grade fridge and freezer, allowing them to increase the ability to accept donations and keep them fresher for longer. Thank you to Lana and Roger Borg, the founders of Mama Lana's Community Foundation. Nepean Multicultural Access requested and received computers to help provide training and program access for new Australians and migrants into a community, helping them to get on their feet, to find work, to find social services and to be connected. I want to thank Laura Sardo and all the team at NMA for all of the work that they do for our marginalised new migrant communities and for reaching out and giving support where it's most needed. Our volunteer sporting groups around the Nepean Valley regional sports centre will finally be able to put their feet up for a well-deserved break after another huge year of coaching, reffing and all-round organising through thousands of hours of community support for new outdoor seating. I was sitting on it just at the weekend and am pleased to know that I've been instrumental in being able to secure some new furniture after I copped a splinter in the leg from the old stuff that has been there since I was little. The equipment-even more proudly am I of thiswas manufactured from 360,000 plastic bags, so we have the added benefit of saving all that plastic from landfill as well as not getting splinters on the backs of the legs of mums and dads sitting down there at training every week. I am incredibly proud of the 20,000-plus volunteers of Lindsay and the selfless devotion that they have to their causes. You are the heroes of our community. I will leave you with a quote from Winston Churchill that probably sums up the heart of volunteerism: 'We make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give.' Happy Volunteer Day! Debate adjourned. Climate Change",181
273,Ms SHARKIE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I move: That this House: (1) notes that:  (a) the scientific evidence for both the existence of climate change and the anthropogenic factors that cause it is overwhelming and compelling and should no longer be held in doubt; (b) climate change is projected to create serious risks to health, livelihoods, food security, water supply, human security and economic growth and that action on climate change is of critical importance to future generations of Australians; (c) the Australian Institute's report entitled Climate of the Nation 2018 found that 73 per cent of Australians are concerned about climate change, up from 66 per cent in 2017, and that only 11 per cent of Australians do not think that climate change is occurring; (d) in March 2007, the then Opposition Leader, the Hon Kevin Rudd, stated that 'Climate change is the great moral challenge of our generation.'; (e) in February 2010, the then Member for Wentworth, the Hon Malcolm Turnbull, stated that 'Climate change policy...is an exercise in risk management and no reasonable person could regard the risk as being so low that no action was warranted.'; (f) the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2018 special report entitled Global Warming of 1.5°C concluded that human activities are estimated to have caused approximately 1°C of global warming above pre-industrial levels; (g) that same report concludes with high confidence that global warming is likely to reach 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels between 2030 and 2052 if it continues to increase at the current rate; (h) climate related risks are projected to substantially increase with global warming of 1.5°C and seriously increase with global warming of 2°C or higher; and (i) serious Government action on climate change in Australia has badly stalled; and (2) calls on the Government to: (a) maintain its commitment to the Paris Agreement and its targets; and (b) take: (i) genuine and meaningful action to meet those targets; and (ii) significantly greater action to reduce Australia's greenhouse emissions, and as soon as possible. The greatest policy failure of our current generation in Australian politics is climate change. Climate change policy captures the ultimate zeitgeist of the modern Australian political era. No other policy issue has been plagued by such partisan attacks, and no other policy issue has heralded the repeated fall of Australian prime ministers. Despite the heroic efforts of former Prime Minister Turnbull and Minister Frydenberg when he was the environment minister, the government has reincarnated their unshakeable groundhog day commitment to maintaining a policy vacuum. Extreme elements from both sides of the political spectrum have frustrated moderate centrist climate change policies, policies which not only find their greatest foundation in science but also have the most chance of achieving lasting bipartisan consensus. The failure of the political class has become Australia's failure. It is the people of Australia and the generations that follow that will bear the burden of this inaction, and I must stress that this is not a left-wing, right-wing issue. The scientific evidence for climate change is compelling. What is lacking is action. It is for this reason that, from today, I am seeking to launch the Parliamentary Friends of Climate Action with my co-chair to be, the member for Wentworth. Together, we will use the group to foster progress on climate change policy and action. It's action where we are failing here in the parliament. Most sceptical and cynical Australians should think of action on climate change as an insurance policyinsurance against inconvenient truths, predictions of disaster and everything in between. My goodness, if Rupert Murdoch says that we should give climate the benefit of the doubt, surely you'd think most in government would listen. Thousands of experts act as reviewers, ensuring the reports of the IPCC reflect the full range of views of the scientific community, yet those reports have fallen on deaf ears in the parliament. Warming caused by human activity will persist for centuries, perhaps millennia, and will continue to cause further long-term changes to the climate system, including a rise in sea level. To put it into perspective, we are in trouble. Rainfall patterns in Australia are shifting and the severity of floods and droughts has increased. The area roughly between Adelaide and Brisbane has already experienced a 15 per cent decline in late autumn and early winter rainfall over the past few decades, and across the Murray Darling Basin stream flows have declined by 41 per cent since the mid-1990s. Warmer atmospheres can hold more water vapour, increasing the risk of flash flooding. A hotter climate dries out vegetation, creating a tinderbox for bushfires. We are seeing this the world over. My own electorate is already feeling the effects of more volatile rainfall, with flash flooding being a regular occurrence. Our communities on the Lower Lakes know only too well the devastation caused by drought. However, the lack of large-scale government support for long-term environmental rehabilitation and futureproofing means we are doomed to see the same story of agricultural and environmental distress repeat itself. My coastal communities are increasingly concerned and affected by king tides, severe storms, coastal erosion and  sea-level rise. My coastal councils are desperate for assistance because this is a problem that local government simply doesn't have the financial capacity or expertise to address. I and the Australian Coastal Councils Association have repeatedly called for the federal government to take leadership on this countrywide issue. Eighty-five per cent of Australians live on the coast, but the federal government refuses to step up and plan for their future. It's almost as if we are in a climate change denial parliament. The call for action is clear. Bipartisan consensus with scientifically based policy in the sensible centre is critical to this. We can't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. That's why it is just astonishing that the government threw out a prime minister based on the NEG, which was a relatively benign policy with respect to energy. It's just astounding that you do this to yourselves and to the nation. If Australia is to carry its share of the global burden to face down the challenges of climate change, we need bipartisan consensus. We need action from this government today. I call on all members listening to this speech, in this chamber and in other chambers: please join the parliamentary friends for climate action, because, if the government's not going to do it, it will be another thing that the parliament will have to address alone.",182
274,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Is the motion seconded? Ms Vamvakinou: I second the motion and reserve my right to speak. Mr CRAIG KELLY (Hughes) (18:05): I'm pleased to speak on the member for Mayo's motion this afternoon. The member notes in her motion in paragraph (1)(a) that 'the scientific evidence for … the existence of climate change' is in, and ' should no longer be held in doubt'. To clear up any ambiguities, I agree with that. The science is in; the climate is changing. We only have to look at a recent paper, published in January 2014 in the journal Nature that said Australian tropical cyclone activity is lower than at any time in the past 550 years. We only have to go to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology and their numbers, and we see a declining trend in cyclones in this nation. In fact, for the season 2015-16, not a single severe cyclone struck Australia-not one. If we compare that to the season back in 1984-85, we had no fewer than 11 severe cyclones, yet in the other season there was not a single one. So, yes, the climate is changing; there are fewer cyclones affecting Australia. We see the same with tornados in the USA-a significant downward trend. This year likely has the lowest number of tornados in history-so, yes, the climate is changing. We can look at the information on snowfall. The trend in winter snowfall in the Northern Hemisphere is actually increasing; we are getting more snowfall in winter in the Northern Hemisphere. The climate is changing. We are a land 'of drought and flooding rains'. The current drought is terrible, as I'm sure that you, Deputy Speaker, among all members in this place know. But, thankfully, if we look at the rainfall records, in many places in this country the drought was far, far worse back over 100 years ago. Yes, we are seeing all those climatic changes. We hear also in this motion that the government should take serious action on climate change. I say that the greatest moral challenge that we face as members of parliament is to admit that nothing that we do in Australia will actually change the climate. This is not only what the science says, but what the Chief Scientist says. During questioning in estimates, Senator Ian Macdonald said to the Chief Scientist: In Australia, we emit less than 1.3 per cent of the world's carbon emissions. The Chief Scientist said: About that. Senator Macdonald asked: If we were to reduce the world's emissions of carbon by 1.3 per cent, what impact would that make on the changing climate of the world? In other words, if we reduced our CO2 emissions ,and CO2 equivalents, to zero, what effect would that have on the temperature? The Chief Scientist's answer was: Virtually nothing. The fact is, whatever we do here in policy will have no effect on the climate. You may well argue: what if all nations worked together, like they are at Paris Agreement? If you do the numbers, and if we assume that every single nation meets its Paris commitments by 2030 and we assume that the computer modelling is correct, how much warming do we avoid? One-twentieth of one degree by the year 2100. That is what is achieved under the Paris commitment-one-twentieth of one degree. The greatest moral challenge that we have is to make those admissions to the Australian public and not virtue-seek on this issue. Others have brought up the issue of Tuvalu and have said that Tuvalu is at imminent risk of disappearance. But actually, if you look at the peer-reviewed science and what the peer-reviewed science says about Tuvalu, Auckland University's Professor Kench has found that, since the 1970s, Tuvalu has actually increased in size by 2.9 per cent. The professor said:  The study findings may seem counterintuitive … but the dominant mode of change over that time on Tuvalu has been expansion, not erosion. That is the peer-reviewed science. When we talk about taking action on climate change, it is very important to remember that our electricity sector, which we all talk about with our solar panels and wind turbines, is only one-third of our CO2 emissions. I ask other members of parliament to please tell me this: what are you going to do in the spaces of agriculture, what are you doing in road transport, what are you doing in commercial aviation and what are you doing in the mining sector to reduce our emissions? The fact is that, no matter what we do, the reality is that we will not make a change to the climate- (Time expired)",184
275,Ms CLAYDON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I thank the member for Mayo for bringing this motion before the House. I saw her briefly outside and gave her that thanks personally, because she had to get to another chamber. I am very pleased to speak on the need for urgent action on climate change. It is an issue of the highest order. Climate change isn't a speculative theory anymore; it's a devastating reality that has very real, measurable impacts across the globe. The five warmest years on global record have occurred in the past seven years. The brutal ignorance, or perhaps rank deceit, displayed by some members of the government about this fundamental scientific reality is one of the greatest travesties of politics today. The list of climate crimes by the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison Liberal governments is long and shameful. Over the past five years, they have systematically set out to dismantle or shackle everything Australia had to reduce emissions and stem the dire impacts of climate change. They abolished the carbon pricing mechanism. They removed the cap on pollution and installed the dodgy direct action program, which paid polluters in the hope that they would somehow stop polluting. They defunded the Climate Council. They launched a savage war on the renewable industry, which saw investments plummet by as much as 90 per cent. They tried to axe the renewable energy target. They tried to shut down the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and ARENA, which had its funding cut anyway. They then set up a pathetically low climate target that all but guarantees that we cannot meet our Paris targets and obligations. All of this was under the direction of the apparent real leaders of the government-that is, the very rabid but small number of right-wing fringe dwellers in the party room who have completely hijacked the Liberal and National parties in Australia. Shame on you. It has just been an ongoing disappointment for Australians everywhere that both of those party rooms seem unable to deal with this small minority rump that has hijacked climate change and effective policy responses in this nation for years and years. This gross neglect of climate and energy policy has not even stopped the spiralling electricity prices. We've seen plummeting business confidence and investment. This neglect also having a direct and material impact on emissions. Under the former Labor government, carbon emissions dropped more than 10 per cent. Since the Liberals got into power, carbon emissions have risen year on year. The government's own data shows that, under its policy void, carbon pollution will keep rising all the way out to 2030, the furthest date of projections. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change starkly outlined the very real chance that we will exceed a temperature increase of 1.5 degrees by 2040. We use a lot of superlatives in this place, but there are no words strong enough to impress the grave threat that this would pose to our health, our food security, our water supply and, indeed, our very existence. The time for climate denialism in our federal government is over. The time to end the war on renewables is here, and the time for real action on climate change is now. And it's not just Labor saying this. The roar of community dissent is becoming deafening: Australians want action on climate change and they want it now. Last week in my electorate I met with around 30 young people between the ages of five and 13 from Newcastle East Public School. They said that they're concerned about the impact of climate change on our animals, our plants and our oceans, and they entreated me to take their message to parliament. It is a sad state of affairs when primary school students are more informed than government members about the dire implications of climate change, but that is the sad reality. My message to those students and to young people across Australia is simple: Labor will not shirk our responsibility to future generations. We've committed to reducing carbon pollution in line with the 45 per cent emissions target by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2050. (Time expired)",185
276,Mr ALBANESE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise to support this motion, and I congratulate the member for Mayo on the comprehensive nature of the proposition that she's put before the parliament this evening. It is common sense. We know that the precautionary principle means that we need to act on climate change; and that the sooner we act, the cheaper that action will be and the more benefit we will gain from that action. I've been here a while and, for a time, I was the environment and climate change spokesperson for the party. I wrote the policy with Kim Beazley, the climate change blueprint, back in 2006. We campaigned for that blueprint, which included an emissions trading scheme and a price on carbon. It included the ratification of the Kyoto protocol. It included measures to improve sustainability in housing and in transport. It included the policy supporting the Renewable  Energy Target being lifted to 20 per cent by 2020. At the time we adopted that policy, the target was just two per cent, so it was a tenfold increase-an expression of the faith that we had in human ingenuity to develop technology that would make a real difference in terms of reducing our emissions, improving productivity and creating jobs at the same time. It is important to remember that in 2007 John Howard changed his mind before that election-there had been a bipartisan position supporting an emissions trading scheme in the lead-up to that election. But, unfortunately, the coalition changed its mind when we proposed the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme in 2009. It still would have been carried, had the Greens political party voted for that proposition in the Senate, and, if that had happened, I'm convinced that there would be a price on carbon still in place today that would have been doing its job and that would have made that transition to a clean energy future so much easier. The problem that we had wasn't just that the climate change sceptics got control of the coalition under the former Prime Minister and member for Warringah. It's that they became market sceptics as well, and opposed any market based mechanisms to promote change. Since the change of government, we've seen the action on climate change go backwards. We've seen a government that has been unable to come up with a comprehensive energy plan. They had the emissions intensity scheme, then they asked the Chief Scientist to produce a policy and he came up with the clean energy target, which they abandoned, and then they had various versions of the National Energy Guarantee and, after it going through the party room not once but twice, they then abandoned their own policy. Now this government doesn't have an energy policy, going forward. The fact is that the private sector and the energy sector are saying that what they want is certainty. They need policy certainty so as to promote that investment, but they're not getting it from this government. They will have it from Labor. We'll put on the table our proposal to be prepared to support the NEG and negotiate with the government. We've put on the table our commitment to a 45 per cent emissions reduction target by 2030, net zero emissions by 2050 and 50 per cent renewable energy by 2030. The fact is that we are the party of the future in terms of government and we're prepared to work with people of goodwill, such as the member for Mayo. I note the newly-elected member for Wentworth in the chamber this evening. We're prepared to work with people of goodwill who understand that climate change shouldn't be a partisan issue. It should be something that the whole parliament unites together on in order to achieve change. We're prepared to work cooperatively with members of the coalition of goodwill as well, because this is an issue that should be beyond politics; it's an issue about our future.",185
277,Mr CONROY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I congratulate the member for Mayo on putting forward this very important topic. I'm going to start by saying that one of the premises of the motion was unfortunate, which is that the government's target was in some way adequate as a contribution to taking on climate change. The sad fact is that the government's climate change target of a 26 per cent reduction on 2000 levels by 2030 is woefully inadequate. It does not represent Australia taking meaningful action. It does not represent Australia making a contribution commensurate with our part in the global challenge. It's wildly out of step with what comparative countries such as the United Kingdom, Germany or other countries in Europe and Canada are taking. What's even sadder is that the government won't even meet their own inadequate targets. The government's own figures show that our 2020 emissions will be the same as those in 2000. Let me repeat that: our emissions in 2020 will be the same as Australia's emissions in 2000, and our 2030 emissions, based on current projections, will be only five per cent below 2005 levels. That is a damning indictment of this government's lack of commitment to taking action on climate change. In fact, carbon pollution has risen in the economy for three consecutive years. Last year, it rose by 1.5 per cent alone. The only reason we will be meeting the 2020 Kyoto targets is the visionary policies of the Beattie-Bligh Labor governments to take action around land clearing in Queensland and Labor's carbon price, which in two years alone reduced carbon pollution by 14 million tonnes. They are the only reasons we will meet our 2020 targets. As I said, this government has no plan on how we'll meet 2030 targets. Their Emissions Reduction Fund is a dog. Half of the abatement isn't meaningful abatement, and we are seeing projects having to hand back their revenue. They have had six energy policies in two years; in fact, they've had four energy policies in 14 days. We had NEG 1, NEG 2 and NEG 3 and then the current energy minister's basic abandonment of any emissions reduction policy. This government isn't committed to taking action on climate change, but I'm proud to say that the Labor opposition is. We've got a commitment to reducing emissions by 45 per cent by 2030. It is based on the best evidence from the Climate Change Authority that that is the appropriate level of emissions reduction for Australia, and we've got a solid plan to hit that. We released our policy in energy last week, with overwhelming stakeholder support, and we'll announce our policies in the other sectors to achieve that target. Labor will have a genuine  alternative-a policy that will not only cut emissions in the energy sector but will also cut the cost of electricity, because renewable energy is the cheapest form of new energy, and will drive up to 71,000 new jobs. In the time remaining I caution people who are passionate about this area to not repeat the mistakes of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, where a group of people in the Greens political party pursued policy purity and political opportunism at the expense of taking concrete action. The five Greens senators put the perfect ahead of the possible and voted with Tony Abbott, the member for Warringah, and the luddites in the Liberal Party to defeat the CPRS. They were the sole difference between the CPRS getting up or not, and that led to the nine years of climate wars which have continued to this very day. Think about it for a second: if the Greens had been willing to compromise and say, 'Here's an ETS that we can build upon, which will be effective and is supported by key stakeholders,' it would have been implemented in 2009 and would have demonstrated to the world that the sky would not fall in. We wouldn't have had comments about Whyalla being wiped out or comments from the member for New England about $100 lamb roasts. We wouldn't have had that silliness. We would have proved to the Australian people that we can take meaningful action to climate change and we could have scaled up from there. Instead they put their petty political self-interest ahead, and we're paying the price now. I urge those same people not to grandstand again-to go not for the perfect but instead for something achievable and practical that we can build upon, which is Labor's concrete plan to take action on climate change.",186
278,Dr PHELPS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise in support of the notice of motion moved by the member for Mayo calling on the government to: (a) maintain its commitment to the Paris Agreement and its targets; and (b) take: (i) genuine and meaningful action to meet those targets; and (ii) significantly greater action to reduce Australia's greenhouse emissions … The scientific consensus on climate change is in: climate change is real and we must act as a nation to do our part to help reduce its impact. In the recent Wentworth by-election one of the major issues people in the electorate raised with me was climate change. Unfortunately in Australia there has been a major disconnect between the desire of a clear majority of Australians for meaningful and immediate action on climate change and the current government's ongoing inability to produce any coherent policy to address it. As a nation and as global citizens we must embrace pathways to effectively cut greenhouse gas emissions while safeguarding national economic prosperity and affordable, reliable energy for all Australians. Implementing solutions that are effective, efficient and do not discriminate or create inequality is our real challenge in this debate. In 2002 when I was serving as AMA president we held a summit on climate change and human health policy. There are enormous public health implications of climate change, such as heat related deaths and illnesses, vectorborne illnesses, waterborne illnesses like gastroenteritis, reduced food production such as reduced fish populations, and air pollution related illnesses such as asthma. The World Health Organization estimates there will be 250,000 additional deaths globally per year between 2030 and 2050 due to climate change. Those of us most vulnerable to these effects are children, the poor, the elderly and those who are already sick. It is clear that something needs to be done. By listening during the by-election campaign I learned from the voters that they wanted action and I made it a key part of my platform. During the campaign I announced my intentions on climate policy: transition to 100 per cent renewable energy, 50 per cent by 2030; restore a credible scientific research based Climate Change Authority to inform government policy; oppose any federal government underwriting of new coal fired power generation; stop government subsidies of new fossil fuel developments, including the proposed Adani mine; meet our commitments under the Paris climate agreement as a minimum; ban political donations by fossil fuel companies; and establish a register to force all senators and members to disclose meetings with fossil fuel companies and their lobbyists. Contrast this to the current government, which is dominated by climate sceptics. The former member for Wentworth and former Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, made this clear when he was speaking at the Australian Bar Association's annual conference in Sydney recently. Mr Turnbull reportedly said that a climate sceptic group within his own party held the line: … if you don't do what we want, we will blow the show up … He was quoted as saying: The truth is … the Liberal Party and the Coalition is not capable of dealing with climate change. This is simply not good enough when an overwhelming proportion of Australians are concerned about the effects of climate change. The latest UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report shows the urgent need for  global action on climate change. The report is groundbreaking in that it looks at the impacts of keeping global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to two degrees Celsius. It finds that reaching the lower target would lessen the risk of drought, floods and extreme heat. The authors of the report said urgent and unprecedented changes are needed to reach the lower target. The half-degree difference could prevent corals from being completely eradicated and ease pressure on the Arctic. Solving the climate change crisis requires vision and leadership. The Prime Minister's thought bubble on the day the IPCC report was released of overturning the ban on building nuclear reactors in Australia was not and is not the answer. We saw how that worked out for the people of Fukushima. The people of Wentworth and of Australia generally want decisive action on cutting greenhouse emissions and a well-researched and deliverable plan for a just transition from coal to renewables. Australia must eventually source all our energy requirements from renewable sources in order to limit the effects of climate change. This will require Australia coming together around an agreed plan. I will be guided by experts on the timing and pace at which Australia can responsibly transition to 100 per cent renewals, but I want the experts on climate and energy to develop this plan. One of the ways to drive a reduction in emissions is to shift away from coal. Coal is old technology that will never be able to become clean. Thermal coal-fired power generation needs to be phased out in an orderly way as renewable sources become more affordable and available. Taxpayers' money should be invested in creating the long-term, sustainable transition to renewable technologies, not propping up environmentally harmful fossil fuels. We have abundant natural resources to harness. Renewable solar and wind are now cheaper forms of electricity generation than new coal-fired power plants. The current lack of policy certainty is hindering investment. Time is running out for an effective national policy to address climate change. The longer we wait, the more expensive and difficult this transition becomes. We can and we must all assume responsibility for supporting and embracing change for our children, for our land and for our planet. Debate adjourned. Remembrance Day Consideration resumed of the motion: That this House: (1) notes that: (a) on Remembrance Day on 11 November 2018, we commemorated the Centenary of the First World War Armistice; (b) from a population of less than five million, more than 400,000 Australians enlisted to serve, and of these, more than 150,000 were wounded, gassed or taken prisoner and more than 60,000 made the ultimate sacrifice giving their lives for their country; and (c) this was an enormous toll for a young nation like Australia with nearly every family and community across the country having experienced a loss of some kind; and (2) acknowledges: (a) the service and sacrifice of Australia's current and former serving men and women; (b) the unwavering commitment of the families who support our veterans on the home front; and (c) and thanks all current and former defence personnel for their service.",187
279,Ms LAMB,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise today to commemorate Remembrance Day, which fell on the 11th day of this, the 11th, month. Every year, people all around Australia stop to reflect on the great sacrifice that was made by those who served our nation in the First World War. This year marks the Centenary of Armistice-100 years from when the guns fell silent on the Western Front. Our country, of course, was still in its infancy then. From a population of less than five million, more than 400,000 Australians enlisted to serve. With just over one in 12 Australians courageously enlisting to serve, it comes as no surprise that they hailed from all over-many of them from the area which I now represent. The bravery of these Australians will not be forgotten-Australians like Arthur Henley, who was living in Burpengary when he enlisted on 9 October 1915. He enlisted as a private and embarked from Sydney on board the HMATSS Hawkes Bay on 20 April 1916. Arthur's fine service will not be forgotten. He was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal for the most conspicuous gallantry and determination, which he displayed at Villeret in 1918. This labourer from regional Queensland twice led his section at enemy strong points which were holding up the advance. He worked his gun to a flank and brought fire to bear on the strong point. Later he led a charge against an enemy machine gun, firing his gun from the hip. Arthur succeeded in capturing it and, with it, seven prisoners. Australia was very lucky to see him return home on 5 September 1919. But as we all know, not everyone was so lucky. Of the 400,000 Australians who served, more than 150,000 were wounded, gassed or  taken prisoner. Tragically, 60,000 gave their lives to defend this great nation of ours. This, of course, took a truly significant toll on the individuals, families and communities that survived them. In seeking to better understand my region's contribution to the First World War, I came across an article that appeared in the newspaper The Queenslander on 4 August 1917. It reads: Charles Munro, of Burpengary, Queenslandthat's how it beginshas received a cablegram from the commandment, 13th Flying Squadron, advising that his son, Lieutenant J.D. Munro, was killed in England in an aeroplane accident on the 17th instant. The article continues to detail Lieutenant Munro's interesting and impressive record. He was one of the earliest volunteers to leave the state in 1914. He was at the nation-defining landing of Gallipoli. He served for several months on that campaign. He found love while enlisted, marrying a nurse who helped restore him to health following a bout of illness. I know the tragedy that was his death will never be forgotten. I also came across an article from The Brisbane Courier that ran on 30 August 1918, and it read: News has been received by Mr and Mrs J.C. Kellior, Mt Comrie, Upper Caboolture, that their second son, Private T.H. Kellior, died of wounds on August 9 in France. This is their second son to make the supreme sacrifice. As a parent, I can feel myself connecting with these very personal stories. We so often retell the courageous stories of bravery and valour that personal stories can become lost. We often forget that, while these brave men and women served overseas, they left behind their parents, their loved ones and their families. We forget that, for regular Australian parents like those of Lieutenant Munro or Private Kellior, while their children were serving overseas, life was just meant to go on. I know the pride they would have felt, but I also know how devastating it must have been to read the cablegrams that related such tragic news for their families. We will not forget them. We will not forget those who served and we'll not forget the sacrifices that they made. A hundred years have passed since the guns fell silent on the Western Front. Even 100 years from today, our nation is still in their debt. We will remember them. Lest we forget.",188
280,Mr GEE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Communities around Australia gathered to attend services that marked the centenary of the armistice that finally ended the fighting of the First World War on Sunday, 11 November. It was a conflict which changed our nation forever. From a population of under five million, 420,000 Australians enlisted, and over 61,000 paid the ultimate sacrifice. Over one single 24-hour period at Fromelles, there were over 5,500 Australian casualties. Mothers and fathers lost sons, wives lost husbands and children lost fathers. When the town bells rang out a century ago, there was no doubt joy and relief that the war was over, but there was also immense sorrow and grief. The men and women who served and sacrificed for Australia asked of future generations only one thing: that we remember them. At Remembrance Day services this year, communities across the electorate of Calare came out in large numbers to fulfil that sacred commitment. At Kandos, 150 community members gathered at the memorial wall to commemorate the centenary of the Armistice, which was organised by members of the RSL, including President John Taylor, Vice-president Glen Evans and the secretary and treasurer, Ken Bevitt, along with World War II veterans Lance Ford and Val Wade. A special feature of this year's service was the 2,501 knitted and crocheted poppies and homemade ANZAC biscuits made by local women in the community, including Jan Baillie, Pauline Brooks, Marilyn Comer, Joyce Doble, Regina Dinten, Julie Denton, Lynette Edwards, Gwen English, Yukiko Evans, Rose Evans, Elizabeth Gardiner, Joan George, Catherine Gleeson, Pat Glover, Chris Hassell, Val Herbert, Elaine Hegarty, Carol Hayward, Denise Jamieson, Marsha James, Judy James, Sharyn Joyce, Jean Lloyd, Leonie MCKenna, Sandra MCIntosh, Carol Morrissey, Jo Maher, Joy Murray, Barbara Murray, Barbara Martin, Wendy Rodda, Ellen Riley, Joan Schultz, Mary Smith, Lyn Taylor, Mona Timson, Doreen Wurth, Bev Williams and Marjorie Windle. The poppies, which were made into banners and hung around the community hall, have since been donated to the Kandos and Rylstone museums. In addition to the poppies, 100 wire crosses were installed, representing local servicemen. These crosses were available for purchase, with funds raised going to Soldier On. In Wellington, there were 200 in attendance, or even more, at a service that featured performances by the Wellington Town Band and local a cappella group Stray Notes, led by Ross Godfrey. I would like to make mention of the hard working Wellington RSL sub-branch members, including President Roy Holmes, Secretary Peter Jarrett, Vice-President Beryl Althofer, Welfare Officer Rod Althofer, Treasurer Peter Duffy, and also committee members Peter Dowell, Aaron Edwards, Mark Inwood, Leslie Langbein, Chris Wykes, Ray Klein and Gary Francis.  In Gulgong, commemorations were held at ANZAC Park, which features a new memorial, which the members have recently installed. Branch Secretary John Fielding made a number of trips to the battlefield in France and drew up the plans for the new memorial from the photos he took. The memorial is a scale replica of the memorial in France where the Armistice was signed. The new memorial is located on the eastern side of the rotunda and will be a focal point for future Remembrance Day commemorations. The Gulgong RSL branch received a $3,000 Armistice Centenary Grant to help with the new memorial. I note the members of the Gulgong RSL sub-branch all worked very hard for that service and for the unveiling of the memorial. I would like to mention President David Henderson, Treasurer Craig Holden and Senior Vice-President Peter Leotta. I also have to make mention of the late junior vice-president, and Gulgong's last World War II veteran, Les Monks. I attended the funeral of Les Monks in Gulgong last week. He will be greatly missed. There was also a very strong turnout at Oberon's commemorations. Oberon RSL sub-branch President Bill Wilcox recited The Ode. He was ably supported in organising the commemorations by other RSL sub-branch members, including Secretary Neville Stapleton, Treasurer Don Stephens and Trustee Elaine Boxer. Following the service, local Oberon High School student Peta MCGRATH gave a presentation on her 12-day trip to the Western Front battlefields. I would like to pay tribute to all RSL members and community groups that organised services for Remembrance Day this year and also thank all community members who attended a service and fulfilled that sacred commitment to remember.",189
281,Ms SHARKIE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," This Remembrance Day we commemorated the Centenary of Armistice Day, a day when we honour the spirit of our service personnel. We are reminded of their sacrifice, a sacrifice made on our behalf and one deserving of our nation's respect and gratitude. I'm very grateful to my team, who represented our office right across the electorate. I attended a service in Langhorne Creek, down the very bottom of my electorate. Prior to attending the service I drove a 1954 Massey Ferguson, raising money for Legacy, from Milang to Langhorne Creek, and that was quite a feat. This year marked 25 years since the Unknown Soldier was laid to rest at the Australian War Memorial, on 11 November 1993. Those of you who have visited the memorial will have been struck by the words etched into the foot of the Unknown Soldier's tomb: He is all of them. And he is one of us. Our veterans are not confined to the pages of well-worn textbooks or some romantic notion captured on the silver screen. Our veterans are our grandparents, our parents, our sons, our daughters, our husbands, our wives. They are our past, our present and indeed our future. If we look to the past, the statistics can be difficult to comprehend. For example, in the First World War alone, over 150,000 service personnel were wounded, gassed or taken prisoner, with 60,000 never to return home to their families. It's not until we speak to our older Australians that we actually get a sense of the grief and loss that rippled through our communities after every conflict. As the memories of our older Australians fade, the importance of Remembrance Day, I believe, grows. The Australian War Memorial plays a vital role in ensuring that our young Australians understand the meaning of Remembrance Day and that we as a nation continue to honour and respect the sacrifices made by young men and women 100 years ago and over the last 100 years. While not every family can afford to make the long trip to Canberra, the virtual war memorial is a South Australian RSL initiative that seeks to do just that. It brings to life the history of service personnel using technology to share their stories with the next generation. We know that the challenges that face many of our service men and women often follow them home from deployment and into civilian life. South Australia, through Veterans SA, was a key driver in recognising transition from the military as a priority issue for ADF personnel and their families. Successful transition is a significant, mitigating factor in avoiding challenging post-service issues such as homelessness, incarceration, broken families, mental health and well-being issues. Looking after our veterans must be a priority. And, with what we now know about mental health and post-traumatic stress, we must do better. The Jamie Larcombe Centre in Adelaide adopts a model of care that offers inpatient and outpatient care and programs, research, and a partnership hub that helps veterans and their families to connect with ex-service organisations and community groups to provide support to assist recovery from mental illness. In excess of 70,000 ADF personnel have been deployed on global operations since our involvement in TimorLeste in 1999. We must position ourselves to be able to address the needs of these service personnel as they transition from the ADF and look to new careers as they move into retirement. We can't allow them to fall into a chasm. We need to ensure that we treat our veterans properly and provide them with a full complement of services for a successful transition. I commend the Minister for Veterans' Affairs on the work he has done so far, as outlined in last month's veterans' statement, but we must ensure that we learn from the mistakes of the past and  that we treat our veterans and their families with the respect they so richly deserve. It was a great honour to attend the service in Langhorne Creek. It was a very small but very meaningful service, and I would like to thank all of the RSLs right across my community for putting on poignant and moving Remembrance Day services right across the Mayo electorate.",190
282,Mr WALLACE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Every year on 11 November, we rightly commemorate the armistice which ended the First World War. However, as the centenary commemoration of that day, this 11 November was particularly special. In Maleny in my electorate of Fisher, our community created a unique and vibrant commemoration to reflect the importance of the day. On 30 November 1918, just two weeks after the end of the Great War, Maleny's families, still awaiting the return of their servicemen from overseas, organised a parade to celebrate the Armistice. Looking at the photographs shared by the RSL, you can tell that the Maleny victory parade was undoubtedly a colourful affair. It brought together publicans, police constables, servicemen and schoolchildren and united ordinary men and women from every part of our community. The vision of our own Chris Brooker and the Maleny RSL in 2018 was to re-create that peace march on this Armistice Day and honour the memory not only of those who served but of the families left behind. Eighty students and their teachers from Maleny and Conondale schools took part in vintage dress, while Maleny Men's Shed and TS Centaur re-created the naval-themed float commemorating the Sydney. Members of the Maleny hospital auxiliary dressed in vintage Australian Red Cross nurses' costumes in remembrance of the vital role that many women played during the war. Just as in the first parade, the Indian-Australian community came out to display the Indian national flag in remembrance of the contribution of our Commonwealth allies, as did our Canadian expats as well. Community groups from every part of Maleny took part, including the Maleny Singers, the Maleny Players, the Maleny Equestrian Group, the Maleny Bushrangers and the Blackall Range Horseless Carriage Club, as did our light horse brigade. The RSL meticulously followed the run sheet of the original parade. They even ensured that members of some of the same families were represented, like Bill Hankinson, who followed in his father's footsteps, riding in the parade as John Bull. Around 1,000 people attended and a great day was had by all. Hundreds lined the route to see the many horsedrawn carts and carriages, period costumes, vintage cars and pushbikes, the flags, the cattle and more. I was proud to take part in my own period costume to play a role in recreating our community's history and follow in the footsteps of the Sunshine Coast's pioneers. I want to thank all of those who dressed up, polished their vintage cars and got their horses and carts out of the barns. You all made a splendid sight and a moving commemoration of the events of 1918. Most of all, I want to thank Chris Brooker for organising such a unique and evocative Armistice Day event. You did our community proud, Chris, and we are all very rightly proud of your efforts. In recent weeks, I was also privileged to dedicate three new memorials to the Centenary of the First World War Armistice, supported by this government's Armistice Centenary Grants Program. I visited TS Onslow Royal Australian Navy Cadets unit in Golden Beach to dedicate a commemorative mural wall. In Maleny, I visited another of our active and dedicated Australian Navy Cadets units at TS Centaur to dedicate their new centenary commemoration flagpole. This flagpole will from now on allow the cadets to fly the Australian national flag during their weekly colours ceremony. Finally, on Armistice Day itself, I visited 223 Squadron Australian Air Force Cadets, where I had the opportunity before the main ceremony got underway to speak to the young cadets and to dedicate a new commemoration stone. In total, across Fisher, five organisations took advantage of the Armistice Centenary Grants Program. These included, in addition to those I've mentioned, the Caloundra RSL Sub Branch, who extended and refurbished their wonderful memorial garden, and the Mooloolaba State School, who constructed a new community memorial garden. I'm grateful to the organisations concerned for their commitment to the important task of remembrance and to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs for his support in helping these new memorials across my community to become a reality.

Question in writing No. 931 (Question No. 992) Mr Hill asked the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, in writing, on 21 June 2018: Further to his answer to question in writing No. 931 (Hansard, 18 June 2018, page 177), why is there a discrepancy between evidence provided by the then Minister responsible for citizenship applications to the Federal Court in BMF16 v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection [2016] FCA 1530 at [61] that 'a portion of...applications is identified as requiring ""thorough analysis"" or ""further assessment""', when he stated in his answer that 'The Department does not attribute applications into broad designations or categories as indicated in the question'.",194
286,Mr Coleman,QUESTIONS IN WRITING,"The answer to the honourable member's question is: In previous years, the Department of Home Affairs (the Department) referred to citizenship applications that were more complex than standard applications as 'assurance cases'. These applications usually required additional analysis or assessment before they could be finalised. The Department has phased out the practice of referring to complex citizenship applications in this way. Instead, the Department considers all applications as falling on a spectrum from low to high complexity. The degree of complexity of each case is dependent on the individual circumstances of the applicant, and the complexity of the case will determine what, if any, additional checks or further assessment – or referral to specialist officers or teams – may be required before a decision can be made. The evidence given by the then Minister for Immigration and Border Protection and the answer recently provided by the then Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs were both in line with departmental practice at the time.

(4) What is the breakdown of the expenditure of (a) allocated, and (b) expended (to date), IPA program funding. Ms Sharkie: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The September 2017 announcement by the (then) Minister for the Environment and Energy, the Hon Josh Frydenberg MP, of $93.4 million over five years from 2018-19 to 2022-23 to support ongoing Indigenous Protected Areas was the full allocation from the Natural Heritage Trust and comprised $87.75 million of administered funding and $5.60 million of departmental funding. The July 2018 announcement by the Minister for Indigenous Affairs, Senator the Hon Nigel Scullion refers to the full allocation of administered funding from 2018-19 to 2022-23. (2) There is no discrepancy. As stated above, the $93.4 million announcement included funding allocated to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet in departmental funding to administer the Indigenous Protected Area Program over five years from 2018-19 to 2022-23.

Not applicable Murray-Darling Basin Plan (Question No. 1127) Ms Sharkie asked the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, in writing, on 13 September 2018: Has the Murray-Darling Basin Authority undertaken a review of climate change risks on the Basin, as required under the Basin Plan 2012; if so, can the Government provide a copy; if not, why not, and when will this review be undertaken.",214
308,Mr Littleproud,QUESTIONS IN WRITING,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The MDBA has not conducted a review of climate change risks on the Basin since the Basin Plan was finalised. As part of its development, the MDBA considered the impact of climate on the proposed Basin Plan by analysing its performance across 114 years of climate records. This long climatic sequence takes into account the extremes of climate experienced in the past, including three prolonged drought periods (the 'Federation' drought around 1900, the 'World War Two' drought around 1940, and the recent Millennium drought) and has a similar mean annual rainfall and mean annual runoff as recent decades. NA  Under the Water Act 2007, the MDBA is required to review the Basin Plan in 2026, or earlier if requested by the Minister, or all Basin States. A review of climate change risks will be undertaken as part of this review. The MDBA may of its own accord also conduct a review before this time. Climate (Question No. 1128) Ms Sharkie asked the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, in writing, on 13 September 2018: 1. Does the Northern Basin Review (November 2016) include an up-to-date assessment of climate risks. 2. In respect of the Review's claim that there is a large degree of uncertainty around whether a wetter or drier future will eventuate, particularly in the northern Basin, are there any Murray-Darling Basin Authority studies that have concluded that a wetter future could eventuate for the northern Basin; if so, can the Government provide a copy.",214
309,Mr Littleproud,QUESTIONS IN WRITING,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: 1. Studies in the Basin over the last 10 years have shown that changes in climate could have a significant impact on water resources. There is a large degree of uncertainty around whether a wetter or drier future will eventuate, particularly in the northern Basin. Consequently, the approach taken by the Murray−Darling Basin Authority (MDBA) in its consideration of the northern Basin sustainable diversion limit was to conduct analyses using the Basin's long-term climate record over the 114 year period 1895 to 2009. This dataset includes considerable natural climate variability from very wet periods to prolonged droughts, including the Millennium Drought, and allowed Basin Plan outcomes to be explored under a wide range of different climatic conditions representative of both past and future weather patterns. The approach is consistent with advice provided by the CSIRO on the climate baseline for Murray Darling Basin Plan modelling. 2. As part of its Murray−Darling Basin Sustainable Yields Project, in 2008 CSIRO concluded that there is a large degree of uncertainty around whether a wetter or drier future will eventuate in the northern Basin. In 2010, MDBA repeated CSIRO's analysis using updated modelling information and some minor analytical refinements. This MDBA study, Water Availability in the Murray–Darling Basin, reached the same conclusions as the CSIRO work Law Enforcement (Question No. 1135) Ms Sharkie asked the Attorney-General, in writing, on 19 September 2018: Will the Government formally respond to Australian Law Reform Commission Report No.133 Pathways to JusticeInquiry into the Incarceration Rate of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples (28 March 2018) before the end of 2018; if not, why not, and in which month will the Government formally respond..  The report by the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) provides valuable insight into the issues that contribute to the over representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia's prisons. The Government will respond to the report in due course. Most of the laws and legal frameworks which contribute to Indigenous incarceration fall within state and territory jurisdictions, and as such implementation of the majority of the recommendations is a matter for consideration by them. The Commonwealth's focus remains firmly on the underlying disadvantage that puts Indigenous Australians at risk of coming into contact with the criminal justice system in the first place, including improving outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians in a range of areas such as employment, education, health and families. Animal Welfare (Question No. 1136) Mr Fitzgibbon asked the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, in writing, on 20 September 2018: 1. Given his media release of 17 May 2018 indicated that he wanted 'an independent observer on every voyage carrying either sheep or cattle-not just the sheep voyages during the northern summer; why does his media release of 13 September 2018 stipulate that independent observers are only required from 1 May to 31 October. 2. How many independent observers have been employed, and what was the recruitment process. 3. What qualifications are required of the independent observers, and do they have animal husbandry qualifications. 4. Under what classification are independent observers employed, what remuneration do they receive, and what allowances are they paid. 5. Has his department finalised the role and responsibilities of the independent observers; if not, what are their current duties. 6. Will the daily photos and written evidence provided by the independent observers be available to the public; if not, why not. 7. Will the independent observers program be assessed or reviewed; if so, what assessment criteria will be used.",215
310,Mr Littleproud,QUESTIONS IN WRITING,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: NA  1. The media release of 13 September 2018 referred to new conditions that were applied during the Middle East summer (1 May to 31 October). From 1 November 2018, independent observers are required on all voyages. Arrangements for voyages where an independent observer cannot be physically accommodated are being considered. 2. As at 2 November 2018, 29 independent observers have been deployed. All independent observers to date have been existing employees of the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources. Internal expressions of interest have been used to identify candidates with the skills, capabilities and personal attributes required to successfully undertake the role. The selection process includes a selection panel interview, referee checks, medical and psychometric assessments. External recruitment will be conducted when internal recruitment is completed. 3. Independent observers may be veterinarians or others with suitable skills. All independent observers must be able to demonstrate relevant experience or qualifications in livestock management, animal husbandry or related disciplines. Veterinary independent observers must have a degree in veterinary science or medicine. 4. Departmental employees are entitled to the remuneration and allowances agreed in the current Department of Agriculture and Water Resources Enterprise Agreement 2017–20. Veterinary independent observers are employed under the APS6 veterinary classification with a salary range of $88 125 to $115 130 as defined in the Enterprise Agreement. Nonveterinarian independent observers are employed at the APS5 Policy and Technical classification with a salary range of $72 743 to $78 421 as defined in the Enterprise Agreement. Departmental employees are entitled to an at-sea allowance of $118.95 per day when they are required to remain at sea overnight. Departmental employees are entitled to travel allowance as specified in the Enterprise Agreement. 5. The role of an independent observer is to monitor and report on activities in approved export programs for the purpose of ensuring the health and welfare of livestock in the course of export activities. 6. The Department of Agriculture and Water Resources intends to publish summaries of independent observers' reports shortly. These reports will summarise the key observations made by the independent observers from the loading of each vessel through to discharge at the final destination port. The summary reports will contain representative images of livestock throughout the course of the voyage. 7. The independent observer program will be subject to a post implementation review within the next two years. The review will be an opportunity to ensure the program is being delivered in the most effective and efficient manner. Funding (Question No. 1138) Ms Sharkie asked the Minister for Cities, Urban Infrastructure and Population, in writing, on 20 September 2018: (1) When will the Urban Congestion Fund be open for funding applications. (2) What criteria and process will be adopted in allocating the Fund. (3) Will there be a requirement for projects to have state and local government support. (4) In the allocation of the Fund, what weighting will be given to fast growing (a) outer suburbs, and (b) regional centres. (5) In millions of dollars, what is the estimated backlog of infrastructure expenditure for Australia's fast growing (a) outer suburbs, and (b) regional centres.",215
311,Mr Tudge,QUESTIONS IN WRITING,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Australian Government committed $1 billion to the Urban Congestion Fund (UCF) in the 2018-19 Budget. The government will work with relevant stakeholders, including state and local governments, to identify projects to be funded under the UCF that remediate pinch points, improve traffic safety and increase efficiency for commuter and freight operators on urban transport networks. As stated at Budget, there is no specific weighting to outer suburbs or regional centres. There is expected to be a focus on the major capital cities with the highest levels of congestion. There is no accurate estimate of any backlog of infrastructure, and attempts to estimate it are fraught with issues around assumptions, methods and what is actually meant by a 'backlog'. There are often multiple potential solutions to infrastructure problems such as congestion, so it is difficult to measure the type, number or scale of projects that would be required to address an identified deficiency in order to quantify a backlog. Rather than focusing on whether there is a backlog, the government is committed to delivering its $75 billion investment in Australia's transport infrastructure, including the $24.5 billion Pipeline of major projects and new initiatives, such as the UCF, announced in the 2018-19 Budget. Postal system (Question No. 1144) Mr Katter asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts, in writing, on 15 October 2018 (1) Why does a letter sent for $1 by 'regular' mail from Gordonvale (postcode 4865) to Edmonton (postcode 4869) take three to four business days, travelling 584 kilometres (Gordonvale to Cairns, then to Townsville to be sorted, returning to Cairns before being delivered in Edmonton). NA  (2) Why does this same letter, if sent for $1.50 by 'priority' mail, take only two business days, travelling only 31 kilometres (from Gordonvale to Cairns, and then directly to Edmonton). (3) In how many other regional centres does this additional transportation of 'regular' mail occur (in comparison to 'priority' mail). (4) How many jobs have been lost from regional sorting centres around Australia to centralised sorting centres in major centres.",216
312,Mr Fletcher,QUESTIONS IN WRITING,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: This question has been referred to me as the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts as the issue relates to the communications portfolio. The introduction of Australia Post's two-speed postal system in 2016, including Regular and Priority services, was necessary because Australia Post is experiencing an ongoing significant decline in letter volumes as customers switch to digital communication channels such as email and social media. Australians are now sending around 50 per cent fewer letters than they were at their peak in 2008. The reforms have allowed Australia Post to return to profitability while still meeting all of its Community Service Obligations (CSO). It is an operational matter for Australia Post to determine processing of letters, consistent with its CSO. Please see below for responses to the specific questions. (1) Transportation of Regular letters to large regional processing centres for automated letter sorting enables Australia Post to achieve cost efficiencies in the operation of the letters business. Letters posted in the Cairns region, including Gordonvale, are initially transported to Cairns for sorting into Regular and Priority mail. Cairns does not have automated letter processing equipment, and letters sent via the Regular timetable are transported to the nearest regional processing centre, in Townsville, for machine sorting, including sequencing to the delivery round. Mail is then returned to Cairns for distribution. (2) Letters posted in the Cairns region for delivery by the Priority timetable undergo a different process. There are much smaller volumes of Priority mail, and this is sorted manually in Cairns. While this is a less efficient process, it enables quicker delivery of Priority letters to meet the shorter, two day delivery time-frame applying to Priority letters. (3) The process by which letters are processed and delivered, including the transportation of Regular letters to a regional processing facility for automated sorting, is the standard model by which Australia Post processes letters throughout Australia. In regional areas, Priority mail for the same township/region (of which there are small volumes) remains in the same township/region to be processed for quicker delivery. Regular mail is transported to the nearest automated processing centre to be sorted/sequenced to the postal delivery round, then transported for delivery in line with the performance standards. Australia Post operates a number of regional processing centres throughout Australia including Queensland regional centres in Cairns, Townsville, Mackay, Rockhampton and Toowoomba. Of these, only Townsville has advanced automated letter sorting facilities. (4) Australia Post moved to centralised sorting when it introduced its Sustainable Regional Mail Program in 2014. This program resulted in the reduction of approximately 60 full-time equivalent staff from regional sites nationally. These reductions were achieved through voluntary redundancies and by not backfilling vacant positions. NA ",217
