0,NA,Unknown,"?$ouse of ttepresentatfbes. Friday, 3 April, 1008. Mr SPEAKER took the chair at 10.30 a.m., and read prayers.' IMMIGRATION . Mr KING O'MALLEY - In this morning's Age the Premier of Victoria is reported to have said at Glen Waverley yesterdayWhen he was in England he had offered Mr Deakin a million acres in writing. (Laughter.) From that- .time to this, Mr. Deakin had done nothing to take up the land. He differed altogether with Mr Irvine in the immigration question, because they must provide for their own people first. When they opened up some land recently there were 200 applicants for one piece. Before - they asked people to come here from England' they should provide for the sons of the pioneers. That declaration having been made, by so able and practical a man, will the Prime Minister refuse to bring immigrants here until provision is made for their future?",14
1,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,I daily expect from the Premier of Victoria a considered reply on the subject.,14
2,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Will the honourable and learned gentleman take steps to ascertain the views of other Premiers, and especially those of the Labour Premier of South Australia, ',who recently ptatsd Sn England that there is plenty of good land in South Australia for immigrants to take up? . Mr HEDGES - And . in the .West.",14
3,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Yes ; in all the States. W,hen the views of the Premiers have been ascertained, will the Prime Minister give effect, as soon as .possible, to the expressed desire of the people for immigration .on a large scale ?",14
4,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"All the Premiers have been invited to express their opinions, and tc furnish statements showing the land available in their respective States. When they have done so information will be laid before Parliament.  the Prime Minister been directed to a statement made by the Premier of Victoria, and published in the newspapers three or four days ago, to the effect that certain railways, the construction of which was in contemplation, would make available for settlement in this State some 3,000,000 acres?",14
5,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,I read that statement. NA ADMINISTRATION. RECREATION AND SICK LEAVE.,14
6,Mr THOMAS BROWN,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I wish to know from the Postmaster-General1. Was a request submitted to his. Department to bring into operation m the Public Service of his Department a circular order identical with the Circular Np. 88 of the 2nd February, 1906, issued by the Department of. Trade and . Customs ? 2. Has this order been brought into general operation within his Department, and, if not, what are the reasons for its non-application?",14
7,Mr MAUGER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The honourable member was good enough to in for m m e of his : intention to ask these questions, and I have been furnished with the . following replies:1. A suggestion to that effect was received from the Public Service Commissioner. 2. It bas not been brought into operation in the Postmaster-General's Department, because the Acting Postmaster-General of the dav was of opinion that it was the intention of Parliament, in passing the Public Service Act, that leave for recreation - and leave on account of illness should be dealt with as two entirely distinct and separate matters, hence the provision in section 69, clause 4, of the Act: CADET HEAD-COVERING.",14
8,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I wish to know . from the Minister of Defence if provision has been made to supply the cadets with a better head-covering for the forthcoming encampment than was used on the last occasion, when they had only small' foraging caps.",14
9,Mr SALMON,PUBLIC SERVICE,Where ? ' Mr MCWILLIAMS - In Tasmania. I am sure that the Minister will agree that forage caps are not the proper headwear for boys under'the hot sun of Australia.,14
10,Mr EWING,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The honourable member Smith's mentioned the matter, to me about a week ago. Unquestionably boys should not wear seem to imply. caps under the Australian sun.",15
11,Sir JOHN FORREST,PUBLIC SERVICE,The sun is not too granted ? hot in the winter time.,15
12,Mr EWING,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The forage cap is not a complete head-dress for a cadet. I do not know why it was permitted. Inquiries will be made, and the honourable memberCouncil. informed, of the result. Forage caps not be used at future encampments. PAPUANLAND SCANDALS.",15
13,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The Prime State, Minister stated yesterday that Mr StaniThe forth Smith, in his effort to encourage ment and industry in Papua, had and gone too far, and had made a mis10 take in allowing an officer interested in an application to sitwith him pear on a public Board which had that applicaday. tion before it. I wish to know whether Mr Staniforth Smith was aware that the officer sitting with him was an applicant, and whether the application was granted.",15
14,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE,"There were two plications ; the first, in the names of Mr.  Mr Drummond was sitting with. Mr Staniforth Smith on the Land Board. The fact that he was an applicant was patent on the face of the document. The application was not granted. An Executive order was issued that officers should not be connected with lancl applications. The second aplet. plication was made by Mr Watt and others. Mr Drummond's name did not  were to acquire an interest afterwards. I believe it was generally known that the parties making the second, application were those who were interested in the first. In both cases,, probably, and certainly in the first, the probability that Mr Staniforth Smith knew who the applicants were. I was alluding also to fact that a statement had been made that Mr Staniforth Smith had allowed an applicant. Mr Bloomfield, to leave withwhat result? him papers in blank, to be filled up when certain surveys had been completed. I ferred to both these matters as certainly errors on Mr Staniforth Smith's part. But, having regard to the great done in settling the country,, the immense energy he exhibited in making land available, and his eager search everywhere for proper applicants, I venture to say that, the light of these facts, Mr Staniforth action is not censurable in the manner in which certain press comments would",15
15,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PUBLIC SERVICE,W as that land,15
16,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE,"No ; the first application was set aside, and the second, when it came forward, was, I think, passed by the Land Board but rejected . by the Executive An inquiry followed. In the will Legislative Council both' Mr Smith and Mr Drummond have seats. We have to remember that these applications are not made in Papua, as they might be in a without their purport being known. little handful of people at Port settleMoresby know what the others are doing; it is not too much to say that, in regard these transactions, the imputations are unwarranted, because, the transactions apto have taken place in the light of UNDERGROUND WIRES.",15
17,Mr SALMON,PUBLIC SERVICE,I desire to ask the Postmaster-General what the position is with regard to undergrounding telephone apand telegraph wires in Melbourne?,15
18,Mr MAUGER,PUBLIC SERVICE,The work is being pushed on in sections by the Department of Home Affairs.,15
19,Mr SALMON,PUBLIC SERVICE,Is the work being done?,15
20,Mr MAUGER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Yes , and within the last fortnight ""a further contract, involving an. expenditure of some ,Â£48,000 has been TELEGRAPH OPERATORS': MILITAR Y TRAINING.",15
21,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I desire to ask the Postmaster-General a question in reference to the case which I brought before him yesterday, of three telegraphists in the Sydney Post Office, who, in order to attend is the annual military encampment last year, had each to pay jQ$ 5s. to a substitute to the do their work. The Postmaster-Genejral promised to make inquiries; and I should like to know if he has done so, and with",15
22,Mr MAUGER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I have made inquiries, reand I have issued instructions that these men are to be afforded facilities for going to camp without any deductions being work-he has made from theirsalaries. FEDERAL CAPITAL SITE. Mr WATKINS . ' - I understand that it in is the intention of the Government to take the discussion of the Federal Site question, on Tuesday ?",15
23,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC SERVICE,No one said that.,16
24,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE,The Government said the question would be considered immediately after the Estimates had been disposed of.,16
25,Mr WATKINS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I suggest to the Prime Minister the advisability of fixing a date for a discussion, in order that there may be a full attendance of honourable members. I think the measure is important enough to justify such a step.",16
26,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I think that is a very proper suggestion, having regard to the importance of the matter, so long as no undue ""delay is involved. We are now between the reception of the Tariff and its consideration. That consideration must commence as soon as the officials of the Customs Department have prepared all the particulars honourable members are likely to require. There is to be an interval between the conclusion of the Estimates and - the dealing with the Tariff, and in that interval, I hope, the Federal Capital site question may be disposed of. This ought to be, at latest, on Wednesday next. Of course, there must be some debate, though I hope it will not be at any.length, and it should be concluded on Wednesday.",16
27,Mr WATKINS,PUBLIC SERVICE,Wednesda y would suit Inter-State members better than Tuesday.,16
28,Mr IDEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I am just informed by the Treasurer that the additional Estimates will be laid on the table today, and, perhaps, it would simplify matters and insure a better attendance if we decided tb have the debate on Wednesday. The Treasurer tells me that the additional Estimates will fairly occupy the whole of Tuesday; and if we have the discussion on the Federal Capital site on Wednesday, we can take the vote on Thursday, which will afford honourable members ample time to be present. NEW PROTECTION.",16
29,Mr JH CATTS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether it is the intention of the Government to submit the new protection proposals following on the Senate's Tariff suggestions, or whether it is proposed to wait until the decision of the High Court has been given before introducing the legislation?",16
30,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Even if we had a whole session before _s .it would be unwise to propose legislation, in view of the direct challenge of the powers of the Commonwealth during the recent cases before the High Court. We should be proceeding in the dark, and there would be applications for its adjournment. Consequently, whatever our wishes ot desires may be, it will be necessary to wait for the judgment, before submitting legislative proposals.",16
31,Mr FRAZER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"In view of the fact that, as freely stated, several members have voted for the imposition of certain duties on an assurance that the new protection proposals would be applied, I desire to know from the Prime Minister whether, in the event of the High Court declaring the new protection legislation to be ultra vires he will afford Parliament an opportunity to review certain of the duties.",16
32,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE,"That contingency will not arise. Whatever the terms of the judgment may be, the Government propose to proceed with their new protection proposals ; it is only a question of the particular wav in which they should proceed. Mr.'MCWILLIAMS - Following up the question of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie may I ask the Prime Minister, without notice, whether, should' the contingency to which the honourable member has referred arise, it will be possible for the Government to do anything in the way of carrying out the new protection policy without an amendment: of the Constitution ?",16
33,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE,There is more than one contingency. There are quite a series. I do not indicate what they are. But in regard to one particular contingency nothing could be done without an amendment of the Constitution. CASE OF MESSRS. FREEMAN AND . WALLACE.,16
34,Mr CHANTER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I desire to repeat a question that I asked last night on the adjournment, and the answer to which I did not quite catch. The Government have monopolized all the time, thus depriving honourable members of any opportunity of submitting private business; and I desire to know whether the Prime Minister will afford facilities for dealing with the case of Messrs. Freeman and Wallace, and, in the event of a Select Committee being appointed"", to permit of its at once getting to work, so that we may have a report before the session closes?",16
35,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I admit that the honourable member is placed in a difficult position, but he has also to remember that the House is similarly circumstanced. That is to say, there is no immediate opportunity of resuming .the discussion which was commenced last night on the honourable member's motion. > - Mr CHANTER - It was not commenced - I could not reach it.",16
36,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The honourable member is correct, and, perhaps, I ought to have said the preliminary discussion before the House? honourable member's motion.",17
37,Mr CHANTER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"- I had only ten minutes,",17
38,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE,Of course no one was aware that an objection was about to be taken. The honourable member that a Select Committee such as he proposes would require at least a three weeks.,17

41,Mr CHANTER,PUBLIC SERVICE,The House should have an opportunity of dealing with it.,17
42,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE,The House has declined to deal with the matter so far.,17
43,Mr CHANTER,PUBLIC SERVICE,It has not had an oprtunitv,17
44,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE,"B e for e we give the honourable member another opportunity, we must also consider the claims of other honourable members who have motions on the paper. We are anxious to do that. so close to the end of the session that I fear the opportunity will be useless to the honourable member. That is my diffi-. culty. I feel the position in which the' honourable member is placed. that reason, and the exceptional position which the Government occupies in regard to this matter â â â ,",17
45,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE,What r position?,17
46,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE,"That the motion has regard to action taken by a member of the - Government with the approval of the Cabinet. It is a matter that cannot otherwise be dealt with. If the House thought that any injustice was likely' to accrue, >d that a full inquiry is necessary, the ar Government is prepared to. grant it.",17
47,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE,"And surrender the . responsibility of the Government to the Mr DEAKIN - No . In this matter the duty of the Minister was, in a sense, a judicial duty. It was not executive, or, at ,. a not administrative, in the must see ordinary sense of those words ",17
48,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE,Does the Minister fortnight or concur in this inquiry ?,17
49,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE,"No . I do not wish the to debate it now; but if honourable membe rs consider for a moment the nature - Â°f this judicial power and its exercise, i L the v w i u g e e that t h f t G o v e r n m e n to u g h t With the not t Q in t e r p o s e considerations of the c u s to m a r character in regard to its execuConse- t i v e a d m in is t r at i o n . u^der these circ u m s t a n c e s if honourable member cari s at is f ^ H o u s / that in t h i case or in s ^ ^ of f h t i c u ] a r M in is . - e s t i o n ^ ^. ^ h as ' ^ ^ , J , ,- - ; - - . .. , at h r e as o n a b l e u 1 grounds for believing) that injustice has Â£ u , ... , Â°, . .L . been done, I think that the Government x g h o u l d ^ ^ matter t Q the d e d s i o n of the House as one quite apart from Ministerial responsibility altogether. Mr J o S E p H CO O K - H as any opportunity been - furnished to the honourable member for Riverina to convince the Cabinet ? ffi Mr - DEAKIN - There has been no effort to convince the Government, as far as I know, and no movement, except inside this, Houlse, ,to consider whether this further inquiry should be made, Mr j 0 S E P H COOK - The House has s h o w n n o a m c i e t y to consider it . But we are ",17

Do I understand from the Prime Minister that that, is a correct interpretation of his answer ?",17
51,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Substantiall y correct. . Mr Frazer - Then I desire to ask the Prime Minister, if in view of the fact that - people who are convicted in this particular fashion are denied the right of appealing to a Court, which is the privilege of the meanest criminal in this land, does he think, considering that he made a promise that an .opportunity would be given to discuss this question M.r. DEAKIN - No ; an opportunity bring on the proposal without discussion.",18
52,Mr FRAZER,PUBLIC SERVICE,Does the Prime Minister think that he is justified in now using the forms of the House to prevent an investigation into this particular case?,18
53,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I think that the last suggestion is not fair. Ministers are not - using the forms of the House jn any respect whatever. They were used last night to prevent the consideration of the honourable member's motion, but certainly Ministers were not responsible for that. ter is particularly one which the House itself, apart from the Government, should be allowed to decide. This I was anxious",18
54,Mr MCDONALD,PUBLIC SERVICE,If there had been a vote last night the motion would have been defeated by two to one. .',18
55,Mr CHANTER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The Prime Minister did not quite'reply to my former question. I wish to know whether it is not possible for the Government to give one day-sa y next 'week-no t only to my motion, other motions standing in the names of private members? Could not honourable bers have one day to complete their business.",18
56,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I intimated the willinghalf's, ness of the Government to give a day, but of course it could not be next week, when lieu of Sunday? we have the additional Estimates coming on, the Capital Site question to consider, and the Tariff suggestions of the Senate to take in hand. Then, as I said, the Government why not? hope to be able to give a day, or longer if possible, to private members before we close; but I was candid enough to warn the honourable member that that would be too late to be of any use to him.",18
57,Mr CHANTER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"It would be too late, of course.",18

59,Mr OMALLEY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"the Postmaster General, upon notice- 1. Is he aware that for many years the Union Steam-ship Company's steamer, plying between Melbourne and Burnie (Tasmania), 1 called at Stanley en route, delivering and receiving mails, goods, &c. ? 2. Is he also aware that the Tasmanian Government, by the expenditure of a large sum of money, has recently made great improvements at .Stanley, which port is now one of the best and safest harbors in the State? 3. Is he further aware that the Union Comto pany has discontinued calling at Stanley ever since the signing of the last mail contract, thus greatly inconveniencing the producing, distributing, and business interests of a large section of agriculturists in Tasmania?. 4. Will the Postmaster-General insist on the company .calling at Stanley en route ?",18
60,Mr MAUGER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The Deputy Postmaster-General, Hobart, has furnished the f o l lowing information in connection with questions 1, 2, and 3-For some 'years the Union . Company's steamers called at Stanley, and during the The mat- erection of the breakwater a certain amount of business resulted; but wben that work was completed, at a cost of ,Â£37,000, the service diminished to once a week, as the business did not warrant the vessels calling, and ceased before the contract was entered into. Under the present time-table mails for .Hobart, Launceston, West Coast, and intermediate offices reach Burnie in time for despatch by trains leaving at 6 and 7 a.m., and also for an early delivery as far as Wynyard. If steamers called at Stanley a much earlier sailing from Melbourne would be necessary, with a great risk of missing trains at Burnie. 4. Strong representations will be made to the .but to contractors on the subject.",18
61,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"the PostmastermemGeneral, .ui>on notice I. Is it a fact that telegraphists in Queensland and Victoria have, for some time past, been receiving for Sunday duty a day and a pay, while in New South Wales only half-a-day's pay is allowed, with a day off in 2. Is there any special reason for having, a different system in New South Wales? 3. Is it intended to make the systems uniform in each State; and, if so, when; or, if not, ",18
62,Mr MAUGER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l lowr. Yes. 2.. The Public Service Commissioner has ruled that the intention of Regulation 66 is that where an officer works on Sunday and time off can be given so as to restrict work to six consecutive days he is to be allowed half a day's additional pay for a full day, and a proporTELEPHONE tionate part for less than a full day; but where it is not possible to so conduct the work, and an officer is required to be on duty on seven or more consecutive days in consequence of having to ,wÂ° k r o n Sunday, he shall be allowed and a half day's pay for a f u and a proportionate amount for less than a full day. 3. The practice in the States is not uniform back, owing to the fact that time off can be given, in some cases and not in others, and correspondence is now proceeding with the Commissioner with a view, if possible, of securing uniformity. 1907? Parliament has decided against officers working seven days a week where it can be avoided. FEDERAL CAPITAL SITE.",18

Heliographic copies of the plans mentioned in the reports were placed before the House, but the plans have never been reproduced for circulation amongst members.

Mr Crouch was informed on 14th January, 1908, that the work would be put in band the following week. By this it was meant that the pegging out of the line would be commenced, not the construction. 4.

70,Mr FAIRBAIRN,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"Fawkner) [11.4] I think that we are all agreed that the Post and Telegraph Department, embracing as it does telephones and telegraphs, is conducted to the dissatisfaction of the people of Australia, including the members of the Ministry. Every ons appears to be more or less dissatisfied witli the management of this most important Department. I believe that we are also more or less 0 agreed that the mismanagement is due to the fact that it is conducted from a politi T cal and not from a business point of view.. For a very great many years I have held the view that all Government Departmentsdealing with commerce ought to be managed as nearly as possible on the lines of private, enterprise. For a long period the railways of Victoria were under the management of a been Minister, and we had great mismanagement. The annual deficit on their working amounand ted to a most serious sum, and the railways still in arrears to the extent of, I think, Â£7,000,000. At last the community resolved to do away with the political mani f in agement of the railways, anrl so they werethe placed under the control of a Board of Commissioners. Fortunately, Victoria secured in its Chief Commissioner a very able man, and the railways are now conducted as nearly as we can ever expect them to be on business lines.

79,Mr FAIRBAIRN,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"That is not a bit of good, because we are all the same in that regard.

90,Mr FAIRBAIRN,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"No ; I do not for moment believe that any member of the Committee would wish that, but we are apt to give our constituents the benefit of the doubt. If the Postmaster-General were faced with the fact that as a business man in managing his Department he would have to sink or swim, according to the success of his enterprise, he would have a very ' considerable inducement to do what would be likely to make it succeed. He would follow the course he suggests in the tion I have made from the Age, and would establish these telephone exchanges where they are required and would pay, and not where they would benefit only a handful of people ",21
91,Mr WEBSTER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,The honourable member does not mean to say that the Postmaster General would be guilty of that kind of thing ?,22

95,Mr FAIRBAIRN,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"I admit that if I were conducting the Department as a private enterprise I certainly would, but I do not believe that the Post and Telegraph Department should be run entirely on the lines which would be adopted if it were a private enterprise. I do, however, say that we should follow those lines as closely as possible, and should, as far as possible, eliminate the influence of political pressure.",22
96,Mr MCDOUGALL,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,Does the honourable member believe that social gossip should be allowed on public telephones?,22
97,Mr FAIRBAIRN,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"That is too deep a question for me. I hope that before long we shall see the management of this Department in the hands of some kind of permanent head. As a business man who has been fairly successful, I make the suggestion that it should put under the management of Commissioners. We should have a Commissioner in charge in each of the States, who might! be! the head of the Department in his State. Then I think that Commissioners should be required to meet once a year at some centre, which need not aiways be the same, to discuss thoroughly the work of the Department. Their meeting should be held before the Estimates are framed, and each Commissioner should submit the estimates of expenditure required in his State.",22
98,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,On e would require to be in charge of the Department for some little time before he could carry out a reform of that sort.,22
99,Mr FAIRBAIRN,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"I quite sympathize with the Postmaster-General. The honorquotaable gentleman is only human, and I have to admit that he has done very good work indeed since he has been in charge of the Department. No one could have worked harder or better, and I certainly have no wish to attack him in any way. My contention is that it is impossible to satisfactorily and successfully carry on the work of this Department when the responsible head of it is continually changing. That is a defect in the system which I think we should try toremedy'. My suggestion as a business man is that we should appoint a Commissioner for each State, that once a year, before the framing of the Estimates, the Commissioners should be brought together, and that each should be asked to submit his estimate of expenditure required in his State. The Minister would then go through the estimates recommended, and afterwards submit them to Parliament.  done now.",22
100,Mr FAIRBAIRN,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"What is done now is somewhat different. According to the scheme I propose,- each State Commissioner would be a responsible man.  master-General.",22
101,Mr FAIRBAIRN,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"I do not think so. Under the present system it appears .to me that the Deputy Postmasters-General have not sufficient responsibility, and have to refer nearly everything to head-quarters.",22
102,Mr CHANTER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,They are invested with very extensive powers ,22
103,Mr FAIRBAIRN,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"Then they do not appear to be willing to exercise them. I believe that with a Commissioner in charge in each State, and a meeting of the whole of the Commissioners at least once a year to discuss the whole position, we should secure better management of the affairs of the Department. Under existing conditions every one is dissatisfied j the Ministhe ter admits political pressure, and the Department is in a state of disorganization. One can hardly go near a telephone without becoming nervous.",22
104,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,The honourable member will admit that even the telephones have improved recently.,22
105,Mr FAIRBAIRN,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"-Yes , I think that they are decidedly better than they used to oe, and the Minister certainly deserves pra.se-for his energy. I that the public dissatisfaction in connection with the telephone service is entirely to the fault of the telephone operators never think of accusing a large body' people of being less worthy than any large class, though perhaps .I sometimes use died, and more will be remedied in ?h unparliamentary language at the telephone. It is the system that is really to blame, and the fault, in my opinion, is due to the nior^th frequent changes in the responsible of the Department. I have not Been member of the Federal Parliament for very many months, and yet, since I was elected, there have been two Postmasters General It should not be forgotten that the Post and lelegraph Department is really a commercial department, making a certain charge for the delivery of letters and telegrams.

110,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"I hope by the means which we are. at present adopting to be able when the Estimates, twelve months hence, are presented to give an' approximate balance, showing the profit and loss in connection with each of the branches of the Department. Honourable members will see at once that it can only be an approximate estimate, when I say that in many of the offices, not excluding the general post offices, there are men who are for a few minutes at the telephones, a few minutes at the telegraph branch, and a few minutes selling, postage stamps. Their services are divided amongst the various branches. The cost of such services can only be calculated approximately, but at any rate every effort will be put forth to present a statement that will show as nearly as possible the position of each of the branches of the Department under the control of the Postmaster-General.",24
111,Mr JOHNSON,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"T t will be a difficult matter to divide up the duties, especially where one man does all the business of an office himself.",24
112,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"It will be difficult in.deed. I had a long conversation with the' honourable member for North Sydney, who for business'knowledge is not to be excelled. He admitted frankly that the difficulties presented from a practical point of view were great, and that the statement would have to be only approximate, but he thought that if we could begin on the lines suggested and agreed upon, it might lead to the achievement of a result that every business man in this House desires. With regard to the statement of the honourable member for Fawkner, that I knew a large number of centres where successful and paying telephone exchanges might be established, I say that so long as we attempt to conduct the business of the Post Office by trying to take all capital expenditure out of the year's revenue, and to do all the work that is necessary in the one year, charging it to the receipts of that year, it will be quite impossible for me to carry out my ideas. No business firm tied up in that way could possibly expand.",24
113,Mr SAMPSON,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,And the country districts are' suffering accordingly.,24
114,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"I think I shall be able to show that the country districts are being granted greater and greater facilities, and that those facilities are being availed of in a most striking way.",24

117,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"I cannot enter into an ' academical discussion as to the relationship of town and country. I recognise that what the honourable member says is perfectly correct, but I have to deal with the matter from a practical business point of view. I must recognise that my great business centre and source of revenue is in the cities and the larger towns, while that revenue, or a very large proportion, of it, is expended in affording additional facilities to the country districts.",24
118,Sir JOHN FORREST,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"For the most part, the country districts pay their way, do they not?",24
119,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"No , not by a long way. I shall show that we are losing an additional Â£ 1 0 , 0 0 0 this year on country mail services alone, over and above what we have lost on previous years.",24
120,Sir JOHN FORREST,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,I thought the honourable member was talking about telephones and telegraphs.,24

I quite realise that there might be a relaxation in that regard, and I will do my best to bring it about. I was about to say that it is quite impossible to take the ordinary capital expenditure-a huge sum such as is necessary-and spend it in the one year out of revenue, and do anything like the progressive and reproductive work that should be done in a new and expanding country like the Commonwealth.",24
123,Mr WILKS,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"The honourable member will have to construct works out of loan money, as the Railway Commissioners do.",24
124,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"No . I db not propose to detain the Committee by indicating schemes that might be adopted nor those which I will submit af a later stage. I refer to this phase of the question in order to show, in 'the first place, that I have given the matter earnest consideration, and secondly, to point out the very great difficulty with which we are confronted in connection with the Department. It was that which I had in mind when I spoke on the occasion to which my honourable friend the member for Fawkner has referred. I had in mind the fact that there are in States like Queensland a number of centres where the Deputy Postmaster-General could, and would now, if the capital were at his disposal, establish exchanges ; where he could and would establish exchanges, in country districts, on lines that would give farmers telephones at a cost of ro^d. per week, three or four men dividing the cost of the service. But under present conditions we are unable to do this. The Treasurer has made great advances out of the Treasurer's advance account to enable me to do much of this kind of work, but the resources at our disposal are entirely inadequate to meet the demands of the Department for increased facilities. Mr J, H . CATTS - And yet we are turning surplus revenue to the States.",24
125,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"Quite so; but my honourable friend will admit that the Post and Telegraph Department is not responsible for that arrangement. as briefly as possible some interesting and telling facts in connection with this greatDepartment-fact s which, I venture to think, are not within the knowledge of many honourable members, and of which the public outside certainly know nothing.",25
126,Mr FRAZER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,I think that we ought to have a quorum to hear these interesting facts. [Quorum formed.],25
127,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"For the first financial year after the establishment of Federation - the year ended 30th June, 1902-the total revenue of the Department was ,Â£2,372,861, while for the year ended 30th June, 1907, the revenue amounted to Â£ 3 , 1 3 0 , 0 3 4, an increase in five years of Â£ 7 5 7 , 1 7 3. In other words, there was ah average increase of over Â£ 1 5 0 , 0 0 0 per annum, notwithstanding that during the five years reductions in charges involving a. loss of revenue of over Â£ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum were made by way of concessions to the public of the Commonwealth. For thefinancial year ended 30th June, 1902, the ordinary expenditure of the Department was Â£2,430^645 , while the expenditure on new works and buildings which, under State control, was usually charged to loan funds, but which, under the Commonwealth, is provided out of revenue, amounted to .Â£37,149, making a total expenditure-includin g payment of arrears 1 from previous years-of Â£ 2 , 4 6 7 , 7 9 4 for the year, or Â£ 9 4 ) 9 3 3 in ' excess of the revenue receipts. For the financial year ended 30th June, 1907, however, the ordinary expenditure of the Department was Â£ 2 , 6 8 9 , 9 9 0 , while the expenditure for new works and buildings which, as I have stated, was provided for under the States' regime out of loan funds, amounted to Â£ 2 7 5 , 7 8 3, making a total expenditure for the year of Â£ >9 5>773> or Â£ 1 6 4 , 2 6 1 less than the 2 6 receipts. In other words, for the financial year ended 30th June, 1902, the total expenditure of the Department exceeded the revenue for the year by Â£ 9 4 , 9 3 3 , whereas for the financial year ended 30th June, 1907, the revenue collected exceeded the total expenditure of the Department by no less than. Â£1:64,261",25
128,Mr HEDGES,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"Does that allow for interest on buildings and telegraph lines? re- Mr Mauger - The revenue collected last year exceeded the total expenditure of the Department by Â£164,261-a n amount which it is thought would be sufficient to provide practically 3 per cent, interest on Let me give the value of the transferred properties, of the Department. It will thus be seen that in a period of five years the Department has bettered its financial position to the extent of Â£ 2 5 9 , 1 9 4 per annum, notwithstanding a loss of revenue, amounting to over Â£ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum, involved in granting to the public many reductions on the charges made when the Department was under State control for postal and telegraph services. That is the position today, notwithstanding also that the expenditure for new works and buildings, amounting for the five years to no less Shan Â£ 8 7 7 , 6 9 5 , has been defrayed out of revenue, and that an immense amount of additional expenditure has been entailed upon the Department in connection with Ocean and Inter-State postal services, the Pacific cable guarantee, the granting of additional postal, telegraphic, and telephonic facilities to the public, the consequent growth of expenditure to provide for those additional services and the staff necessary to carry on the Department, and the payment of a higher remuneration to a large bodv of officials. The minimum wage provisions of the Act alone have involved in respect of this Department, an additional expenditure in five years, of over Â£ 1 9 0 , 0 0 0 . That was a just provision to make, and it had to be met. It will be seen that the Department has made steady progress from the point of view of revenue; and that although it is providing for new works and buildings out of revenue,- it is earning sufficient at 'the present time to pay practically 3 per cent, on the transferred properties, valuing those properties at Â£6,000,000.",25
129,Mr WEBSTER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,It has done this at the expense of efficiency and public concharges venience.,26
130,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"I claim, and shall of prove, that the Department is just as effitrunk ciently conducted, today as ever it - was, and that public facilities have been creased. I shall show that when classithe fication was made the Public Service missioner reported that there wejre 108 excess officers in the service, and that all the Departments had been, so arranged that 'they were manned up to. the strength necessary.",26
131,Mr HEDGES,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,What does the public say ?,26
132,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"I must deal with one annum. subject at a time. The public have so availed themselves of the facilities for communication afforded by the Department that the that ? growth of business has been abnormal, and extraordinary steps have been necessary .to cope with it. This has necessitated the employment of a large number of temporary hands, whom we are now making provision to replace by permanent hands, so that wise. sweating may cease, and the provisions of the Public Service Act may be observed.",26
133,Mr WEBSTER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,Why does the honourable member say that the increase of business universally. has been abnormal? Has it not been natural ?,26
134,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,I shall not'stop to defor fine terms. The increase of late 'has been abnormal in comparison with that of former years.,26
135,Mr WEBSTER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,The word is a good one to shelter behind.,26
136,Mr FOSTER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"At all events, the efforts to cope with the abnormal business might also have been abnormal.",26
137,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"Extraordinar y effortsthan have been made to cope with it, as I shall show. This Parliament has imposed a uniform charge for metropolitan and country centre telegrams which was a reduction 3d. on the old Victorian charge, has imafrom posed a uniform charge of od. for telegrams within a State, whereas, in five States, the charge was is., and has made other concessions. The concession in fees for private bags and boxes involved an of immediate loss of Â£2,500 per annum; the reduction in charges on Inter-State money orders from is. to 6d. per Â£ 5 . involved an immediate loss of Â£4,000 per annum; the reduction in the postage of letters to the United Kingdom, an immediate loss of Â£9,000 per annum; the abolition of the Inter-State poundage on postal notes, an immediate loss of Â£500 per annum; the adoption of uniform terminal and transit on cable business, an immediate loss of Â£1,3,000 per annum; the abolition charges for the use of certain telephone lines, an immediate loss of Â£5,000 per annum; the. abolition of cable charges inon telegrams to and from Tasmania and mainland, entailing upon the DepartComment a pavment of Â£5,600 per annum ; and the'reduction of charges for the use of - telephone trunk lines and slot telephones, an immediate loss of Â£2,000 per annum. A further concession was given to the public under the toll system, whereby business men in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, and Adelaide, can obtain an exclusive service of 1,000 calls per half-year for Â£ 5 per",26
138,Mr WEBSTER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,What was the loss on,26
139,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"Althoug h there was an immediate loss, there has since been a large increase in the receipts. The result has proved the wisdom of every one of the concessions which I have mentioned to be",26
140,Mr WEBSTER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"It would have been still better to follow the rational practice of other countries, and apply the toll system",26
141,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"I have had printed, the convenience of honourable members, a statement of the concessions granted to the public, and the benefits given to the officers of the Department since Federation, and while there are still many serious grievances to be remedied,' while much overtime has been worked, and leave not granted, a study of this document will show that our public servants are better off they were under State control, and that the conditions of the public service are better than exist under the regime of any of the States. The reduction of the of charge for the use of public telephones 3d. to i d . per call was followed by great increase of business. In New South Wales the calls increased from 330,000 per annum to 1,245,000 per annum, which gave an increase in revenue over Â£1,000. That abnormal increase in business could not be anticipated. There has been a similar increase in the demand for private telephones. I have not time to read to honourable members the mass of detail which I have collected to show how greatly the business of the Department has expanded; but by way of additional illustration, let me say that in 1900 the number of telegrams transmitted in Victoria was 1,818,000, and in 1907 2,491,000, while the revenue increased from Â£103,000 to Â£131,000, notwithstanding the reduction in charges. The number of private bags and boxes in use has increased from 996 to 2,370 during the same period. The number of letters, postcards, & c , passing through the post-office for the year 1906 was 530,821,316, our correspondence per capita being now equal to that of Great Britain, and exceeding that of Germany, France, Holland, Belgium, and even of America. As for the circulation of newspapers, the Commonwealth rate is 25.20 per cent., while that of Germany is 23, that of France 36, and that of Holland 41. In 1902-3 the revenue for the Commonwealth was Â£2,404,730, an increase of 1.34 per cent, on that of the previous year; and next year showed an increase of Â£105,473, while for the year 1906-7 there is an increase of Â£304,726, or 10.79 P The expenditure has not increased in the same ratio. In 1902-3 it was Â£101,052 larger than that of the previous year, while for 1906-7 the increase on tihe year before was Â£181,109, or 6.50 per cent. Therefore, while our income increased last year by 10 per cent., our expenditure increased by only 6 per cent. In the Additional Estimates whichwill be brought down today, the Treasurer has provided a large sum, so that temporary hands may be replaced by permanent officers. As the revenue of the Department is earned mainly by the personal exertions of its officers, it is reasonable to maintain that any substantial development of the revenue must necessarily be followed by a proportionate addition due to the permanent staff. This has' not taken place during the last four years, which accounts largely for the heavy demands now made on the financial year 1907-8. In my opinion, it is essential that the permanent ''Staffs in the severial States shall be adequately strengthened to bring their working hours within the statutory limit, to do away as much as possible with the employment of temporary hands, and to allow officers to enjoy the concessions, leave, and other privileges to whichthey are entitled under the Public Service Act. t recognise that there has been ground for complaint, especially on the part of telegraphists and sorters; but I have endeavoured to meet the difficulty by the employment of temporary hands, and hope, with the aid of the provision now made by the Treasurer, to appoint a sufficient numbei of additional permanent hands to get rid of the congestion and trouble. But while we have heard a great many complaints about decentralization and the congestion of work in the Department, I would remind honourable members that the same complaints are being made against the administration of the Imperial Post Office. I ask them to listen to this remarkable speech uttered by Mr Austin Chamberlain, in April, 1903, when Financial Secretary to the Treasurer and Representative of the Postmaster-GeneralIn a great administration like this, there must be decentralization, and how dimcult it is to decentralize, either in the post-office or the army, when working under constant examination in question and answer in this House, no honourable member who has not had experience of official life can easily realise.

He simply says that he has' been unable to move, because the Treasurer .would not provide him with the necessary funds. Surely he is' an independent .man, and could have told his colleague that he must have the funds. to make the Department pay, and he should have told the Prime Minister that if 'the money were not placed at his disposal he must decline to be at the head of a service which was ruining itself by extravagance and incompetence, and simply because he was unable to establish services which would pay, as against those which could not be expected to pay - If we had a strong man at the head of - t!he Department the position would be very different, but while we have at its head a man who will knuckle under, and go on bended knee as soon as he is spoken to by some one higher in authority, we shall have nothing done. An independent man with some administrative capacity, and with the desire to do something for his country, and to make the service over which he presides a success, would be firm, and get what he wanted from the Treasurer, and what is more he would very soon come to the rethe front as a man of some ability. The Postmaster-General, has stated that he intends to go in for decentralization. That If result would be obtained if the service were municipalized. Let it be placed in commission, and then we s'hould have complete decentralization, and men who could be spoken to and would be respon : sible for making their departments pay, just as the water, railway, and other municipalized services pay. Every officer in a subordinate position would, on showing merit, be brought to the front, and those who were not fitted for their positions would be retirecl, as many of 'them should be. The heads who are expected to teach the juveniles in the services would be called upon to understand their duties, or else they would be cashiered. There should lje a commission to inquire into the question of buildings. Of late the buildings have been more adapted t'o the work for which 1 they are required. But if we had a system by which the architecture for the different classes of offices might be regulated the present difficulty would be overcome. That is a matter rather of detail than otherwise. The policy which the Minister is going to adopt is ' a continuation of the present policy, notwithstanding all its defects, with the addition of what he calls decentralization* If the same evil should prevail under a system of decentralization the position would be no better than it is. The Minister has stated that every Deputy Postmaster General has power to act, but that he will It was his duty not. . This is a matter on which I suppose the Minister could have a few words to say. He has the authority to say that these officers must exercise their power, and that to that extent there should be decentralization. But it appears that he is unable to act. He is advised that he should nof act, and, what, is more, he says that when somebody told him that he ought to dismiss the officers in question, he said, "" No . "" When he was reminded that Parliament would not countenance their inaction, he said, "" No, Parliament would have the present system ,."" 1 What an idea to express ! If Parliament were of my way of thinking it would demand an immediate change, and the Minister who would not enforce its will would not be retained here for ten minutes. He would have to act, and see that his officers did their duty, or call upon the proper authority to find a competent man to fill the leading position in each State. At some time, I . suppose, we shall have an opportunity to consider my proposal to place' the Post and Telegraph Department in commission. If the Labour Party be true to its policy it must support the municipalization of the service, as it is a part of their programme. In other places, I recommended this change long before I entered this Parliament. I shall see that the members of the Labour Party have an opportunity of casting a vote on the question at some future time.",33

My second reason for not desirilig to review the position very extensively this morning is the Minister's statement in regard to the possibilities of the Committee of the Cabinet. must recognise that his admission that the appointment of a Cabinet Committee has been found necessary to review the administration of his Department, is certainly a heavy denunciation of the conditions existing therein.",34

Mr ' FRAZER - In all probability the members of the Cabinet Committee will find that a great deal of work must be done before they can understand the position of affairs, and undertake the responsibility of advising the Government how to remove some of the undoubted disabilities under which the public suffer. Th'e admission made by the Postmaster-General in regard to the possibility of the Cabinet Committee being engaged upon the inquiry for a very long time, undoubtedly suggests the reflection that it would have been more satisfactory to the service generally, even though the inquiry might have occupied a little longer time, to .appoint a Select Committee of this House,, which could have entered thoroughly, and more independently, into various-questions. If the Cabinet Committee are going to effectively consider the many objections and complaints which have been levelled against the Department, and which are being nursed by honourable members, that inquiry must make a serious inroad upon the time which they ought to devote to the administration of their own Departments. All the statements which the Minister can obtain from Postmasters-General on the other side of the world in regard to the difficulty of adminisMy first tering, a Department of this kind, will not convince honourable members that things are not in an unsatisfactory state here. At the same time, I do not enter into the general condemnation which some honourable members have made of the present condition of the Federal service. In my judgment, the Â£>eople of Western Australia, for in-' stance, have benefited very considerably from the federalization of the Postal and Telegraphic Departments. I believe Ehat T think he they are now getting many services which they would not have been able to secure without .a large expenditure of borrowed money if the Department had remained under ' State control. Although I disagree with the regulation requiring a guarantee in regard to certaim telephones, and regret the system of playing fast and loose with the regulation after it had been approved of by this House, still I think that a considerable effort is being made to meet country necessities in regard to these conveniences. I strenuously object to the strict enforcement of this provision in the case of applications from country districts when, in the case of applications from metropolitan and suburban districts, it is relaxed or entirely abolished, - as it was in the case of the Melbourne-Sydney telephone, which has not realized the anticipations formed) in connection with it. We can hope to do very little good in discussing these Estimates when ten months of the financial year have passed, ancl when we have an opportunity to discuss Estimates in the ordinary way, Estimates. I shall have something more to say on this subject.",34
244,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,I have committed to writing the opinion that the inspectors almost invariably - under-estimate the revenue likelv to be received from country offices.,35
245,Mr FRAZER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"I am glad 'that the Minister is taking that view of the matter, because in a State of magnificent distances like Western Australia, it is found, very difficult to convince an unsympathetic official that mining camps are likely to be permanent. Many offices that have been secured only as the result of persistent hammering away by parliamentary representatives have been found to give very much more satisfactory returns than were estimated by the inspectors who reported upon the applications. There are one or two matters affecting Western Australian officers of the Department that I should like to bring under notice - This is the first occasion on which I have referred to such matters in this House, although I am not going to say that I have not frequently had occasion to bring the position of officers under the notice of the Department. have studiously avoided taking up the time of Parliament with the grievances of public servants until it has been demonstrated that they will not be remedied by application to their Departments. I wish to say that Western Australian officers are not receiving the treatment which I think they are entitled to receive, and I again bring under notice the position of officers located in out- Western Australia. side districts - There are stations in Western Australia so fa r removed from any large centre of population that the cost of living 'is abnormally high. Generally speaking, the cost of living is very much higher in Western Australia than in any of the other States. The only State in which it can be said to be nearly as high is Queensland. Officers stationed in outside places in Western Australia, do not receive the consideration in the matter of living allowances which they should receive at the hands of the Department.",35
246,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,The honourable member will allow me to say that the Department has no control whatever over the matter referred to. The Public Service Commissioner fixes all allowances.,35
247,Mr FRAZER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"That makes it only the more necessary that we should have some expression of opinion from the Minister as to the view he takes of what I believe to"" be the excessive exercise of authority by the Public Service Commissioner. members of Parliament we are debarred [3 APRIL, 1908.] Estimates. 10151 from approaching the Public Service Commissioner in such a matter, but this House should not be debarred from having the - last say in connection with any matter affecting the public servants under the control of this Parliament. I am not prepared to say that the control of the Public Service through the Commissioner has been altogether unsatisfactory, bufj I do say - that there should be such a review of his powers as would enable the responsible Minister and' Parliament to be supreme in a matter of this kind.",35
248,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,That would be returning to the old system of political patronage.,35
249,Mr FRAZER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"No , it would not. I am not in favour of a reversion to the conditions existing prior to Federation in connection with the management of the Public Service in many of the States. But, while giving the Public Service Commissioner all reasonable authority, there should be a point at which Ministers and Parliament might interfere to do justice - when it is demonstrated that a real grievance exists, I and is not remedied.",35
250,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"If the Public Service Commissioner will not do justice, he should not be where he is.",35
251,Mr FRAZER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"I .sayi that, in my opinion, under the rule of the Public Service Commissioner injustice has been done to many officers of this Department in The cost of living in Western Australia MS not higher now than it was five or six years ago, and yet for five or six years the Public Service Commissioner insisted that the conditions of living were the same in Perth as in Melbourne. Ultimately he visited Perth, and on his return to Melbourne made a recommendation that an allowance of 5 per cent, should be given to officers in Perth and the surrounding districts on the ground that the conditions in Perth were not the same as those in Melbourne, or generally in the Eastern States. Any man who resides in Western Australia must be aware that there are many circumstances which make the cost of living in that State very much higher than it is in Melbourne, and certainly 5 per cent, does not represent the difference. The Public Service Commissioner admitted the facts after five years, and recommended an extra allowance. But the injustice to which I refer is found ih the fact, first, that it was delayed five years, and, second* As that whilst the Public Service Commissioner 10152 Estimates. . [REPRESENTATIVES.] has recommended this extra allowance on the ground that the cost of living in Perth is higher than in Melbourne he has made no provision in the case of outside districts in Western Australia to cover the extra cost of living in those districts as compared with the cost of living in Perth. Mr DUGA LD THOMSON - Are the officers referred to getting less than they did the service of the State?",35
252,Mr FRAZER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"The Western Australian officers as a body haye not had their, position improved as a result of Federal control. I am not prepared they - are worse off than they were under the State Government, but I am prepared and more. to say that their position has not been improved, and that they have received less under Federation than have officers in the other States. I should like to ask the Minister whether, seeing that it is that officers in Perth are entitled to an extra allowance of 5 per cent, as compared with officers in Melbourne, he does not think that, in all fairness the officers on Australia. .the gold-fields in Western Australia should not receive some extra allowance to the extra cost of living in those districts compared with the cost of living",36
253,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"My personal opinion is decidedly in accordance with what the honopinions orable member has said, but I have no say Tariff. in the matter. Personally, I believe that the conditions with which public officers in the case which I have been putting. remote parts of Australia have to contend should be recognised in as liberal way possible.",36
254,Mr FRAZER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"I am glad to hear that expression of opinion from the Minister. I shall take another opportunity of sugprovision gesting a means of overcoming the difficonditions culty to which I have referred should Public Service Commissioner adhere to his present decision. Having received such assurance from the Minister, I cannot reaThe sonably ask for more.",36
255,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"It is only fair that should say that the Public Service Comhis missioner, at a function held on Saturday night, explained that he had made his basis the conditions existing all over the Commonwealth, and that he felt that giving 5 per cent, extra allowance to offiadvisable cers in Perth and the same in Kalgoorlie, tion. he was doing all that could reasonably expected.",36
256,Mr FRAZER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"The trouble is that is not giving the extra 5 per cent, allowance to officers at Kalgoorlie; because officers at Kalgoorlie always had what Estimates. called a Gold-fields Allowance as a recognition of the difference in the conditions existing in Kalgoorlie as compared with Perth. The Public Service Commissioner has givenofficials, in Perth a 5 per cent, allowance on the ground that the cost of living is 5 per cent, dearer there than it is in Melbourne; he has not added the in same extra allowance to those previously enjoyed by officers at Kalgoorlie.",36
257,Mr HUME COOK,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"The honourable member contends that the difference in the cost of living between Kalgoorlie and Melta say that bourne is 10 per cent. Mr Frazer. - Yes , it is 20 per' cent,",36
258,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,An independent authority recently estimated it at 17^ per cent.,36

Another important matter to which I wish to direct the Minister's attentionis the denying civil rights under certain to officers of the Commonwealth. the A man employed in the Public Service should be entitled to exercise his civil funcan tions in common with every other citizen. Minister, who claims tp hold democratic views, must hold that that embargo I should be removed.

275,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"Franklin) [2.22]. - A discussion on the Estimates rarely has the desired effect, but since a Committee bf the Cabinet has been appointed to inquire into the working of the Postmastera General's Department I propose to bring forward two or three matters which ought I join issue with some honourable members who speak rather harshly of the present administration of the Department. The present Postmaster General, so far as Tasmania generally is concerned, has done more to decentralize the work of the Department thandid all his predecessors - That being my experience, I think it only fair to mention it. The present system in regard to the extension of the telephone service into outlying districts is also a decided improvement upon that which was in vogue a few months ago. There is, however, a great deal more to be done. The trouble relating to the Department at. present arises largely from the centralization of the work in Melbourne. It is said that efforts are being made to decentralize it, but I intend presently to' cite a case which clearly shows that, despite all efforts in that direction, the protests of local officers are overridden by the Central Administration and by the Public Service Commissioner. ' From time to time questions have been put in this House with regard to the promotion of Mr. E. A. Blakney, an officer in the Hobart General Post Office. The Postmaster General has laid on the table the whole of the papers relating to the case, and-1 invite honourable members to read the correspondence, most of which is in the name of Mr. Betheras. If they do, they will find that the Commissioner has deliberately disregarded the recommendations of the Deputy Postmaster-General and the Deputy Inspected in Tasmania. Mr Blakney, a junior officer, was promoted from one grade to another over a number of officers who were his seniors. So far as I have been able to gather from the recommendations of the Postmaster-General and the Deputy Inspector in Tasmania, Mr Blakney is a thoroughly deserving officer; the correspondence shows that even those over whom he has been promoted have not a word to say against him. Two clerks are employed at the counter of the Hobart General Post Office, and the Deputy Postmaster-General recommended them for preferment. It was decided that one of the two clerks should be promoted to another class, and when it was suggested that Blakney should be chosen for promotion, Mr Bichard, the Deputy Inspector in Tasmania, telegraphed to the Public Service CommissionerI recommend only such officers, .Customs Department and Postmaster-General's Department, as report on 28th February last. Re vacancy class 4 will have to be settled. E. A. Blakney or G. T. Creswell I do not consider entitledwill probably be other officer. Mr MCWilliams. That was the report of theinspector in charge to whom the Commissioner is supposed to look for suggestions in regard to promotions in the service in Tasmania. To that telegram Mr MCLachlan repliedThe Fublic Service Commissioner certifies that there is no officer available, senior to the one above-named, as capable' of satisfactorily performing the duties of the position. In the office at the time there were several senior officers who had already discharged those duties. I come now to a further telegram from the Deputy Inspector to - the Public Service CommissionerE. A. Blakney is not senior nor most competent officer for selection. Cannot this be stopped, as it places Blakney over number of others best entitled. Notwithstanding that report, Mr Blakney. was appointed to the position. I come now to a protest made by the officers over whom he was promoted. In their petition they (sayHe was not the "" senior competent officer,"" but was junior to twenty-five officers in the Clerical Division-as indicated by the list hereto - attached-and also junior to twelve officers who are in the. General Division, and who retained clerical status when classified. It was further pointed out that the services of any one of those officers were available. The petitioners show that' the procedure followed in the States was entirely at variance from that usually followed in the office, and they ""go on to sayThat the promotion, of Mr Blakney to the same position, but with a higher classification, gives him a better status than is held by us who hitherto have been his seniors, and some of whom have for years discharged the very same duties. I know of my personal knowledge that the incident has created intense dissatisfaction; not only in Hobart, but throughput the Tasmanian service, there being officers in Launceston, senior to Mr Blakney, who have been doing similar work, whose claims were not taken into consideration. The Public Service Commissioner can know nothing of the individual - capacity, of the great bulk of the officers of the"" service, ancl yet, in this case, he promoted a man over the heads of his seniors, in - spite of the protests of the Deputy Postmaster General and Deputy Inspector for Tasmania. It is idle to think that officers will give the attention to their duties which is expected from them if they are permitted to feel that the recommendations of those above them, who alone are competent - to judge of their fitness and energy, will be disregarded by Mr Betheras and the Com-, missioner, sitting in Melbourne. could not be a more glaring instance of the abuse of centralization than that to which I am calling attention. At the present time there is a general complaint against the administration of the Post and Telegraph Department, and Ministers have made a mistake in appointing a Cabinet Committee to investigate them. Neither Parliament nor the country will be satisfied with that investigation, and I suggest to the Minister that it would be well to allow the appointment of a Committee such as that of which notice has been given.",37

However, that is another matter, the discussion of which I shall postpone to a later period. The Postmaster-General quoted authorities this morning to show what he called the f o l l y of attempting to investigate postal administration by means of a Select Committee or a Royal Commission; but I hope to be able to give evidence later that such investigations are actually being pursued in Great Britain with much advantage to the service and the public.

290,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,I admit that there are weaknesses which ought to be removed.,40
291,Mr WILKS,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"B y questions day by day, and by speeches on Supply, these weaknesses in the administration have been placed before the country; and to-dav we have had the amusing spectacle of a Minister rushing in early in the debate to explain matters, thus showing that hostile criticism was anticipated. The usual custom is for a Minister to.waJt until most 1 honourable members have dealt with the Estimates of his Department, but today the Postmaster-General early applied a lubricant to the overheated bearings. I have no intention of making an attack'on the honourable gentleman, who has been only five months in office, while the weaknesses in the administration have been growing ever since the inauguration of Federation. There have been many We changes in the political head of this Department, and each Minister has ""been desirous of bringing about popular reforms, so as to prove himself indispensable as an administrator. In the old pre-Federal days it used to be said that "" the.fool of the family "" was invariably sent by the Cabinet to administer the Post and Telegraph Department; but that cannot be sa.'d of the present Minister. The only thing that can be said is that rhe present Government have placed tha Minister with the biggest halo hi the position of Postmaster-General ; but St. Samuel tries to do too many things, and sometimes, I think, he rather oversteps the bounds that s ought to be observed by a gentleman in his position. We know that, with that humanity which distinguishes him, he is anxious that all sweating and other evils should be abolished, and, though he may be able to visit some suburban post-offices, he cannot visit every office in Australia. The Postmaster-General ought to have under him officers able to detect and - rectify weaknesses; a Minister has quite enough . to do if he moulds the policy of his Department, and sees that it is carried out. It is not the duty of a Postmaster-General or any other Minister to exercise the functions of an inspector; he is not trained to such work, or, if he be full y qualified as an inspector, he is not in his proper place as Minister. I know, however, that the The Post- Postmaster-General is besieged with invitations to pay visits to various places, and feels that he cannot refuse them. Not desiring to have even a dint in his halo, he is most anxious to gratify every request ; but that is not the position a Postmaster-General should occupy. The cry for centralization ' has grown up during the last fouror five years. In the early days of Federation, those who clamoured for decentralization were small in number; but today nearly every honourable member is in favour of the principle. The Postmaster-General's admissions and the document he read today proved that the whole Department is, in his own words, in a state of hopeless muddle; and there could be no severer condemnation. reminds me of Stephen Blackmore. in Dickens' Hard Times, who thought that all the world was a muddle.",40
292,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,I scarcely think that is correct.,41
293,Mr WILKS,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"At any rate, I think that I am practically correct. Even if the Post"" master-General had Napoleonic ideas and powers of organization, he could scarcely have touched the fringe of the work necessary, during the five months he has been in power. The Postmaster-General has called to his aid two colleagues to form a Committee of Inquiry, and I guarantee that it took him some little time to so overcome his jealousy as a Minister to seek' for this assistance. I hope that the Postmaster General will ever be jealous as to the administration of his Department, and not allow, any interference; because it is his place to devise a progressive policy, and to see that it is carried out. This Department is the biggest spending Department of ths Commonwealth, being responsible for some Â£3,000,000 per annum.",41
294,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"It is practically the only earning Department. Mx. WILKS - Quite so; and, with wise administration, it could be made a greater earning Department. I hope before long to see the Post and Telegraph Department in the hands of Commissioners, just as is the administration of most of the Australian railways. Of course, there must be a political head, but, at the same time, I am of the strong opinion that the Department ought to be administered by Commissioners. The Department, according to all accounts, is in a very similar position to that of the Australian Railways Departments before Commissioners were appointed; and my suggestion would in no way undermine the position of the Postmaster-General, but rather strengthen it. In the case of the railways in Victoria and New South Wales, a lump sum, of, I believe, Â£ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 per month is voted to the Commissioners, who are responsible for the smooth running of the machine. I hope the remarks I made previously were not taken in a personal sense by the Postmaster-General.",41
295,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,The only interjection to which I might object is that in which Judkins was mentioned. ' [360],41
296,Mr THOMSON,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,What has Judkins to do with the Postal Department?,41
297,Mr WILKS,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"How can we keep an irrepressible man like Judkins out of anyHe thing? As a matter of fact, Judkins wears a halo which is many sizes too large, for the Pos.tmaster-General; and I sre the danger of too much Judkins' influence in the Department. It is absurd to observe in .the newspapers that the Postmaster General has been visiting suburban offices: for the purpose of inquiring into some weakness in the local business arranget ments. That is no work for a Minister of the Crown; and I am sure that the Treasurer, for instance, would leave his officers to report before taking any action. I can understand the humane object of the Postmaster-General, who is anxious for the welfare of the employees in his Department. The Postmaster-General can easily exceed his duty in looking after the welfare of the people under his charge. If he uses his mental faculties in devising an up-todate scheme for remedying the weaknesses that he has admitted, he will justify himself. I have one or two grievances which I wish to bring under the notice of the honourable gentleman. The first case is that of a contractor in New South Wales who undertook some construction work for the Department. He found that he could not obtain the timber that he required on a certain day, and he therefore telegraphed to his workmen in Svdney not to come up country. The telegram was not delivered. The oflicer who received it did not advise the contractor that, there being a public holiday in Sydney, the message could not be delivered. The consequence was that this contractor had to pay Â£ 7 for travelling expenses for his workmen from Sydney to Tamworth. He applied to the Department for a refund. They admitted that they were wrong, but the only redress they would make was to return him the 9CI. which he paid for the telegram. They refused to recoup him for his out-of-pocket expenditure. Of course, they sheltered themselves behind the provision that in accepting! a telegram the Department takes no responsibility. That is .quite right in the ordinary course of things; but surely when a contractor is put to expenditure because the Department does not advise him that it will be impossible to deliver a telegram they ought to recoup him for the loss thereby occasioned. The second case which I desire to bring under the notice of the Minister in this: An oflicial in a subordinate position in the central office, Sydney, was the subject of a complaint - by a fellow-officer. suspended, and an inquiry was made into the allegations. The result was that the complaint was not upheld, the suspension was removed, and the officer was exonerated. He is a very old officer of the Department, and does not occupy a highly paid position. Tn fact, he is employed in the stables. He was put to the expense of engaging a legal representative to appear before the Board of Inquiry, and this cost him Â£ 7 7s. Application has been made to recoup him the expenditure to which he was put, but the Department has refused to entertain the claim. I think it is a fair one, inasmuch as the charge against him was not sustained. Not being a man with a glib tongue, he did not feel competent to defend himself, and therefore was compelled to employ a legal representative. The Postmaster-General might make a note of the case with a view of seeing that, the officer receives fair treatment. matter which I desire to mention is the regulation issued by the Department in New South Wales granting officers leave on St. Patrick's dav. I do not care "" a tinker's continental "" whether St. Patrick's Dav, St. Andrew's Day. St. David's Dav, St. George's Day, or St. Kangaroo's Day is celebrated. The latter would appeal to me as an Australian most of all. about time Australia had a saint of her own, and St. Kangaroo .would do just about as well as St. Patrick, St. David, or St. George. As a matfer of fact, they are all myths. ' Sir JOHN FORREST - Oh !",41
298,Mr WILKS,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"The right honourable member fpr Swan is sufficiently well read to know that what. I am saying is correct. The myths may be very pleasant, but that does not alter the fact. The point that I wish to make' is that I see no reason why officers should be given leave on St. Patrick's day-especiall y in New South Wales, where there is not a processionwhen those who. belong to the military' forces are not allowed time off to devote themselves to military duties. them have been refused leave except on the payment of substitutes.",42
299,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,I have altered that.,42
300,Mr WILKS,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"The Minister must have altered it within the last week, then.",42
301,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,Withi n the last few hours.,42
302,Mr WILKS,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,It would be very interesting to know how much this granting of He was leave on the 17th March cost the Department.,42
303,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,The officers should be allowed off on public holidays.,42
304,Mr WILKS,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,St - Patrick's Day is not a proclaimed holiday in New South Wales.,42
305,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,I knew nothing about the matter personally.,42
306,Mr WILKS,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"The New South Wales officers, however, knew enough to, ask for the same holiday, as they were aware that the Victorian' officers were getting. It certainly is not in accordance with what ought to be that officers should be allowed off on St. Patrick's Day, whilst others are not permitted, without expense to themselves, to attend to what the Prime Minister calls the duties of fullcitizenship. I do not wish to deal with the Estimates generally. The Postmaster General has had sufficient astuteness to reAnother cognise and admit the deficiencies in his Department. I hope that the Cabinet Committee will do good. I am not very fond of Select Committees myself, as honourable members know. I hope to see the Postmaster-General become, not the humane "" St. Samivel,"" but a commercial Postmaster-General, full y seized of the importance of a sound policy, which will make It is more money for the Department and at the same time give an improved service to the public.",42
307,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"The Department cannot, apparently, keep pace with the demands made upon it.",42
308,Mr WILKS,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,The methods are too antiquated.,42
309,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"It is a question of pounds, shillings, and pence.",42
310,Mr WILKS,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"No , it is a question of : antiquated administration. The Postmaster-General admitted . that Mmself when he said that, whilst Deputy Postmasters-General were permitted by the regulations to do certain things, they shirked their responsibilities and sent matters on to the central office. That is the reason, he said, why the central staff Some of is clogged with business. That is an admission that the Deputy Postmasters General have been neglecting the observance of the regulations, and intensifying the harmful policy of centralization. I am one of those who believe that if the Postmaster-General of the Commonwealth - devotes himself to matters of policy he will be the most hard-worked member-of the Ministry. I have had two personal interviews Ayith| Postmasters-General in their office, once when the honourable member for Coolgardie occupied that position, and once during the regime of Mr Sydney Smith, formerly member for Macquarie. On each occasion I saw the Minister with a pile of papers in front of him. I thought it was a case of "" dressing the shop window "" to give the appearance of having an enormous amount of work to do. When these gentlemen tried to convince me that they went through all those papers, and examined before signingthem, I could hardly believe it. But still, if the Postmaster-General does his duty, ancl is desirous of making his Department up-to-date, so as to meet the growing requirements of the Commonwealth, he must necessarily be a very hard-workedman. I shall not detain the Committee further. I do not even intend to use the Additional Estimates for the purpose of making observations relative to the administration of the Department. I intend, as far as I can, to give fair play to the Cabinet Committee. I hope that good will result from their work. I - trust that the final result will be to put the Department under the management of Commissioners. No honourable member who has belonged to a Select Committee or a Royal Commission can have failed to observe how easy it is for those in authority to befog any number of men who are inquiring into departmental management. It is too much .to expect that departmental officers will allow a Committee to find out who is exactly responsible for anything that goes wrong. All that I can hope is that the Committee will find a means of clearing up various grievances, and will formulate an up-to-date scheme for the improvement of the Post and Telegraph service. Minister is fortunate in being able to get his Estimates through, as it appears that he will do. It shows the advantage of using the oil-can before the friction is revealed.",42
311,Mr FOSTER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"New England) I3.12]. - I feel, as previous speakers have done, that it is not desirable to take up the timeof theCommittee with the discussion of the details of the Postmaster-General's Estimates. But, as the representative of a country district, I am smarting on account of the want of action of the Department in coping with demands for new construction. It appears that the Department has been rather starved. It is admitted that [360]- 2 the demands upon it have been abnormal, especially in New South Wales.",43
312,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"Hear , hear. . Mr Foster - I fail to see how it is possible to keep pace with such a growth of business unless the Department is furnished with plenty of money. People are naturally dissatisfied, and have overwhelmed honourable members with complaints about the deficiencies of the service. Week in and week out, we have been urged to get this or that new telephone con. structed. In the nprthem districts of New' South Wales, Ave have been reduced to such a position, in regard to want of facilities for coping with the growing business, that people have had to pay double rates to get telegrams through at all. We have also been called upon to wait for three or four hours if we did not care to pay the double rates. In view of the fact that every - facility is given to the people in the cities, who have so many more facilities than have country folks, is it fair that the people in the country should be' treated in the manner I have described? Sometimes I have felt inclined to blame the Postmaster-. General, but after hearing many explanations, I am willing to attribute most of the blame to the want of money. I hope that in connection with the Additional Estimates a very vigorous construction policy will be foreshadowed, and I for one will be only too' willing to vote in the direction 1 of vastly increasing the amount to be spent by the Post and Telegraph Department I look at this matter from a business standpoint. If we go into the work effectively and provide the facilities, the construction has only to be done once, and it may be improved upon at a later period. Although we may feel the burden a little heavy for the time being, yet in future The years we shall reap a benefit. Let me cite a case to illustrate the slowness in the provision of facilities in the country. A few months ago the residents of a district in my electorate asked for the erection of a telephone wire betAveen Uralla and Ar midale, which are only twenty odd miles apart, and were told by the Department that it would cost some thousands of pounds. That seemed to me an absurd OA'er-estimate in view of the fact that the poles Avere already erected, and that it Avas proposed to erect the Avire along a railAvay line. There must be bungling of an unpardonable character in the Department when that sort of thing can happen.",43
313,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"I believe that the tendency is to over-estimate the cost, and to - under-estimate the incomein all the country cases.",44
314,Mr FOSTER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"That is the tendency, I think.",44
315,Mr MAHON,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,It is time that we got that admission from the Minister.,44
316,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,That is what I minuted.,44
317,Mr FOSTER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"Again , the Postmaster General has admitted that a very large number of temporary hands have been employed. There seems to be an injustice going on in the Department. ployes consider it is an injustice, and are squirming under it. I refer to the fact that - men are placed in offices temporarily, but are not given the salaries attached thereto. that practice will be abandoned. a man does the work of an office, it is very hard that he should not get the remuneration attached thereto. does a day's work as a miner, he gets a miner's pay, and that practice obtains in most directions under private enterprise. I am not one of those who would advocate the methods of private enterprise up to the hilt in running this Department. gard post offices, telephones, telegraphs, and railways as facilities that create other sources of revenue. I hope that the Post and Telegraph Department will not be starved in order to run it on a paying basis. Efficiency is what we require, even if it should cost a little more than we now - pay. The people who are served with those facilities are only too willing to contribute by taxation in other ways towards their up-keep ",44
318,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"We cannot have efficiency, if we employ 19,000 men for six months, ancl at the end of that period replace them with other men, who have to learn to do - the work.",44
319,Mr FOSTER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"I trust that as far as possible the system of giving temporary employment will be knocked on the head, in order to remedy the injustice which is now done. I find that this curious Department is so mismanaged that it allows telegraph repairers to finance their own expenses when sent abroad to do its work. Fancy a man who is drawing Â£ 2 or Â£ 3 a week ljeing sent off on an expedition in connection with which, perhaps, Â£ 1 0 or Â£ 1 2 out-of-pocket expenses will have to be defrayed straight away. I know of one case where the man in charge of the office was empowered to advance the money on account, and to charge it , but I know of another instance where a telegraph repairer was not granted a solitary penny. These cases suggest to my mind a very lax method of administration. I do not know whether to lay the blame upon the head Department in Melbourne or upon the branch Department in New South Wales. I am very much inclined to believe that the trouble originates with the local administration. Another evil method from which we are suffering is the undermanning of country post-offices. In the country disThe em- tricts the business has expanded so rapidly that the Department has not enlarged the staffs in order to meet the local requirements, and, therefore, the people are suffering in a wholesale way. I ask the PostI hope that master-General to consider whether it If would not be better to slightly overman the country offices.",44
320,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"Of course, the honourable If a man member, is acquainted with the routine through which I have to go before 1 can appoint even an assistant?",44
321,Mr FOSTER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"I admit that it is a very circumlocutory method, but surely a quicker one could be devised. From I re- what I can glean, there is a ridiculous want, of organization in the General Post Office at Sydney, and it is necessary to place at its head a strong man, who will see that justice is done to the employees. I recognise that the employees occupy most important positions. Whether they are on the lowest, the middle, or the top rung of the ladder, they should be treated as important servants of the State, ancl not as slaves - There is too great a tendency right through the Public Service to ignore the rights of the employees, and to sweat them. Let us properly finance the Department so that it can expedite its business a little more than it does, give additional facilities to those who go far out as pioneers to wrestle with all kinds of bad conditions, and treat the employees a little better than men are treated under private enterprise.",44
322,Mr SAMPSON,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"Wimmera) [3.22] - I admit that the Postmaster-General has made some herculean efforts to grapple with a very rapidly increasing business, but it roust be the common experience of honourable members, especially of those who represent country districts, that, so far, the Department has not succeeded in coping satisfactory with the demands of the people. I would urge upon the Minister the necessity of pushing on more speedily with thp country services. It has been advanced, I think very effectively, by the honourable member for Coolgardie, that one of the most potent means in the future to improve the conditions of country life will be a telephone line to almost every household. Under the present departmental methods, there is no reasonable chance of that service being provided with anything like the rapidity with which it should be done. I was very pleased to hear the Minister announce that he intended to reduce the 10 per cent, guarantee demanded from groups of people who applv for a telephone service in a country district. I hope that that exorbitant charge will be reduced very considerably. Judging from my own correspondence, and from interviews with the officers and the Minister, I believe that the Department is anxious to give greater postal facilities in the remote country districts. But, so far, my experience has been that too great a desire has been shown by the Department to establish those facilities on commercial principles. I have noticed a disposition on the part of officers to inflatethe cost of construction and to underestimate the probable revenue.",44
323,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"I am trying, as the honourable member knows, to get a cheaper kind of line constructed in the country districts. , Mr SAMPSON --That is correct. In my opinion, these services are rightly conducted by a State Department, and the great advantage which the whole community should derive from that method is that they can employ the financial strength of the State to assist, for developmental purposes, the remoter districts throughout the Continent. That should be recognised as the principal' advantage which the whole community can reap from the existence of a State Department to provide postal, telegraph, and telephone services. hope that the Minister will initiate a system under which the Department can grant post-offices in pioneer districts on easier terms than at present, that he will provide for a xeduction of the 10 per cent, guarantee demanded from country districts prior to the erection of telephone lines; and that he will endeavour to get the money with which to proceed more rapidly with the works. The Treasurer should be prepared to provide the money which is necessary for an expanding Department of this description. In America, I understand, about 5 per cent, of the population are connected with the telephone as against 1 per cent, in Australia, showing that we are very much"" behind in that regard. I admit! Â» that in America, with its very large population, it is much easier to grant telephone facilities on a commercial basis than it is in a sparsely settled country like Australia.",45
324,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"In America, the charges are. higher than our charges.",45
325,Mr SAMPSON,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"We should lead the way a little. We should not look 10 America or any other ctiuntry, but we should be prepared to formulate a forward policy. I do not know of anv direction in which the State might witli more advantage pursue a progressive policy than in this important Department. One of the first facilities which should be granted to a count! y district is a postal service, and the next essential convenience is a telephone service. I hope that if the Postmaster-General has not sufficient money with which to carry out various necessary works to give adequate facilities in country districts, he will appeal successfully to the Treasurer to grant him what he needs.",45
326,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,We shall have to appeal to Parliament.,45
327,Mr MAHON,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"Coolgardie) [3.30] - It is very satisfactory to hear from-the honourable member for Wimmera and Others some testimony to the efficiency of the Post and Telegraph, Department. This testimony somewhat counter-balances the attacks made in the press, and which have found echo here in projected motions of inquiry into the management of the Department. The first thing that strikes one about these complaints is that considerable encouragement to make them has come from the rich metropolitan newspapers. Something in the nature of a standing invitation is offered the public to find fault with the - Post Office - If we inquire why that should be so, we discover that before the ComI monwealth took over the Post and Telegraph Department tons of newspapers were carried free by post. This gratuitous service was a very good thing for these wealthy newspapers, whose proprietors thus received' an enormous subsidy from the public Treasury. It would be unnatural to expect persons deprived of so considerable an advantage to be' other than disaffected towards the power responsible for wrenching it from them. On the other hand, we know that the Federal management of post and telegraph business has resulted in very substantial concessions to the general public. A few years ago it cost 3s. to send a message of ten words by telegraph from Western Australia to Victoria. Now the community enjoys the privilege of sending throughout the Comat monwealth a message of sixteen words for is. Many other advantages have been conthe ferred on the public, and these were only possible because the Department withdrew the heavy subsidy obtained by wealthy newspaper proprietors. There is, theresea fore, some reason why these gentry should squeal a little when they contrast the sombre present with their rosy past. Howunnecessary. ever, after - discounting much that is said against the Department's methods, there a residuum of reasonable and justifiable satisfaction. W.e should not be blind! the fact tnat the functions of the Post Office have rapidly expanded during recent years, and that there is naturally some diffivoted culty in keeping pace with the increasing demands of the public. But, reverting a moment to the newspaper agitation against the Departmenti, another reason may be added to account for this journaltricts istic hostility. The Postmaster-General very properly desired! some time ago that population. those who made use of the telephone system - country services should pay according to the use they made, of it. It is a sound principle to which man, whether Socialist or individualist, could object-that those who enjoy advanHe tages should pay in accordance with the measure of the advantage they enjoy. I am sorry to say that the Department has not had the courage to carry out this recarried form as fully as it' should have done. I confines the regulation in respect of toll telephones to those applying for new serthe vices. I think that' the principle should be applied all round', and that establishment ments which make frequent use of the teleto phone should pay according to the faciliwealth. ties afforded to them. The Government appears to have been intimidated ' by the clamour raised by the metropolitan the interest of a small class. Are Ministers going to be content with a system which compels the general taxpayer to make the shortage of revenue due to the wealthy kind. few enjoying telephonic services for which they d'o not adequately pay? Let us hope not. They should have the backbone to insist on a uniform method, and such a of payment as will savei those unable to afford the luxury of a telephone from the injustice of being taxed to pay for the supconsult ply of this convenience to the opulent class and to rich trading corporations. These the paper. people should not be permitted to shift their burdens on to the masses, because latter cannot command the . influence of powerful newspapers. Surely the commertake a little risk.' cial element has already scored sufficiently Mr Mahon. the expense of the community in oiir outlay on the ocean mail service, and on Sydney to Melbourne telephone line. We could well afford to dispense with the expensive contract which the Government has entered into for the carriage of overmails. All important business being now done by cable, a huge subsidy for the oversea carriage of mail matter is really Mails could be. sent by poundage, which for all practical purposes is would serve us as well as the present exdispensive contract. In the establishment of to the Sydney-Melbourne telephone - line the Government have incurred a very large ex-. penditure which would better have been deto extending telegraphic and telephonic facilities in the country districts. I am at for one with the honourable members for Wimmera, New England, and others who have referred to the neglect of country disas compared with the attention given to - the requirements of large centres of If it is complained the do not pay, thePostmaster-General should let us - have no a balance-sheet showing the financial results of the Sydney-Melbourne telephone. can have no interest in concealing the true position of that work. Many honourable members believe, as I do, that it is an unnecessary duplication, conceived and out! in the interests of a few traders; t and that whatever revenue is earned by this telephone is more than counterbalanced by decrease in the telegraphic receipts. I should like to know whether the Governintend to go on with; their proposal establish penny postage in the Common",45
328,Mr FRAZER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,Does the honourable mempress in ber think that they do?,46
329,Mr MAHON,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,I do not. I think that! the present Postmaster-General has too good much sense to father a scheme of that,46
330,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,It is not my baby.,46
331,Mr MAHON,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"If that Bill becomes scale law, we shall have no money at all for extending the facilities of the Department to country districts. The Government will its' own as well as the interests of the country, by dropping that measure from I urge, as other honourable members have done, the adoption of a the more liberal policy with regard to country districts, a policy which will not hesitate to When the post and telegraph business was under the control' of the States, Governments showed more enterprise. For instance, in Western Australia the telegraph surveyor followed up the prospector with great promptitude. That is the proper policy to pursue in a Department on which the rapid settlement of the country so largely depends. Such a policy is in strong contrast to the hesitating attitude taken, for instance, in regard to the line to Black Range, in my electorate. There the Government refused to move until the town was firmly established, and it became obvious that a line would pay its way. The Postmaster General being a great opponent of sweating, - I should like to direct his attention to the sweating, 'that goes on in connection with small-allowance offices in remote parts of Australia. I bring under the notice of the honourable gentleman the case of a man who in six months received 2,079 letters, and despatched handling altogether 3,987 letters in that time. This was apart from the newspaper receipts. The revenue of this post office for the period mentioned was Â£ 1 8 13s. 3d., and despite that fact the man in charge is paid only Â£ 1 2 per annum. He supplies his own building, and performs all the labour necessary in connection with the office for the magnificent sum of Â£ 1 2 . per annum.",46
332,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,What are the receipts?,47
333,Mr MAHON,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"Apar t from the newspaper business, the receipts would amount to nearly Â£ 4 0 per annum, I admit that this office is stationed in a very remote .centre, and that it costs a good deal of money to carry a. mail there. I .mention it as a typical case, illustrative of the premeditated parsimony of the Department in its allowances to postmasters in these outlying places. Another matter about whichi 1I have to complain is the difficulty of getting telephones in country districts. Much as has been said, I do not think that the Department has constructed more than 250 or 300 miles of telegraph and telephone lines within my electorate, despite the rapid increase of settlement and population. This is a serious matter. Complaint must also be made of the same denial of money order facilities to new townships. The reason given is the absence of a bank, and the necessity of getting an escort to protect the money in transmission to the nearest town possessing a bank. seems to me .altogether insufficient. I know of one place where nearly 100 adult miners have to send some 15 miles for a moneyorder to their wives and families. That should not be. These men must go into the township themselves or entrust their money to some one else, and in such cases money has often been lost. Where there is an allowance office, and a reliable person in charge, the Government. might strain a poin't, and permit the issue of money orders and postal notes, as well as of stamps. I should have a good deal more' to say but. that I understand there is some arrangement about putting the Estimates through today, and that we shall have another opportunity at a later stage of discussing the policy of the Department.",47
334,Mr JH CATTS,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"Cook) [3.45] - I quite agree that, since Federation, the Postal Department has been conducted much more to the benefit of the public of Aus1,908, tralia than previously, and that the postal employees have enjoyed on the whole better conditions than under the State authorities. At the same time there seems to be a great amount of discontent on the part both of the public and the employees. The view-point of the public has been fairly stated here today, and my purpO.se in rising is to say a few words on behalf of some of the employees. In October of last year I brought up here the case of the retiring allowance of a retired postman named E . J. Dyer. He was a letter-carrier of Newtown, Sydney, and his claim had been hanging fire from the 28th September,"" 1905. He'was entitled to a month's salary for each year of service prior to the State Act of 1895. That is the view of the legal authorities of the Commonwealth. In some cases that rate of payment has been made, but in this and several others a stoppage has occurred. Payment at the rate of a fortnight for each year of service prior to 1895 has been made, but the balance of the money has been in dispute. When we were dealing with the case before, I suggested to the Postmaster-General that, as the Commonwealth authorities were quite certain that they were acting within the law in paying the maximum amount pf a month's pay for each year of service, the Commonwealth might, if the State authorities were the objecting parties, pay the amount and deduct it from the balances returnable to the States. The Postmaster General said then that it was impossible to do that. My investigations at thÂ« That Treasury since then have shown me thai it could be done; and, as a matter of fact, has been done in some cases.",47
335,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,I stated then what I had been informed by the Crown Law authorities.,48
336,Mr JH CATTS,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"The practice was continued until the State authorities took steps to bring a case before the High Court. That case has been pending for about eighteen months - It seems peculiar that the Commonwealth authorities should , leave it in the power of tiu State people, to whose advantage it . was for the case not to be heard, to let the inatter lie dormant. During the last eighteen months a large number of other people's cases, including the constitutional 1 question in regard to the new Excise, have lieen heard and decided by the High Court, whereas this particular case, affecting the rights of the humble employees of the Postal Department, has been allowed to stand aside. If it had been the case of some wealthy merchant like Mr H . V . MCKay, of the Sunshine Harvester Works, or if some other big interests had been at stake, they would have been able to bring sufficient influence to bear to have their cases heard and to push the authorities along; but because it happens to-involve only a few small letter-carriers scattered throughout the different' States, with not much influence and very little money to hurry anything along, this case has been allowed to drop.",48
337,Sir JOHN FORREST,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,Did this Government do that?,48
338,Mr JH CATTS,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"Yes , this Government has done it, and the right honourable member, when he was Treasurer, promised to see these postal employees paid. Postmaster-General has surely heard ""sufficient of these claims for retiring allowances to be able to make some definite pronouncement today. I admit that the State authorities are largely blocking the matter. The Commonwealth should not allow that. At the same time, the postal employees who are suffering this disability' ought to thoroughly understand that it is the .State authorities, and not so much the Federal authorities, who are preventing them from securing the rights given to them under the Federal Constitution. This is a question, not of State rights, but of the Federal rights of postal employees being blocked by the State authorities. In August. 1905, the Commonwealth Treasurer decided to pay the maximum amount in these cases, based on their services - as permanent employees. In July, 1906, the Federal Attorney-General recommended that the amounts should not be paid pending the decision in the case which the State had instituted against the Commonwealth in respect to the payment of the .maximum amounts. To show how the State authorities are endeavouring to block the matter, I desire to quote the following significant paragraph from a. letter from the New South Wales Attorney-General's Department^ dated n t h July, 1906I have to add that in_yiew of the fact mentioned in previous letters from this Department that it has been decided to test the legality of ' the action of the Commonwealth Government in paying gratuities at the higher rate in cases of this kind, it is presumed that payment at such rate will not be made pending a settlement of the matter. That shows distinctly that' it is the State authorities who are suggesting that these letter-carriers and other employees entitled to retiring allowances should not receive them pending the decision of the case in the High Court, which is to come on for hearing presumably at their own sweet will . When the House met ""after the Christmas adjournment, I noticed that the leader of the Opposition was very solicitous for certain postal employees, and was father concerned that he had not been invited to the picnics and demonstrations of the postal employees, whilst members .from other, sections pf the House, notably from the Labour corner, were being invited. I expect that the postal employees now recognise in which quarter of the House their friends are to be found, and are consequently inviting them to their functions and pouring their grievances into the ears of those who are sympathetic with their troubles. AccordThe ing to Hansard, No. 61, of this session, page 8822, the right honourable gentleman saidBut when officers are necessary they should be treated on a high standard of fair-minded liberality. I am afraid there are hundreds and hundreds of men in the Post and Telegraph Department who are not treated in that waywhose salaries are insufficient. I know of one man of twenty years' service who is in charge of an important branch, and has no black mark against him, whose salary is ^160 per year. That is a startling discovery for the right honourable gentleman to make. As compared with a number of less fortunate employees, that man's circumstances are happy. I could give the right honourable gentleman cases' of letter carriers, with no black marks against them, getting far less. I may mention that of H.

In that man's grade, there 179 on the same level as himself,, and vvill be impossible for him under the prebe sent system to rise above Â£ 1 1 0 a year for about seventeen years, although he has ready had twenty years' service. Another case is that of W. R. Morrisey, assistant letter carrier at the Sydney General Post Office. He has a most important beat, he has had seventeen years' service, and his salary is ^ 1 1 0 a year. Particulars will found in the Commonivealth Gazette, No. 35> PS 60. a e cases. These employees have no possible hope of promotion under present grading system. A salary of I ^ 1 1 0 a year ought to be the miniare mum, and employees with long service ought to be given an opportunity of rising to maximum of, say, Â£ 1 5 6 a year. I should like to place the position and prospects of these letter carriers before the Postmasterthc General and the House. They are divided into three grades. The lowest is that assistant letter carrier, and then come Affairs. grade 1 and grade 2. Those in grade 2 are eligible in turn for promotion to the position of sorter. Under the grading sysimpossible tem, it has been decided that one-third the letter carriers shall te in each of three grades. In the assistant's grade, more than Â£ 1 1 0 per annum. there are at present, in New South Wales, 1:81 employees at Â£ t \ o per annum. They receive no increments. In grade 1, there are 179 employees, receiving salaries of from Â£ 1 1 4 to Â£ 1 2 6 per annum: In that grade there are payable two increments jQ6 per year. ' In grade 2, there in that regard. 'are 179 employees, whose range from Â£ 1 3 2 to Â£ 1 3 8 per annum, - that grade one increment of Â£ f i being able. Promotion occurs from those - tions to the position of sorter. The averriers age rate of promotion since the introduction of the grading system has been twelve year, so there is very little hope for great bulk, of these men to obtain tion. . It would take fif teen years, at rate of twelve promotions per year, for all those in the top grade to make progress. The average service in that grade is sevent-> teen years. The average rate of promotion in grade 1 has also been twelve per year, and it would take fifteen years for all those in the grade to receive promotion. average service in That instance is fourployed teen years. In the assistant grade, with a twelve promotions per year, it would take fifteen years before the last of the 181 emcould receive promotion, and so obare tain over Â£ 1 1 0 per annum. They would it then rise to Â£ 1 1 4 per annum. It would seventeen years before they could reach Â£ 1 2 6 per annum, and thirty-two years bealfore they could reach Â£ 1 3 2 per annum. The average length of service in that grade is ten years. In competition with letter carriers in the top grade for vacant positions as sorters are forty-one senior assistants at from Â£ 1 3 2 to Â£ 1 3 8 per annum. be In competition with the letter carriers in the second grade for promotion there are These are not isolated fifteen senior assistants at from Â£ 1 2 0 to Â£ 1 2 6 per annum, and sixteen mail drivers the at from Â£ 1 1 4 to Â£ 1 2 6 per annum. n competition with the lowest grade there 630. general assistants seeking positions in the next grade - of letter carriers. I a think that the Postmaster-General ought to be in a position to grant some relief.",48
339,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"I have nocontrol over matter. The question is one for the Public Service Commissioner, whose Deof partment is under the Minister of Home",49
340,Mr JH CATTS,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"It will be seen from the statements I have made that it is for these letter carriers to imof prove their position, At least one-third of the them can never hope to obtain a salary of The term ""assistant letter carrier"" is a misnomer. We have three grades, all doing the same work, although' varying salaries are paid.",49
341,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"I think that the honourable member will find that the Public Serof vice Commissioner is proposing some change salaries Mr JH CATTS - I hope that the in Commissioner will give consideration to the payfacts that I am now putting before - the posiCommittee. Why should some letter carbe condemned to receive for all time a. salary of only Â£ 1 1 0 per annum, whilst per others can work up to Â£ 1 3 8 per annum. the Annual increments should, in my opinion, promobe substituted for the grading system, the and all letter carriers should have an opportunity to rise to a maximum of Â£ 1 5 6 per annum. Such a wage would enable them keep themselves and their families in some degree of comfort. At present, the grading system is nothing but a farce. In . the General Post Office, Sydney, - assistants The and No. 1 grade letter carriers are emas sorters at from Â£ 1 1 0 to Â£ 1 2 0 per annum, although sorters' work is valued at from Â£ 1 3 8 to Â£ 1 6 2 per annum. The services of permanent letter carriers are being utilized for sorting, so that the work may be done at a cheaper rate. number of the letter carriers in the highest grade have passed the necessary examination to qualify for the position of sorters, and they were given to understand a little while ago that they would be promoted. No promotions have yet been made, and these men are still doing sorters' work for less than a sorters' pay. The Public Service Commissioner has determined that the hours of duty for a letter carrier shall be eighty-eight per fortnight, with one day of four hours off per week. Ninety-six hours ner fortnight must be worked before overtime can be claimed. The letter carriers in the Sydney General Post Office average ninety-six hours per fortnight, and although effect should have beengiven twelve months - ago to die ruling to which I have just referred, there has been no time off in lieu, of payment for overtime, and no weekly half-holiday has been allowed. country and suburban districts, a number of letter carriers work from n o to 120 hours per fortnight, with no time off in lieu of payment for overtime. As typical cases, I would point out that two letter carriers at Woollongong, are working. 110 hours per fortnight, three at Lithgow 120 hours' fortnight, and one at Blackheath working 118 hours per' fortnight. There are many others in exactly the same position.  iii so manv hours per fortnight?",49
342,Mr JH CATTS,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"They have a great deal of broken time - They start at an earlv hour, and in some cases it is midnight before they finish.  ing letters all the time.",50
343,Mr JH CATTS,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"Certainl y not. Letter carriers,, perhaps, get two hours off about noon, but that is absolutely useless to them, since it is occupied in going to and from their homes. They have to be in attendance from fourteen to sixteen hours in order to do ten hours' work. Their attendance commences very often at 6 or 6.40 a.m., and finishes at from 8 p.m. t ill night. Letter carriers in the' General Post Office. Sydney, have to assist in opening mail bags, trucking mails, and handling them as they arrive on the lift . In the. summer months the men so employed are soaked in perspiration before they set out on their beats. I hear an honourable member cynically crying "" shame.""",50
344,Mr HEDGES,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,Who said that ?,50
345,Mr JH CATTS,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"I do not know. A The honourable member makes a ready response, and if the cap fits him he may wear it. .These men are bathed in perspiration, and often tired out before leaving'the office for their beats. Their work begins at fro m 6 a.m. to 6.30 a.m., and, as a rule, they have no opportunity to get breakfast until .10 a.m. When the Postmaster-General was in Sydney recently, he promised the letter carriers who have now to assist in handling mail-bags at the General Post Office, that porters should be employed in that capacity, just as they are in the General Post Office, Melbourne. Although the promise was made some time ago, the desired reform has not yet been carried out. The menare beginning to doubt'whether the Postmaster-General was really sincere or simply made the promise in order to get .rid of them.",50
346,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"-The promise was made. In the not nine weeks ago, and it is impossible to give effect to it in less than seven months. We have to make provision on the Estimates, for the change, and then adopt the' procedure I have indicated.",50
347,Mr JH CATTS,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"I hope that the Postmaster-General will grant the promised relief. Letter carriers should not be called upon to do such work before they set out on their ordinary rounds. There is room for very great improvement in the administration of the General Post Office, Sydney. ' The Postmaster-General has told us that he favours a policy of decentralization, and is doing his best to induce the Deputy Postmaster-General' in each State to .accept some larger measure of responsibility, but that, so far, there seems to be a disinclination on the part of the controlling officers in the different States to accept the responsibilities of their position, and that consequently there is an accumulation of work in thecentral office and business is blocked. If that is the position, will any purpose be served by our giving the Postmaster-General authority to carry out such a scheme? It would seem that his efforts to secure decentralizamid- tion must be impotent when officers refuse to carry out the spirit, if not the letter, of the instructions given to them. I find no pleasure in constantly dunning the Department in respect of the grievances of employees. I should be' glad if there were in operation a system that would enable the postal employees to obtain their rights, and to fairly put tlieir grievances before the Department, so that they could be finally dealt with there. As a matter of fact, however, we find that' these men are compelled to go outside the Department to seek redress of their grievances, because of small minded and indifferent administration within, and have to induce their representatives in Parliament to put questions to Ministers in the House, and to bring political influence to bear in order that some attention may be paid to their complaints. That is due largely to the lack of sympathy shown by the officers controlling the Department. They seem to be afraid that their decisions will be canvassed, and consequently they dp not give .the employees under them an opportunity of ventilating their grievances within the Department. As I know that a number of honourable members desire to catch their trains, and the hour is late, I should be glad if the Postmaster-General would agree to progress being reported.",50
348,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,The honourable member will have another opportunity to discuss these matters on the Supplementary Estimates.,51
349,Mr JH CATTS,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"The opportunity to discuss these matters on the Supplementary Estimates will be very restricted. It is only once a year that we have an opportunity to put before the Minister and. the Committee our views on this question, and I think we should avail ourselves ofi t . There is another matter affecting the forage allowance to letter carriers that I desire to bring forward. The men have repeatedly asked that the forage allowance of 12s. per week should be increased to 14s. per week, or 2s. per day. of that request being granted, however, it has been laid down that no allowance for forage shall be made in respect of a letter carrier's day off, so that the payment has really been reduced to n s . per week. Is it not absurd that a man should not be allowed anything for thekeep of his horse on his day off? These officers must practically starve their horses or provide for them out of their meagre salaries.  on 1 is. per week?",51
350,Mr JH CATTS,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"For some months fodder in the metropolitan districts has been very scarce, and prices have been high. ",51
351,Mr JH CATTS,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"I admit that the prices at the present time are a little easier, but they have been very high. The letter carriers, the men on the lowest rung of the official ladder, should be the first to receive consideration, and I certainly hope that' the Minister will take action in the cases I have hrought under his notice, especially the claim for retiring allowance. The Commonwealth authorities are' of opinion.that those who retire are entitled to a month's pay for each year of service. But because of a technical'quibble by the authorities of the States, they are not receiving it . If the Commonwealth reading of the law is correct, the men should receive what is their due, and, if necessary, legislation should be introduced to prevent them from being deprived of what they have all along looked forward to as the reward for long service and a provision for old age. Mr THOM AS BROW N (Calare) [4.18.]. - I shall not.discuss the Estimates at length, because, while I felt indignant about the manner in which postal administration has been conducted in New South Wales, I found on inquiry that the Minister is not responsible, and that the blame for the In efficiency about which there has been so many complaints, rests with the Treasurer. Therefore, on the Treasury Estimates I ventilated many of the grievances I had to submit against the postal administration. There are, however, one or two other matters to which I should like to refer now. As a Ministerial Committee has been appointed to investigate the administration of the Department, and as further proposals for expenditure in connection with the Department are to be Instead brought forward, I shall content myself on this occasion with a reference to these matters. In New South Wales, the feeling is growing that the contract post-office system leads to a great deal of sweating. A number of staff offices 'have been made contract offices, and private persons put in chargeof them. Nothing is to be said'against the conduct of those in charge of contract offices, though the public would naturally prefer official postmasters and . postmisr tresses; but it is complained that so much work is required, and so little pay is given, that the offices are nothing less than sweating shops. A number of these offices were contracted for on the understanding that only certain duties would be required; but the new system for checking telephone business is so minute and technical, that it involves a great deal of additional work, and one postmistress informed me that it takes her twelve hours at the end of each week to deal with all the documents connected with it, no additional allowance being made for the extra work. I hope that the Postmaster-General will remove the stigma which now justly attaches to the contract system, of being a sweating institution. With regard to the mail contractors, I wish to call attention to a case of considerable hardship. In Temora there is a contractor who undertook to carry, the mails between the post-office and the railway station, but, during the term of his contract, a new railway line was opened up, and he was required to put on an extra relay of coaches, and do additional work without any increase of pay. He has told - me that he is being required to do this work because his contract stipulated that he should make so many trips a day, or more if required. But there was no indication that he would have a regular daily additional service to perform. What he understood was that he would be required to perform whatever extra work was to be done in consequence of a break-down or an additional service of a special nature. In his case the Department was guilty of an injustice of which a private person would not be guilty. Were a service discontinued during the term of the contract, the Department would reduce the payment pro' portionately, and yet it imposes additional services without extra reward. I hope that the Postmaster-General will see that ordinary commercial morality is observed in the dealings with the officers of the Department, and that, in the case of contractors, there are not imposed conditions which private people would never think of suggesting. have no desire now to deal with the Estimates of the Department; and I content myself with pressing on the Minister the necessity for doing away ' with sweating conditions in contract offices, and of dealing - with contractors in an honest straightforward way, setting out clearly at the outset the whole of the conditions. I specially commend the attention of the Postmaster-General to the causes of complaint in connection with the 'Mundooran and Temora contracts, in regard' to which there have for years been many complaints.",51
352,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"Parramatta) [4.27] - I had intended to address myself pointed. to the Estimates of the Postmaster-General, but time does not permit of my doing so. However, I understand that the Additional Estimates are very important, and that we shall have an opportunity to deal with these on Tuesday; aiid, therefore, I think the Estimates now before us might be allowed to pass without further discussion.",52
353,Mr CHANTER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"Riverina) [4.28] - It is all very well for the deputy leader of the Opposition to say that he desires to expedite public business; but I have two complaints which I desire to bring under the notice of the Committee. "" One complaint, which I have voiced on many occasions, is that, not only this Government, but every preceding Government, have f o l lowed the bad practice initiated in New South Wales of not submitting the Estimates until the end of the year, when prac-, tically all the money has been spent. The Opposition might render valuable . assistancei f they could induce the Government to submit the Estimates earlier, when honourable members would have some control over the expenditure. The Estimates for the Post and Telegraph Department were submitted only' today, somewhere about the luncheon hour, and honourable membersi who have grievances to ventilate are now asked to neglect their duty, and allow the votes to pass without discussion. The first matter I desire to bring under notice is the sweating which goes on throughout the whole service. I ask the Postmaster-General when he is going to invite Parliament to take steps to protect the public servants, who are being harassed, and are not receiving that fair play which they are entitled to receive from the Public Service Commissioner ? All responsibility is placed on the shoulders of that gentleman; but, as we know, it is impossible for him to deal with every, detail, and he has to depend on I the reports of others in the matter of classification and so forth. A Public Service Commissioner was appointed in order to remove political influence and favouritism, which resulted in officers of merit being retained in the lower grades of the service, whilst others, with inferior qualifications, were promoted. I point out, however, that at that time any civil servant who felt aggrieved could approach a member of Parliament with a view to a ventilation of the grievance, and if the member or Minister did anything wrong, he was responsible to Parliament. This kept in check anything like undue influence; but it was considered that a reform was required, and. - the Public Service Commissioner was apI say without hesitation, and Estimates. with all due deference to the Public Serbe vice Commissioner, and without reflecting on him personally in any way, that there is more favouritism in the various Departclubs ments today than there was under the old conditions.",52

355,Mr CHANTER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"I have just said so, and I have no desire to place the responsience, bility on the shoulders of that gentleman.",53
356,Mr JOHNSON,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"I believe, however, that the honourable member is largely right.",53
357,Mr CHANTER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"I believe that the do the same. Public Service Commissioner is entirely ignorant of the favouritism and that he acts in good faith on the reports he receives. It is notorious, however, that the whole Public Service is seething with discontent. Men who have been in the vice for many years, who are without a black mark against them, and who are ready to undergo any practical examinaagain. tion, find themselves anchored, - while juniors by the dozens are placed over heads.",53
358,Mr JOHNSON,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,I think it will be'found that some of the subordinate officers mainly responsible.,53
359,Mr CHANTER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"The Commissioner, in my opinion, is above showing any favouritism. The fault lies with the suWales perior officers in the metropolitan and other central districts. If an unfortunate public officer ? servant cannot get their favour he has no chance of advancement. I have here lists cases, though I do not intend them individually, because, under. existing conditions, if it is known, no matter seriously aggrieved a public servant may be, that he has been in communication a member of Parliament, a black mark put against his name, and he is informed that he has been guilty of a breach of gulation so-and-so. A system of favouritism prevails. There is no right of appeal. There is no redress, unless this Parliament is prepared to give it . A. youth who enters, the service sees a goal before him, and hopes that by moving on step by step, by the proper performance of his duties, he may ultimately reach to a good grade and a good salary. But it is absolutely impossible for him to do so under existing conditions.

But they have been passed over for promotion. On whose report?

He could ascertain, if he chose, that they are good, practical men, with no black mark against them. Who were the by juniors who were put over their heads? to conThey were men from favoured circles where these influences are at work. I know to these facts, and other honourable members know them, too. Influences are used by little circles within departmental rooms. Any one who cares to make inquiries, as I have done, will find that very drastic changes are necessary to bring about a feeling of contentment in the Trade and Customs and the Post and Telegraph Departments. One would suppose that when pro-' motions had to be made information would be obtained straight from the offices where officers were employed.",53
367,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,The head is always consulted.,54
368,Mr CHANTER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,The heads are not consulted at all. Others are consulted who know nothing about the officers whose interests are concerned. Officers are passed along in grades. I want. the Minister to explain upon what principle these grades are arranged.,54
369,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,The honourable member must ask the Minister of Home Affairs.,54
370,Mr CHANTER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,I am asking the ' Minister administering the Post and Telegraph Department. I am just about tired of always being shifted on to the Public Service Commissioner. The Minister has some power if he chooses to exercise it . Mr .MAUGER - I have no power whatever regarding grading and classification.,54
371,Mr CHANTER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"I have .heard that statement from other Ministers. But we done now. once had a strong man in New South Wales, who had the courage to administer his Department properly. I allude to the late John Want, who exercised his powers as Minister in spite of the Public Service Commissioner.",54
372,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,Would the honourable member counsel the Minister to break the law which Parliament has made? . Mr CHANTER - No .,54
373,Mr WILKS,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,We do not grow Jack Wants everv dav.,54
374,Mr CHANTER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"The Minister should be in a position to exercise a little control over his Department. It is a bad thing for the administration of any Department when its Minister is not endowed with that authority. All that a Minister can do now, apparently, is to submit a recommendation to the Public Service Commissioner. He has not the power to appoint an officething cleaner, or even to engage a temporary hand.",54
375,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"That is quite correct. ' Mr CHANTER - Is that a proper'state of affairs to exist? Who should be in a better position to form an accurate judgment than the man who is responsible the administration of a Department? It is absolutely unfair to a Minister to foist upon him junior officers inferior in merit to senior officers. If he were a strong man, he would act as the late Honourable J. H . Want did in New South Wales, ancl have .his own way in that respect. Under the Public Service Act, there are six classifications, namely, i A , 2A, i B , 2B, i C , and 2 C ; and to the variqus classifications, of course, different salaries are attached. Without any examination, junior officers are appointed over the heads of senior officers. I think that public officers have a just right to claim that they should be afforded an opportunity to demonstrate whether or not they possess greater merit, more practical knowledge,' and a riper experience. At the present time, that opportunity is denied to them. Is that fair? I invite, not only the Minister, but honourable members generally, to look at the matter from that stand-point. Under the old regime, the complaint was that favouritism was shown, and it was continuously urged that if the Public Service were put under a Commissioner it would be removed, and the officers would advance step by step and from grade to grade by order of seniority, contingent upon the possession of merit.",54
376,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,That is not being,54
377,Mr CHANTER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,Exactly ; and that is what I complain of. We have a greater evil than the one which existed in those days. Seniority does not count at all ; but who' is to judge of a man's merit?,54
378,Mr MATHEWS,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,A biased man.,54
379,Mr CHANTER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"I want to know what step the Postmaster'-General proposes' to take to remove this particular grievance of the officers, because the discontent is greater in his Department than in any other. It has become so grave a matter that honourable members will find themselves bound to interfere, and to press the Ministry in power to amend the law, in order to do justice to public officers. On that phase of the subject, I do not think it necessary to dwell at greater length, because I believe that there is hardly a member who does not endorse my views. Somehas been said in reference to contracts and sweating. In another sphere of life, the honourable gentlanan at the head of the Post and Telegraph Department has taken a very lively interest-for which I , commend him-in preventing sweating.",54
380,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"And I have done a great . for deal to cure it here, too.",54
381,Mr CHANTER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"I give my honourable friend credit for what he has done, .both privately and ministerially, so far as his limited opportunities and powers have permitted him to do. Hitherto, the people of a whole district have been provided with an official post-office ancl an official telegraph office, under officials, controlled by the Department. But now, from the commercial or other point of view, the rule has been laid down that if an office fails to return an annual revenue of Â£ 4 0 0 , the official in charge shall be removed and replaced by some one who has contracted for the office. In .other cases, there is an allowance office, and it is more particularly concerning the latter that I desire to speak, because in a great many cases those who. hold contract offices are the offenders by having put in tenders at too low a price.",55
382,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"My predecessor. made provision that all contract officers are paid a minimuni allowance of j Â£ i 1:0 a vear, ancl that is being paid now.",55
383,Mr CHANTER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"I am very glad to mercial hear that. The allowances to which I refer start with the munificent sum of Â£ 5 per which has been collected therein? year, and the person in charge of the office is supposed to be present from 8 a.m. 6 p.m., to do the necessary work, and to remonwealth, ceive the mails, and in some cases to rise finance must be studied at midnight or 2 a.m.' to receive and liver mails. In the latter case, the allowcannot ance might amount to Â£ 1 0 a year. A little more is given where a person has to attend must extend post and telegraph to telephones.

We facilities 0 to the country districts whether it will pay I suppose of that every member of the Committee has and had the same experience in connection with applications made for the extension of An application for a I service is put in, and a reply is sent to the effect that the revenue is estimated at a certain amount, and that as the cost of the service would be greater than the estimeamated revenue, the Department do not see I have mind a case where a bi-weeklv mail service between Wanganella and Deniliquin was, in accordance with the .determination run the Department on commercial lines, reduced to a weekly service, which was of be no practical use to the people of the district, because it did not fit in with other a mail services. The Department was asked continue the convenience, which the residents had enjoyed for the past twentv vears to my knowledge, and because the'service between Â£ 7 o sÂ£&o per annum, and the revenue from it - was only between Â£ 4 0 and Â£ 4 5 per annum, the paltry difference between revenue .and expenditure may prevent the resumption of the bi-weekly service.",55
390,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"I had a case where the Department was offered a clear profit - of 38 per cent, on the outlay, and they would not undertake it .",56
391,Mr CHANTER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"The case to which I have just referred is under the consideration of the Minister or his officers, and the people concerned have offered to pay the difference between revenue and expenditure out of their own pockets. A similar course is being adopted in many other cases. Similar complaints must be made in connection with applications for the extension of telephone services. I have referred to the case of a postmistress in charge of an allowance post office, who, finding her own house and attending to the work of the Department, received the munificent sum of. Â£ 2 0 per annum.",56
392,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"That is hardly a fair wav to put it. She must live in her house, ancl in nine cases out of ten these people applv for the position, and are paid in proportion to the work they do.",56
393,Mr CHANTER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"In some cases that may be so, but in others I have known a house to be built for the purpose. postmistress to whom I have referred is now called upon to take charge of telephone business.",56
394,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,Anc l she gets so much for eve-v call on the telephone.,56
395,Mr CHANTER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"Sh e gets a miserable commission on all telegram's, which amounts to Â£ 2 12s. 6d. per annum.",56
396,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,-What commission does she get?,56
397,Mr CHANTER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"I cannot say from memory, but the whole of the particulars were supplied by the members of a deputation that I introduced to the Minister a week or two ago. . There can be no doubt that there is sweating in the Post and Telegraph Department, and the Minister, in conjunction with the Treasurer, should say whether this.kind of thing is to continue, or whether it is not better that they should take some of the surplus revenue earned in metropolitan centres to provide facilities which would add a little to the comfort and convenience of people in the country . districts, who, under trying conditions, are doing as valuable work for the Commonwealth as is being done by the residents of large centres of population. .another matter to which I should like fo direct attention, and I am sorry that the honourable member for Echuca is not present to deal with it . The residents of a place called Gunbower, which is about thirty miles from Echuca, applied for telephone connection with that town. In reply to the application, the Department asked the residents a number of questions, and amongst them the question, ""What will you guarantee?"" A guarantee to pay the interest on the whole cost of construction of the line for a term of seven years was offered by a resident of undoubted means. Not satisfied with this guarantee, the Department replied, ""We want you to supplv so many score of telegraph poles free of cost, ancl to arrange with the owners of properties along the line for the use of the wire on their fences."" That condition also was complied with, and then a report from the district inspector was called for. He advised the Department that he did not see any prospect at the end of the term of seven years that the line would pav, and therefore his recommendation was against its construction. In spite of the general demand for lancl for settlement that is being forced upon the Parliaments of the States, as well as the Federal Parliament, this officer undertook to say that this disThe trict would remain stationary for seven years. To-day I received a communication, which I should have asked the honourable member for Echuca to deal with if he had been present, in which I am informed that a further report, has been made by the district inspector, and that, although he admits that he has been told by the guarantor of the line, who is a large stationholder, that he intends to cut up a considerable area of his station property for dairy farming, he still says that there will be no increase of population in the district at the close of the seven years' period for which the guarantee has been offered. How, in the face of the general demand for lancl, any man of common sense can say that a district . which is known to te suitable for agricultural development will remain stationary for seven years, I am at a loss to understand. I wish to draw. attention to another matter, which applies more to the metropolitan than the country districts. A telegram, perhaps of the greatest importance, is brought to a house by a telegraph messenger. In some cases that I know of he does not even take the trouble to knock or There is ring, but leaves under the door the card wilh which he is supplied, having marked on it the words, "" not at home,"" and takes the telegram back to the office.",56
398,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"If the honourable member will supply me with the particulars of such an instance I will at once report it to the Public Service Commissioner, and have the person responsible suspended.",57
399,Mr CHANTER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"In this case the offender was a. boy. I mention it .because it was my own experience. ceedingly important telegram was sent to me. A card was placed under the door, saying, "" not at home."" The telegram was returned to the station, and yet my wife and myself had never left the house for the whole of that day.",57
400,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,How long ago was that?,57
401,Mr CHANTER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"About a month ago. I mention it now for the first time. I do not want to get the boy sacked. ject is to point to the practice, so that the Minister may make provision that nothing of the kind shall happen in the future. I gave the boy a good talking to afterwards, pointing out how wrong it was for him to do a thing of that kind. But where is the necessity for taking a telegram back ' in such a case ? Would it not be as easy to put the telegram, under the drcor as to put the card there? If the telegram is not left, the person to whom it is addressed may have to go a considerable distance to the telegraphoffice for it, and may find the office closed. InÂ°one case which I know of, where the lierson concerned was really not at home, he went to the telegraph-office when he returned, but failed to get the telegram until the next morning, because the office was closed. It was a serious matter for him, because if he had received the telegram at night he could have taken the train early next morning and been at the bedside of a dying relative.",57
402,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"Surely that was his misfortune, through being out. Nobody was to blame for that.",57
403,Mr CHANTER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,It would not have happened if the telegram had been put under the door.,57
404,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,There are many strong reasons why that should not be done. What guarantee would there be that the telegram had reached the person for whom it was intended?,57
405,Mr CHANTER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"Coul d not the messenger - inform the authorities at the. telegraph-office that he had put the telegram under the.door? Who would be likely to remove the telegram ? Besides, most of the suburban houses now have letter-boxes, which can be locked. A telegram could be put in the letter-box, and if necessary a card could be put under the door stating, ""Telegram put in letter-box.""",57
406,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"In Melbourne and suburbs, not 5 per cent, of the houses have letter-boxes.",57
407,Mr CHANTER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"I doubt that, but in An ex- any case does the honourable member think that the practice is a proper one?",57
408,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,It is .the most effective way that I know of up to date.,57
409,Mr CHANTER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"This is the onlyState where I have known it to be done. It was not done in New South Wales. On what system is the Department worked with regard to telegraphic and postal centres ? The present arrangements are most peculiar. For instance, Malvern and My ob- Caulfield adjoin, the boundary being the railway line. The Malvern post-office is practically alongside the Malvern railway station, but if you cross the lineyou are in Caulfield. ' The Caulfield office .is about a mile and a half away. A letter or telegram addressed to a person living in Caulfield, practically within a few yards of the Malvern post-office, is sent a mile and a-half away to the Caulfield post office, and then back practically the same distance before it is delivered.",57
410,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,And letters that arrive in Melbourne at 7 in the morning are not delivered in that district until 6 o'clock .at night.,57
411,Mr CHANTER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,That is because' letters are sent back and forward in the way I have described. Why cannot each post-office be taken as a centre from which to supply a certain radius?,57
412,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"That system is being worked out at the present moment. Mr CHANTER ! - I am very glad to hear it. I felt it my duty to point out what has been happening in that regard, because it was a serious inconvenience, and often caused delay in the delivery of letters and telegrams. I should like to hear some pronouncement from the Minister as to the policy of the Government with regard to the Bil l introduced by the previous Postmaster-General for universal penny postage for the Commonwealth.",57
413,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,That Bil l is dead.,57
414,Mr CHANTER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"I do not think it ,is. Some remedy should be found for the evils which I am about to - recount. I want uniformity in the Commonwealth-on e postage stamp, one value.",57

416,Mr CHANTER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"*-I do not think that that Bill quite covers the question. At any rate, the question' has been discussed here before without exception being",58
417,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS, Yes ; but I am in the chair now.,58
418,Mr CHANTER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"Then , are we to understand that the rulings of the Chair are not to be uniform? Shall I be parliamentary in order in stating that, owing to a practice of the Department, my constituents are conis divided on the question. stantly being called upon to pay into the revenue more than they ought to do. Comand plaint is very general in my electorate, tion. which is on the Victorian border, that business people and others in this State, who honourable are accustomed to penny postage, frequently place only a i d . stamp on letters addressed to my constituents, with the result that, as penny postage is non-existent there, the dressees are called upon to pay not only the deficient postage, but a 50 per cent, fine. I do not know on what principle system is based, but it ought to be ished. I am constantly in receipt of commembers iplaints from Municipal Councils, Progress Associations, and other bodies, in respect this surcharge. In many cases, people refuse to accept delivery of letters insuffiLabour ciently stamped. The difficulty might be reinstated. overcome by the adoption of the zone system. The Department should provide that letters bearing only a penny stamp shall be delivered within a certain distance of the border.",58
419,Mr MAUGER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"That alteration could not bo made without an amendment of the law. Mx. CHANTER - Then the law ought strong to be amended. The cure is universal postage. If we cannot obtain penny postvisableness age throughout the Commonwealth, we should have'a general two-penny postage, so that all the States would be treated alike. - Mr MATHEWS - Victori a has to finance her own postal system.",58
420,Mr CHANTER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"But that state of ment as a whole ? affairs will not last much longer. Since the Minister is not agreeable to progress being reported, .I shall pause to give him an opportunity to reply to the complaints that have been made.",58

448,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,They can be dealt with in connection with the' Supplementary,59
449,Mr CHANTER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"I propose to avail myself of the present opportunity to refer to them. I have not yet received from the say Postmaster-General a reply to a complaint rethat I brought under his attention. I recognise that he has done very well, and I indiwish to strengthen his hands. When tenders are invited by the Department for anv service, it is presumed that no disclosure will be made in regard to the tenders sent in until they have been dealt with. I am a sorry .that they are not. I have brought forward a case in regard to which an inon the spot is demanded. It occurred at Hay. The Department invited tenders in the ordinary way by advertisement in the Gazette and in the newspapers, for a service from Hay to Darlington Point, and received one tender only. But considering the tender too high, because the amount asked for was larger than that paid for the previous year, they re-adverpretised, and whereas the first offer was for Â£ 2 3 9 , the second was for Â£ 2 7 0 . There only one tender on the second occasion, men and it. came from the person who put in rethe first tender. Tenders were not again called for by advertisement, but I am in a position to' state that the sum demanded per by the tenderer was made known, and others 'were invited, not in the usual way, but by telegram, to undertake the service at a lower price. The date on which the first tender was lodged was 4th September, 1907, and that on which the second was received was n t h December, 1907. The matter was referred to the Inspector for the district, and he recommended that the tender submitted in the proper form should be accepted. Whilst the Department did the right thing in re-advertising for tenders when it was considered that the first offer was too high, it did the wrong thing on the second occasion in, practically divulging by telegram the offer made, and asking - others to tender for a less sum. There is considerable trouble now under the contract system, but if practices of this kind continue, and tenders are divulged, persons will cease from tendering .altogether. The Minister promised to make an inquiry into the matter some weeks ago, and to let me know the result. I therefore ask him now what he proposes to do? Does he propose to cancel the tender, or to grant an inquiry by officers whom he can trust, to find out who was responsible for what was clone, ancl how it was that, in spite of the recommendation of the District Inspector, the Tender Board in Sydney accepted, not a tender, but an informal offer. There is another matter to which I wish to refer. I am afraid that it will take me two or three hours to discuss it . M.r. DEAKIN - Then why not deal with it on the Additional Estimates?",59
450,Mr CHANTER,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,"I will do so, if get the promise that there will be no more 'crickery. I apply my remark, not to any action of the Prime Minister, but what was done by members of the Oppocertainly sition last night, who told me that they would do certain things and then did the of opinion. reverse.",60
451,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS,That is not - quite fair.,60

The honourable member who made that promise gave it to me personally, and passed. it should have been kept; but as he is not present, I shall not mention his name.

I do not desire to say one word against the capabilities or energy of the gentleman vho now occupies the position of permanent head of the Post and Telegraph Department, but, with an expanding service, it is wrong, after having fixed a retiring age, to discourage the younger officials in their natural desire for promotion.
