2,Mr FERGUSON,COMMITTEES,"I present the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration entitled Asylum, border control and detention, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",11
3,Mr FERGUSON,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The document titled Asylum, border control and detention endorses the overall thrust of Australia's existing immigration detention policy. In an inquiry which certainly demonstrated the value of our committee system, the report entails a sensible balance, for this investigation report welded varying nuances and involved significant compromise. For those reasons I would especially hope that it is acted upon, given the serious issue at stake and the work involved in this sometimes controversial policy area. The balance mentioned is between the needs of genuine refugee claimants, the conditions of applicants whilst detained and the need. to ensure that Australia's migration scheme and border protection policies retain their integrity. The committee received numerous submis.sions after extending the closing date because of an earlier lack of response. These submissions overwhelmingly subscribed to a view that our current policies were too harsh, although the vast majority conceded the requirement for some detention. There were diverse attitudes on the length of permissible detention. Some actually believed that after preliminary identification, and somehow swiftly assessing criminal background and health risk from distant provinces, the people should be immediately released. Many referred to international conventions in what were often misinformed or, in some cases, contrived endeavours to portray Australia as breaching these undertakings. The documents generally referred to were the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The submissions were singularly unconvincing, being characterised by selective interpretation and legalism. They appeared Report unable to grasp that, whatever the technical difficulties with Australia's regime, refugees would be better served if other nations in our partQf the world signed, ratified and adhered to these conventions. The recourse to overclever readings of international requirements undert11ines the Australian electorate's belief in the value of international cooperation. It is a dangerous game to manipulate the bare essentials of international agreements. These are usually reached by compromise with less pluralist societies than. our own. They attempt to enforce unprecedented requirements on these nations: It can only hurt our adherence to these conventions if polemicists sensationalise interpretations. There were simultaneously a diverse range of church, community and other support groups with a deep concern for the fate of the detainees. These contributions, with the committee visits to Westbridge, Port Hedland and Perth, were persuasive in reaching the central recommendation that there should be a capacity to entertain release if detention exceeds six months and certain stipulations are met. The committee has· determined that, if continued detention arises from departmental inaction and administrative error, the Minister for Immigration andEthnic Affairs personally, and not by delegation, could consider release. The committee emphasises its opposition to any judicial review of the exercise of that discretion and stresses that we are dealing with discretion, the use of which cannot be compelled. . Other recommendations of the committee demonstrate concerns about the upturn of litigation. in migration matters. As indicated earlier, the committee received evidence on international practices. It was convinced that the existing procedures and suggested alterations were not out of line with international standards. Few nations lack detention policies and the interest groups would be unimpressed by sterner European and US practices for turning around claimants at sea. The same people who cited very limited, rare US parole practices diverted their attention from the almost universal trend in Europe. Whether it be Sweden, the UK, France or Germany, the action is towards more trenchant measures to counter perceiv,ed manipulation of their previously liberal refugee admission policies. The committee has rejected the widespread view in middle Australia that boats should be turned around at sea, but has also countered the contention that those who undertake what is sometimes a dangerous sea voyage-risking pirate attack, drowning or starvation-are per se refugees and thus, entitled to remain in Australia without examination. I am pleased to say that the submissions of some groups active in aiding refugee applicants persuaded the 'committee of the need for some changes in detention practices. My own experience as the former representative for the Villawood area provided knowledge of Westbridge. Amongst the suggestions that I hope the minister will adopt are: consideration to allowing detainee children to attend local schools,in the appropriate circumstances; consideration to teaching detainee children in their native language; and, where a large group of unauthorised border arrivals from the one nationality are held in a detention centre, every effort should be made to engage the services of medical personnel who can provide regular consultations in their native language. There was a noteworthy lack of appreciation amongst many making submissions as to the extent of abscondment. Most witnesses were surprised to learn, for instance, of the high proportion of PRC applicants who had treated our legal processes with disdain after an initial negative response. For those in constant contact with refugee applications and other aspects of the migration intake, there a firm understanding that Australia is confronted by a proliferation of bogus claims. These are often engineered by advisers who have scant regard to the legislation's intent or to the integrity of the system. An expectation that people will persistently make themselves available to administrative and judicial review if they feel things are going badly is quixotic. Many groups advocated release and promised assistance to these people. I believe they are generally trustworthy in these offers. Nevertheless, they showed minimal interest in providing enforceable guarantees to ensure compliance with any given undertakings. The committee was actually confronted with witnesses who expressed horror at the idea that they should act in what they perceived to be a 'policeman' role. In the absence of more pro-active suggestions to counter threatened abscondment, the committee unfortunately had very restricted options on voluntary release. It .is unrealistic to suggest that people desperate to remain in Australia for whatever reason-without permanent housing and employment tiesand often lacking immediate family-can be compared in bail and parole expectations with permanent residents. The more responsible media would do a service by indicating to the public the tendency to abscond rather than blithely ignoring it to orchestrate irresponsible changes to the policy. Some have argued that the 833 unauthorised border arrivals detained' and held in custody during the period since 1 January 1990 have led to an overreaction. The reality is that the development of advanced transportation, continued connivance of some neighbouring countries and any sign of an easy' admission policy would cause an explosion of numbers. Certainly, our island status represents a partial protection against, for instance, the Californian experience which was detailed in this week's Economist. In California, State Governor Wilson has reliably claimed that there are two million undocumented immigrants in his state alone and that their numbers are growing by 100,000 per annum. Similarly in Europe, the continent is confronted by an unprecedented movement of is people, whether they swim or sail from North Africa, walk from eastern Europe or arrive as unescorted children at airports. Even if Australia could theoretically handle the current numbers, there are no grounds for introducing a free for all, possibly encouraging a massive growth of aspirants. The suggestions of this committee report represent a· sensible, compassionate outcome. Finally, I take the opportunity to thank the chairman for. arranging a fairly strenuous timetable and engineering a final document which represents a sensible compromise in this matter, managing to weld together a number of differing views. I also thank the staff and advisers' throughout this inquiry, which has provided Australia with worthwhile information on international practices.",11
4,Mr RUDDOCK,COMMITTEES,"by leaveFirstly, let me take this opportunity of endorsing the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations on detention practices, which the House has before it, and the comments of the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson), who spoke before me. I do so as one who has taken a personal interest in refugee and human rights issues over a long period. I do not intend to qualify myself save to say that I have seen refugee situations around the world and have spent quite long periods in Cambodia, unlike, I think, most members of this House. I will return to Cambodia in the next few weeks to .try to play a positive role in' the reconciliation of some of the disparate political groups in that country to working together. I make those comments because I believe that we have very important obligations in relation to refugees internationally; we have obligations to fellow human beings. We ought to understand that refugees are not just those people who arrive on our shores seeking sanctuary. Refugees exist· in a multiplicity of situations around the world, and our obligations are universal. In the earlier report of the Joint .Standing Committee on Migration other Regulations entitled Australia s refugee humanitarian system: achieving a balance between control and entry one will find a full outline of our humanitarian responses and the need to ensure that Australia's ability to help those in real need is not compromised by allowing those people who want to exploit our compassion mischievously to do so. The fact is that we do accept obligations. We have signed a number of treaties. When people arrive at our shores and say that they are refugees, they are asylum seekers; they are not refugees. They are not refugees until somebody has actually sat down with them, heard their claims, assessed them and made a decision as to whether or not they are entitled to our protection. At that point in time a person mayor may not be a refugee. We. have quite developed systems for assessing those claims. This is not to say that there have not been shortcomings in the past, particularly in relation to the processing of SOme of the claims regarding the Khmer. I do not wish to create a discordant note regarding the consideration of this report by saying that if it were a broader debate today I would be still very critical of the government's handling of these matters over time. I would be very critical of the fact that people have been held in detention for as long as they have, without their claims finally determined. That is a sorry part of our record. I would be critical of the application of resources to the task and, I think, the unwillingness of people to grapple with the situation of the Khmer, for sometimes the best of reasons. I think many people did not want to see Khmer cases assessed quickly in the beginning because they did not want to develop to a point where they knew their cases would be rejected because they were not going to satisfy the internationally accepted definitions that would enable them to have refugee status. They thought that if they were sent back at the time the Khmer Rouge were very act.ive that could create political difficulties. People in government went slowly in relation to the assessment. I think there were others, who also had agendas, advising and counselling those and who were held. A part of that agenda-and I do not criticise people. for doing it, but as a lawyer I know that my profession is wont. to do that when acting for clients-is that they . take advantage of every legal opportunity that exists for their clients and, if that means pursuing further appeals even though the case might be fairly light, they will take those opportunities. So we saw a situation in which every one of us was concerned that people had been held in detention for as long as they had. This report separates those issues and looks at the question dispassionately. It is a report that is unanimous, save and except for the comments of Senator Cooney in relation to some particular questions relating to judicial review and the dissenting report of the person who asked for this matter to be investigated by a parliamentary committee. When the committee looked at the matter it came to a unanimous view, save and except for her. She opposed it, she did not accept that judgment and added her dissenting report. The rationale for detention is clear and is set out on page 11 of the report, which says: It is a fundamental legal principle, accepted in Australian law and in international law, that, as a natural incidence of Australia's national sovereignChinese ty, the State detenmnes which non-citizens can gain entry to Australia, the conditions under which such non-citizens are admitted or permitted to remain, a.nd the conditions under which they may be deported. or removed. Of course, the courts have looked at the very question of detention. It is proper within the context of our law. We looked at the questions of our international obligations. I encourage honourable members to look at page 53 onwards. The principal convention is the convention dealing with refugees and the protocols relating to that. Specifically, the refugee convention authorises detention to carry out certain tasks to determine whether or not people have valid claims. It sets out the basis upon which they ought to be dealt with. People have tried to introduce questions relating to other treaties and, in fact, the committee looked at this but the Attorney General's advice in relation to all of those matters quite clearly stated that administrative detention of itself is not prohibited under international law and that: . ... detention of individuals who enter Australia witHout authorisation, including asylum seekers, is permissible both under international law and those non-binding international authorities and instruments which are morally and politically persuasive. I think they are very important points to be made. My colleague who spoke before me; the honourable member for Reid, mentioned the situation in relation to overseas experience. I do not want to go into any detail in relation to those matters, save to introduce two elements. We were encouraged to look at the United States experience in particular. But those people who encouraged us to look at it had not themselves examined what was happening in the United States. In particular, they were not aware of the comprehensive requirements needed to satisfy the US before release was undertaken. We ascertained that most of the people who were released in the United States were the same people as we release in Australia under surety, those illegal entrants who are detained, have further claims to be made, have some support in Australia and are released under our law. A number of people-particularly the students, about which one could say a great deal but which is not for this debatewho came into Australia with a valid entry pern'lit but who sought later to make a claim for refugee status and that claim was rejected goon and appeal, as they are entitled to do. A number of them leave Australia. But what alarms me in particular is that in the information contained iri the report, of the very large number of people-about 8,OOO-who were surveyed, more than 27 per cent, that is 2,171 persons, did not appeal, did not depart, did not make any further application but remained in Australia unlawfully. The majority. of. those people who have arrived by boat and whom we now detain under our existing system of assessingc1aims, which is not being criticised, are unlikely to succeed and have been shown to be unlikely to succeed. If we simply· process their claims and release them into the community, judging by the experience of those who were in less pressing circumstances, a large proportion of . them would have elected to t;emain unlawfully in Australia. 1 suspect that would be our experience in relation to boat people. I was very disappointed by Senator Chamarette's dissenting report-I do not wish to give it greater moment than I think it deserves-because she asked for this refer:"" ence and then did not accept the judgment of her peers. She persists in usingcharacterisation of detention, which I think is quite unjustified, that we are treating those people who arrive on our shores 'in a harsher way than most major criminals, and without court supervision'. I think 'statemen- like that do her no justice. They were certainly not sustained by· our inquiry. It serves to show how superficial her examination of this issue has been and how those who have sought to rely on it as a basis for criticising this report do themselves IlnQ their own independent and impartial abilities to make judgments a great deal of harm. I want to' conclude by saying, as the honourable member for. Reid did, how much I appreciate the support of my colleagues on the committee and, in particular, the support of the staff-Andres Lomp and his colleagues, particularly Kathryn Cronin, who gives up so much of her time from academia to assist us in our work. I thank the House for the courtesy of allowing me to speak on this matter.",13
5,Mr HOLDING,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I support the recommendations made iIi the report of the Joint' Standing Committee on Migration entitled Asylum, border control and detention. Those groups that are now vocally criticising aspeCts of. this report should look to the history of Australia and our attitude towards refugees. I believe that that is a record, irrespective of who is in power and in government, of which all Australians can be proud. A large number of people are seeking to enter Australia. as refugees. The committee had to deal with the difficulty that confronted the Minister . for Immigration· and Ethnic' Affairs (Senator Bolkus) and his department in dealing with that justly. It always has to be remembered that those who choose to come to Australia without any attempt to have their claims for refugee .status processed through embassies and our overseas missions take that position themselves. When they arrive on our shores the pressure on the department and upon.the Australian taxpayer is quite immense, because they have to be properly examined to see whether or not their case is bonafide. Te the extent to which Australia has both a moral and an international duty to provide proper support to the genuine refugee,every applicant who takes up the time of our structures at the cost of the taxpayer by making claims which will not stand· proper investigation is doing a grave injustice to bona fide refugees. The claim that those seeking refugee status are housed in circumstances less than those which exist in our prisons simply indicates that, unlike perhaps some members of the committee, Senator Chamarette has never visited ,some of our prisons and never seen the conditions that operate there. I do not believe these applicants for. assessment should be treated at the same level as a convicted criminal, but they are not. when we visited the detention centres we saw that they had three reasonable meals a day, there was health and medical supervision and there were educational facilities for children. All of those, if we apply a high enough standard, could be regarded as less than adequate, but to what extent is the Australian government under a duty to provide maximum facilities? Quite clearly, on the basis of the evidence that was ,before the committee, if we simply release people who come here seeking refugee status-a large number of them are not bone fide refugees in terms of the. international convention-we are doing a grave disservice, not only to our own immigration standards and policies but also to the bone fide refugees who in various parts of the world are seeking admission to Australia. I can understand the arguments put relating to humanitarianism, but the reality is that we know-it cannot be denied-that the refugee claims of many people, eitherboat people or others, having arrived here aT)d overstayed or with a tourist visa, will not stand examination. Therefore we hllve to balance the need to preserVe and protect the .standards set down by the government and by thisparlhiment in terms of our immigration processes .with trying to deal justly and humanely with those who arrive on our 'shores. Simply turning them loose into the community means that a very significant proportion is. going to disappear. Again, it is a problem for immigration officers, when we already have a large number of illegal immigrants. I believe the. recommendations in the report are balanced. The report comes from a very proper examination of the evidence and I do hot have any difficulty in supporting the recommendations and commending them to the House.",15
6,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMITTEES,"New England)'--by leave-I support the three colleagues of this House from the Joint Standing Committee on Migration who have spoken on the report entitled Asylum, border control and detention. In relation to our refugee program and this detention aspect, which is the subject of the report, it is important to put the whole of the migration program into a context where we look at the various 'elements. I refer those who have an interest to the initial table, 2.1, on page 9 of the printed report. From that we get some understanding of the extent to which, while the number of persons entering Australia under normal migration outcomesthat is, family migration, skill migration and special eligibilitY--'is declining, the number of those entering under the humanitarian program is increasing. In the general perspective of the balance of the program, if we provide-as' the two who made minority recommendations; one with respect to the rights of appeal and the other, on a more general basis-'-a right of release, we would be, in my view, further adding to the distortions which concern me greatly for a country which remains a net migrant taker. It is of great concern that we do not just look at detention as a humanitarian program which is there in some way to penalise people who, as one of the minority reports suggests, have not committed a crime. To start with, detention of a migrant is different from detention of a person within a gaol. While some claimant refugees have been detained in Roebourne gaol for a brief period, the circumstances are quite different. There is no doubt that, although the conditions In the detention centres are not as good as some would like, they are still not gaols. The significant difference is, I guess, that there no restriction on visitors; there is no restriction on the use of a telephone; there is no restriction on the receipt of goods from outside-other than, I guess, in terms of ordinary security; and, the people who are detained are able to leave that detention centre at any time, should they be prepared to return to their own country. The first thing I wanted to say in my few brief remarks is that I am of a mind that, unless. a nation like Australia maintains, in a humane way, a detention program, there is no real equity between the several categories. But against that, there are two elements. It is essential that applications for refugee status are processed as expeditiously as possibleand there is reference to that within this report. There have been problems in the past in a number of instances. There is little doubt that people have been detained for unnecessarily long periods. This' was. due, in part, firstly, to the number of people who arrived and, consequently; the difficulties in processing those applications; secondly, the first boat people arrived more or less at the same time and there was difficulty in ensuring equitable dealing with each of the applications; thirdly, in some instances, which is what occurred with one particular boat load which the committee saw in Darwin, they try to put all the applications . in at once; and, fourthly, there were obvious difficulties in ensuring adequate translation facilities. I think that those matters have been addressed. In any event, they are matters to which I believe the government must give attention. We also recognise within the committee the obvious problems if people are detained for an excess period. A recommendation in the report relates to that. Essentially, the report is designed to try to blend what we would see as a proper and humane treatment ,of people who are detained' with the proper maintenance of a migration policy. The· one real general comment that I want to make is that,when we are looking at the detention report, we must not ignore the circumstances existing in our region at this time. Given the fairly tight procedures being applied in other countries, I would be very is apprehensive if we were to relax our detention practices in Australia so that there could be a wave of refugees coming to Australia in a way which would further distort the balance within our overall migration program outcome. I am one of those who see significant advantage in our migration program. I believe that there is certainly an advantage in our increasing the intake of migrants with skills and those in the special eligibility category. I am worried that there would be a flood of refugees if refugees are immediately released into the community, quite apart from the question of whether we. would be. able to recall tJlem and whether they would be prepared to leave when they were expelled. 'I think that would be regrettable. In my view, it is important that the elements of the economic and social conditions in our region are taken into account. It is on that basis that I see the recommendations in this report as being the only ones which could be sustained in any reasonable assessment of where Australia should go in the future. Like my colleagues, I would like to extend particular thanks to the secretary and staff the Standing Committee on Migration. Dr Kathryn Cronin has been a godsend. She seems to know more about migration law than most people in this country, and we are indebted to her for the contribution she makes in ensuring that we do not trip over ourselves through precedents given only a matter often of a week or so before the. actual hearing. I commend this report, which I believe is balanced between humanity and ratipnal understanding. I believe that it is a very good solution to what is a very difficult and yet a very important matter of public policy. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1993 Consideration resumed. from 21 February. . Second Reading",16
7,Mr LINDSAY,OLYMPIC INSIGNIA PROTECTION,"Herbert-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development) (10.05 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Olympic Insignia Protection Act 1987 provides protection for what are collectively called the Olympic insignia; namely, the well known representation of the five interlocking rings and the Olympic motto, citius, altius, fortius, which in translation means faster, higher, stronger. This protection accrues to the benefit of the Australian Olympic Committee, AOC, formerly known as the Australian Olympic Federation, by providing it with a means to derive income by.licensing the use of the insignia and of up to 10 associated registered Olympic designs, which are created by the act forth is specific purpose. As honourable members would no doubt be aware, the participation in, and the hosting of, an Olympic Games is an extremely expensive undertaking. As the host nation for the year 2000 games, Australia will be expending considerable sums. over the next seven years on .the provision of infrastructure, facilities and organisation for this major event. Events of the magnitude of the Olympic Games provide unparalleled business opportunities . for the marketing of products and services. Official Olympic Games sponsors recognise of these opportunities and are willing to pay considerable licence fees to the AOC for the rights to take advantage of these opportunities. Unfortunately, at times like these there are always free riders who wish to exploit the available opportunities without making any contribution. These are. the businesses and organisations which indulge in what is commonly called ambush:marketing, an activity that was certainly rife in Australia around the time of the Barcelona Olympics, and, to a lesser extent, at the time of the Albertville winter Olympics. . The AOC, on behalf of the International Olympic Committee, is naturally concerned that as much as possible should be done to strengthen the protection afforded under the act to the Olympic insignia against this unauthorised commercial exploitation. This would have a twofold benefit. Firstly, it would protect the revenue base of the AOC, the body charged with overseeing Australia's participation in the Olympic Games, and secondly, and perhaps more importantly,' it would ensure that Australia is in a position to assure the International Olympic Committee that Australian law gives effect, to as full an extent as possible, to the obligations of the Olympic charter."" I will now briefly detail the legislative changes made by the' Olympic Insignia Pro,;. tection Amendment Bill. The most technical change made ameilds all references in the act to the federation' to refer instead to the com,;. mittee, as iIi 1990 the Australian Olympic Federation changed its name to the Australian Olympic Committee, or the AOC.· Another' very minor amendment to the fee setting provisions of the act will ensure that the application .fees for. registering designs under the. act; and for extending their protection periods, remain pegged to .the corresponding fees in the Designs Act 1906. The remaining amendments are more substantial and relate directly to the issues of protection, which I have already outlined. The act currently provides that the Registrar of Trade Marks must not register a trademark which comprises or contains .the Olympic motto or, words very similar to the motto. As I stated before, the motto is the Latin citius, altius, fortius. The bill extends this prohibition on the registration to the English translation of the motto-faster, higher, stronger. I referred earlier to the' provision made in the act for the registration of up to 10 Olympic designs. These designs, and the five interlocking tings,ar-designs in which the AOC has' a monopoly and can license. This allows the AOC or the holder of it licence in relation to a prote-ted design to take legal aCtion if the monopoly (in the design. is! infringed. "" The bill seeks to provide protection in much the same way for designs of the Olympic torch and flame. A new design ·of the torch and flame is cOll)missioned foreachOlyrnpic Games-,both winter and summer, So, in term!l of commer-ial advantage to. the AOC, protection of these designs. is required only for a limited period leading up to and following each games .. ' The protection period proposed is from the beginning of three' calendar years before the yearofthe particular games to the end of the year of that games. This provides. a maximum protection period' of four years for any particular design and, because of the structuring of the time periods, minimises the potential for confusion. This is because there will only ever be a maximum of two designs for the Olympic torch and flame for which designs can be registered at the one timeone winter games design and one summer games design-and the overlap period will never exceed one year. The designs for the Olympic torch and flame will be included in the maximum of 10 registered designs allowed by the act currently, as it ensures that when the AOC no longer a has Ii use for logo or design it will pass into the public domain. There will be no provision for extending the period of protection for registered designs of the torch and flame, but it will be possible for the Aoe to apply to have the protection period reduced if mote commercial benefit could be gained from registering other designs as part of the 'portfolio' of 10. I am sure that we are all aware of the existence of trademarks, brand naines and business names which have been operating for many years using the word 'Olympic', or some or 'all of the words comprised in the English translation of the motto, or indeed a representation of what could be an Olympic torch or flame. As there is no intention to acquire the rights which have' accrued, both at common law and in these registrations, or affect existing rights in any way, the bill clearly provides for the preservation of existing - rights. This includes any rights in the torch or flame which may have accrued to ' persons under the related legislative provisions of the Designs Act 1906 or the Trade Marks AcU955 up to the time of the gazettal of the statutory rules prescribing the particular torch and flame design. Gazettal will take place no more than six months before the commencement of the relevant protection period. This will limit the period in which common law riglits, if any, might accrue in relation to the use of the Olympic torch and flame. ' Finally, in recognition of the seriousness of the need for protection against unauthorised commercial exploitation, the bill takes the unusual step of referring potential infringers to the remedies which are available under the Trade Practices Act against I organisations whose conduct is misleading and deceptive and which make false representations as to sponsorship, affiliation or approval. I would like to take this opportunity to urge the AOC, as the body charged withresponsibility for raising funds for participation in the Olympic Games, to make optimum use of the Olympic Insignia Protection' Act 1987, as amended. I would also like to remind the AOC of the value and potential for use of other existing industrial and intellectual property legislative regimes which, after all, are also designed to provide a' degree of market exclusivity and therefore protection. A detailed explanation of the changes made by the bill is contained in the explanatory memorandum. The changes brought about by the bill require no net additional expenditure. I commend this bill. to the'. House and present the explanatory memorandum to this bill. Financial Impact Statement The amendments to the Olympic Insignia Protection Act 1987 have no financial impact. MrRONALDSON (Ballarat) (10.13 a.m.)-The coalition supports the Olympic Insignia Protection' Amendment Bill· 1993. By way of background, in 1990 the Australian Olympic Federation changed its name to the Australian Olympic Committee. This bill amends references to this organisation in the Olympic Insignia Protection Act 1987. Of more, importance are the changes to the protection offered by the bill against so-called ambush marketing. According to media reports, there were instances of products which illegally used the Olympic logo being sold shortly· after Sydney was announced as the host city for the 2000 Olympics. Problems seem to be associated mainly with the detection of offenders, with media reports that the committee had hired private detectives to assist as the police were not iriterested because no criminal offence was being committed. The bill does not address these practical problems but does widen the range of designs which will be protected and attempts to defer potential offenders by directing their attention to the remedies available against them under the Trade Practices Act 1974. Neither the act nor the bill attempts to prohibit the use of the wotds 'Olympic' or 'Olympiad'. According to media reports, calls have been made by the AOC and the Sydney organising committee for such a prohibition. The government, however, believes that the existing use of these words as trademarks, brand names and business names should not be affected. That was referred to in the second reading speech in the Senate. The government decision not to attempt to prohibit the use of these words should also be seen in the light of the High Court decision in Davies and others v. Commonwealth of Australia and another 1988 .. In this case, a provision of the Australian Bicentennial Authority Act 1980, which' purported to prohibit the use of a number of words and expressions, was challenged. The court unanimously found that ,the use oUhe expression in dispute, '200 years', could not be validly restricted by the act. The court held that the expression was a common one which .did not distingllish any particular goods and services. It could therefore not be supported by the trademarks power of, the constitution, nor could any otherhead of power support it.'IJle court did not determine the validity of other words purported to be restricted as to usage by the act, but it is possible that an attempt to restrict the use of the word 'Olympic' could also be successfully challenged- , The purpose of the bill is to amend the Olympic Insignia Protection Act 1987 to provide increased protection against unauthor':' ised commercial exploitation of the Olympic insignia. The Australian Olympic Committee has been endeavouring for. some time to provide far greater protection for the words 'Olympic' and 'Olympiad' but without success. The AOC is of the view'that, until this is addressed, ambush marketing, as it is known, will continue. The AOC does not say that there is anything, wrong with companies gainingcommercial advantage per se but, if they are going to use the property of the AOC and the 10M, they should provide appropriate payment,' which would then contribute to the development and participation of the Olympic team and various programs. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Develtered opment (Mr Lindsay) referred to the use of of this bill. other intellectual property avenues. It is my clear understanding that, in that regard, there have been innumerable and ongoing discusof sions between the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the New South Wales Premier's Department, the Attorneyeven General's Department, the office of intellecOlympic tual property and other organisations to try sort out some of those other possibilities the problems associated with them. I am not too sure whether the parliamentary secretary is aware of anything that happened at the recent COAG meeting, where I believe there were going to be some discussions. I have not heard the outcome of anything that may have been raised; The main provisions of. the bill are as follows. Clause 3 of the bill amends the definition of the act. Several definitions extended, bringing under the protection of bill, firstly, the Olympic motto expressed in English as 'faster, higher, stronger' and, torch design. secondly,'a registered torch and flame design. The protection period for a registered torch and flame design for a particular summer or winter Olympic Games will be the period starting when the design is registered or on the 1 January date that is at least three years but less than four years before the opening of those games, whichever is the later. The protection period ends on 30 December after the closing of those Olympic Games. The bill proposes a definition of 'Olympic artistic work' - which includes a prescribed Olympic torch and flame design under prodate posed section 2A, or an artistic work that incorporates either the Olympic symbol or prescribed torch and flame design. Claus- 4 inserts a proposed new section 2A, which allows for the prescription of a single artistic work of an Olympic torch and. flame for a particular Olympic Games. Such a - egulation maybe made only where the committee is the owner of the copyright of the relevant work. Clause 5. proposes the repeal and replacethat ment of section 6 of the act, which deals the ownership of the Olympic symbol. The committee is taken to be the owner. design of the symbol and any design regisunder the act before the commencement Clause 6 proposes to add subsection 8(9), which provides in relation to an infringement the monopoly in a protected design that a design may be a fraudulent or obvious imitation of a registered torch and flame design if it does not incorporate a pr-scribed torch and flame. Clause 7 proposes to to insert a .new section 9A. The section and provides that remedies under the act are in addition to those provided by the TPA. IThe section is designed to draw attention to the TPA remedies, especially those relating to misrepresentations about sponsorship. Clause 10 proposes to insert a new section ItA, which requires the registrar, on application from the committee, to reduce the protection period of a registered torch and flame design. Clauses 8; 9, 11, 12, 13 and 14 are propose minor technical changes and consethe quential amendments relating to the proposed addition to' the act of a registered flame and Clause 15 proposes to amend section. 20, which preserves existing rights conferred by the Trade Marks Act 1955 and the Designs Act 1906. Subsection 20(2) provides that the aCt does not affectthe use of a symbol on or after a relevant date, where before this date' a person would have been entitled to prevent another person from passing, off goods or services as those of the first mentioned person. The relevant date is inserted by proposed subsection 20(2A) and.is each of the dates of commencement of the act and the bill and the of registration' of a registered torch and flame design. Clause 16 provides that further a amendments are contained in the schedule. As I said before, these replace all references to the 'federa:tion- with 'committee'. I mentioned earlier that considerable discussions have been taking place at a'very sel1ior level concerning proposals to develop, the protection of the words surrounding the Olympics and other matters. It is important in context for the government to ensurethat with the competing· interests of those who are involved in this matter do not let it become a of the matter of sports politics. The coalition is extremely concerned that there be appropriate protection for the bodies that have interests in this matter. We are extremely mindful of the position faced by the AOC to provide significant and proper recognition for what is, after all, its design and to ensure that it is able to maximise the financial. benefits that flow from it. At the same time, we are appreciative of the fact that other groups also have an interest in the words. 'I want to speak briefly on a matter that is of great concern to the coalition. It relates the question of the ongoing conduct of not only the Olympic program but also the sports program in government. My friend and colleague the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr), ,who was very eloquent in his praise of my bipartisan approach to this matter yesterday, might throw me to the lions for these comments. I am extremely concerned about, the proposals and the ministerial arrangements announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) following the resignation of the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly) as Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. There appears to be great concern amongst the, sporting community as to who has the conduct of the sports policy. Considering the extraordinary workload of Senator Richardson, ,I fail to see how he can possibly devote the requisite amount of time to the portfolio. Mr Simmons-He is a very capable minister.",17
8,Mr RONALDSON,OLYMPIC INSIGNIA PROTECTION,"Even a man of Senator Richardson's self-confessed tireless dedication to his duties would find it extraordinarily difficult to add the sports portfolio 'that of health and the environment. Senator Faulkner, with whom I served on the Library Committee in this place, is relatively new to the portfolio. Without in any way detracting from his abilities, which I am sure are numerous, it is my understanding that he is already the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel and Manager of Government Business in the Senate. On anyone's reading, they are quite 'significant commitments. I am sure that Senator Faulkner will again be required ,to give his undivided attention and total commitment to those areas, which will potentially leave this extremely important area languishing. I do not think one person in Australia would not say that the Sydney 2000 Olympics presents the greatest challenge that this country has had since Federation. If we do it properly, there is an enormous ability and potential for us to set ourselves up for the next 100 years. I am not referring to the likes of me or the parliamentary secretary; I am to referring to the young, people of' Australia, whom we should be representing in this country and in this place. If we do it properly, they will come out of this well ahead and we will have set them up 'for the,' rest of their lives. If we do not do it properly, then I think we, are wasting an extraordinary opportunity. We must ensure that these are an Ausltalian Olympics. I am sure that the people of New South Wales do not want it to become a purely Sydney or New South Wales Olympics. They must be an Australian Olympics and there must be an opportunity for everyone, right throughout the country, to benefit from the extraordinary pluses that will arise from them. There are many areas throughout Australia that can potentially benefit from the games through tourism. The coalition would like to see a minister properly placed to be able to coordinate what is going to be required for the games. If the economic and tourism questions are not properly handled and not properly targeted then there will be an extraordinary waste of potential resources. I know that my friend and colleague the honourable onto member for Calare (Mr Simmons) has some comments to make. I thank the House for the opportunity to speak on this matter.",21
9,Mr SIMMONS,OLYMPIC INSIGNIA PROTECTION,"'-As we have heard from previous speakers, the scope of the Olympic Insignia Protection Amendment Bill is rather limited. Mr Deputy Speaker, with your indulgence-and I am sure the shadow minister for youth, sport and recreation, the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson), will have no objection,......I will widen my remarks beyond the essential scope of this bill. The bill offers some important elements of protection against so-called ambush marketing. We saw no better instance of such marketing than at the time of the announcement on 23 September last year of the successful bid for the 2000 Olympics. I was overseas on government business at the time. When those scenes of euphoria, including the celebrations at the Rocks and Darling Harbour in particular, were shown on television screens throughout the world one could not help noticing that some lurk merchants were quick to take advantage of the situation with particular merchandise. Obviously, any major logo is and should be subject to appropriate protection. I had the privilege of serving as a government member on the board of the Australian Bicentennial Authority from about May 1983 to about April 1989. From that experience, I am aware of the issues relating to the protection of important logos, such as the one used at the time, and the opportunities for unscrupulous people to take advantage of the situa-ion. Obviously, one of the major elements of this bill has quite profound implications for protection against ambush marketing. Looking through the Hansard records of the debates in the House, I noticed that in October last year the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) moved a motion commending the various levels of government for their success· in gaining the 2000 Olympics for Sydney. As the shadow minister has pointed out, the Olympics Games are going to be held in the city of Sydney but they should be viewed as an Australian event. The honourable member for Reid referred to the probable impact of the games· on the municipality of Auburn in his electorate. He noted that the Homebush site, as a nonrateable area, would mean the loss of some $6.5 million in rates in Auburn between now and the year 2000. I know from my ministerial experience as the minister for government the significance of that particular . sum to the budgeting and accounting procedures for local authorities; This forgone revenue would obviously seriously affect the provision of important local services to the area. In debating his motion the honourable member for Reid called on the state government in particular, but also the federal authorities, to recognise this problem. , He noted also that the unemployment rate within the division of Reid, and particularly the Auburn area, had reached 25 per cent. He said that this very high level of joblessness would clearly need to be addressed in 'the lead-up to the Olympics in the year 2000. I noticed also that he referred to the need to source a significant amount of infrastructure materials in Australia and with local building companies. These are sentiments that lam sure would be shared by all honourable members· in this House. I believe that these twin effects on the municipality of Auburn, which lies at the very heart of the site of the year 2000 Olympic Games, provide an important pointer to broader issues which will affect the whole of the state of New South Wales and, to a lesser extent, the whole nation. The issues to which I particularly refer are, first, the need to ensure that the range of public infrastructure and serviees which the community reasonably expects to be provided continues to be provided at acceptable levels and standards in the years leading up to the games. In other words, that public works spending is not diverted from other areas of the budget-such as schools, transport, health or elsewhere within the same portfolio; I have a particular interest in country roads-to road projects around the Olympic sites. I think that is an important issue to raise. I will cite one instance. Since 1990, when, the Premiers Conference by agreement decided that from this particular year rQad funding to the states would be untied, there have been opportunities for state governments to divert resources. We all accept that governments from time to time do come under significant pressures and, as someone once commented, 'The urgent always replaces the important local issue'. In that sense, as the games creep up on us, the temptations for state governments to do this sort of thing will clearly increase. Secondly, there is the need to ensure that, to the greatest possible extent, Australian companies and Australian products are ,used at all stages in the preparations for. the year 2000 Olympics and in all services and' proThe ducts available for sale prior to and during games. Nothing would offend me more-as well as,1 hope, a lot of other members in House and I am sure the general public-than to buy merchandise that clearly was aimed highlighting the profile of the year 2000 Olympic Games and see that it was made in another country. I believe·these are important points which. deserve to be considered in association with today's debate. As I said at the outset, the Olympic Insignia Protection Amendment Bill touches on such issues in only a small way, in that it amends the Olympic Insignia Protection Act extend copyright protection to the Olympic motto and to the torch and flame design. The act's very existence and the fact that we are taking the care here today to amend it in way provides strong support for the wider principle that we should take great care protect these matters intimately related to successfulst-ging of the games to ensure that this wonderful opportunity, which the honourof able member for Ballarat, highlighted, yields country. the greatest good for Australia as a whole. It has been rightly said that suchmatteis are, first and foremost, the responsibility the government of New South Wales which, along with the city of Sydney, is primarily responsible for the organisation and the staging of the 2000 Olympics. Indeed"" the state legislation which has been passed in order to establish the Sydney organising committee for the Olympic Games includes a provision that the committee in its dealings will: . "" use its best enqeavours to ensure that, preferway ence .is given to the use of Australian goods, services and materials. However, that should. not prevent the C()mmonwealth from doing everything in its power to ensure that ,similar principles are ,upheld throughout the nation. Indeed, I believe we should be doing just that. I fully support a resolution that was the subject of some debate within my own party branch in Bathurst which,in part, urged: . "" legislation be passed regarding the. making in Austra,lia of souvenirs and everything that or sold in Australia in relation to the Olympic Games in the year 2(){j(). benefits of doing so should not be undetthe stated, given the estimates that are already available for the impact of the games on the this national economy. For instance, KPMG Peat Marwick has estimated that the Olympics are at likely to create 156,000 jobs and inject some $7 billion into the national economy between 1991 and 2004. Sydney is expected to benefit from at least half of that amount .of money, with the rest being spread throughout other parts of New South Wales and Australia. I commend to the House the comments of the shadow minister when he raised the issue of the impact of tourism. There are areas 1987 to immediately adjacent to the Sydney metropolitan area that I am sure will provide opportunities for great day trips for many of our visitors, both' in the lead-up and in the this period subsequent to the Olympic Games. As we are a long haul destination for internationto al travellers, many people who come to this the country either prior to or after the Olympic Games will take the opportunity to visit many our major attractions throughout this It is not just the games for Sydney. It is the games for North Queensland. It is the games of for other capital cities throughout Australia. It is the games for the benefit of our' great wilderness areas such as Kakadu National Park,parts of Tasmania and many other areas bf Australia. I know that,'as the member for an electorate less than three hours drive from Sydney-it is less than three hours drive; as '1' have alluded to in this House before, as a result of $120 million worth of funds poured into the upgrade of the Great Western Highthrough the national arterials and provincialcities and rural highways programs-:-the cities and towns throughout the electorate of Calare are already planning to ensure that they receive an appropriate slice of the action. We should not forget the federal government's contribution to the games' bid and our continuing contribution to a successful staging of the games. This government contributed $5 inillion of the $24 million that it cost to stage Sydney's bid, making us one of the biggest is used contributors. We have already contributed $150 million to the New South Wales government to assist in the development of the games facilities themselves. I dD not regard that as a CDst tD gDvernment. That, tD me, is mDney well spent. It is an investment in spDrting and tDurism infrastructure that will benefit not 'only Sydney but the natiDn as whDle. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has alsD assured the HDuse that the CDmmDnwealth will cDntinue tD wDrk cDDperatively with the gDvernment 'of New South Wales in the many things that need tD be dDne between nDW and the year 2000.

There is no room for error, and complacent officials should not be used on this project. These Olympics will be the first impact of Australia for the majority of the world's nations. We have one chance for a favourable first impression. We must not lose this chance by allowing ourselves to be guided by less than useful Australian personnel and national characteristies. I commend this bill to the House.",24

IMMIGRATION (GUARDIANSHIP OF CHILDREN) AMENDMENT. BILL 1993 Consideration resumed from 21 February. Second Reading",25
12,Dr THEOPHANOUS,OLYMPIC INSIGNIA PROTECTION,"CalwellParliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Human and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) (10.45 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill amends the Immigration (Guardian:' ship of Children) Act 1946 to preclude certain non-citizen children from coming under the guardianship of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. The bill also provides for the 'declaring', by gazettal notice, of states and territories once complementary state and territory legislation is enacted. Complementary state and territory legislation will, therefore, be required to provide guardianship care for those non-citizen children who will no longer come under the guardianship of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs upon their· entry into Australia for the purposes of adoption. Presently, the act places certain non-citizen children entering Australia under the guardianship of the Minister for Immigration the and Ethnic Affairs, principally these being children who enter Australia for adoption, including those children who have been adopted overseas but whose. adoption is not recognised in Australia, and children who enter Australia as unaccompanied refugee minors. In relation to children entering Australia for adoption, guardianship powers of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs are immediately delegated to the relevant state or territory welfare administrators by instrument of delegation under subsection 5(1) of the act. The bill gives effect, as far as the Commonwealth is able, to an understanding between the Commonwealth, states and territories in 1990 that state and territory governments would amend legislation to enable them to assume guardianship care for those children entering Australia for the purposes of adoption. The amended legislation will not preclude the specified children from the guardianship of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs until states and territories have been 'declared' by gazettal notice. The bill is premised on the fact that a 'declaration' will not be made until the' Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs is satisfied that adeql.late guardianship coverage exists for all children in all circumstances. The provisions of this bill will not impact the costs of administering the migration program. I commend this bill to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill ..",25
13,Mr RUDDOCK,OLYMPIC INSIGNIA PROTECTION,"Berowra) (10.48 a.m.)Colleagues might be grateful to learn that this legislation has the support of the opposition and I will not be calling any divisions on the matter. I understand that in relation to my own responsibilities there seems to be an expectation that that might always be so. The Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Amendment Bill 1993 is non-controversial. We will not be opposing it. It proposes to transfer the guardianship powers of certain non-citizen children from the federal minister to state and territory governments. That does not seem unreasonable, although I hope that cooperative approach is something that the states will recognise has been undertaken by the Commonwealth and that they will build on that in developing appropriate regimes for ensuring that there can be a prompt assessment of overseas countries who are prepared to allow Australians to adopt children in their jurisdictions. Likewise, I hope that the state and territory governments will cooperate readily in developing an effectiveCommonwealth regime, one which is not fraught with bureaucracy but one which is very much more efficient .in ensuring that, where adoptions are desired and where it is in the best interests of children where the Australian parties who are jnvolved are good and appropriate folk who satisfy the normal criteria here for adoption, we are able to. satisfy their needs, recognising that in Australia there is a shortage of children available for adoption and that in many other countries there are. possibilities where Australian parents could· benefit and likewise young children benefit. But,as I saia, in the spirit of cooperation, state and territory governments will be able to assume guardianship when children have been declared by gazettal by the minister, after he is satisfied that state and territory legislation is in place to ensure adequate guardianship arrangements exist on their arrival. It is envisaged that the guardianship powers will be assumed by those state government officials who currently exercise the delegation of the Commonwealth minister, but it will be up to those individual states· and territories to determine who under their legislation will assume this role. The bill does provide legislative arrangements to formalise what is, in fact, the current· practice. "" Under the current provisions of the Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Act 1946, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has guardianship of non-citizen children, including those entering Australia for adoption, and unaccompanied refugee minors. In practice, the minister immediately delegates his powers, as has been said, of guardianship of adoptive non-citizen children to the relevant state or territ-ry welfare administrator. There have been exceptions to this practice, the most noticeable of which being the baby Kajal case when the then minister, Senator Ray, intervened in the state adoption' process by exercising his guardianship powers despite his delegation of his role as guardian to the relevant Victorian welfare administrator. The minister, as guardian, ·ordered the child be returned to prospective parents pending determination of the case. The state government had sought to have the child placed with foster parents in that'particular instance. The failure to follow the usual delegatory procedures in the baby Kajal case raises conc.erns and from state governments about interference of federal government in adoption procedures which come essentially under their jurisdiction. In October 1986 the Council of Social Welfare Ministers and the then Minister for Immigration· and Ethnic Affairs made a number of major decisions· relating to the Australian inter-country adoption program. One decision was that the Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Act continue to be used to provide guardianship protection for overseas children adopted by Australians on entering Australia for the purposes of adoption. Since that time the Kajal case has highlighted some of the problems of state and territory officers in exercising the guardianship powers and functions of the federal minister. Following a review into the federal government's guardianship powers an understanding was reached by the Commonwealth and state governments in 1990. This bill is the legislation by which the federal government will implement this understanding. Complementary legislation will be required by states and territories. There will bea need for ongoing discussions between state and federal governments about details of the complementary state and territory legislation, such as ensuring commonality of definitions such as 'pemianent resident'. However, these are not part of the objectives of this bill, rather they will be negotiated between the states, territories and the federal government on an individual basis. As I said, the coalition does support this bill, given the current practice. But I ought to say that having previously held some responsibility as shadow minister for immigration and ethnic affairs I was not comfortable with a lot of the secrecy that is involved in dealing with issues of adoptions.' It is perhaps. the need for cooperative approaches between the Commonwealth and states, and meetings involving state welfare ministers in the various practices that states seek to put in place, that probably leads to this difficulty in being able to find out a great deal about the practhose tices..., - this does give reason for concern from time to time. There was an occasion in which Western Australia, for instance, had an inquiry into the question of overseas adoptions. A lot of the difficulty that prompted the former government to undertake this inquiry arose· from legitimate concerns flowing from early Australian practices in relation to domestic adoptions involving Aboriginal children where they were, in some cases, removed from their families and placed in foster parent situations within Australia. A whole host of questions arose about the appropriate cultural practices that were pursued in relation to those particularadoptions. The assumption that the culture of the dominant population here in Australia was more appropriate and beneficial is a matter that has been quite seriously contested. These are practices that would not be conducted in Australia today. There is a much greater understanding of the need for children to know a great deal of their background, their family situation and their culture. That is important for their self-esteem in terms of their upbringing. From this has flowed a view, which has troubled me, that it is inappropriate to al10w overseas adoptions because behind it there are some assumptions that Australian parents presumably see their culture as, in some way, superior and that they are doing a favour by arranging adoptions, I suppose, for families from overseas that are unable to adequately provide for their children. The view is often put that it would be preferable for those Australian parents who would like to .have an overseas adopted child to give funds to aid organisations to satisfy, in some circumstances, their need for a family so the children can continue to be brought up in their home situation. It is almost fantasy to suggest that people who are anxious to adopt a child would in fact give over the moneys that they would otherwise spend on that child to assist families overseasas much as I and my own family do spend some of our own resources in assisting children overseas through a number of aid organisations herein Australia. It is naive to assume that we could increase funds dramatical1y by curtailing over. seas adoptions here in Australia. Yet, I think that view is seriously put. This legislation is important because it puts beyond argument, I hope, that there is a proper place for intercountry adoptions and that guardianship is an important part of that, and we provide for it legislatively. I take this opportunity to raise some concerns in relation to inter-country adoptions generally, because we have seen inter-country adoptions in Australia in quite a significant way since the early 1970s. I understand we have something like 10,000 children who have been adopted from overseas by Australian families. Inter-couritry adoption is a upon which children for whom there is no suitable care in their own country may enter into a family situation here in Australia where the better provision will be made for them in a physical sense and, hopefully, where there will be a caring family environment that will support .those children. It is not an easy situation. There are young people who often face the crisis of having been abandoned, relinquished or orphaned and who often face the potential of long-term institutional care. I have heard of quite tragic situations in particular countries, and I do not want to be pejorative in suggesting that in some countries these problems are· greater than in others because we know that there are children even in our own country who have been abandoned. In countries that have faced civil war, and in countries that have faced drought, there are often situations where parents cannot provide for their children so they leave. them on a hospital doorstep, or sometimes even in rubbish bins around the hospital, in the hQpe that they might be picked up· and some care will be provided to them. That abandonment is common, and the life that that child might face is something that· obviously. no-one would want. 'The long-term·institutional care in a country that has limited resources and limited capacity to provide that care can be quite difficult. So the concept of inter-country adoption is that ,life with a loving family is better than an institutional arrangement in any country. This is recognised in the preamble to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child which states: . . .. that the child, for the full and harmonious development of his or her personality, should grow up in a family environment, in an atmosphere of happiness, love and understanding. Australia does have an excellent reputation for intercountry adoption, largely free of any scandal. Parents are carefully vetted and very often most comprehensively briefed on overseas adoption matters. No approved program in Australia condones or participates in baby trafficking. Australian governments, through our immigration .laws, have ensured that children who basis come to Australia come only from approved sources.· This approval does depend upon satisfying Australian authorities that children are generally available for adoption. I complained earlier-and I do not resile from that-about the time that it often takes to undertake those investigations and approvals, the lack of resources to ensure that Australian officials are able to do so and the difficulty that is occasioned when we have to involve a number of governments, state and federal, in that process. A number of organisations in Australia take an interest in these matters. The Australian Intercountry Adoption Network, AICAN, is particularly concerned about the government's lack of response to a Joint Standing Committee on Migration Reglllations report of December.1992. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Dr Theophanous), who is at the table, was the chairman of that committee. which. inquired into the issue of conditional migrant entry and the health rules.",26
14,Dr THEOPHANOUS,OLYMPIC INSIGNIA PROTECTION,That's right.,28
15,Mr RUDDOCK,OLYMPIC INSIGNIA PROTECTION,"I think the parliamentary secretary is taking a degree of credit for this report; I heard him say, 'That's right' with a degree of enthusiasm. This inquiry, conducted by members from both sides of the parliament, Was undertaken in an unusually cooperative spirit of bipartisanship. But, obviously, now that the parliamentary secretary has joined the e:1(ecutive,he does not seem to have been able to join with his colleagues to give occasion to any sense of urgency in responding to this report. It may surprise honourable members to note that a section in this report on page 84 deals with intercountry adoptees. The committee received a number of submissions-one from AICAN and another from another notable organisation, the Australian Society for Intercountry Aid of Children, ASIAC. This organisation said that we ought to take a special approach in adopting children who have some special needs. The organisation said: It is at best insensitive, and· at worse morally culpable, for Australia to expect to take from relinquishing countries (which are necessarily among the most needy in the world) only the most healthy orphaned or abandoned children, leaving those countries with the sole responsibility for caring for the less healthy children. In a submission from a Mr and Mrs Rollings, adoptive parents of a blind Taiwanese boy who was eventually granted entry following appeal to the Immigration Review Tribunal, the theme was continued. They said: We cannot encourage acceptability of people with disabilities within our own community, and at the same time only allow the adoption of perfect blueribbon babies from overseas. The general thrust of those submissions was accepted by the committee in its recommendations. The committee concluded: Recognising the essentially self-limiting nature of the intercountry adoption program, the Committee was sympathetic towards permitting greater flexibility in interpreting the health rules, to consideration to be given to financial and other circumstances which might outweigh the less positive aspects arising from a disability or medical condition. This flexibility should only apply to cases where there is no potential risk to public health, the relevant State welfare authority is satisfied that the intending parents are suited to the task of parenting the particular disabled child, and appropriate guarantees of financial support are provided: The committee went on to recommend that: . . . in determining whether to grant an adoption visa or entry permit to a disabled adoptive child who cannot satisfy the health criteria, the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs consider the. financial· and other family support able to be provided by the adoptive family and the circumstances of the adoptive 'child, particularly whether ,these factors could outweigh any likely costs to the community or' access to community resources in short supply. In such cases, the entry or stay should be approved' only where appropriate guarantees of support can be provided and where the relevant State welfare authorities have· approved. the intending adoptive parents as capable of parenting the child. A numbers of organisations-and AICAN is one-are particularly concerned about, the government's lack of response to the migration committee's report, and I think justifiably so. Findings of the Australian Government Health Service relating to migrant entry are generally non-appealable, even though other matters can be the subject of appeal. On humanitarian grounds, I think it is proper that the minister ought to be in a position to consider. those cases where children suffer some minor health difficulties and parents are able to meet the cost and guarantee to do so. The parliamentary secretary, who introduced the bill, is listed to speak later in the debate. If he does not, he may close the debate. He may be able to give us some assurances on this matter and to ten us how this report has progressed. I am sure that he is across the detail of these matters, having chaired the committee that reported in December 1992. He would not want to let those important recommendations be stood aside through lack of application or attention on the government's part. It may surprise honourable members that enable issues of intercountry adoption can be of such great moment, but a large number of people are concerned about these matters. AICAN has some other concerns, which I think the parliamentary secretary should take on board and raise with his minister. One of them is the lack of efficient consultative measures between the government and non-government bodies in relation to intercountry adoptions. An aspect of great concern to me is that an organisation like AICAN, which has in it people whom I know to be of very considerable reputation, with undoubted capacity and very wen informed on these matters, has generally been excluded from the processes in which these matters are considered. I think there ought to be a basis upon which these bodies can be involved. Non-government organisations are generally an intricate part of the administration of intercountry adoptions. They are very often able to offer views on the situation in countries in which they are working. NGOs involved in the administration of intercountry adoption fonned a national network in order to coordinate their views, making it very easy for the government to obtain them. Non-gove'rnment organisations also offer a valuable resource to the government. They have unique knowledge which, because of their experience in the field over very long periods, is often generally better than the knowledge of administrators from government bodies who, given the basis upon which promotion often occurs in government, are involved in these activities for rt<lativelyshort periods. If there is mobility .in the Public Service, very often there is no institutional knowledge. People have to look up files rather than have any particular understanding of the issues. People involved in nongovernment organisations tend to have longer periods of interest and, therefore, skill and experience that they can draw upon. I am sure the parliamentary secretary would like to brief the parliament on the way in which AICAN particularly, with its very considerable experience, might be able to be used in a much more positive way by government. I tell the parliamentary secretary that AICAN does believe that completely unsatisfactory decisions are being made, sometimes on the basis of inadequate and inaccurate information because there are inappropriate and ineffective consultative mechanisms in place at this time. That is what it believes I would hope that the government might adcfress those concerns. I have taken an interest particularly in the very long period of time that it took the government to· respond to the willingness of a country such as Ethiopia to allow intercountry adoptions. Senior officers from the department were sent overseas many years ago. Certain reports that ought to have been acted upon were left largely in abeyance and when people got around. to considering the matter again, almost a fresh round of visits .was requ,ired. One of the things that troubled me with this matter' was that the· government of Ethiopia, which was quite prepared to facilitate intercountry adoptions, itself became concerned about the' inadequacy of our bureaucracy to respond in a timely fashion and about the extent to which we had to go back over the matter again, with the same questions being asked. We come to a situation such as obtained in Romania. We were all challenged by what happened in Romania and the large number of people who were in institutions, separated from families. People in Australia wanted to respond to those needs: We had newspaper articles such as 'A mother's heartbreak: Tasmanian couple flies out to get a Romanian child who may not be let in'. It is a fact that the response from Australia was essentially slow and tardy, yet the response from New Zealand, which does not have the problem of being a federation, was very much quicker. The Tasmanian couple had to look to move to New Zealand so that they could in fact adopt that Romanian child. New Zealand did have an adoption program with Romania. I think it is important that this matter not be seen as a backwater in the department. I think it is a matter that requires somebody's taking hold of it and saying, 'I'm going to do something about sorting out this problem'. I think it requires the federal minister to provide leadership. I am not suggesting that it should be done in a non-cooperative way, but this matter requires the leadership that comes from being acroSs the issues, understanding them, understanding the motives of the people who and are involved arid understanding the particular interests of the states, but facilitating the cooperative arrangements. I think people need to be much more open than they have been about the way in which these' processes are undertaken. I think it is important that organisations that have this experience and background, particularly the non-government organisations, be involved in a proper, consultative way in assisting the government. I believe they are willing. I believe they have the experience and the capacity. I do not believe the people I have met are irresponsible. Very often, they are people who have worked for government in other guises. The name of one of the ladies I know, who is involved in this process and is a leading member of this organisation in a voluntary capacity, appears on .substantial reports tabled in this parliament from other government departments. We are not speaking about people who lack credibility, ability or knowledge, yet they seem to be marginalised in this matter. I have known numbers of people who have adopted children from overseas. I am aware of the very happy homes they provide and the way in which· they work. I know senior ministers in New South Wales· who have adopted children. A former member of my own staff adopted a child from Korea. I se.e that situation on a regular basis. I think it brings considerable benefit to the families involved, who have often suffered emotionally because they have not been able to have children of their own, and it brings very considerable benefit to the children who come into that loving family relationship. I would hope that the prejudices borne out of some very inadequate experiences in this country in the past do not jeopardise a program of this sort. I hope people in government will give it the priority it deserves and that it will not be marginalised because of the government's failure to provide the resources to deal with other difficult questions in. the immigration area-the refugee determination matters that we have addressed at other times, the decision making in relation to Chinese students or whatever. I hope those sorts· of issues do not mean that an important question such as this is put to one side because we have other priorities. I thank the House for giving me an opportunity to put some of the views I hold on this matter and I hope the parliamentary secretary wiU be able to give Ii comprehensive brief on the consideration of this report, outstanding now for almost a year and a half, and the implementation of its recommendations.",28
16,Mr FERGUSON,OLYMPIC INSIGNIA PROTECTION,"Reid) (11.16 a.m.)...,.I will not detain the House for very long in what has been, before the previous contribution, essentially a recitation by speakers in both houses of the nature of the bill and a series of statements of agreement with it. The Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Amendment Bill 1993, as has been detailed by many other speakers in both houses, especially amends the 1946 legislation. Its thrust is to avoid some non-citizen children coming within the minister's guardianship. . As detailed earlier, it essentially arises from discussions and agreement in 1990 to legislate for what is a reality, the reality being the primary role of the state governments of Australia in this sphere. It really does operate what basically simultaneously happens on entry to this country, that guardianship does revert to the state authorities. I join with the previous. speaker, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), in expressing concern over the fact that, in a matter on which he obviously displayed great knowledge, there has been delay by the government in answering the report· of December 1992. I am sure that, with the activity of the Parliamentary Secretary to the . Minister for Housing,·Local Government and Human Services (Dr Theophanous) and the honourable member's own continued presence and activity on the joint standing. committee, these matters can be brought to fruition. As I said, I do not want to dwell on what is, essentially, necessary legislation. Amongst the necessary ingredients is a continued preparedness by the state governments to try to ensure that legislation has a degree of uniformity so that we do not have a wide variation of practices around the country in what is, as has been noted earlier, an area that can be very traumatic. for the individuals involved. I think we also have to be aware that there should be a balance. It is aU right to say that New Zealand may be more expeditious than Australia in these matters, but New Zealand is one country that I would not be too inclined to give much recognition to on immigration practices, as on a variety of fronts they actually constitute a bit of a problem for this country. As I say, there is a need for balance there. On the one hand there needs to be an understanding that, whether it be orphans in Afghanistan, children in Romanian clinics or the result of droughts in Africa, there is a wide variety of children who can obtain a far better life in this country. On the other hand, we have to recognise that many of these countries, and others not quite facing those crises, are also negligent or lack facilities to ensure the proper maintenance of a variety of paperwork. Their laws are often ignored by their own internal citizens. There can .be attempts to utilise the sentiments and the. charity of Australian citizens to subvert, for mercenary purposes, this area of adoption. It is all right to say there have been protracted delays, that people have not had enough from officers in the field and that it is taking too long. All of that can on occasion. be correct. To just say that it is simply a matter of people in Australia wanting to do things tomorrow afternoon and then being readily accommodated by the Australian and state authorities is to simplify the problem. As detailed by the previous speaker, we also have to be constantly aware-and we are because of the changing nature of Australia,. of the needs of the children involved. Often they can have continuing relationships with people in other countries and. need their kind of cultural background. Their reality also has to be accommodated by the parents who adopt them. In state .practices, that should continue to be stressed in the direction of those policies. The legislation has been agreed to by all political parties. It is non-controversial. It basically inaugurates, by legislation, what fundamentally already exists. I commend the bill to the House. '",31
17,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,OLYMPIC INSIGNIA PROTECTION,"Maranoa) {11.21 a.m.r. '--It is my pleaSure today to speak on the Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Amendmept Bill. The National and Liberal parties will be supporting the passage of this legislation. The bill precludes children entering Australia for adoption from coming under the guardianship of the Commonwealth Minister for Immigration and EthniC Affairs. Assuming the states and territories enact complementary legislation, such children in the future will come under the guardianship of the relevant state or territory authority. Under current arrangements, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has guardianship of non-citizen children, including those entering Australia for adoption and unaccompaniedrefugee minors. In practice, the minister immediately delegates his powers of guardianship to the relevant state or territory welfare administrator on the arrival in Australia of adoptive non-citizen children. Such practices have not always been followed. The high profile 'baby Kajal' case of that some years ago revealed the capacity of the federal minister to intervene in the states' supervision of adopted children. Despite having delegated guardianship to the Victorian welfare administrator, the then immigration minister intervened on the basis of his own guardianship powers and ordered that the child be returned to the prospective parents. The Victorian government had sought to have the child placed with foster parents. Surely the conflict between what the Victorian government wanted to do and what the Commonwealth was seeking-in this case, the minister-was certainly not in the best interests of the welfare of the child concerned. Aside from the rights and wrongs of the baby Kajal case, the incident did reveal the capacity of the existing legislation to provide for overlapping jurisdictions-a situation which clearly has the potential to cause confusion and hurt to those closely involved in such cases. Obviously the situation needed remedy. In 1990 the Commonwealth and state governments reached an understanding resolving the overlap of authority, and this legislation effectively implements that understanding. However, the issue of adoptive children from other countries .is an emotionally exhausting one. I hope that this legislation will, in some small measure, simplify the process to remove a potential barrjer to the coming together of children and their new parents in a very happy environment. . I sincerely hope that the intention displayed by the government in introducing this legislation carries through to other areas of immigration administration. The introduction of this legislation displays an interest in simplification, in compassion and in reason, which is long overdue. It has been a concern of mine for some time that these qualities were in very short supply within the government and its immigration department. Like most members, I receive countless requests each year to assist constituents with immigration matters. A large proportion simply involve assistance with the filling out of forms and the supply of information. Some, however, seek out assistance when their· applications for residency or the extension of visas, whatever the case may be, are rejected. Sadly, some of these applications appear to be soundly based, often resolving a family crisis or reflecting a genuine humanitarian .need. But, on a technicality, on a minute administrative detail, they fail. There are clearly many applications for permanent or temporary residency that are spurious and that deserve to be knocked back. Such applications are not my concern .. However it does concern me that, in seeking to keep out those responsible for spurious and unwarranted applications, we are imposing a regime so inflexible and so stringent that innocent people, with genuine needs and with no hidden agendas, are put through unnecessary trauma. and distress. The government's extraordinary attention to detail with regard to individual cases has unfortunately not always been carried into other immigration related areas ..The ill-fated ELICOS scheme, which attracted thousands of people to Australia for short-term language courses, was an unmitigated disaster, largely due to the absence of scrutiny and poor administration. There must surely, somewhere, be middle ground. We should be able to couple the desire to assist those who require residency for genuinely sound or humanitarian reasons with the need to deal hastily with those who do not deserve or require residency. Finding that compromise is no small task, and I do not offer a solution on this occasion. I do, however, encourage the government to continue the path it has charted with the legislation before the House today, and to continue to work towards a simplified and flexible. approach to immigration .matters which would not endanger the integrity of our immigration system. . To this end; I would like to raise today a recent case in Queensland which was brought to my attention. Fortunately, it seems that case will be successfully resolved. The constituent in question had requested an extension of a temporary entry visa for a period of three to six months. The circumstances surrounding the need for the extension were tragic. The constituent, an elderly European woman, had arrived in Australia to visit her daughter and son-in-law and their four small children. During her visit, her daughter suddenly died, leaving a distraught husband and four very sad and confused children- The children's grandmother has put aside her own grief for the last few months and cared for the children, allowing the husband time .to tidy his affairs in preparation for the day when they will all return to their homeland to rebuild their shattered lives. On first inquiring whether her temporary entry visa could be extended, she was verbally informed by an officer of the immigration department that it could be but it would not be. According to the officer, such visas could be extended only if there was a new circumstance requiring the applicant to stay tn the country. The officer did not regard the tragic circumstances of this case as reason enough to grant an extension. The department acknowledged the children's growing attachment to their grandmother and their obvious need for her love and care but, as the children's need for their grandmother's care had not actually increased, the department could not technically grant an extension. I find that quite amazing. Incidentally, there was no doubt regarding the entire family's desire to leave Australia as soon as possible. The woman had rejected the possibility of applying for permanent residency on the grounds that the whole farriily would soon depart for their homeland. . My office took up this woman's case with the department and stressed the emotional damage that would be wreaked on these young lives if their source of love and support was again taken from them. The department again acknowledged this but suggested the children could be placed in child care if the woman returned to Europe. This suggestion revealed a complete lack of compassion and this empathy that Ifoundrepulsive. I trust it was an isolated incident which does not reflect on the immigration department as a whole.· ' I approached the minister for immigration in relation to this matter. I sincerely thank Senator Bolkus and his staff for their assistance.The minister was able to ensure that this woman's case was assessed fairly, according to the relevant circumstances. As a result, the woman's visa is likely to be extended and her family will be 'spared further trauma. This decision was a common sense and rational one. I again thank the senator and his staff for it. However, it is unfortunate that it took the involvement of several third parties to achieve it. I am sure honourable members could recount similar examples which demonstrate the need to combine a touch of humanity with the abunQance of regulation needed to retain the integrity of our immigration system. I do not believe that this is an impossible dream. I urge the government to take up thechallenge. In conclusion,. as the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) has said, the opposition will be supporting the thrust of bill. It has been a great pleasure to speak on this bill. I hope that in summing uP. the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Dr Theophanous) takes on board some of the points that I have raised. I am sure there are other areas in which there needs to be some more flexibility, without compromising the integrity of the immigration system. Dr THEO·PHANOUS (Cal wellParliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Human Services and Parliamentary Secretary to the Mitiister for Health) (11.33a.in.)-in reply-I thank those honourable members who have participated in the debate on the Immigration (Guardianship of Childre,n) Amendment Bill. As the honourable - ember for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) knows, I have been concerned with this matter for a number of years. At one stage it reached the point where I got into open conflict with a state. minister in relation to this issue. One of the concerns that I had was the ad hoc nature of assessments being made by some state authorities in relation to whether parents were eligible to adopt children from overseas. This legislation is intended to streamline the process. Essentially now it has shifted the full responsibility-most of which was with the states anyway-onto the state and territory governments, particularly onto their welfare ministers, to ensure that Australia has a reasonable inter:-country adoption system. I will be very interested to see how they meet that responsibility. The Commonwealth's role is now quite small. . Essentially, because inter-country adoption is a state and territory welfare matter, it is important that as far as possible states and territories have some· uniformity in their approaches to this issue. For exa:mple, I know that they are having discussions on the arrangements with specific countries such as Ethiopia, as has been. mentioned by the honourable member for Berowra. There is a council of state and territory welfare ministers. At meetings of that council, the ministers work out general approaches in relation to specific countries for the whole of this Australia, on a state and territory basis-to the extent that they can work them out, of course. It is to be hoped that as a result of this new cooperative approach we can get rid of bottlenecks and create a situation in which the inter-country adoption process improves dramatically in this country. Given the very sad situations around the world of children languishing in very high poverty level orphanages, a number of countries are quite happy to allow them to be adopted by loving parents in Austra:lia. There is no reason why we should not accommodate that and, as a nation, do whatever we can to make that process work. As the honourable member for Berowra said, a very large number of Australian couples would love' to be in a position to adopt. If there is need over there andthere is need here in Australia,we have to make sure that that need· is met, because the overall humanitarian outcome is good for everyone. That does not mean that we should ignore the fact that we have to be cautious in making sure that chilQren are not abused and that the adopting parents are in a position to look after the children and not abuse them. In an overwhelming number of situations, that will be the case. We are talking about couples that either cannot have children or have had one child and want to adopt another child. Within Australia the number of children that are available for adoption is small. So in that sense I think the federal government and the minister ought to be congratulated lining these arrangements so that we can progress this matter. I hope that the state and territory welfare ministers will take their responsibilities in this matter seriously and will help in overcoming the bottlenecks and other problems. I do not know whether the House is aware that there is no immigration quota on inter-country adoption. If these state bodies wanted to meet the needs of these people, and if the children were available and had been cleared by overseas authorities, they could significantly increase the number of children being adopted. In this context it is worth mentioning that an international agreement called the Hague agreement has recently been signed. Australia is considering whether it will become a signatory to that Hague agreement on intercountry adoption.··I think that Australia should. We should be able to participate in international forums to ensure that the conditions under which children are given over for adoption within Australia meet all humanitarian concerns and all the concerns of the various governments involved; But there is no reason why .we should not, as a consequence of all of these procedures, have in place a much better and more streamlined system which delivers an outcome. I look forward to a situation in which many of those couples· in Australia who have been waiting are provided with the great happiness that they deserve from adopting a child from overseas. The other matter that was raised in the debate concerns the response to the conditional migrant entry report. The honourable member for Be.rowril raised this issue. There has been active dialogue between departments on this matter. As honourable members would know, there are 21 recommendations. As the honourable member for Berowra would be aware, because he was with me on the committee that produced the report, these recommendations and the issues concerned involve complex legal and administrative questions. They also involve a number of government departments and are being studied by an interdepartmental committee. I am reliably informed that a response in the next few for stream- months will be forthcoming. Mr Ruddock-How many months?",32
18,Dr THEOPHANOUS,OLYMPIC INSIGNIA PROTECTION,"I said in the next few months. I have just been given responsibility for the Australian Government Health Service and it is my intention to explore those aspects which deal with the AGHS. I can assure the honourable member for Berowra that I will expedite that response to the report. I am making a serious point to him. Obviously other departments have a role to play, including the immigration department, and I am reliably informed that it is the government's intention to bring down that response. People are awaiting this response not just in the area of children but in a range of areas. The response to this conditional migrant entry report has important repercussions for many people. I hope we will be able to deliver that soon. In conclusion, I thank honourable members for their participation. I am pleased that this bill is unanimously supported. We look forward, as I say, to a dramatic improvement in the situation of inter-country adoption. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Dr Theophanous) read a third time. NA 1993 Second Reading Debate resumed from 15 December, on  That the bill be now read a second time.  Secretary to the Minister for Defence)-I wish to table a supplementary explanatory memorandum to the Military Compensation Bill 1993 and a correction to the explanatory memorandum dealing with matters relating to the financial impact of the bill. Mr TIM FlSCHER (Farrer-Leader of the National Party of Australia) (11.45 a.m.)Before turning to the Military Compensation Bill, dare I say that I was interested in the passage of that last piece of legislation and hope that inter-country adoption will always involve male and female couples and not couples of the same sex. At the outset, I want to say how pleased I am to see this military compensation legislation finally before the parliament. The federal coalition will not be opposing the military compensation legislation, however I would like to go over some of the background to this legislation· to illustrate how tardy the government has been in finally dealing with this important matter. It now presents us with an additional amendment to the bill which is of passing interest and which we will also support in respect of a member of the Defence Force being detailed in line with the request of the RSL. Issues such as this should not have to 'be vigorously pursued on a partisan. basis. I recognise that over the years the Labor Party has had a record in regard to. veterans entitlements and. the former minister the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Humphreys) had a great deal to do with the veterans entitlements legislation, its enactment and its hnplementation. It. is a very important area of federal statute in respect of veterans and also serving members of the defence forces. I remind the House of what Ben Chifley as Minister for Post-war Reconstruction once said in the House: The careers of hundreds of thousands of young men have been interrupted and in .some instances partially ruined. There is. a break of education, training and opportunity which cannot be repaired. It is perfectly true that experience is gained, but that is not material to an ordinary civil vocation. On this parliament rests the responsibility of seeing that the right thing shall be done. On a bipartisan basis, I also refer to what former Prime Minister Arthur Fadden, the then Leader of the Australian Country Party, said: A grateful nation must see that those who are privileged to return from battle areas shall be properly cared for, and that their reinstatement in civil life shall be wisely and expeditiously carried out. Former Prime Minister Menzies and many others, of course, have spoken of that commitment, that responsibility, of the parliament. As today's Leader of the National Party and also as someone who has had military experience of yesteryear, it is my interpretation that that commitment goes not just to the veterans but to our serving personnel who even in the 1990s are often called on to carry out quite dangerous peacekeeping work in places like Somalia, the Sahara, the Middle East, where Australian soldiers are at present, Syria and the Golan Heights. They have a right to have confidence that their parliament will take proper measures in respect of their circumstances. I will go back over the history of this particular legislation to illustrate the government's tardiness. I well remember the introduction of the Veterans' Entitlements Bill to this parliament in 1985. I spoke on that bill on i2 November and made the point that there would need to be a military compensation act to complement the Veterans' Entitlements Act. The response from the government was that members of Australia's defence forces had cover under workers compensation-a very risky provision in all the circumstances. In fact, they are currently covered under the Safety Rehabilitation Compensation Act 1988. This did not satisfy the coalition or the RSL at the time because there was no recognition of the very different demands placed on members of the defence forces as opposed to other Commonwealth employees. In fact, I said at the time that our position was quite clear cut-that is, the armed forces should remain under repatriation cover until we saw the full details··of a military compensation scheme and the passage of military compensation legislation. That legislation is before the House this day. In response, the government, through the then Minister for Veterans' Affairs- I am talking about 1985-said that the government was examining the area of military compensation and developing a military compensation package. The result of that examination is before us today. Senator David MACGIBBON will deal with this legislation when it gets to the other house. We have considered it in some detail. I highlight that it has taken nearly 10 from the time the Veterans' Entitlements Bill was introduced into the House to finally having the Military Compensation Bill before the parliament. I· do not believe that this is satisfactory. I believe that the government stands condemned for the time that it has taken to finally develop. - proper military compensation bill. I will now tum to the detail of this legislation tion. As I have said, the opposition will not oppose this bill. The bill amends the Veterans' .Entitlements Act 1986 and the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 to create a military compensation scheme. The effect of the proposed amendments-that is, the purpose of the bill-are worth canvassing. Part 2, covering clauses 3 to 10, establishes the military compensation scheme within the framework of the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. First, the military. compensation scheme apply to all members of the Defence Force, including members on future operational service, ensuring that members on operational service as well as hazardous and peacekeeping service· will have the option of Safety Reha:bilitation and Compensation Act or Veterans' Entitlements Act coverage. Second, ordinary peacetime members who, on the commencement of the military compensation scheme, have an existing entitlement under part 4 of the VEA will continue to have the option of Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act or Veterans' Entitlements Act coverage for that period. Subsequent service will·be C07 vered by the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act only. Third, ordinary peacetime members who do not have an existing .entitlement under part 4 of the VEA on the commencement of the military compensation scheme or who enter the ADF after commencement will only have Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act coverage as modified for the military compensation scheme. Fourth, through section 5(6A), the minister will be able to extend the operation of the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act beyond members of the Defence Force by declaring that the act will apply to those who years hold honorary rank when they engage in activities stemming from that rank. An example of this is an honorary colonel of the infantry corps travelling to Somalia, Cambodia or an equivalent future peacekeeping operation. That is quite necessary and satisfactory. Also included are members of philanthropic organisations, such as members of the SalvaArmy and other organisations,. which go forward with Australian peacekeeping efforts. They went forward in the Gulf War and made a very thoughtful, powerful and· positive contribution to the well-being of Australian soldiers. I salute the contribution that those philanthropic organisations, such as the Salvation Army, have made over the decades to Australian troops in all sorts of situations, particularly those ex-members of the ADF who are here on discharge settlement training. Fifth, while it is possible under certain will circumstances to have a choice of coverage, it will not be possible to receive doubling up, overlapping entitlements. Sixth, members of the Defence Force, cadet corps and persons declared under section 5(6A) will be covered for any injury which arises out of medical treatment provided by the Commonwealth where the injury is an unintended consequence of the treatment. Seventh, injured members of the ADF will be able to receive full payor supplementation up to full pay for the first 45 weeks of compensation regardless of whether they stay in the ADF or separate, as can be the case. I will now· deal with other parts of. the legislation. Eighth, transitional provisions are in-erted to ensure that members on operational service do not have dual coverage under the Veterans' Entitlements Act and the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act as surveyed by the military compensation scheme. Ninth, members on hazardous service are to continue to have the choice of Veterans' Entitlements Act coverage. Tenth, peacetime members who have an existing,period of entitlement under part 4 of the VEA will have the choice of Veterans' Entitlements Act coverage for that period following the commencement of the military compensation scheme. Eleventh, ordinary peacetime members who do not have existing entitlements under the VEA will only have coverage under the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act as modified for the military compensation scheme. Twelfth, a termination date is fixed to remove Veterans' Entitlements Act coverage for ordinary peacetime service except for a period of entitlement already existing at thaf date. I have stated all this so that the House might be fully cognisant that this military compensation scheme comes in at a critical time to make sure that we do the right thing not only by veterans but by those who are serving in Australia's army, navy and air force. The main features of the military compensation scheme provide a basic level of compensation cover for all types of service, including all benefits currently provided under the Superannuation Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. There is coverage for unintended conseq""uences of medical treatment paid for by the Commonwealth. However, there is one anomaly that I would appreciate some comment on and response to from the Parliamentary Secretary to the  the table; He will bring forth an amendment in the consideration of the bill in detail, which we have no argument with, concerning a defence member in relation to the military compensation legislation. The bill quite rightly covers unintended consequences. However, unintended consequences may not have been fully covered since 1988. The RSL and others have made submissions which point to the following situation: a member of a defence force who perhaps injures his leg and is compensated for that injury may damage his other leg by the way that he is forced to limp on the first 'leg and may have to correct his walking style or whatever. I am not being pedantic. I have had recent experience of this and have observed other patients at close hand in a' range of circumstances which I would not wish upon anyone. These situations can literally come about through the initial injury and, at a later stage separate to the actual incident, bringing on a consequential injury. That damage to the other leg or other part of the body is an unintended consequence. It has a.lways been covered by compensation except, it would seem, for the period from 1988 until the passage of this bill. I would appreciate it if the parliamentary secretary could fully lay before the House the coverage that exists in respect of this aspect - I am pleased that he will do that-and the period that the coverage relates to with particular reference to that critical period between 1988 and the present day. I return to the main feature of the military compensation scheme. As has been mentioned, it covers those declared by the minister to hold honorary rank and other special categories. It provides, in a broad sense, the type of compensation which. the coalition feels is most necessary. Therefore, we do not oppose the bill, but we give an assurance to our veterans and, more particularly, our serving navy, army and air force personnel that we. will monitor closely the operation of the Military Compensation Act. We will monitor extremely closely its practical application to those who apply for compensation from ev-nts' whiCh have impacted upon them during their military service to see that fairness and justice applies in practice and that it does not lead to those ex-service personnel and serving personnel somehow becoming derailed in the system. This is an extraordinarily complex area of the law. Over the years, it has been partially tidied up in related areas under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. It is one for which this parliament has the responsibility of seeing in absolute terms that the right thing is done by our veterans and serving personnel. I remind the House that even on this day personnel are serving in several theatres around the world, including the Middle East and the Sahara, with a great deal of personal danger attaching to their honourable· work that is being done on behalf of Australia and the world. Therefore,. the coaljtion does not oppose the Military Compensation Bill. However, it seeks the assurance that I have detailed. We will oppose the particular minor. amendment that will be moved by the parliamentary secretary.  pleased to speak in this debate on the Military Compensation Bill. I note the contribution made by the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer). I am very pleased that we are able· to reach a bipartisan approach in this important area. I am also' pleased to see that the victims the Voyager disaster have finally received a measure of compensation and justice. Frankly, honourable members on both sides of the House have at different .limes borne responsibility for this matter· being dragged· out for such an inordinately long period. Nevertheless, I think honourable members are pleased with the initiative of the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) to bring this matter to a conclusion. As the Leader of the National Party pointed out, we have serving men and women in peacetime operations not only in Australia. I am very pleased that the members of the. Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade have had the opportunity to,visitmany of these men and women at thejr places of work. I thank the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) and the ADF for that opportunity. We gained an appreciation of the challenges they face and the equipment they need to operate. As people .who are not serving menibers of the services, we got as close as we could to the challenges. The important role that the' ADF has iii peacekeeping has also been mentioned-lwas very privileged to.go to Somalia with '-enator MACGIBBON, the honourable, tnel)1ber for Casey (Mr Halverson) and the honourable member for Richmond (MrN'ewell) at the invitation of the Minister for Defence. We saw at first hand just what our forces had to put up with and the hazards that they were faced with. We also saW the tremendous goodwill and good work that they genera-ed throqgh their operations. It is always an advantage for members of parliament to see at first hand the good work of the members of the ADF in peacekeeping. I say frankly tQ the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for  able members on both sides wQuld welcome any further opportunity to visit these peacekeeping operations. Whilst we can be rightly proud of the entitlements and' coverage that we have provided for our veterans, operating under the Department of Veterans' Affairs,it is true that there has been a significant gap. The military compensation scheme brings the ADF closer of to workplace compensation packages. Whilst veterans entitlements try to retain. the health of veterans and provide them with permanent pensions, one of the advantages of the military . compensation scheme is that it is based more on lump sUm compensation and it has a greater emphasis on rehabilitation. I do not want to repeat the detail referred to by the Leader of the National Party when explaining this to the House. But, whilst it is really good to see that the scheme has been extended to certain categories of people-for example, those holding honorary rank, such as colonels of regiments and cadets-one of the ironies is what happens to members of parliament who may be visiting a peacekeeping operation and suffer an unfortunate injury. Whilst everyone else may be covered under the scheme, no compensation is available for members of parliament. Whilst I do not want to seek to plead self-interest here, I find that rather ironic. Notwithstanding the lack of adequate compensation arrangements, I reiterate that honourable members on both sides 'are very keen at all times to take up whatever opportunity may exist to see at first hand our serving men and women operating. As this bill has bipartisan support, I am content with making a very modest contribution. I want to congratulate the Minister for Defence, the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Senator Faulkner), the parlia,. mentary secretary· and the departments on the consultation process. I am very pleased to .see that there is an amendment befQre the House which provides the opportunity fQr a serving member of the ADF to serve on the commiscompensation sion. In hindsight, we could probably see this as an omission, but it is always good to see the government, as' a result of necessary consultation, picking it up. I commend the government for the process and the outcome. I am sure it will be welcomed by not orily serving men and women of the ADF but also those organisations that seek to represent their interests. In conclusion, I strongly feel that some parts of parliamentary activity ought to attract a bipartisan approach. I am very pleased that, on this particular matter in the defence we have the support of not only government members but equally importantly opposition members for the proposals being considered by the House.",35
19,Mr TAYLOR,MILITARY COMPENSATION BILL,"Like the honourable member for Chilley (Mr Price), I have a great deal of pleasure rising this afternoon to provide a very measure of bipartisan support for this important legislation. I would also like to reinforce one or two of the comments made by the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) in his contribution. I pay tribute to one or two people on the other side of the House who have made very .large contributions to the veterans affairs and defence personnel areas in the time that I have been in this parliament since 1988. I refer specifically to the honourable member for Griffith (MrHumphreys) and the honourable member for Calare (Mr Simmons), both of whom have made very large contributions. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Chilley, made a very substantial contribution in that . area in the last parliament. I take the tunity to acknowledge that this. morning. There is one person whom the Leader of the National Party forgot to mention in his contribution, and that is the Leader of the National Party himself. In his capacity shadow minister in previous parliaments, has made a very substantial contribution the veterans area. I take the opportunity this he stated: afternoon to acknowledge that. As previous speakers have said-and lwill not go over the history of this legislationincorporate there .are four dimensions to the military scheme which are worth reinforcing in the context of this debate. Firstly, the scheme will provide a basic level of cover for all types of service, whether it be peacetime' service, peacekeeping service, hazardous and/of-operational service. Secondly, it· also the ensures that all the benefits available under the Safety Rehabilitation Compensation Act 1988 are picked up. Thirdly, as the Leader of the National Party said, the scheme adds some additional benefits, but I will not go into the . details of those. Fourthly, those who are injured in operational, hazardous or peacearea, keeping service have a choice between the military compensation scheme and the Veterans' Entitlements Act provisions. It is important that we recognise all of those. It is also important that we recognise another important aspect of this legislation. Let me say to the House that members of the in Australian Defence Force, of which I was large very proudly a member for three decadesMr Tim Fischer-And a good one.",40
20,Mr TAYLOR,MILITARY COMPENSATION BILL,"Thank you very much. Members of the Australian Defence Force are not members of the Australian Public Service in uniform. I think it is important that we highlight that fact. in the context of debating this legislation, We must not lose sight of the fact that the Defence Force is a unique environment. Where we can, we pick up the provisions that apply to all others in Commonwealth employ but, at the same time, we' must' recognise the specific environment under which'the Defence Force serves. I am sure the President of the RSL will not mind my mentioning that in some correspondopporence that he, had with the Minister for Veterans' ·Affairs (Senator Faulkner) in the lead-up; to this legislation he made the point that, whilst he thought the military compensation scheme, was accepted and it is a political as and gove-!11ental decision, there were a he couple of points he felt he should make. In to reference to the Veterans' Entitlements Act, The ex-Service community is stilI not convinced that an adequate reason exists Jor establishing a Military Compensation Scheme. We. prefer to appropriate amendments into the Veterans Entitlements Act to ensure that Service Personnel are covered under the VEA at all times during their service. This follows from the principle that during peace Service PeTS?n.nel .train for w-r and the effectiveness of that trammg IS reflected m either the effectiveness of their deterrence or the effectiveness in war. Other reasons for maintaining coverage under VEA are as follows: a. One Department would admjnister all compensation and rehabilitation for all Service Personnel. b. The system is already established. The DVA have 75 years of experience of dealing with _injured and ill ex-Service personnel. A national network of officers, medical staff, support systems and liaisons is working effectively and has been modified recently with the change of hospital support systems to be more accessible to the client needs. c. The system established at the moment, recognises the unique nature of - the Defence. Force Service. I have just made that point myself. He· continued: This was explained by the Government. when amendments to Repatriation Legislation were introduced in 1973 to cover peace time service. d. There is an obligation to provide the best posSible conditions of service to the Defence Force, whereas there is no obligation other than· a statement of political intent for an MCS to be established. That said, the RSL and other groups have - ccepted the need for this legislation. The President of the RSL also made the pointand the Parliamentary Secretary to the  this in his summing:.up-about the income supplementation provisions not ceasing at age 65. He made one other point which the parliameritary secretary may also like to address. He said in part: It is accepted that the medical and fitness requirements of the Australian Defence Force are such that a physically incapacitated person may not be able to remain in the Defence Force. However, the obligation of the employer, ie The Commonwealth, to the employee ie The Service Person, should not be forfeited and the commitment in the second reading speech should be honoured in that Service Personnel no longer capable of continuing Service within the Defence Force, should if they are not able to gain employment elsewhere, if that is their desire, should be employed by the Commonwealth or at least have a preference to employment by the Commonwealth. I understand and, recognise that that is a far wider issue but it is something about which the parliamentary secretary might like to make a comment. I will not take up undue time of the House this morning. I am glad that the honourable member for Chifley made mention of the Voyager case, As someone who has been very heavily involved in those compensation cases since 1988, I say to the House that we must never let that sort of thing happen again. . I am not pointing the finger at the present government. I think ministers on both sides of the political fence really have something to answer for in relation to the Voyager saga. I am delighted that the present Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch)-I pay tribute to him again this morning-saw that a pragmatic solution was necessary in relation to compensation in the Voyager cases. Whilst undoubtedly that will be expensive for the taxpayers-perhaps in the region-of $30 million to $40 millionit is at least a small measure of recognition of the psychological and other problems that surVivors of that catastrophe, which occurred just over 30 years ago, have. I thank the honourable member for Chifley for raising that matter. I reinforce to the parliamentary secretary and the officials in the chamber this morning the point that we must never let such a thing happen again. We must never again let something drag on for three decades. During that time we saw people take the extreme action of suicide because they were being frustrated by a system and a bureaucracy which was unnecessary and which, in any event, proved to be fruitless. Like honourable members before me, I have much pleasure in supporting this legislation. I look forward to making some further comments in this area as further legislation comes before the House. .  Secretary to the Minister for Defence) (12.16 p.m.) -7in reply-I will respond to a couple of points raised by honourable members opposite. I thank the honourable member for - Chif Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) and the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) for their contributions and the spirit in which they were made. As the honourable member for. Chifley said, it is an outstanding feature of Australian politics that defence matters have bipartisan support in this place and the other place. I think it is incumbent on all, of us to work very hard at maintaining that situation, given the national importance of defence at the present time and in the future. The fi-t matter I want to deal with is one raised by the Leader of the National Party. He spoke of an unintended consequence in the form of a consequential injury not being covered in the period from 1988 to the present.' The honourable member is correct in, saying that there is somewhat of a gap between 1988 and the present legislation. But that gap does not relate to an example such as that given by him in which there is a clear causal link. In other words, if the original injury is a compensatable injury, I am advised that linking it to a second,consequential injury does not present a problem under the scheme., ' :There is, however-and the honourable member is correct to raise this matter-a problem when the original injury is not compensatable. I am advised that the best example of that might be a dental problem. The department is aware of this gap and, as we speak, is working on a formula that will resolve this problem. As I intimated privately to the Leader of the National Party a few moments ago, it may well be that this can be done by administrative means rather than legislative means. The honourable member for Groom raised three points. Firstly, heasked: why the MCS? The government foreshadowed this in 1986 with the introduction of the veterans entitlements legislation. In 1992 the government adopted a very firm' view on the policy of an introduction of the MCS. During the'development of the MCS, consideration was given to the option of providing the scheme as an amendment under the old veterans entitlement regime. However, this was not adopted for a number of reasons. I will briefly 'deal with those reasons. Firstly, Defence was already administering the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. As this military compensation scheme was to be based on that, it was logical to retain the administration of the scheme with Defence. It was also important that Defence retained its role as the administrator of this scheme to ensure that Defence fulfils its responsibility as an empJoyer-a simple employment relationship. It is no longer acceptable, in our view, for an employer to injure an employee, as it were, and then take no interest in the rehabilitation of the injured individual. One would hope that we ,would all agree that should be the case right ,across the work force but it is particularly the case in terms of our armed forces. A separate MCS administered by Defence brings this employer responsibility into very sharp focus. The MCS will allow the Department of Defence to integrate all the aspects of the important areas, obviously, if they are under the one roof. There are a number of other reasons which I will briefly summarise. It has to be said that, while the Department of Veterans' Affairs has a long history of administering veterans benefits, it does not 'have a great deal of - xperience in managing the type of rehabilitation and vocational retraining that is the hallmark of modem compensation legislation such as this. The modem rehabilitation and vocational retraining responsibilities are something that we think that Defence is well positioned to do.' Much rehabilitation work is, of course, carried out now by the defence forces medical services and through a highly effective system of, schools and training courses. All in all on that first point raised by the honourable member for Groom, I think it is sirTtply a case of who is best able to do the job and where the responsibility should lie. They are the two essential points coming out of it. The honourable, member also asked a question that a number of the returned services organisations have asked, and that is: why do the weekly income support payments stop at age 65? He is quite correct to ask that I deal with this question here. I think that is most appropriate. Weekly income support payable under the MCS will stop at age 65 and, of course, all the other benefits continue for life. But, in so assessing it, we have to understand that income support payments payable'under most major Australian compensation schemes also finish at age 65. This is the age by which most Australians have left the work force. When they leave the work force, they draw their income from their superannuation or from a government pension. Therefore, they are eligible-as are other Australians under other schemes-for other benefits, be they superannuation or government pension. It. is, if you like, entirely consistent as a matter of logic with the broadorgllnisations. er· work force. The final matter that the honourable member for Groom raised was the matter of preference and retaining employment for injured persons. That is also a very good point that he has raised. I might say that, while the honourable member was busy congratulating a number of people in the place on their involvement in defence matters, he probably should have given himself a. pat on the back, not to mention his brother as well. He has a very strong family history of very senior and worthwhile military involvement. This issue that the honourable member raises is and will be considered in the rehabilitation process of the individual. The department has advised me that it is doing more work on this. This may be something that. we as a government need to monitor to make sure that it is being done .right. I have got every confidence that it will be. But I guess that, because the rehabilitation process is under the roof of-he Department of Defence-which was the first point raised by the honourable member-it yet again highlights the benefit of being in the right place. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the. Governor General recommending appropriation announced ..

Section 89E of the Principal Act is amended by inserting after paragraph (l )(f) the following paragraph: '(fa) a member of the Defence Force;'."". This proposed new clause 9A deals with the inclusion of a member of the Defence Force on the commission. This is inserted following discussions with a number of ex-service I understand the opposition is happy' with that amendment. We think it is a worthwhile one. We should remember that the defence forces are not a unionised body of employees and so they need to have a say in this very important aspect of their employment relationship with the department. This is one means of doing that.",40
21,Mrs SULLIVAN,MILITARY COMPENSATION BILL,"I just rise to say that the opposition does support this amendment and acknowledges the significance of it to the Defence Force in the terms outlined by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence (Mr Punch). New clause agreed to. Remainder of' bill-by leave-taken as a whole, and agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Third Reading  read a third time. NA (MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS) BILL 1994 Consideration resumed from 2 March. Second Reading  Secretary to the Minister for Defence) (12.30 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill proposes amendments to a number of acts administered within the portfolio of the Prime Minister and to other legislation dealing with matters relevant to the Prime Minister's portfolio. Details of the various amendments are set out in the explanatory memorandum which accompanies the bill. I will deal only with the more important aspects. The bill contains amendments to the Freedom of Information Act 1982 and the Archives Act 1983 relating to access to documents known as cabinet· notebooks. The Archives Act will be amended to provide a clear arid sensible archival mechanism that, for the first time,. will allow public access notebooks recording the deliberations. of cabinet after a period of 50 years. At the same time, cabinet notebooks will be protected from access under the Freedom of Information Act during that period. While these acts do not fall within the portfolio responsibilities of the Prime Minister, the amendments are included in this portfolio bill because of the Prime Minister's responsibility for the cabinet· process. Honourable members'may be aware that, on 16 December 1992, amendments to the Archives Act, the Freedom of Information Act and the Evidence Act were introduced into the House of Representatives in a bill titled the Cabinet Notebooks (Access and Protection) Bill 1922. That bill lapsed on the calling of the last federal election in March. An explanation of the cabinet notetaking system was included in the second reading speech accompanying that bill. In April 1993 the High Court handed down its decision in relation to the appeal by the Commonwealth against a decision of the full court of the Federal Court in the case of the Northern Land Council v. Commonwealth in which the council sought' access to a number of cabinet notebooks from the 1970s. While not finding that there is an absolute immunity from production of cabinet notebooks in court proceedings, the High Court found that there were 'extremely strong' considerations of public policy weighing against their production. Only exceptional circumstances, such as non-disclosure impeding defendants in the conduct of their defence or allegations of serious niisconduct on the part of cabinet ministers, should' justify disclosure in such proceedings. On the basis of this decision, the goverilment has decided' that it is unnecesoverseassary at the present time to include provisions regulating the use of cabinet notebooks in court proceedings in the Evidence Act or the proposed evidence bill. This bill also implements the government's December1992 response to the Report of the review 0/ the Office of the Ombudsma:n by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. In line with the recommendations of the standing committee, the to major amendments to the act will: give the Ombudsman jurisdiction to investigate administrative actions of Federal Court registri'es and Commonwealth parliamentary departments; give the Ombudsman a discretion to decline to investigate or to cease investigating commercial activities of Commonwealth agencies; and allow the Ombudsman to transfer complaints to the Australian Broadcasting Authority, the Merit Protection and Review Agency or an industry ombudsman, where appropriate. In addition to ,the amendments to implement the government's response to the Senate Standing Committee's report, a number of other minor amendments to the Ombudsman Act will be made. The bill also includes amendments to the Public. Service Act 1992 and the Superannuation Act 1976 to enable effect to be given to the government's decision to allow secretaries to departments and a limited number of equivalent level statutory office holders to relinquish their continuing tenure in the Public Service, and the value which attaches to that tenure, in return for a reasonable loading on their salaries being set by the Remuneration Tribunal. The government has recommended to the tribunal that the loading should be set at 20 per cent. The changes we are making are a natural evolution of the changes made 10 years ago when the parliament removed the right to tenure in particular departmental head positions and the. policy of rotations on a five year .basis was introduced. Enabling secretaries to departments to choose whether to retain their tenure in the Public Service or to relinquish it in return fora salary loading is a logical progression which has taken place in many other public services both here and Even with the loading, which will be set by the independent Remuneration Tribunal, the remuneration of Commonwealth heads of departments, with their national level responsibilities, will not match that of their counterparts in Victoria and New South Wales. It should be noted that the government policy of reviewing secretaries' appointments after five years in one position will continue. Secretaries who remain in their current positions will be reviewed at the expiration years from the original appointment. In sharpening the focus on the policy of rotation of making greater use of fixed-term appointments, the government will continue to retain the traditional virtues of the Public . Service with the emphasis there has always been on having heads of departments with great personal integrity, political impartiality and preparedness to offer the frank and fearless advice we expect of them. The bill includes other amendments of a minor nature to the Public Service Act 1922 to ensure that the act adequately reflects the requirements of contemporary public sector administration. For example, amendments are included relating to the discipline process, excess officers, joint selection committees and the mobility provisions of the act. The discipline process as it relates to unattached officers will be brought more into line with theptocess that applies in relation to other officers. The amendments reflect the recommendations of the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Adminlegislation istration in December 1992 on its inquiry the'management of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The amendments relating to excess officers will ensure that the appeal mechanism available to excess officers in relation to transfers is only available to those excess officers ·who have applied for transfer to a position. Other amendments will allow for the use of a joint selection committee order of merit in filling identical and quent vacancies.The bill also makes a number of minor or technical amendments to a number of other acts. Details of these are set in the explanatory memorandum.! commend this bill to the House and present the explanaSecretary tory memorandum to the bill.",43
22,Mr CONNOLLY,PRIME MINISTER AND CABINET,"In my introduction I would like to make the point that I find it quite unsatisfactory that we have the explanatory memorandum available to the opposition some days before we have the second reading speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for  reading speech only takes place as part of the second reading debate. This is one of the new of five changes that have been introduced to the procedures of this House but I think it should be reviewed. The concept of· having the legislation introduced and then the second reading speech take place at that time and then adjourned gives the opposition the considerable advantage of at least being able to read in detail the second reading speech as well as the explanatory memorandum. There are many occasions when the contents are not consistent with each other. To expect anybody to be able to comment on legislation immediately after a speech has been made, especially of this nature, is ludicrous, to say the least. Nevertheless, the opposition is not opposing this legislation. It is an omnibus bill. It amends a number of acts concerning cabinet notebooks, the Ombudsman's responsibilities, the disciplinary process applying to unattached officers in the Public Service, the remuneration arrangements for departmental secretaries and a number of other minor technical amendments to other acts. Perhaps the most interesting· element of this is the handling of cabinet noteinto books. This has always been. shrouded in some mystery. They are intended to serve as an aide-memoire in the preparation of cabinet minutes by the cabinet secretariat. They. are held by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. It is my understanding that they contain the personal views of individual ministers, although the actual vote, if there is a vote, which may take place in the cabinet subsemay not necessarily be so recorded. These notebooks are confidential. They cannot be . reproduced or shown to any unauthorised out person, and access to the cabinet notebooks is not allowed except on the authority of the to the Cabinet and is strictly limited to senior officers of the department. When one looks back through the history of the Westminster system over recent decades one immediately comes upon the story of the Crossman diaries, which as I understand it was the first time that a cabinet minister in our system had actually released a book, an autobiography, which contained a substantial amount of information which he had obviously gleaned from his own diaries kept of cabinet meetings and their outcome. That caused at the time quite some irritation both amongst his ex-colleagues and the bureaucrats as to what the actual standing of notebooks and confidential material should be when they were meant to be a factual account of cabinet proceedings. Notebpoks are not open for inspection after cabinet meetings although there have been a few occasions where during those discussions ministers were able, with the approval of the Prime Minister, to look at the notebooks or to have provided to them a summary of the main points so they could r-fresh their memories. Apart from such instances, there have been only two cases of note where external access to these notebooks has been provided. The first was between 1978 and 1980, when a former cabinet minister, Mr Clyde Cameron, was orally briefed from notebooks concerning cabinet meetings. The second case was in 1983, when the Hope royal commission had access to notebooks relating to matters it was then reviewing. Under the Archives Act, Commonwealth records are accessible'when they are over 30 years old. Cabinet notebooks are not regarded as Commonwealth records for the purposes of the act and therefore are not accessible under the Archives Act. Nor are they accessible under the Freedom of Information Act. At present they can be the subject of valid requests for access, as I noted, but access would invariably be denied under section 34(1)(d) of the act, which protects documents which would involve the disclosure of any deliberation or decision of the cabinet. Conseever, quently, those seeking access to cabinet notebooks have been required to go through the courts. The issue of access to cabinet notebooks under that procedure came especially to the note of the government and to the parliament in 1992, when the case of Northern Land Council v.. Commonwealth was before the High Court. The Northern Land Council was trying to gain access to cabinet notebooks, and the government believed that the council would probably succeed. This matter was considered by both the government and the opposition at the time and, in its decision of April 1993, the High Court held that documents recording the deliberations of cabinet fall within a class in respect of which strong considerations of public policy militate against disclosure. Only under quite exceptional circumstances, where there is a significant likelihood that the public interest in the due administration of justice outweighs the public interest in the confidentiality of cabinet documents, will the production of cabinet notebooks be ordered by the court. Because cabinet notebooks ate clearly important historical documents, it is reasonable that they are made publicly accessible after the passage of an appropriate length of time. Pursuant to the amendments to the Archives Act in this bill, cabinet notebooks will become accessible after a closed period of 50 years. The standard period for the release of documents, as you are aware Mr Deputy Speaker, is 30 years but this was deemed too short as some former ministers may still be alive. Therefore, the decision has been to extend this period to 50 years when former ministers will be well beyond caring. This is a reasonable compromise which balances the competing public interest on the one hand, with the .need for appropriate cabinet confidentiality on the other. This legislation also amends the Freedom of Information Act to make it clear that cabinet notebooks are excluded from the operation of the act. At present, a valid request for access to cabinet notebooks under FOI can be made, even though the inevitable outcome is that access will be refused, and rightly· so. Howthe reques'tmust still be processed and the material must be identified and detailed, which isa very costly process. In the Northern Land Council case, which I referred to, some 113 notebooks were actually identified. Under future arrangements, as a result of these amendments, such searches will not need to be undertaken· because it will not be possible to request access to cabinet notebooks under the freedom of 'information legislation. The amendments to the Archives Act and the Freedom bflnformation Act are consequently supported by the opposition. It is also worth noting reports that, following the loss of the last state election, outgoing ministers in the Victorian state government shredded their state cabinet documents. While I am not suggesting _th.at Commonwealth ministers would necessarily act in a similar manner, I put on record that the opposition is very concerned that, whether or not these acts did occur in, ViCtoria, this should certainly not be regarded as an accept,able form of public behaviour for any government. One of the significant things about the Westminster system of cabinet governmentand, to my surPrise, I found this when we were in government"":""'is that when a decision is made by a former government, even of a different political persuasiop, unless a subsequent decision is' made specifically overturning that decision, that cabinet decision stands indefinitely regardless of the government of the day. Most people perhaps are not aware of this fact. They may presume that with a change of government what happened before is de rigueur, past tense, finished, the slate is clean and we start all over again. In fact, that is not how our system of government works. Therefore, to even suggest that it is permissible to destroy cabinet records is utterly and completely an anathema to the very principles upon which cabinet government are basednot only the Westminster system but in terms of the traditions of the Australian· system of government, which vades from Westminster in various ways. I also want to referbrieOy to some other questions covered in this legislation, particularly the Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act, which is amended under the' bill. There are two basic amendments and they are both quite significant. The purpose of the first amendment is to clarify that the Merit Protection Review Agency has jurisdiction over Commonwealth employees employed by a statutory authority under industrial award. The MPRA can conduct a appeals and investigations into grievances people employed under such an enactment. The word ,'enactment' is defined as an act, ordinance or an instrument, including determinations, rules, regulations or by-laws. It has always been assumed the definition includes industrial awards but apparently that is not the case, and the purpose of this amendment is to clarify· that situation. The full bench of the Industrial Relations Commission has recently raised the possibility that the definition of enactment is not in fact wide enough to encompass industrial awards. Accordingly; this legislation proposes to add industrial awards to the list of determinations included in the definition of enactment to make it quite clear that the MPRA can carry out its functions in relation to people employed under industrial awards. The amendment is retrospective. The opposition has taken a· very strong line in recent years against·legislation being. retrospective. In this case, however, we are of the' view that the proposal is not objectionable because all it would do is preserve the status of' matters dealt with by the agency in the previous 10 years. So any change, to that w,ould create quite unnecessary hardship to. individuals who do nothing wrong but go through the process .in expectation that the MPRA would be able to handle their cases. Therefore, it is appropriate that matters should be taken as retrospective in this particular case. The MPRA does not automatically have jurisdiction over people employed . by a statutory authority under an industrial award. For example, an award must contain a provision which allows use of the MPRA by employees with grievances. 'If it contains such a provision, then this amendment to the merit protection legislation will ensure that the MPRA can act if it is asked to do so. On, the other, hand, if the provision does not contain references to this amendment,' one would presume that it does not apply. The second amendment which complements a proposed amendment to the Ombudsman Act 1976 will allow for transfer of complaints 'between the two agencies, depending on an which agency could more properly deal with complaint. The opposition is supporting that of view. In December 1991, the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration tabled an important report entitled Review of the Office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman. Most of the proposed. amendments in this legislation are, iil fact, the government's response to that report. In line with the committee's recommendations, the amendments will clarify the Ombudsman's jurisdiction in relation to Commonwealth controlled companies. Commonwealth controlled companies presently fall within the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman only if regulations expressly so provide. Therefore, if regulations ignore this point, clearly Commonwealth controlled companies do not fall within the Ombudsman's purview. These amendments will reverse the situation so that companies. created after the commencement of the amendments will clearly fall within the Ombudsman's jurisdiction unless they are specifically excluded by regulations made under the act. The jurisdiction will also be further extended to investigate actions of Federal Court registries. and Commonwealth parliamentary departments. The Ombudsman will also gain an explicit discretion to decline to investigate or to cease investigating commercial activities of Commonwealth agencies and the ability to tr:ansfer complaints to the Australian Broadcasting Authority, the Merit Protection and Review Agency or an industry ombudsman, such as the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, where appropriate. The amendment will facilitate the transfer of complaints to the Australian Broadcasting Authority. This arises from the recommendation of a Senate committee that the Ombudsman should have jurisdiction to deal with complaints from persons and organisations claiming. to have been misrepresented on ABC programs. This gives me the opportunity to refer to another issue in relation to the responsibility of the MPRA, on the one hand, and the ombudsman decision, on the other. Members of the House would be aware that over recent months there has been some concern about the handling, in the Public Service context, of two former staff members, known as housekeepers, at the Lodge. These people were dismissed initially under the MOPS legislation-the Members of Parliament (Staft) Act-in which there is no clear provision for access to the MPRA ..The MPRA is the subject of this legislation. However, persons in that category do have access to the Ombudsman. The interesting situation in this case is that these, two women were referred to in derogatory terms in evidence given to Senate estimates committees. Allegations were made that they had overspent on credit cards and matters such as that. Nevertheless, when their positions were terminated, they were both given certificates of service issued by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet which stated that they had committed no wrongdoing either of a serious or a light nature. Consequently, there is a contradiction here. On the one hand, their reputations have been effectively attacked before a Senate committee; on the other hand, their erstwhile employer, the Department of the Prirrte Minister and Cabinet, says that they'have done nothing wrong. But it was officers of the same department who said that they had done something wrong: they had overspent on credit card limits. This issue still remains unresolved. Gardini and Co., solicitors and attorneys for these two women, has acted on their behalf. Representations have been made to various members of parliament. Issues have been raised by me in this parliament as well as in the Senate. The difficulty arises from the fact that the Ombudsman initially publicly stated that she would investigate pre-employment matters. While she is not authorised under her interpretation of her regulations to investigate actions of a minister, nevertheless, section 5(3) of the Ombudsman Act allows her to investigate acti()ns taken by a delegate of a minister. In other words, in this case under the MOPS Act the Prime Minister was able to delegate his responsibilities to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. The Ombudsman says, 'A decision was made by a minister, ergo it. is policy. Therefore, I as the Ombudsman cannot review that decision'. But, at the same time, under section 5(3), she clearly accepts that she does have the right to review a decision made by an authority or by a person to whom the responsibility has been delegated. The sad fact is that, despite all this, the Ombudsman is determined that she cannot carry the issue any further. In this case the housekeepers were dismissed under a power of delegation signed by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on 17 January 1992 under section 33 of the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act 1984. Surely in those circumstances there is a prima facie case that the Ombudsman does have the jurisdiction to investigate the circumstances of the housekeepers' termination. Efforts have been made to raise this with the Ombudsman, apparently so far without success. Once again, I put on the record of this parliament that I think. it is of fundamental importance that, if we are to have a system to review decisions, whether it be through the ombudsman system or through the Merit Protection and Review Agency process, we cannot have exceptions. If it is to be argued that the MOPS Act creates a different classification, I would urge the government to review the MOPS Act because that apparently is creating two classes of civil servants-those who are under normal Public Service rules and those who are under the so-called Members of Parliament (Staff) Act. There are inconsistencies when it comes back to the fundamental question of human rights. When somebody has been attacked and their reputation has been besmirched before this parliament everybody says that it is all too difficult, there is collective washing of hands in the best Pontius Pilate manner and these two women are left hanging. They are not wealthy people; they are not powerful people. They have done all they can to access the system and in this case quite clearly the system has been found wanting. I hope the government will do something about it. Returning to the Public Service Act 1922 and the Superannuation Act 1976, this legislation contains some worthwhile changes to the handling of departmental heads. Under the new arrangements, it effectively means that persons either inside or outside the service may be taken on as departmental heads for a fixed term of office; Previously, there was no conception of a fixed term of office.· It was like professors at the university: they were in a tenured situation and a person could not be removed. Under the new proposal, departmental heads will be given, for example, a fixed term contract of, say, five years. The quid pro quo of losing tenure will be that they will have access to an additional 20 per cent salary increase, which would not be available to people who remain in tenure. I and the opposition believe that this is a worthwhile change. In a sense, it brings the permanent head status, which will no longer be permanent, as I have emphasised, more or less in line with the Senior Executive Service arrangements where a significant number of positions which are now advertised openly-in other words, available to people outside as well as inside the service-give people the option of either a career position or access to a fixed contract term. That is often useful for the individual as well as the department, depending on the nature of the work which is to be undertaken. It also gives the government some flexibility in the types of people it may wish to appoint as permanent heads of departments. There have been some interesting examples in recent times where, with the restructuring of departments, it simply has not been possible to terminate the services of secretaries and they have been kept on as joint secretaries. This is a bizarre arrangement in mimy respects. Effectively, it means that two secretaries are running a department of state. That is a contradiction in terms. As the law stood it was extremely difficult to remove·officers: We will be watching this very carefully in terms of the regulations under the act to ensure that the civil rights of persons who are appointed either under .contract or under existing arrangements are fully protected,but a balance has to be achieved. Clearly, it is not in the public interest for a person who is no longer fulfilling a function to still be paid the full salary for doing less than what that salary is meant for. Therefore, the position needs to be terminated and these provisions allow tl}.at to take place. There are also some other minor changes which are perhaps of some interest.. For example, the bill amends the act to allow departments to apply an order of merit principle when filling positions which were filled on the advice of a joint select committee and become vacant within six months of the original appointment. People may wonder why matters ·of such little consequence are included in legislation, but I go on the record as saying that they are not matters of little consequence. In many cases positions attract literally hundreds of !lPplications. It is difficult to put in place a methodology which is fair to all those applications while, at the same time, giving the department the capacity to reaccess those people in the event that a similar or even identical position becomes available within a reasonable period of, say, six months. Only: last week a case received media attention in Tasmania. The Commonwealth Employment Service advertised, for some positions. It got literally hundreds of applications. It spent in' excess of $90,000 going through the process of interviewing all those people. Various comments were made about all this terrible waste of money. The point needs to be made that the department does ,have the responsibility nQt only to safeguard the taxpayers'expenditurebut also to be fair to the people who have made application for these positions. . One of the advantages of this amendment is that, byh-lVing the order of merit ,concept, the position is obviously offered initially to the first person on the list. If. that person rejects the offer, the position is then offered to the second person, then to the third and SO on. When the position js filled, the subsequent order of merit is still .in existence which c,an then come into operation should that position again fall vacant or Ii similar position become available. That obviates the need for extensive advertising. and for the substilptialpersonnel commitment to the establishment of the joint .selection committees, and so forth under the ""merit protection arrangements. Clearly, that is a . saving to, the taxpayer and is certainly aPministratively simple for all concerned. The opposition supports the passage of this legislation. Whilst we are not questioning the integrity of the Cabinet Office or its, staffcertainly to the best of my knowledge there has never been a case in terms of the Commonwealth jurisdiction-as I stated earlier, we are very concerned at this allegation that the Victorian' state Labor government did shred state cabinet documents prior to leaving office. We seek a reassurance from this government that all future cabinet records and documents will be kept in safe keeping.",45
23,Dr KEMP,PRIME MINISTER AND CABINET,"The Prime Minister and Cabinet (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 1993 is an omnib.us bill which proposes a number of amendments to legislation administered within the portfolio of the Prime Minister, to make provision for cabinet. notebooks and to make amendments to the Superannuation Act 1976. Although my colleague the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) has outlined in detail the' coalition's position on these various amendments, in my capacity as the shadow minister for science, technology and export 'development I would like to make a few comments relating to the amendments to the Australian Science and Technology Council Act 1978. The support staff of the Australian Science and Technology Council-ASTEC, as it is more commonly known-presently constitute a separate department under the Public Service Act. Pursuant to the amendments proposed in this bill, these staff will be integrated into the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. As the primary source of information and advice to the government on matters relating t() science and technology policy matters, ASTEC has had a key role in promoting the development and application of Australian science and technology. Its extensive responsibilities have ranged from the advancement of general scienti ficknowledge to the identification and support of new ideas in science and technology that can contribute to the country's future development. Given the critical link between innovation .and the economic growth of nations and their comparativeand competitive advantage, ASTEC's part in fociJsing and fostering innovation in Australian industry cannot be overstated. . By way of background to this debate, I am sure that honourable members will recall that it was the coalitiOri that first established an advisory body on science and technology policy. The MCMahon government set up the Advisory Committee in Science and Technology a little more than two decades ago. Unfortunately, this body had a very short life as it soon became a victim of the Whitlam government, and it took the election of another coalition government, the Fraser government, for a permanent Australian Science and Technology Council to be established with a close relationship to the Prime Minister. This was done in 1977. This gives an indication of the coalition's historic commitment to science and technology, a commitment which underpins our belief that science and technology must play an integral role in any worthwhile vision of our future as a strong and independent nation. As I pointed out during a debate in this place yesterday, sound investment in science and technology. and innovative practices is generally one of the principal means by which Australia can make its way in today's highly competitive global marketplace. Indeed, given the extensive focus on these areas by our main international competitors, sucll an investment is essential if Australia is to avoid slipping further behind. Unfortunately, the reality is that we are a very long way from achieving such a situation. The government has been unable or unwilling to implement any clear strategic framework for the long term development of Australian science and technology. The effort needed to cement a culture of innovation in the national psyche, described by the Business Council of Australia's innovative study commission as 'imperative to enable Australian businesses to be internationally competitive', has not been forthcoming. For those who wish to look-there are many opposite who would rather, I fear, bury their heads in the sand-the signs of failure are there to see. Australia has one of the weakest industrial research and development efforts in the developed world. Despite all the government's huffing imd puffing, and despite recent improvements in· the performance in industry and in research and development, the fact remains that Australia's relative performance in this regard has not pushed us up one rung on the international ladder during the past decade. In the mid-1980s, Australia was 17th out of 24 OECD nations in terms of its private sector research and development effort and we are still 17th today. This month's current account 'deficit of $1.26 billion is another grim reminder that as a nation we are living beyond our means and still have avery long way to go in relation to our export performance. . The science and technology statement released each year has little meaning as a policy statement. Departmental missions in science and technology are unclear and there is little effort at forward thinking to provide universities, research councils and industry with a genuine sense of direction. There has been a refusal to· address the issue of declining research infrastructure within theuniversities, despite the findings of the government's own National Board of Employment, Education and Training, which identified 'serious shortcomings'in this area. Government can do much more to encourage a wider appreciation of the importance of science and technology to Australia's· future. The quality of science and technology education in schools is a key part of such a strategy. Yet there has so far been little or no effective action to address the-downgrading' of scientific knowledge and skills in favour of 'social and political agendas' that the Australian Academy of Science was so critical of in the draft profile. The fact is that the policy advisory process in science and technology .is not working optimally. The science and engi-eering council of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has so far, despite good features, which I do not deny, failed to fulfil expectations that it would consider strategic issues for Australian science and do so in a way which would lead to a strategic perspective and framework being brought to bear upon government policy in this area. The academies have largely been sidelined in a policy sense, even though they have· great capacity to be more closely involved in· the process of advising government on science policy initiatives. Indeed, this is probably to some extent one of the unintended consequences of the role that ASTEC has played over the years. ASTEC for some time has faced certain difficulties. It has, since the Fraser government, had a special relationship with. the Prime Minister, but of course the importance of this relationship to the promotion of science and technology in this country depends on the interest of the Prime Minister in the development of Australian capacity in these areas. When the Prime Minister has had little interest, ASTEC has been left out on a limb. We know of course the level of interest of the present Prime Minister in science and technology. This was confirmed for us by the President of the Labour Party, the honourable member forLalor(Mr Barry Jones). He made it quite clear at the recent ANZUS conference that the Prime Minister is really not interested in Australia's science and technology effort. As the honourable member for Lalor said: To date he hasn't shown. conspicuous interest in science. Professor Graham Johnston, the newly ap, pointed head of the nation's leading representative science group, the Federation of Australian Scientific and Technological Societies, has also alluded to the prime ministerial deficiency in this area. Of the Prime Minister, Professor Johnston said: . . . is not yet knowledgeable about science and technology ... We would like to help him learn Of course, the Prime Minister faces a difficulty in becoming knowledgeable in this area because he has chosen-characteristically, in view of the politics of the New South Wales right faction and the way it operates-to appoint his key numbers man as the minister for science, a minister who really has very little interest in this area, who has become lmown for making science policy on the run, without any substantial consultative process being undertaken, in an ad hoc way, to, meet what seem to be the political needs of the minister. Indeed, it is quite extraordinary that this minister; after the fiasco of his first in office when he succeeded in alienating virtually the entire science community in Australia with his unthought out recommendations to reorganise the nation's leading scien,. tific organisations, has apparently 'returned to the fray; In this morning's Age there is a report that, despite opposition from the minister's senior ministerial colleagues-one of whom is the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans, and the other of whom was the now departed Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly):-he returned to the fray. Perhaps the departure of the honourable member for Canberra from her ministerial position has encouraged him to take' up an issue which previously he was unable to successfully promote amongst his ministerial and cabinet colleagues. According to this morning's Age, Senator Schacht is believed to have told CSIRO's chief executive, Dr John Stocker, and the heads of CSIRO institutes that he plans to proceed with the construction of a national marine institute, which involved, in his previous and possibly in his present proposal, the hiving off of certain divisions from the CSIRO. Apparently he has also said that he intends to withhold some $50 million from CSIRO's budget in order to create such an institute. . . If the minister for science is again prowling Rambo-like around Australia's scientific community with his guns blazing to show his ministerial colleagues that he is indeed somebody to be reckoned with and he is indeed reviving or attempting to revive recommendations that even his own review, the MCKinnon review last year, said simply were' not sensible and should not' be considered· until a national policy framework is in' place, I believe that his tenure in this portfolio will be quite short lived. Mr Elliott- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: it has been a fascinating discussion, but I would suggesUhat a reference to the measures in the bill would be appropriate. So I draw your attention to the point of relyear evance. It seems that this is a very long way away from the actual thrust of the provisions that are in the bill that is being considered the House.",50
24,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER AND CABINET,"I have been listening very carefully to the comments of the honourable member for Goldstein on this matter and, because of the broad ranging nature of the bill-it amends the Australian Science and Technology Council Act and other acts-I rule that there is no pOint of order.",53
25,Dr KEMP,PRIME MINISTER AND CABINET,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. My remarks are very much directed to the principal issue raised by the bill, which nature of the advisory and. policy making processes of the government in relation to science and technology policy. The point inaking,by referring to this extraordinary report about Senator Schacht in this morning's press, is to illustrate again how unsatisfactory the current policy making process in this area is. The changes that are a part of this bill unfortunately do nothing to give any. assurments. ance to the coalition or to the science munity generally that the government is interested in establishing an appropriate policy process for science and for technology. .. I have commented on the difficulties ASTEC faced in its previous incarnation because of the lack of interest of the Prime Minister in policy. Because of the special relationship that this organisation has had with the Prime Minister, it is only able to effective if indeed' there ministerial interest. But, as I have said, there is none. There has also been a difficulty of process faced by ASTEC in actioning its reports because, once made, these reports have no clear path through the bureaucracy which might lead to their being acted on in effective way. As a result of this sort of consideration, it was the view of the coalition before the 1993 election that there was much to be said for merging ASTEC completely with the science council. In 1992 the government review of ASTEC, headed by Sir Rupert Myers. The Myers committee concluded that ·although ASTEC should continue as a sepaupgrade ""rate organisation with its present functions, had lost some of its initial drive and needed to enhance its effectivene-s. In order to by improve its capacity to undertake its work, the review committee considered that ASTEC should give greater' emphasis to industrial of science and technology and should increase the proportion of its members from an industrial background. It also believed that ASTEC should provide the government with new ideas and greater warning about issues that may shape the science and technology policy agenda. . It is clear that the government has not accepted this recommendation. Indeed, it has is the preferred to move some distance, but only some distance, towards the coalition position. But, in not accepting the coalition's policy on I am this, it has left ASTEC in a kind of limbo land, in an uncertain position, neither independent nor a flilly integrated part of the science council arrangements. This has led, not surprisingly, to confusion about what the minister has had to. say about these arrangeHe has described ASTEC, on the one comhand, as the government's primary Source Of independent advice, yet the provision in this bill transfers responsibility for ASTEC staff to the Department of the Prime Minister and that Cabinet,which would seemto mean a significant reduction in the independence of ASTEC. The government's confusion on this matter is really a part of the bt:oad pattern of lack of direction and lack of PlJrpose that is be evident throughout this policy area at the is a genuine prime present time. The nature of the arrangement ·which is .foreshadowed in this bill really raises a number of significant questions about the advisory processes on science and technology. an The science council has been focused particularly on specific issues rather than on broad strategic questions. The presentations to the science council have come essentially from those interested in these policy areas and, therefore, have not really provided in themselves as documents. appropriate bases for established a government action. One of the steps which could be taken to the role of the science council and to it give the government a greater sense of direction would be for that council to focus more on major strategic issues in the area of sciAt the moment ASTEC is in a kind of limbo land. The government has neither abolished it nor given it independence. It is not clear what its role is to be. If it is to be the government's primary advisory body on science policy issues, one can only wonder why, when the government was looking for policy advice on the future of nuclear science or marine science, it did not ask ASTEC to provide it with advice and in the end set up independent inquiries. I am afraid this piece of legislation raises, and continues to raise, very significant questions about the way the government is conducting policy in this area. It will not reassure the science and technology community in this country that this policy area is in the hands of an interested and responsible government.",53
26,Mr WILLIAMS,PRIME MINISTER AND CABINET,"I note that I am the third member in a row from this side of the House to speak on the Prime Minister and Cabinet (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. I wish to speak on only one aspect of the bill; that is, the provisions of the Archives Act relating to cabinet notebooks. In this respect the bill had a predecessor in 1992-the Cabinet Notebooks (Access and Protection) Bill 1992, which lapsed when the election held on 13 March last year was called. The proposal in the 1992 bill is different from the proposal in the present bill. The 1992 proposal was to prevent the use of cabinet notebooks in court proceedings rather than simply to deal with them from an archive point of view and leave it to the courts to deal with them in legal proceedings. It is perhaps of significance to understand what cabinet notebooks are. They were explained at the time of the introduction of the 1992 bill by the then Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General. It seems that since 1951 there has been a system in place·to facilitate the formal recording of the outcome of cabinet deliberations. It was developed as a means of assisting the cabinet . process in that respect by providing an effective link between the priVate deliberations in the cabinet room and the Public Service, which of course gives effect to government decisions. The system allows cabinet minutes, which constitute the formal record of cabinet decisions, to be circulated to ministers and departments as soon as possible for appropriate action. The practice is to have three note takers at cabinet meetings. They are officers of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. One of them is the secretary to the cabinet. At least one of the note takers attempts to take as full a record as possible of discussions. The form of the notes is entirely within the discretion of each note taker. While the notebooks do not record verbatim the proceedings of cabinet, the note takers do endeavour to record the gist of the contributions of individual ministers. Their object is to provide an. aid in the drafting 'of cabinet minutes. The cabinet minutes, which record the collective decision of ministers on particular items, do not contain any reference to the contributions of individual ministers to discussion on particular items. The notebooks, therefore, contain records which are merely a means to the end of preparing a definitive minute which will be generally circulated. Access to the notebooks is very limited. Ministers, including prime ministers, do not have direct access to cabinet notebooks. The practice, apparently, is for the note takers, at the. request of a minister, to refer to the notebooks for the purpose of assisting an individual minister to recall his or her individual contribution to a discussion. I understand that on one occasion in the past a former minister the Hon. Clyde Cameron was given that sort of access. to notebooks relating to. a period when he was a member of the cabinet. It seems that there ,is only one occasion when the contents of a notebook have been shown to a person outside the cabinet system. This was done with the express agreement of the Prime Minister, at the time of the Hope royal commission in 1983, for the purpose of examining issues concerning the actions of a cabinet minister. The bill proposes that, for the purposes of the Archives Act, access to cabinet notebooks be restricted for a period of 50 years. As the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), the shadow minister responsible for the bill, has indicated, the coalition accepts the appropriateness of that. The point I highlight is that,while in the 1992 bill the government sought to .limit access to cabinet notebooks for the purpose of court proceedings, in this bill there is no such attempt. The action of the government in introducing the 1992 bill was prompted by a case then.in the. Federal Court brought by the Northern Land Council against the Commonwealth..The council was seeking the production of cabinet notebooks to assist in setting aside an agreement entered into by the Northern Land Council. In the Federal Court, Mr Justice JeI}kinson considered the objections of· the Commonwealth to· the production oLthe notebooks but determined that they should be produced. He directed that 113 cabinet notebooks be made available, not to the council but to the legal representatives of the council, for the purpose of the proceedings. The case was taken on appeal to the full Federal Court and the decision of. the trial judge was unanimously upheld. It was at that juncture that the 1992 bill was introduced. Subsequent to the lapse of the bill, the matter was dealt with by the High Court, which delivered a decision in April of 1993. The High Court determined by a majority of six to one that the Commonwealth should not have been ordered to produce the notebooks for ·inspec;tion. The ·majority judgment contains some inter:esting comments on the nature of cabinet government as understood by the members of the majority. The judgment stated: Whilst there is increasing public insistence upon the concept of open government, we do not think that it has yet been suggested that Members of Cabinet would not be severely hampered in the performance of the function expected of them if they had constantly to look over those who would seek to criticize and publicize their participation in discussions in the Cabinet room. It is .not so much a matter of encouraging candour or frankness a- of ensuring that decisionapproach making and policy development by Cabinet uninhibited. However, the High Court determined that the claim by a minister of immunity from production pursuant to a court order was not absolute. The court determined that the production of the documents recording cabinet deliberations could be ordered but held that such an order should only be made in exceptional circumstances which give rise to a significant likelihood that the public interest in the administration of justice outweighs the very high public interest in the confidentiality of such documents. The court determined that it was doubtful whether civil proceedings would ever warrant the production of documentsrecordirig cabinet deliberations upon a matter which was current or controversial. It was the view of the majority that, in criminal proceedings, exceptional circumstances might exist if withholding the documents would prevent a successful prosecution or impede the conduct of the defence. . Given the very limited circumstances in which disclosure will be permitted, the government has apparently decided, and the bill reflects it,. that it is unnecessary specifically to prohibit the production of cabinet notebooks in court proceedings. The coalition accepts that this is a realistic and sensible approach .. The point that was emphasised in the Northern Land Council case is that, in the determination of a claim for what used to be called 'crown privilege', what is now usually referred to as 'public interest immunity', the appropriate course to be followed is for the court to assess the validity of the claim and for that purpose to inspect documents for the purpose of deciding whether the claim should be upheld. It needs to be'highlighted for the purpose of the debate on this bill that the High Court was saying that this principle is applicable to what are, in effect, the most sacrosanct of the documents held by executive their shoulders at government. That approach by the government in rela. tion· to courts contrasts sharply with the by the government in relation to is houses of parliament and to parliamentary committees exercising the powers of a house of parliament. Yesterday in question time. I asked the Attorney-General(Mr Lavarch)a question without notice ieil:iting to the very issue; I suggested that the Attorney-General was aware, and he was, of the practice of the courts, and in his. reply' he referred to the Northern Land Council case. But his reply went on to assert what I regard as wrong andunaccepta:ble propositions.The Attorney said that the fundamental weakness implicit in my' question was that I was equating the role of a committee of the parliament with the role of the court. That is not correct at all. But, taken at a more limited level, it is wrong,. in my view, for the Attor:ney to suggest that one cannot in some limited situations equate a house of parliament or a parliamentary committee with a court. It is wrong as a matter of principle ill the context of where a - house or a committee seeks the production of documenl$or summons a witness to give evidence. We have to bear in mind, of course, that the courts and parliament· have identical historical origins. Unlike the modern courts, however, parlia:ment has not .developed mechanisms for dealing with competing cla:ims of immunity from production and an order for production of documents. It seems to me that there is no reason why patliamentary committees cannot develop similar mechanisms to those that courts have used. There is, in fact, one example of an attempt by a parliamentary committee to do what courts commonly do. It is referred to in the third report of 1992 of the Procedure Committee of the Senate. What occurred in 1982 is recorded in the report in these terms: Resolut-ons then' pasSed by the Senate requiring production of documents to a person appointed to act as the Senate's agent to delete from the documentsmaterial which should not be disclosed particularly on the ground of risk.of prejudice tlegal proceedings . . . . This is. also referred to in Australian Senate Practice. Ot.her mechanisms used by a court can readtly be suggested. It would be appropriate in some situations, for example, for a chairman and deputy chairman of a committee to be the only persons to inspect the documents. Counsel assisting a committee could be given the· role of inspecting the documents for the purpose of advising on the claim. A committee could go into camera. A variety of mechanisms are available. A second suggestion made by the Attorney General was that the issue is in effect settled by.a paper written in 1972. The paper to which the' Attorney-General referred, as I understand it, is a paper by the Attorney General at the time, Senator Ivor Greenwood QC, and the' Solicitor-General of the time, Mr Robert EllicottQC. It is entitled Parliamentary committees: powers over and protection afforded to witnesses: That paper set out what was. accepted wisdom of the day-':that a a claim by minister for public interest immunity was in effect conclusive. It has to be pointed out, however, that at that time that was the view also of the courts. Since then there have beeri major changes; in fad, they had started prior to the 1972 report with the decision of the House of Lords in Conway v. Rimmer. Since that time there have been dramatic changes, culminating in the Northern Lafld Council case in the High Court last year. In addition, we have seen major changes in the statutory scheme relating to the accountability of government; we have the establishment of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal; we have judicial review formalised under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act; we have an ombudsman; and, most relevantly, we have the Freedom ·of Information Act. .' It is of interest also that the views expressed in 1972 by Senator Greenwood and Mr Ellicott were not adhered to by them for long. In an addendum to a report of the Senate the Standing Committee of Privileges of 7 October 1975, Senator Greenwood referred to the 1972 report and indicated that his view had changed. He pointed out that 'the conclusiveness of the minister's certificate is for the Senate to determine'. Mr Ellicott. also changed his view. In evidence he gave to the Senate's current print ?le?is inquiry on. 16 February 1994, he md1cated that the 1972 view was based on principles established by courts which had long since changed. ' The Attorney-General also referred to the practice. s.ince 1972-which, he alleged, has been contmuously followed by governmentthat the certification by a minister as to the public interest of a particular document to be kept confidential should be accepted by the parliamentary committee inquiring into the subject. That assertion of what is said to be a practice, I have to reject. There is no instance to which I can draw attention where any house of parliament, or even a parliamentary comm.ittee, has accepted that view. There are many instances where there has - n a contest between a parliamentary committee and the executive government as to the production of a document. In my opinion, it is really quite unacceptable that the current stand-off should continue in the way it does. Accountability by ministers, accountability by the executive government,is fundamental to the democratic system. It is also incumbent, in my view, on both houses and parliamentary committees to develop mechanisms for appropriate assessment of accountability on this important issue, the accountability of a minister for a claim to public interest immunity in respect of documents or, similarly, in respect of witnesses. In relation to the cabinet notebooks provisions, the coalition supports the bill. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mrs Crosio) read a third time. NA Strategic Review 1993 Debate resumed from 22 February, on  That the House take note of the papers.  Secretary to the Minister for Defence)-by leave-The statement by the Minister for Defence, Senator Ray, when he· tabled. the review highlighted the main features of the strategic review. In my comments this afternoon I will elaborate on the ramifications of the new global and regional environment for Australia's defence science and industry. My contribution follows earlier ones by the ministerrepreseriting the Minister for Defence in this House, the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), and also the shadow spokesman for defence, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), in what I must say was the least objectionable set of words I have heard him string together in this place· for a long time, in the spirit of bipartisanship on defence in this place. The Strategic review 1993· reaffirms the importance of Australian industry in contributing to our defence self-reliance. It emphasises the need for clarifying further the defence priorities for support from Australian industry and the advantage of defence engagement with the region. This more precise targeting of what industrial capacity is strategic for defence is currently being researched by the Defence Industry Committee, which is chaired by Mr David Hoare, and will be further elaborated on in'the forthcoming white paper. Local industry has benefited from defence contracts over the past decade. In pursuing greater defence self-reliance, the government has increased the proportion of spending in Australia on new major capital defence systems· and equipment over the past decade from around 30 per cent to approximately 65 per cent. In total, 88.9 per cent of the 1993-94 defence budget of $9.786 billion will be spent in Australia. While Defence depends heavily on Australian industry for the provision of goods and services, this emphasis on self-reliance does not mean we can or need seek to be self, sufficient. Beyond the combat and combat related needs of our defence capability, Australia will not need to carry out all tasks itself. There are also limits to the extent to which Australia can divorce itself from overseas support, particularly in important areas of new and complex technology. Complete self-sufficiency is unachievable, and this would divert resources from priority defence tasks at the expense of capability. Hence, as well as developing local support capabilities, ensuring the ability to draw on support from overseas is an integral part of the government's strategic planning for defence. Since the release of defence policy guidelines for industry in 1984, the government has maintained its emphasis on the need for defence industry policy to be consistent with broader defence policy and correspondingly strategic requirements. Areas of industry identified as important to the long-term effectiveness of our defence forces are repair, adaption and maintenance of equipmentconsumables, where we can least rely on overseas sourcing and stockpiling-and, in some cases, the development of new technology. The 1987 defence white paper and the 1'992 defence policy and industry report restated these requirements and provided some broad priorities for Australian industry capabilities. Strategic review 1993 develops the theme further. It outlines more comprehensively those capability areas in which Defence will look to local industry for support. These areas are: command, control and communications, information technology, intelligence, surveillance, weapons platforms, combat systems, munitions and logistic support. More specific capability priorities for industry will continue to evolve as Defence more precisely defines operational requirements and the capabilities to meet these requirements. In terms of key Australian Defence Force priorities, in broad terms the capability Defence is looking for from industry may be defined by reference to sector categories. I will mention some of these now. First, taking command control and communications .functions, defence requires the best technology available in the world, adapted to our environment, fully integrated and secure, to ensure an edge over any potential adversary. Given technological advances in the commercial field, Defence is looking to increase its support from industry in the software development and systems integration areas, recognising that some technology transfer from overseas may be involved. Security integration and adaption require considerable indigenous industry support and Defence will aim to maximise the use of technology that has dual defence and civilian applications. Secondly, I refer to the· important area of intelligence. Defence intelligence requires systems that provide a high level of operational availability on a continuous basis and timely distribution to users. In the same way as I mentioned . for command control and communications activity, in the intelligence function, software support and systems integration are also important. For surveillance, defence requires leading edge technology adapted to meet our unique geophysical environment. It also needs· advanced facilities for the integration and analysis of information from various sources. Maintenance and through life support of these systems by Australian industry are a high priority for defence. In relation to weapons platforms, the maintenance, repair and through life support of weapons platforms are a high priority for industry assistance to defence. Adaption to meeLour environment, once again, is a high priority; The production or manufacture of platforms in Australia will be a priority when it represents value for money or where it contributes to the development of capabilities and skills required for through life support; The maintenance, repair and through life support of combat systems are of the same high priority as they are for weapons platforms. Especially important is the capability to integrate weapons systems with associated command, control and communication systems and the skills required, once again, to adapt them to our environment. With regard to munitions, Defence will be looking for a combination of supply by Australian industry for high usage items .and, for those. items where the pOSSIbility exists for disruption of overseas supply and of our stockpiling. Finally, in this listing of strategic industry capabilities, I turn to logistic support, includingtransport and supply of consumables. In this field, Defence will make maximum use of facilities and services already available in our community. In particular, Defence will be looking· for increased industry support in. the north of Australia. What I have just outlined suggests that certain industry sectors will be of particular importance to Defence. The electronics and optics industry will be required to look to support intelligence. systems, systems integration activities,·weapons systems and surveillance. The communications. and information technology industries will be looked to for support of command, control and communication systems, intelligence systems and critical management and administration systems to integrate with specific weapon systems. The aerospace industry will be looked to for support in the maintenance and provisions of infrastructure for the operation of aircraft and their systems, and to adopt and adapt various aircraft systems from around the world. The shipbuilding and repair industry can expect opportunities· to support and maintain ships and their systems and to adapt other systems. The munitions industry, which the government owns, will be required to produce stocks of high usage munitions and maintain sophisticated munitions such as missiles. To complete the list,in relation to land vehicles, local suppliers can be expected to look for and to adapt, repair and maintain vehicles suited to Australia's terrain and environment. In addition to. this list of industries, Defence is increasingly looking to broader Australian industry on a competitive basis to provide support services, consumable items and minor capital items across a very wide range of areas. Our defence policy has always tried to ensure that our capabilities are of adequate technological level to meet any likely threat to Australia. Our use of advanced technology will continue .to be a key element in our overall defence approach. Our emphasis on technology reflects the realities of a small population defending a large country, as well as our technical capacity to use advanced equipment. The range of new technologies relative to defence is expanding. We should continue to seek innovative applications to increase our capacity for defence. in the context of a constrained resource outlook. Given the limitations on resources, we must be selective in our use of advanced techflol':' ogy. We need the most advanced capabilities in areas such as command and control, information transfer and integration, all-weather day and night operations, and the ability to control and concentrate force rapidly and precisely. Judgments on the balance between technological quality and the quantity of equipment will become increasingly important. Planning should identify opportunities for quality and quantity trade-off. We invest heavily in defence science arid technology as taxpayers. Close collaboration is required between defence science and industry in the development of new capabilities. Industry should be encouraged to undertake complete engineering developments to the point where they can be acquired by Defence's new capabilities. The Defence Science and Technology Organisation should undertake engineering development only for high priority capability areas if local or overseas industry cannot do so at an acceptable cost or if security considerations are paramount. . As Defence more clearly defines its operational capabilities and the in-country industry capabilities required by the defence forces, priorities will be communicated to industry. Defence maintains regular contact with industry to keep its members informed of the needs of our defence forces. Industry has a role to play in bringing new capabilities into service and enhancing the effectiveness of equipment already in service. Strategic review 1993 em.phasises the need for close collaboration between defence science and industry in the development of new capabilities, and industry is expected to play an increasing role in supporting existing capability through the commercial support program. Whenever it is practical and cost-effective to do Defence should 'buy Australian' to support self-reliance. We need a judicious blend of overseas and indigenous sources, complemented by stockpiling. In the remaining time available, can I simply say that the Strategic review 1993 provides a useful guide to local industry. It places the relationship betWeen Defence and industry on a solid footing by enunciating clearly our industry goals in relation to strategic goals. Although further work needs to be done to implement these measures, the government is convinced that the existing successful track record of Australian industry, combined with its obvious potential for additional growth, augurs well for the nation and its defence. Defence will continue its commitment to optimise local industry support capabilities which are critical to the defence of Australia, within our collective security cooperation with our immediate neighbours. To conclude, in addition to its value to industry, Strategic review 1993 provides for the community,· both here and abroad, a comprehensive guide to the underlying principles motivating Australia's defence strategy. It also makes clear the government's commitment to emphasising a combined economic, trade and diplomatic approach to improving our relations in our region. I expect that the review and the government's broad policy in defence will receive widespread community support.",54
27,Mr SINCLAIR,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Firstly, I thank the honourable mem as he did. I had been under the rather foolish impression· that the blue meant what it said. The blue, of course, is the program of the House. If honourable members look at that, they will see that this matter is. listed for debate later this afternoon. I left the Turkish Foreign Minister in order to return. I thank the minister for being here. The defence strategic review follows what is a regular and recurrent appraisal of Australia's defence situation, known as the strategic bases paper, which is submitted successively to cabinet and is a product of a fairly close consideration between the Department of Defence, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Prime Minister's department and Treasury of how they see the world around us. Because of its nature as a public document, the Strategic review 1993 tends to be a fairly bland document which does not tell us any of the things we really want to know. I suppose that is to be expected, but it is regrettable, because the result tends to underplay some of those situations which all of us see around us but which we tend to ignore. Because it is the first paper presented since the end of the Cold War, I think it is unfortunate that that. should be so. review. . In looking at the overall strategic threat, I want· to· first identify a couple of concerns that, while mentioned in. the paper,; do .not seem to me to be adequately exposed. As I have explained, the Strategic review 1993-in its glossy cover and looking .pretty, and being presented by the Minister for Defence, Senator Ray-is a document that he feels is sufficiently innocuous to be exposed to public gaze. My worry-for all that I know, given any type of token significance by a minister of the government-is perhaps highlighted as a result. There are a number of worries which all of us in our theatre have, and which I do not think are sufficiently stated in the paper. Let me refer to the first, because this is the first paper since the end of the Cold War. What is happening about the outbreak of nationalism in what was the Soviet Union, which became the Commonwealth of Independent States, and which is now that loose affiliation of countries that are gradually trying to work out their way in the world? Within those countries, there are markedly independent national groups still asserting their individuality. The tragedy of it all is that it is really no better than what is going on in Bosnia-Herzergovina at the moment. In that area of the Balkans, in the Middle East and in the former soviet republics, there are many nations which are still asserting their right to be different. I say nations, but I really mean national groups. Th- conflict between individuals .linked together because of their origins, and the extent to which they seek to resort to violence to resolve their futures, are matters of great concern. I put that point first, since it is because of the outbreak of new nationalism that the United Nations has been turned to as a vehicle by which resolution of problems can be found. Peacekeeping is a subject that has involved Australia and, properly, the Australian Defence Force, although not so much perhaps in 1994 as in 1992 and 1993 .. But there are several characteristics of Australia's role in peacekeeping that need to be related back to that first area, which I see as perhaps inadequately dealt with within the strategic I would like a recognition by the wider community of the unique capability that we have within the Australian Defence Force. Australia· is a peculiar country. We are all extraordinarily proud of it and we feel quite comfortable with our Australian identity. However, we· need t() understand that, in a multinational peacekeeping group, those rather casual, self-sufficient, get-on-with-one'sneighbour, hail-fellow-well-met. characteristics-or however Australians are describedhave been the core reasons why Australian forces have been so extraordinarily successful. There is much in that of which we· should be proud. However, being proud and recognising the role they play has a price, and the price is that there has been a significant conunitment by the Australian Defence Force to peacekeeping which, in terms of personnel, equipment and expenditure, has meant that we have spent a lot more of our time than many expected in recent years in a role that is not even part of the defence task. Therefore, I think it would have been appropriate to have mentioned that broader problem in the strategic review paper. I have done it in a generic sense, and I. am not talking about anyone nation. The. first thing we have to do with theStrategicreview 1993 is to try to work out what sort of role Australand is is going to play in the defence of the wider world and where that affects our security, as distinct from just what our· national defence threat is. I do not believe that the Strategic review 1993 has sufficiently analysed the obligations that all of us feel come to a country like Australia which does not have a territorial neighbour, but which has an opportunity to playa significant role in trying to help others to help themselves, and so win peace in the world and achieve, hopefully, not only recognition of human rights, but also recognition of the democratic rights that, sadly, exist in so few countries. . My first concern in terms of the strategic review comes out of that wider world scene. I do not feel that enough emphasis is given to the rather extraordinary characteristic of Australians of all shapes, colours, races, creeds, origins and beliefs to endear themselves to their fellow men and women and to be able to fit into any community. Anybody who saw, for example, the peacekeeping force in Somalia or the peacekeepers in Cambodia would realise how extraordinary that characteristic is. An Australian private or corporal will have relatively senior officers of other countries coming to him Or her because of that unique capability of being able to get on with others and help people to help themselves. In that respect, I 'Would have liked there to have been a slightly different emphasis within the overall embrace of the strategic review. The second point relates to the defence of Australia. I have a concern about Papua New Guinea. Whilst there are some fairly blunt statements within the strategic review about Papua New Guinea, I do not think any of us can understate the situation in Bougainville and the extraordinary difficulty that we have had with the relationship with Papua New Guinea as it evolves as a separate nation. We have withdrawn much of our budget support and we are moving towards project aid. We have tried to allow Papua New Guinea to be totally independent. Despite that, I suspect that in our region the Australian .Defence Force has less knowledge of the capabilities the directions of the individual members of the PapuaNew Guinea defence force than it has of the personnel of every other country in our region. That is unfortunate. It is very important that Australia accept several things. Firstly, while nobody on either side of the politic;a) fence in this place would consider Papua New Guinea as anything. other than a totally independent country, we do have a particular responsibility to try to assist Papua New Guinea to face up to the enor:mous problems it will have in the future. The problems are compou,nded by its history and geography. . I read the other day that there are something like 4,500 languages in the world-I cannot rememberthe exact figure-of which about 1,500 are now spoken and about 600 of them are in Papua New Guinea. The division in that country is absolutely unbelievable. It is, r guess, a product of the physical terrain and lack of contact with the outside world. Honourable members who have been there will know the magnificent mountains-and the Ko.ko.da Trail-o.ver which Australians fo.ught against the Japanese during Wo.rld War II. . The co.untry is extrao.rdinarily iso.lated because o.f that terrain, and it also. creates pro.blems in trying to. fo.rm o.ne natio.n. In Australia state bo.undaries were laid do.wn because Australia was a co.lo.ny o.f the United Kingdo.m. The Papua New' Guinea boundaries were laid do.wn because New Guinea was o.riginally a co.lo.ny o.f Germany and Papua was a co.lo.ny o.fthe United Kingdo.m-Papua was at o.ne stage part o.f Australia-so. Papua New Guinea has bo.unda.ries that areno.t exactly the.se that the people who. live there necessarily reco.gnise. There is an eno.rmo.us problem in defining just what are the rights and freedo.ms o.f the people in Bo.ugainville, and ho.w in Australia we can ensure that the.se who. have suffered are no. Io.ngergo.ing to. suffer, that medical aid and o.ther fo.rms o.f aid are available to. the Bo.ugainvilleans and, as well, ho.w Bo.ugainville is go.ing to. establish itself in the future; Iho.pe that it is within Papua New Guinea. But whatever the future, I certainly do. no.t believe that Australia can iso.late itself fro.m· that - Jtuatio.n. No.thing abo.ut the Bo.ugainville situatio.n is in the Strategic review 1993, yet to. my mind it is pro.bably the mo.st immediate flashpo.int o.n which we need to. spend so.me time. There are a number o.f o.ther majo.r matters which I think have no.t been adequately dealt with· in the strategic review. I have no.t mentio.ned Ko.rea, where I see the prospects o.f a nuclear ho.lo.caust as mo.rereal than anywhere els- in the wo.r1d. I· have no.t spo.ken o.f the pro.blems that I still see in the settlement o.f Indo.china, o.f the difficulties that still exist the bo.rders between Vietnam and China, Vietnam and Lao.s, Vietnam and Cambo.dia, and Cambo.dia and Thailand, no.r have I spo.ken ·abo.ut Burma, no.w called Myanmar. There are a number o.f co.untries in o.urregio.n that I do. no.tthink are adequately dealt with in the review and yet all o.f them affect us. I do. no.t think we have been giving eno.ugh attentio.n to. the o.verall role o.f Australia in peacekeeping in the wo.rld o.r to. the problems o.f Australia and Papua New Guinea. I think they sho.uld be paramo.unt. In the time left to. me, I will refer briefly to. o.ne o.ther aspect o.f the strategic review. As we all kno.w, it will be fo.llo.wed by a white paper. There are three aspects to. that. The first is that fo.r the services there has been a real trauma that no. white paper presented by either side o.f politics has in fact been funded o.ver recent years. It is extrao.rdinarily difficult if the Defence Fo.rce is expected to. be able to. develo.p a defence capability but funds are no.t pro.vided fo.r it to. do. so..  pro.vide.",60
28,Mr SINCLAIR,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"That is right A strategic review is produced and everybo.dy says, 'Gee, that is great', and we criticise o.r co.mmend it. Then a white paper is produced and everybo.dy says, 'Right, that is the bo.o.klet o.n which we are going to. develo.p o.ur Defence Fo.rce·, and then the go.vernment do.es no.t provide themo.ney. There is a real pro.blem. I am. no.t blamingthe Labo.r Party, because we were just as bad; I was the lastco.nservative minister fo.r defence, so. I reco.gnise the problem. But I make the po.int that it is no. use creating an expectatio.n fro.m a white paper that is no.t go.ing to. be realistically funded. I ho.pe that in the productio.n o.f the white paper the go.vernment ensures that Treasury is well and truly tied do.wn, because there is a reaso.n· to. maintain an adequate, viable Defence Fo.rce. We have excellent men and wo.men in the Australian Defence Fo.rce and I feel very sad when they are no.t funded adequately. That is the first po.int. The seco.nd po.int is that the go.vernment has made a great deal o.f the fact that there has o.n been a significant increase in lo.cal co.ntent fo.r defence systems and equipment. I co.mmend it fo.r that. But I am mo.st unhappy that we are to.o. dependent o.n o.verseas design and equipment. I want to. talk abo.ut o.ne item o.f equipment, the LAV wheeled vehicle. We have an APS-an armo.ured perso.nnel carrier-that go.es back to. the end o.f Wo.r1d War II. It is a great vehicle but it is no.t suited to. Australian co.nditio.ns. If honourable members have travelled o.n dusty, dirty Australian roads, they would know that conditions are pretty lousy. I would hate to have to get out and fight after I have been shut up in the vehicle for a while. Defence has got a vehicle called the LAV vehicle, which comes from Canada. The trouble is that Canada is in the Northern Hemisphere and it has a cold climate. This vehicle is not designed for our terrain or for our climate. The tyres get thorns in them and they go flat. We have to start to recognise that there is every reason for us.' to give encouragement to Australian design; we should be able to achieve this. I do not have enough time to go into this, but there is a very good article on how the yanks achieve this. They give money as an incentive to private enterprise. They do it in shipping and in a lot of other ways. I would like to see Australia, in its white paper, accept the fact that we can give a few carrots as incentives to Australian industry to produce designs that can. be adopted by the Defence Force. It would add real meaning to our defence exports. It would ensure that we were self-sufficient. The underlying problem in our defence self-sufficiency in 1994 is that nearly every major piece of defence equipment comes from the United States. We rely on it to far too great an extent. I would like us to be self-sufficient in every way, but we are nOt. (TIme expired)  to reminisce a bit but Ido not want to be too indulgent. I have never had the opportunity to adequately thank those people who were invo!ved in the development of defence policy for mdustry that I was responsible for in 1992. Honourable members may recall that we had some six months in which to complete what was a very major task. I want to place on record my appreciation of the departmental team led by Andrew Podger, now the permanent secretary for the Department of Administrative Services, and the members of the steering committee. I cannot mention all the members but, in particular, I would like to thank Guy Verney, Rear Admiral Hunt and Major-General Gower. Of course, I want to mention my personal staff, Eddie Husic, Shari Soutl?erg and Patrick Cremen. All the people mentioned and others worked extraordinarily long hours, including Saturdays and Sundays to make sure we kept to the deadline. I welcome the paper; I think' it is a good paper. Because of time limitations I will not be. able to talk about all the good things in the paper. Instead, I will raise some issues. Firstly, while I welcome the prominence given to industry in the strategic review, I am really appalled at the lack of reference to the defence, science and. technology area and partieularly research' and development. It is absolutely crazy to think that we can talk about industry capability without talking about the R&D effort that underpins it. I will read from the 1992 paper because I think it highlights the shortcOmings or the absences: There will be an examination of future management and reporting arrangements for DSTO. In.co-sultation - ith.the ADF, industry and other sCI-ntlfic orgamsatlOns, Defence will develop options for the future management and reporting arrangements for DSTO. This will include examinations of: the benefits which might result from the introduction of 'user pays' and the establishment of D-TO as a statutory authority, or other form of OBE, with its own independent Board of Directors; arrangements. which might be needed to provide funding for longer term priorities to guard against too great a focus on shorter term needs..., the extent to whiCh financial commitment from c-stomers, particularly Defence customers, Will translate to better tasking in responsiven,ess of the DSTO. I have hang-ups about a couple of things. I am really hooked on the idea of the importance of research and development, particularly development. I admire the DSTO as being the second largest research institute in Australia. Given the climate of cutbacks in defence funding or where Defence funds so many of the major new initiatives of the government, I felt that the DSTO was really under some threat. We need to look to preserve that R&D capability within DSTO and certainly we need to encourage far more research and development in private enterprise. I have taken the view that the best relationship between' organisations is that of a customer and client. One cannot really say that about DSTO and Defence. That is why I believe that if the ADF and headquarters have to· task the DSTO with dollars we are going to have much better tasking and a much more responsive DSTO. Hence, I frankly favour core funding going to DSTO so that it can continue· with a baseline of core and fundamental research, but all.other activity must be funded out of ADF or headquarters programs. It is inevitable that it goes that way but there needs to be a decent public discussion about it I also think there is a major issue about how quickly one involves .industry, and the point at which one involves industry, in taking something from a general research stage into a product development or prototype development stage. One of the criticisms that DSTO has been subjected to is that it tends to hold onto things far too long, although I am the first to acknowledge some of its outstanding achievements. And last but not least is structure. Is it effective to have the DSTO as a run-of-themill program area within Defence or, if one really wants to strengthen this customer relationship, have it in the portfolio area but with an independent and statutory board? That board could really provide some of the business and strategic direction that DSTO may require from time to time and also it may be able to monitor and improve on the relationship between DSTO and its overwhelmingly major client, the ADF. I note that the suggestions about the opportunities for collaboration have been picked up and I certainly welcome them. I also note that there has been a real change now· in the climate of defence exports. Nothing excites me more than the proposal for the Malaysian patrol boats that Transfield started on when I was there and is spearheading it I would like to publicly acknowledge the role that the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray), the department and ADF have taken in getting behind these proposals. It has not been easy to change something that has been done within Australia for many years and adapt it to the requirements of a collaborative effort such that the patrol boats represent. I sincerely hope that they are successful because I believe that it will be very good for Malaysia, given the transfer of technology. It will be exceedingly good for Australia and it will demonstrate with a big bang just how superior some of our capabilities are in Australia. The right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) mentioned design. If there is one criticism of the defence policy in industry it is that it does not tackle the issue of design in a full-blooded way. My only defence is that a person has to pick his timing and, of course, the ADF has had some poor or bad experiences with locally designed products. But in a whole range of areas,and shipbuilding is one of them, we have certainly reached the limits of taking a prove- design and building them in Australia. The next logical step is to be involved in design. In many areas Australian industry has the capability. Certainly it is an area that the most white paper cannot ignore. I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for  already receiving strong suggestions from industry about their capability and about that next step. It will not surprise me to see that as the next major development in what has been a very exciting area; that is, the defence industry. I said that I would concentrate on a few critical areas. It is very ambitious to suggest that the white paper to be released at the end of the year is going to last for 10 to 15 years. I note that the last white paper did not last anything like that length of time. Probably half of that time isa much more realistic expectation. I do not think we should be embarrassed by the need to regularly review and update. . Through the committee that I am pleased to chair, there are some concerns that I hope our report will address, but I want to place on the public record that we· are still endorsing, as . we should, that the priority for Defence is the defence of· Australia. It is a really major statement that focuses very appropriately on defence planners. But having said that, I believe in peacekeeping. Sending a battalion to Somalia has brought about the need for some review, however. It seemed to stretch· the resources of the ADFto have a battalion away for such an extended, albeit defined, period. It is conceivable, given credible contingencies, that Australia may need to place a battalion in our north for an extended period, although there is no evident threat. Most Australians would be concerned if we were not able to do that with relative ease. The other concern is with regard to our reserves. We say that there are not two armies; that we defend in depth and the reserVes have an equal place with the regular army. However, I note that no reservists are ever sent overseas on peacekeeping missions. I do not particularly mind that the reservists play a secondary role, but all I plead is that we should be open with the Australian public. If the reserves are to playa secondary role to the regular army, I think we should say so and change our rhetoric. Getting back to Somalia, I note that Professor Dibb has already suggested that, whilst he disagrees with sending the battalion to Somalia, he sees it as quite conceivable that we should send a battalion to our strategic area of interest, that is, in our region, in the future. So the problem of our sustaining a battalion in the field for an extended period as a theoreticalproposition is not going to go away. With other committee members, I am raising and want to be informed about this issue of having a 5th battalion. Again, this is an issue that the white paper needs to take up and address very well. I now hav- an opportunity to say a couple of really complimentary things. Something that the review reinforces is the terriflceffort of. defence, civilian and. uniform people in building relationships with our ASEAN neighbours. For anyone who has not stumbled on this it comes as a great surprise, as it did to me. But it is of key interest that even when it may go through a difficult period-as, unfortunately, it may in the relationship between any neighbouring country and· Australia'-that defence relationship remains intact. So we should really appreciate and value the fact that Defence is strongly underpinning the initiatives of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and it is adding depth to· the quality and quantity of·· the relationship we have with our neighbours. We hope to strengthen even further our defence relationship with Indonesia, but I still do not get the feeling that we have a comprehensive foreign affairs program of developing the Indonesia-Australia relationship in the same way as we have in defence. If I am wrong, I would be very pleased to hear from Mr Costello at Foreign Affairs. It seems to me that Foreign Affairs keeps doing more of the same. One of the popular misconceptions in defence, and this is very much addressed in the paper, is that, with the collapse of the Cold War, Australia has the so-called opportunity to yield a peace dividend. We continually need to remind the Australian public that Australia's defence forces were never structured to meet a cold war threat and therefore, with the collapse of the Cold War, and with the collapse of communism in eastern Europe, there is really no change to our defence posture. As the strategic review suggests, this collapse has added complexities for us in our relationships. I am pleased to say that the paper notes that ASEAN countries have done a commendable job in improving dialogue· and bilateral· and multilateral understanding through thdr operations, and our region is· marked by peace: I am sure all honourable members would hope that that would continue for the foreseeable future but, more importantly, that Australia and its defence forces will be able, with all the good things that they are currently doi-g, to playa significant role in ensuring that.

29,Mr BRADFORD,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I appreciate the opportunity to make a contribution to the debate on the Strategic review 1993 paper, and I do so for a number ofreasons. Firstly, my electorate comprises a very large number of retired and returned service people who take an active interest in defence matters and constantly make me aware of their views in the area of defence and defence personnel, and that I appreciate very much. Secondly, my father was· a returned serviceman and I took a great interest in his activities as a serviceman during the Second World War. I also have the distinction of being one of the very few veterans remaining in this parliament. So I do take an interest in defence matters. The opposition, as has already been stated by the shadow minister for defence, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), broadly supports the thrust of this particular review, although, as the shadow minister said, we have a number of concerns, some of which were expressed very ably by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) in this debate. It probably goes without saying that defence is a key area of government responsibility. It is a very large area of' government' expenditure, probably almost the largest in the budget, with around $10 billion being spent on defence. The responsibility of ensuring an adequate defence capability for Australia is an important responsibility of government. When people elect governments, one of' the things that they expect a government to do is to deliver on that issue, that is, to ensure that Australia does have an adequate defence capability. There are, as I suggested, a iarge number of people that take an interes- in defence by virtue of the fact that they are former service people: These days there is a greater need than ever to continue to make young people aware of the importance of defence. It is coming up to 50 years now since the end of the Second World War. I was born right at the end of the Second World War and my fiftieth birthday will actually coincide very much with the end of the Second World War; I was born on 3 January 1946. I know that I look much younger than that,' but that is a fact, so I am right on the leading edge of the baby boomers-:Mr Crean-It is all that swimming.",65
30,Mr BRADFORD,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"It is, and the minister is swimming .well too. I see him every morning, and early too, which I must commend him for. The younger generation has not experienced directly the importance of defence, and the generation that is growing up behind me did not even.go through those years of Australia's direct involvement in the war in Vietnam from about 1965 through till 1972. To some extent this review addresses the need for people, particularly younger people, to be made aware of the importance of defence and of the need to be ready to. defend the country should the need arise. . There is no doubt that the world is a volatile place; things change quickly. One only has to read history leading up to both the first and the second world wars to realise how easily a huge war can actually start and how circumstances can suddenly come together to create a conflagration of the extent that occurred then. Of course, all of us would h<;>pe-and pray, indeed-that there will never be a third world war, but we cannot discount the possibility that there will be. There are many things happening in the world today, flot the least what is happening in the former Yugoslavia, where there are all sorts of interests. What makes the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina so difficult to solve is not only that the three main protagonists in Bosnia are fighting, but also that their allies extend into all parts of the Eastern and Western world. That makes a solution to the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina so difficult. At the same time, of course, it shows that the situation in the Balkans has the potential-and I think the United Nations and the Western nations and, indeed, the Eastern nations are aware of the potential-to explode beyond the borders of the former Yugoslavia, without any great difficulty at all. Of CQurse, we know that that part of the world was very much a focal point in both the first and second world wars, particularly in the First World War. Many people. probably do not realise that the First World War actually began in Sarajevo; and the circumstances surrounding that were, to 'a large extent at least, unexpected. . We cannot afford to be complacent at all aboutthe defence of our country. I would like to believe that we on· this side of the House are completely committed to having a strong defence capability. To some extent, we would like to believe that the government had that same commitment. It would be very easy, for instance, if one was not vigilant in this area, to say that there was $10 billion going on the defence of the country that could be spent on hospitals and schools and all sorts of other things. There are people in the community who probably take that view. Fortunately, the vast majority of Australians believe that we have to spend money on defence. It is an expensive proposition. It requires not only a large number of personnel-highly trained, qualified and renumerated personnel-but also a very high level of equipment; and equipment is something that is changing almost by the moment. It is of no use to have a defence force that is not equipped with the latest available equipment. If it is going to be effective, it has to be armed effectively and it has to be supported effectively by the best levels of equipment' that are available. It is expensive to defend Australia, to ensure that we have an adequate defence capability. As I say, we on this side of the House strongly support the need for a strong ongoing defence capability. One could observe, whtm talking about the volatility of world events, that the Middle East continues to be an area of great concern. How quickly things can change. A week or two ago, we could see Israel and the PLO getting very close to a - rapprochement, a peace-and not only a peace for Israel, which most of us in this place regard and, certainly speaking for myself, I regard as highly desirable, but a peace that involved a place for the Palestinians to live and call home and a peace in the whole of that region. The Middle East, almost like the former Yugoslavia, is very much a focal point for the future peace of the world. It is very desirable that Israel and the PLO accommodate each other. It is also desirable that Syria and the other major protagonists are brought into that arrangement to provide a new era of peace and cooperation in a part of the world which, for all sorts of historical reasons, continues to have problems. Yet we saw a week or so ago one extremist, in the name of the Israeli cause, carry outan.horrific mass murder which stalled the process to the extent that it is now badly undermined. We need to hope and pray that the right pressures are applied to get Israel. and the PLO back together again so that they put that terrible event behind them. It is amazing how quickly things can change. It is amazing how unexpected events can suddenly occur; and they can occur just as easily, I believe, in our part of the world. So we need to be ready. Australia's recent role in peacekeeping forces, which has been alluded to by a number of speakers in this debate, has added a new dimension to the activities of the Australian Defence Force.' It is a very valuable and worthwhile dimension. Once again, Australian service personnel have. served with great distinction in peacekeeping forces under the auspices of the United Nations. Many such peacekeeping forces are in operation in a number of parts of the world, and some have been operating for many years. The most recent one that comes to mind is the role of the Australians in Cambodia. We can be very proud of the role that we, as Australians, and our service people, as our representatives, have played in Cambodia. They brought a new and, to some extent, unexpected level of peace and stability not only within the borders of Cambodia but also, to some extent, extending beyond that country. We can also be proud of the fact that the United Nations contingent in Cambodia was commanded so ably by an Australian, Lieutenant-General John Sanderson.' Australia gained great. kudos from its defence service personnel operating' there, and that is something that every Australian can be proud of. Likewise, the honourable member for Chifley  bution in Somalia. Once again, it was a difficult operation, yet it was one that was carried out with distinction by Australians as a part of the United Nations contingent. The other aspect of peacekeeping is that it gives to the Australian Defence Force' not only an additional dimension but also· an additional opportunity to operate in an active theatre, not necessarily of war, but a theatre nevertheless; which may, in some respects, be hostile. It gives our service personnel valuable experience. It adds a level of experience that would prove very valuable in the event of having to serve in a theatre of war in some part of the world. So the opposition supports, and I know the government is committed to, Australia having an ongoing role in United Nations activities around the world. I believe that that is a vital element of modem-day defence. I have a number of concerns about the current operation of the ADF. One that consistently comes up is the curl-ent rush what is quaintIycalled 'downsizing'. It is a pity to see the numbers in the Defence Force falling. On 30 June 1993, the total number of uniformed personnel in the ADF was 91,547, and that continues to trend down. It is particularly in these times of high unemployment, that that is the case. I am not suggesting, necessarily, that the ADF is the ideal body to provide employment opportunities, although in many respects it It would be politically incorrect, and perhaps a little unpopular, to suggest that national service of some sort should be reintroduced, yet that concept is very popular within the community at large. Not a week goes by that I do not get input from a number of constituents who suggest national service as an obvious way to provide a worthwhile activity for young people. I can understand that the ADF does not want to give such an opportunity, nor does it really have a role to do that and nor is it set this year. up to do that. The point is that hardly a week goes by that I do not get a young man or woman coming to me who wants desperately to join the army or the air force, or even the navy, in deference to my colleague the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor). Unfortunately, they are being knocked back; and these are really good quality young Australians. I suppose that, from the Defence Force perspective at the moment, it is very much a buyers market. That is a pity. When one is approached by a highly qualified' young person who really would be ideal as a member of any of the services but who is not able to get in simply because recruiting numbers are· down and the services are going about downsizing, it is a great pity. I ought to place on record, notwithstanding what I said a moment ago, my ongoing commitment to the concept of national service. I realise, as I also said a moment ago, that it might not be very politically correct to say that but, having been a national serviceman myself and having been conscripted straight out of the gates of university in early 1968 and subsequently going to Vietnam in 1969 through 1970, and speaking for those·of into us who did that, I can say that it was a wonderful experience. I do not think one would meet many of the twoto three-year national· servicemen of my generation that would not say that it was not a very worth:' a pity, while experience. (Tlmeexpired) .",66
31,Mr LES SCOTT,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Oxley) (2.42 p.m.)....,..I am pleased to have ,the opportunity today to speak on the Strategic review 1993 paper. The review is a comprehensive and thorough is. document that lays the groundwork for defence policy and practices in this nation for the remainder of the century. The review takes into account the enormous and far-reaching changes that have taken place in the strategic relationships throughout the world since the end of the Cold War and suggests avenues through which Australia's defence interests will be served in this new climate of uncertainty in some parts. It is clearly a significant document requiring the careful consideration of the House, and is a useful precursor to the defence white paper due later The first thing I would like to say is that this document is the first step in the process of reorganising and adapting our defence and strategic policies to the profound changes in the post-Cold War global security environment. The challenges that this new world order presents to Australia'S defence planners are wide ranging and very complex. The thinking that has gone into the strategic review and later the white paper is clearly directed to finding solutions to those challenges· The major requirement of any defence policy, of course, is to provide adequately for our own defence. Whilst the strategic review has not identified any particular immediate threat to Australia or our interests, that situa'tion cannot be guaranteed to continue in perpetuity. In particular, the risk that we could 'be drawn into a regional conflict exists. Our unique geostrategic conditions make the process of preparing the nation for a conflict difficult. For this reason the review has stated quite rightly that the highest priority of defence planning will continue to be the defence of Australia. Providing adequately for the defence of Australia·involves a range of initiatives. The review identifie- these as: (1) A national defence capacity to provide for the self-reliant defence of Australia and our interests; (2) encouraging the growth of a 'regional security community' via cooperative defence relationships with countries in the Asia-Pacific region, but with particular emphasis o'l South""East Asia; (3) continuing the alliance relationship with the United States in a way that will contribute to our national defence capacity and a broader regional security situation; and (4) continuing our high level of defence commitment to the UN and other multinational operations in order to provide a secure global environment. With regard to the first of these initiatives, the national defence capacity, we -!.e presented with unique challenges in developing a force structure for Australia. We have a small Defence Force to defend a very vast area, as we all know. This means that we must draw on the full range of Australia's resources, both military and civilian, to develop the greatest practical combat effectiveness and to respond to rapid changes in strategic imperatives. One of the most important functions of the national defence capacity is to enable us to carry out the essential combat anti combat related tasks ourselves, as these are the, tasks that other countries are lea:st likely to perform on our behalf. This not only meets our goal of self-reliance but also encourages participation of our regional. defence' partners by demonstrating our willingness to shoulder our part of the security burden. One of these tasks is the provision of adequate warning of a conflict or an immediate threat I would like to say a few words on this particular issue before moving on to further discussion of the review. We must have continuous intelligence information in order to assess the likelihood of a threat to our shores. A general political appraisal is available through our diplomatic sources. However, the review points out the need to. preserve our access to the specific intelligence gathering units of the US intelligence community. These include the joint defence facilities in Australia itself. It also points out the need to continue the development of our own intelligence systems and processes on both the diplomatic and technological fronts. With regard. to the specific intelligence needs required in the force struc,.. ture, we must consider capacity to provide early warning of .immediate threats. This sort of information will ideally be needed only in times of conflict in the region and should not be regarded as vital in peacetime. However, as the review acknowledges, one of the key requirements of defence capabilities is the ability to collect and evaluate intelligence to support ADF operations. The two major elements of our forces that have a capacity for continually gathering intelligence about force movements are the fciur RFlllCsof the RAAF, at Amberley in my electorate, and the RAN submarines. At present, these facilities can provide adequate surveillance of our territory, but some suggestions that might come up in the white paper are worth mentioning. At present, we have a good capability for surveillance of the northern approaches to Australia, utilising the 20 P3C Orion aircraft of the RAAF. Theoretically, these' aircraft are capable of observing some 7.8 million square kilometres each day. I say 'theoretically' because at the present they are not used this way, for several reasons. Firstly, the present system of surveillance is quite adequate in peacetime and the current policy of the Defence Force is to use scarce resources like the Orions for higher priorities such as training in the joint antisubmarine operations of the ADF. Another reason is that the navy carries out a lot of surveillance of the oceans to our north and in the south-west Pacific. In the event of a major escalation of capacity, the navy's resources would theoretically cover about 500,000 square kilometres. An encouraging development over the last few years has been the opening up of our military training facilities to the military personnel of those countries in our region. Some nations, like Fiji, have been represented in our training institutes for many years, but the availability of our air force training facilities, for example, to pilots from Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia is a development very much in the vein of the strategic review. In fact, a contingent of'Singaporean F4 pilots undertook flight training andparticipated in an exercise with RAAF personnel at Amberley in my electorate of Oxley in 1991. It was only in the last couple of weeks that I had· the opportunity to meet some defence personnel from Papua New Guinea, Malaysia and New Zealand who were actually at the college here in Canberra. I will make a few points about Papua New Guinea following on from what the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) had to say earlier. You may recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I had the opportunity last year to lead a parliamentary delegation to some South Pacific islands-Micronesia and the Marshall Islands, Western Samoa and Tonga-and Papua New Guinea wa:sincluded in that trip. When we talk about relations with Papua New Guinea, I agree wholeheartedly with the right honourable member for New England about the relationship that we need to develop and have prosper. One of the recommendations of the report of that delegation, which I tabled in the parliament, concerning Papua New Guinea. was that we extend the opportunities for our parliamentary committees to have exchange visits to Papua New Guinea similar to the relationship we have with New Zealand. I have actually written to the Speaker in that regard. I am encouraged by the response I got from the Speaker. He is to get back to me again but he thinks it is a good idea. He is going to pursue it with the government to see whether the government will support such a proposal. I take this opportiJnity to· suggest that the government should support the proposal, because Papua New Guinea is our very close neighbour and the long and historic relationships. we have had with Papua New Guinea are very important for us in keeping stability in· our region. I met two gentlemen from Papua New Guinea the other week. I had not met them before. I just happened to see them at a particular venue I was at. I went and spoke to them. It was at about the same time that the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea was visiting here. Interestingly enough, they remembered our. delegation going to Papua New Guinea, so we already had that relationship before we started. I can only agree with the riglit honourable member for New. England that it was important that we went up there. I would like to tum to the question of patrol boats. Ori that particular delegation visit, we had the opportunity in a number of places to actually see first-hand the success of the patrol boats that we haJ supplied to various nations. Of course, there is a particular section in the Strategic review 1993 report that refers specifically to the south-west Pacific area, and it talks about our near neighbours in New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and the other Pacific island countries. The Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney) had had the opportunity to visit those countries earlier, to see for himself how successful those boats were. I mentioned the Orion aircraft before, and I understand that the Orion actually does visit some of those parts from. time to time and does a lot of surveillance-'-from an economic, not so much a military, point of view. They are involved in protecting those islands' waters and their very vital fishing industry. That is a real plus for them. We should take every opportunity to develop ihese relationships with our neighbours. In my view, that is what this strategic review is all about: As we continue to develop things like APEC and the ASEAN region, it is only by working closely with our neighbours that we will always have a peaceful area to live in .. Of course, the immediate Pacific region is of importance from that point of view. Another aspect of the report is civilian and military coordination. The honourable member  role of DSTO, and that there should have been more emphasis placed on DSTO in the report. Coverage of industry is somewhat lacking in this report, although one chapter touches on it. Only last week, as I a:m sure the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) will recall from one of the committees we are involved in, we had the opportunity to meet with a representative from ADI, Australian Defence Industries. Its good work is very important for Australia in developing industries in military and civilian areas. This of the success stories of our Australian industries, and there are many others. The honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) earlier mentioned personnel. There is no doubt that the Department of Defence employs a lot of people. In my own electorate of Oxley, a lot of people are employed at the RAAF base in Amberley. We claim that they are the largest employer in our area riow, . even though there ar- a lot of other industries with significant numbers of employees. But some of the traditional industries, such as mining and transport, do not employ the numbers of people they used to in the past. Defence industries and the role of civilians are an area on which there could be greater focus. Through the civilianisation process, more and more civilians are now employed in the defence area. As well, a lot of service personnel who retire at a reasonably early age are returning to work in a civilian capacity in the defence forces. If anything is going to change as a result of the white paper, we should encourage a greater emphasis on industry itself because there is a great potentiill for people to operate in that area. We need to focus not only on our own region. Australia plays a very important role in all parts of the world, particularly through our involvement in the various peacekeeping forces of the United Nations. The honourable member for Chifley mentioned our role in Somalia, and there are other important areas that we need to look at as well. In chapter 2 of the report there is some emphasis on global security, and Australia has a very important part to play in helping to maintain t-at. As a peace loving people, we need to focus more on that. (Extension of time granted) The global aspect of security in the changing world today is extremely important for us and I hope that through the white paper process we wilLsee greater emphasis on that than there is already. With regard to industry, I encourage those people participating in the white paper process to have a good .look at the role of Australian Defence Industries, because I was very impressed with the professionalism of Australian Defence Industries. is one The managing director,. Mr Harris, appeared before our committee and talked to us about the things that it is doing, not only here in Australia but throughout the world, and about the high regard in which it is held. . With regard to the Amberley air force base in my electorate, the surveillance capability of the FIlls is extremely important, as I mentioned earlier, and the defence personnel stationed there also are important. The government has been doing a lot of things to help personnel in the defence forces, including improved housing and a recent change in their salary structures. It is a good opportunity for honourable members of this House to· acknowledge the role that our defence personnel play in all parts of the world. The various committees in this parliament often talk to people from the defence area, and we see the professionalism and the expertise that our defence personnel have built up in the world of high technology. I take this opportunity to support the report and all the personnel who work in. the defence area. Mr SPEAKER....,...Order! It being 3;00 p.m., the debate is interrupted. In accordance with standing order lOlA, the debate may be resumed at a later hour. By courtesy of the honourable member for Gippsland, the honourabl- member for Oxley will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA Female Genital Mutilation",68
32,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. At the instigation of the coalition, last week this House debated the practice of female genital mutilation. This debate received extensive pubiicity and was followed by the New South Wales state government announcing plans to outlaw the practice in that state. Since that debate took place a Melbourne court has placed two young girls under a health department supervision order. They have suffered the most extreme fonn of female genital mutilation. Given the Prime Minister's responsibilities for the status of women, what plans doe- he have to see an end to this practice in Australia? Will he assure this House that his government will take all'necessary'steps to ensure that this barbaric practice is outlawed in Australia?",71
33,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have seen reports over time about these practices, which seem to have some cultural support in certain communities but which I think are regarded as an anathema by the Australian community in the broad. There is no doubt that in the action which might be taken by the states in particular, given their authority in this respect, may certainly be a role for the Commonwealth government. I will ask the Attorney General whether he has had this matter under notice. If he has, I will be happy to indicate whether the Commonwealth is able,'or whether it is appropriate for the Commonwealth, to actually play a role in supporting anything which any of the states might be prepared to do in outlawing these practices. Budget Deficit",72
34,Mr GRIFFIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. I refer to the government's fiscal framework which sets out the government's budgetary strategy for the forthcoming financial year. Is the Treasurer aware of reports that, the deficit reduction target is too modest and that a much greater deficit reduction should be achieved? Can the Treasurer advise the House what the implications of such a deficit outcome would be?",72
35,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Earlier this week the government released the fiscal framework which set out the government's budget strategy. The government is committed to reducing the deficit from the estimated outcome for this year of around 31f2 per cent of GDP to around 1 per cent of GDP by 1996-97. That is our medium-tenn deficit reduction program; We adhere fully to that program and have committed ourselves to taking credible steps towards that goal in the forthcoming budget, as well as taking some substantial initiatives to address our priority areas. I have noted that the shadow Treasurer has called for the budget deficit to be reduced to $9 billion or $10 billion; that is, a little over 2 per cent of GDP. He wants to cut the budget deficit in one year by about $5 3/4 billion, from an outcome this year of around $14 3/4 billion to about $9 billion-a cut of about 11f4 per cent of GDP. , I will quickly take the House through the implications of such a policy. Firstly, obviously, a cut of that order would mean a large cut in demand, and that would certainly ,have an impact on the rate of economic growth unless'it was fully supplemented by some other fonn of increased demand in the economy. But the fact is that the public sector has been, to this stage, providing a substantial there degree of impetus, to economic growth because of the policies pursued by the government to get us back onto a growth path. We accept absolutely the need to withdraw that stimulus as 'the economy recovers, but to do it drastically in very large lumps would run a very great risk of reducing demand by an untoward amount. If 11/4 per cent of GDP were cut out of the economy in one hit, we would certainly do that. As a result of that, we would see the economic recovery faltering rather than solidifying and increasing. That would be a quite counterproductive thing for us to do. We,all want business investment to take off. The argument from the opposition is that this policy would assist business investment because it would help with interest rates. Interest rates at the present time are at their lowest level for 20 years. What is important for business investment is not just interest rates being low and remaining low and having low inflation but also that there is sufficient demand for the products that business produces from increased investment. If there is not the demand, obviously the investment will not come. So the opposition 's policy is right over the top. It would certainly be damaging to economic growth and economic recovery and, with that, damaging to employment growth. We need higher rates of economic growth in order to get higher employment growth. It is also worth considering how the opposition would achieve such a reduction. It has ruled out completely any increases in taxes; therefore, one can only make such savings by cutting government expenditure. The cuts in government expenditure which would be involved would be horrendous. The starting point for the deficit for this forthcoming year is likely to be in the vicinity of $13 billion. To get down to $9 billion would mean cutting government outlays by about $4 billion. It is worth the House taking note of the that that is a bigger cut in outlays than was proposed in Fightback in year one-even in its mark 1 version, which involved $3.9 billion in gross expenditure cuts. The honourable member is talking about net expenditure cuts. But, in terms of gross cuts in Fightback, it was $3.9 billion-just under $4 billion. In Fightback mark 2, that was reduced to $3.2 billion. In net terms, the effect on the deficit was zero, because the opposition incre-sed some other expenditures and had some tax cuts to offset it. So there was no impact on the deficit at all .. The opposition is 'saying that we should be doing vastly more on the deficit than it proposed to do under Fightback mark 1. Presumably, this means that the honourable member for Mayo now thinks that the honourable member for Flinders was a wimp· when he was the shadow Treasurer, because he was pursuing this softy old policy of cutting expenditure by only $3 billion in gross terms and then offsetting it in other ways and not reducing the deficit. He is a real wimp compared with the honourable member for Mayo, who apparently thinks he has to prove himself to be ultra hairy-chested. It is also worth reminding the House very briefly of the sorts of things that were involved in cutting expenditure by these levels. Remember how the opposition was going to cut out the jobsearch allowance after nine months in Fightback mark I? It eventually dumped that. It was ,going to reduce the budgets of the ABC and the SBS by 10 per cent; cut public housing expenditure by $100 miIlion; cut Aboriginal affairs expenditure by $82 miIlion; cut foreign aid by $154 million; cut pensions to sole parents by $30 million; and cut funds to the states by $700 million. I hope the state premiers remember that. The opposition was going to force the unemployed to rundown their liquid assets before providing the jobsearch allowance to save $150 million. In fact, it had a whole swathe of attacks on the unemployed. It was going to reduce their benefits by hundreds of millions of dollars and cut outlays on labour market programs. In the forthcoming budget, we will certainly increase expenditure on fact labour market programs to address the position of the long-term unemployed even more than we have in the past. The opposition wanted in Fightback to cut expenditure on labour market programs. It had a whole program of attacks on the unemployed. That is the sort of thing that it was prepared to do to get cuts in the order of $3.9 billion or $3 billion. We will not be making those sorts of cuts. We will certainly be addressing the need. to have tight expenditures, but we will not be pursuing that kind of course. It shows that the' implications of the opposition's policy are a lower level of economic and employment growth and higher unemployment. It is a great attack on social justice in this economy. Yet the honourable member for Mayo, when asked what his philosophy was, described it in these somewhat unsophisticated terms: We hang out in common ground where sensible people hang out. These are the .sorts of policies that he reckons sensible people support. All I can say is that, if he reckons they are the policies that sen. sible people support,thank God' he is not pursuing. policies that lunatic Right people support. Prime Minister: Piggery",72
36,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again directed to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister will be aware that over the years prime ministers and ministers on both sides of politics have been questioned about possible conflicts between their business affairs and their public duties. In this context, the Prime Minister will recall that in 1978 he made a scathing attack on Phillip Lynch, concerning some of his business transactions. The Prime Minister justified doing so because, in his own words at the time, 'the former Treasurer's personal affairs are in the marketplace of politics'. In view of the fact that the Prime Minister is engaging in a business venture Which, by any.measure, is major and which, in terms of borrowings, is unprecedented by any Prime Minister, will he provide sufficient information on his business affairs to satisfy the Australian people that there is no conflict or appearance of conOict between his private business interests and his public duties as Prime Minister? Mr KEATING""-As I recall it, the former Treasurer-and I do not want to go over that affair-was involved with zoning issues, local government approvals and other things which were matters of investigation. The reason the Leader of the OPPosition seems to be ipterested in this subject is the amount of information which is made available, first, by my disclosure in the House that I have a business interest and, second, by the publication of annual accounts to the Australian Securities Commission. The point is that nothing is hidden. That is why the Leader of the Opposition has commissioned Senator Baume for 20 months now to ask snide questions in the Senate built around information supplied by me. The Leader of the Opposition has to make some point about a conflict of interest between my prime ministerial duties and any investment I have, but he has made no such point. Therefore, I do not owe him any explanation whatsoever about any investment I have made-any more than he owes explanations about business investments he has made. One would be flat out finding anything further removed from the realm of the Commonwealth than a piggery. If the Leader of the Opposition wishes to ask these questions about conflict of interest, does he know, for example, how much the honourable member for Bennelong is paid for his industrial relations consultancy with Clayton Uti?",73
37,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Yes.,74
38,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Does he belh:-ve that his shadow minister responsible for formulating industrial relations policy should be paid for advising a legal firm practising in industrial relations?,74
39,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am shattered by all of this.,74
40,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You ought to be because you have no shame. When I was the shadow minister for minerals and energy for seven years, I had the confidence, the business information and the corporate plans of major companies, such as MIM, BHP and CRA. I could have lined upa consultancy for myself to traffic in that information. The honourable member for Bemlelong does not provide advice as an individual. He goes with all of the advice given to him, often privately and confidentially given his status as a front bench member of the opposition, and he sells it to a major legal firm. This is a straight, open conflict of interest. Yet the Leader of the Opposition has the hide to ask me about a matter where there is no cOI-flict of interest. Did the Leader of the Opposition know, for instance, when he gave the honourable member for Mayo responsibility for Treasury matters, including banking policy, that he owned shares in' Westpac? How many shares in Westpac? Mr Downer-'-How pathetic; you are pathetic.",74
41,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The House will come' to order. The honourable member for Mayo!,74
42,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The shadow Treasurer holds shares in a bank, and obviously that institution will probably come to him at some time and talk to him about its corporate plans and its circumstances. Mr Andrews-Do you have a bank account too?",74
43,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The honourable member for Menzies! ' , Mr KEATING-:-Does he know how many shares he owns in this respect? Does the Leader of the Opposition seeariy conflict of interest between the honourable member's investment in a bank and his role in formulating opposition banking policies? The opposition has ,been asking snide questions under privilege for 20 months about information published by me in relation to a matter which has no conflict of interest with my ministerial duties. Yet on his own front bench the Leader of the Opposition has .people with clear responsibilities being potentially by their holdings or, in the case of honourable member for Bennelong, by actually selling his wares to a legal firm. I think he has obligation to demonstrate, and to satisfy himself of, the probity of those sitting behind him. Mr Reith-Give him an extension of time. We want to hear it all.",74

45,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Flinders! Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,75
46,Mr JENKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Can the Prime Minister inform the House of the reasons the AustralFYROM Ian government recognised the Former slav Republic of Macedonia? Is the Prime Minister aware of tensions which have embols erged within the Australian community as result?,75
47,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government, in its statement on 15 February, recognised the amended Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. country Senator Evans pointed out in his statement on 15 February announcing Australia's recognident tion that all three conditions that I set now been met. He said: ... the use of the word 'Macedonia' being settled ries. in a way that does not cause further tension with Greece . . . while the name issue has not been finally resolved ... the international community (including Greece itself)for United Nations purposesaccepting the temporary use of the name 'Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia'. In recognising states, we have met the objecAustralian tives that we normally lay down: permanent population, defined territqry, government effective control, capacity to enter relations with other countries. Fifty-eight other ries,including the United· States and all Greece's European Union partner-, have also recognised the republic. FYROM's memberrelations ship under that name, as I said,· was comatic sponsored by Greece. That co-sponsoring Greece made widespread international recognition inevitable-a point recognised by the shadow minister for foreign affairs, who on compromised 15 February acknowledged: Australia's decision to recognise FYROM as an iridependent state was consistent with that state's an membership of the United Nations. That was correct. The government also needed to take into account its responsibilities to . the roughly 75,000 Australians from the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, including difficulties caused by their lack of access to appropriate consular facilities. In recognising FYROM we have taken steps to address legitimate concerns expressed both by Greece and by the Greek community in Australia. Our recognition of FYROM, as with our recognition of any state, does not imply any Australian judgment about its policies. Indeed, we have publicly urged to assist negotiations with Greece by Yugoaddressing a number of Greek concerns, amongst them ceasing to use disputed symon its flag, not using the name 'Republic a of Macedonia' and addressing concerns about its constitution. In July 1992, in part because Australia failed to recognise or was not prepared to recognise that state then,it its constitution, spelling out that that 'has no territorial pretensions towards any neighbouring states', together with PresiGligorov's restatement, most recently on had 10 February, of Skopje's acceptance of existing boundaries between the two countOn the step of changing the constitution, not recognising. the state as the Republic of Macedonia and making it clear that we dispute the use of the Star of Vergina in the flag, we have done the things which are consistent with the concerns expressed by the Labor Party about any attempts by the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia into represent itself in some way as part of Greece or Greek interests. It is fully consiscounttent with the principles I laid out. Can I also add that recognition of FYROM is different from establishment of diplomatic which involves setting up of diplomissions. We have yet to begin negotiaby tions with FYROM on the establishment of diplomatic relations. I remind the House that we made our agreement to the opening of a FYROM consulate in Australia conditional on it describing itself appropriately as the consulate of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, not Macedonia, and not .displaying any contentious flag or other"" symbol pending resolution of these and other issues. I am concerned about recent incidents involving community facilities used by Greek Australians and by Australians from the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. I urge both communities to show restraint. In this regard I welcome calls by community leaders for calm. The attitude of most community leaders is contrasted with the dangerous and self-serving posturing of our opponents. Outrageous statements such as Mr Kennett's reference at a Melbourne rally to the' final betrayal of the Greek community' do him no credit and are a provocation to community unrest. His remarks constitute an assault on the traditions of tolerance and community cooperation on which our society is based. Need I make the obvious point that a state premier is not involved in the issue of diplomatic relations? Therefore, he took the running on the issue because, after the statement had been made by the honourable member for Kooyongproperly, in my view-the federal opposition was in no position to make remarks of the kind made by Mr Kennett. I can only say this: Australia's multicultural society depends on all members of the community having tolerance and respect for the positions of others. There is a state involved here. It happens to be a poor state, a poverty ridden state, a small state. Small though it is, it has no rights to expropriate the symbols of Greece or to try to represent itself in some way as the government or republic of Macedonia. We made that very clear. In the course of making it Glear, in the two intervening years it has led to this constitutional change about recognition of other people's territory; it has led to Greece sponsoring this state for entry to the United Nations as the Former Yugoslav Republicof Macedonia; and it has also led to an international view that this state should not represent itself with the Star of Vergina and other things which are peculiarly Greek. I should think that from the point of view of the Greek community, the pressure which Australia, amongst others, has exerted internationally has brought about this change which should suit the attitudes of the people of Greece and also Australians of Greek origin. As with,m6st things like this, one should look at the objective facts notwithstanding the obvious emotionalism of these issues and, on the part of Greek Australians, conclude that progress was made in this issue; that there is a state there; and that the principles of recognition of the state have to be observed and were observed by 58 countries,' including the United States of America. Australia so recognising this state, after Greece sponsored it to the United Nations, is, I think, a defensible recognition by Australia of a state notwithstanding the interests that the government has in the people 'of Greece and in Australians of Greek descent. Prime Minister: Piggery",75
48,Mr COBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. In view of the Prime Minister's assurance that he gave in answer to the last question from this side that"" to use his words, 'there is nothing hidden' and 'there is no conflict of interest', I ask: is the Prime Minister aware that farmers are still being sold up and evicted from their properties by banks because either they cannot meet their repayments or they have run out of equity? An instance of this, Prime Minister, is on the front page of the Parkes Champion Post last Friday under the headline 'Family evicted'. It shows Don and Sharon Wright of Trundle, a little town in my electorate, being' taken away",76
49,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member will now get to his question.,76
50,Mr COBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"from their property by two police officers, two sheriffs officers, a locksmith and a bank representative",76
51,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You, will get to your question or resume your seat.",76
52,Mr COBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"from the Commonwealth Bank. I ask the Prime Minister:, as these evictions of farmers are obviously continuing, can you, as a fanner yourself nowadays, give me some answers to the following genuine questions that fanners in my electorate who are in trouble with their banks constantly raise with me. Firstly, so that these fanners can have a chance of getting a similar deal to you, why did the Commonwealth Bank only recommend making a provision for a loss of $4.5 million against your piggery company's debts instead of foreclosing? Secondly, as you are a joint partner, how does someone on your income and in a position of negative equity successfully manage to sustain loans of at least $24 million?",76
53,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, again this has absolutely nothing to do with my ministerial responsibility-absolutely and completely nothing. I think that by and large the Australian banking system has played a fairly constructive role over the last few years with agricultural properties in seeing that people have not been driven off fanns, that they have been able to see them come back into full production, particularly after bad seasons, extend their indebtedness and become viable units again into the future. The project to which the honourable gentleman refers is about building a major new business for Australia, something that now does not exist. It will take the technology of the world's leading producer of this material and marry it to the natural comparative advantage of Australia. It is unbelievable for the country party, the National Party, to be cavilling at the building of Ii major agricultural enterprise. It is because of that, obviously, that there is the opportunity to exploit the Australian and international markets in' this product. It is not in the position of a farin which is dealing in one commodity, which does not process or add value and it is not in a position to be compared with this project: Other elements of the question I am not aware of, but let me quote the. Land newspaper, rather than the honourable member's local newspaper. It said: The Federal opposition is risking losing further support among its constituents if it keeps up its unconstructive attack on the Prime Minister over his involvement in the Parkville piggery at In recent weeks Mr Keating has been grilIed unrelentingly over aspects of the piggery group's financial structure and the environmental implications. Can I just say. this about the environmental implications: the Leader of the National Party was on radio this week in Brisbane saying what a dreadful thing it was that a piggery with 68,000 pigs and the excrement which it produces would be a problem nine kilometres from the city of Scone when he has in his electorate a piggery of 250,000 pigs four kilometres from Corowa-250,OOO pigs, the largest piggery in Australia, the largest in the southern hemisphere, four times the size of the one that he attacks, which will build up over five years-half the distance from the city of Corowa as this project is from the city of Scone. Yet we have had this supposed leader of rural interests' out there on the highways and byways decrying the fact that a new rural enterprise which Australia does not have, which would give it a position in the white meat industry of Asia, attacking it for its by-products, when in his own electorate he has a business four times as large and half the distance from the city in which it is located. There is a long forgotten saying of the 1970s: Mr H. Bug- Mr Hum Bug. The Leader of the National Party has in his electorate a plggery four times as large. The article goes on to say: Voters have every right to ask what it is that the coalition, supposedly the ideological wonghold of free enterprise, finds so distasteful about a Prime Minister having an interest in a commercial pig meat business. People have argued that a conflict of interest could arise by virtue of the Prime Minister's ability to influence policies affecting its profitability ... but surely similar arguments could have been levelled against former Pthne Minister Malcolm Fraser who was' and remains heavily involved in wool production, and--', need I sayMr Anthony, who had at the time the largest loan from the Commonwealth Bank in establishing his piggery in the 70s. . I think the Land sums it up. If the National Party wants any relevance in this country, it should at least stick to its last about the rural Scone. industry and that industry'S place in the Australian agricultural scene. If the Leader of the National Party with the hypocrisy of his statements believes that >the product of a piggery a quarter the size of the one in his electorate is a problem, what is he doing? What has he said to Bunges in Corowa about its output? What has he done about the smells and odours from theCorowa piggery, which is half the distance from Corowa that the Scone piggery is from Scone? I think he has to answer those questions. International Women's Day",77
54,Mrs SILVIA SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Attorney-General. The Attorney-General would be aware that International Women's Dayis on 8 March. What initiatives are being taken which will significantly benefit women?,78
55,Mr LAVARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"A number of initiatives which were started last year and which will shortly come to fruition will be of particular interest to Australian' women. Honourable members may recall that eariy last year the Australian Law Reform Commission was given a reference regarding women and equity before the law. Later today the first interim report of the Law Reform Commission will be tabled in this parliament. This report canvasPrime ses the position of women> a:nd the Australian legal system. Its major recommendation is the establishment of a national women's justice program. This program 'envisages a review of the operations of aspects of the legal system such as the legal aid system, way in which community legal centres operIs ate, as well as practical> matters such as barriers> women face in accessing courts. These barriers include the lack of 'adequate child-care facilities in Australian courts inappropriate waiting rooms to make sure that the victims of violence and the perpetrators are separatedHonourable members would also be aware that the Australian Institute of Judicial ministration received a grant from the governaway ment to commence the development of grams on gender awareness for the judiciary and other members of Australian courts. I can report to the honourable member and to the House that these programs are progressing Senate. well. We have had very strong support from all Australian jurisdictions and all Australian courts for this program, as we had with the cultural awareness programs following the setting up of such a program as a result of one of the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Black Deaths in Custody. Indeed, this morning I held discussions with the chief justice of the Family Court about the program which that court is operating. Finally, later this year we will see further amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act dealing with that second raft of changes proposed in the Halfway to equal report. This will deal with the operation of indirect discrimination provisions, the strengthening of the special measures provisions in the act, as well as the vexed question of discrimination on the basis of one's spouse. This range of initiatives will tackle problems within the Australian legal system which impact mostly on Australian women, and I think augur well for this government's commitment towards our legal system. They will make sure, that Australian women are treated equally and fairly in the operation of the system. Senate Voting System",78
56,Mr MACK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister. I refer to the comments of the Prime Minister and Senator Gareth Evans for concerning the government's desire to alter the proportional voting system in the Senate. Is this an attempt to achieve executive dominance by electoral manipulation which cannot the be achieved by a majority at the ballot box? he aware that> his apparent desire to crush the minority views is seen as undemocratic and a rejection of the diversity of the Australian community? As it was the >' Chifley Labor and government which introduced the fair proportional voting system, is this the final extinguishment of the light on the hill?",78
57,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As the Minister for Communications and the Arts reminds me, AdItaly, amongst, other countries, is moving froin proportional representation. I prowould not have thought that the simple presence of a voting system would mean that we have some sort of holy grail about representation. Let us not mix words about the It is no longer a states house. It is not a states house; it is a party house. It has an , equal number of senators for the principal reason of protecting small states against the large states in the early days of Federation when the revenue of the then states or colonies was to be directed maybe to the larger states at their detriment. That check and balance was put in. That condition has long passed. We now have national budgets. There is no notion of that kind of representation in the House of Representatives voting appropriations to the large states. It is simply a party house. Worse you. than that, it is now a party house which throws up members who cannot· get themselves more than two, three or four per cent of the vote. I would not have thought, if you put yourself up as an Democrat, you would have found something alien about the concept of getting 50 per cent plus one somewhere, even if it was through preferences. The notion is that somebody can try to usurp executive authority with three 6r four per cent of the vote. Remember that governments are formed in the representative chamber, the House of Representatives. Has the· Liberal Party taken leave· of its senses on this matter in not understanding where the weight and fulcrum of our democracy are? It is in the representative chamber. That is where there are roughly equal numbers of electors across the country and we have an election where every person's vote is equal. But in the Senate a person's vote in .a small state is not the equal of a person's vote in a big state. It is unrepresentative and, because it operates as a party house and now a spoiling chamber, it is in fact usurping the responsibilities of the executive drawn from the representative chamber, the House of Representatives.",78
58,Mr SINCLAIR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Ask the honourable member .for Kalgoorlie. He will tell you what he thinks of this rubbish..,79
59,Mr S,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,EAKER-Order! The right honourable member for New England!,79
60,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This notion that senators of minority parties, parading themselves as agents of virtue in seeking to have accountability or; beyond that, simply holding any government to ransom over budget measures is in some way 'good' for our democracy, fails to understand three simple points: first, in this country the electors get a chance to change the government every three years at least; secondly, the chamber is elected representatively; and, thirdly, the government is drawn from the representative chamber and is subject to party public opinion and the ballot box three years hence. The Senate was to be a states house: for most of its time, a house of review. Mr Reith-To keep a check on people like",79
61,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Flinders has been repeatedly asked to cease interjecting.,79
62,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,",-But before the last election the Liberals· were making' all sorts of noises about being decent, about the government, about its policies. Knowing that they lost the 1993 election and believing that they will lose the following one-that is, faCing five years of opposition from here-it is now a totally oppositionist mentality: 'Rip up the rule book; let us invest minor parties with a chance of dealing good and responsible government a blow\ therefore believing in some way that they are advancing their political cause. I would only say to the front-bench of the Liberal Party, 'You have got to think beyond your nose and the next election'. If you have not got that much sense now, it should not frankly fall· to me and government ministers and members to make the point that the essential, robust element of out democracy is the representative nature of the Australian ballot. The Senate is nota representative ballot; it is a proportional ballot. Because of the nexus \yhich has expanded the Senate, we n9w have·exceptionally low quotas which usher in people who could not possibly secure a majority ill the wide open spaces of the electorate. The member for North Sydney put his name up in the House of Representatives and won a seat in parliament-and good on him {or it. At least he ran in· the representative chamber and tried his luck in the big league. But hiding behind the proportional representation system, picking up three or four per cent of the vote, or two per cent of the vote, and hoping to pick up part of someone else's quota and then parading as a paragon of democratic virtue is the sort of nonsense which, frankly, the rest of us should not have to stomach. Australian Tourist Commission",79
63,Mr DODD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Tourism. I refer him to recent reports suggesting that the government might - scrap , the Australian Tourist Commission. Can he advise whether there are any plans to change the status of Australia's international tourism marketing body? Further, is he aware of any other mar)<eting proposals aimed. at increasing international tourism to Australia?",80
64,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Leichhardt for his continuing interest in promoting Australia as a tourist destination. Tuesday's Courier-Mail.did in fact have a report along the lines suggested by the honourable member. In fact, the shadow minister for tourism and aviation, the honourable member for Fadden, also put out a press release which stated: Tourism Minister Michael Lee must' reassure the tourism industry that the government has no plans to scrap the Australian Tourist Commission. I can certainly assure the House and the shadow minister that the government does have no plans to scrap the ATC. He goes on to say: This must extend to a commitment to maintain funding for the Commission. This Labor government has not only maintained funding; it has dramatically increased it. In fact, funding for the Australian Tourist Commission this year is eight-fold what it was when the Liberal-National Party coalition was last in government. That is a 700 per cent increase; eight-fold what it was in 1982-83. We have certainly more than maintained it; it has been dramatically increased. It is as a result of that that we have had in 1993 about a 15 per cent increase in the number of international visitors to Australia. Foreign exchange earnings will be more than $8 112 billion thanks to international visitors coming to Australia, to places such as Cairns in the honourable member's electorate. It is because of that that we believe that not only will the ATC continue to exist,but will it continue to improve the job it does. I was very interested to note that, during the attacks which the opposition made on the honourable member for Canberra about funding for sport, it made the point that it thought ministers should not have any discretion whatsoever in allocating funds, that ministers should simply rubber-stamp .the views of their departments. So imagine my surprise when I received the followjng memo from the shadow minister for tourism. It states: Dear Minister, Earlier this year I attended the inaugural ErmenegiJdo Zegna Regatta at Port Douglas. The promoter of this event isan individual I will not Dlimeat the Port Douglas Yacht Squadron. Plans are under way for 'another event in 1994; Because of the international publicity generated it would appear that next year's event will be a massive one. Of importance is the fact that it does attract the high-rollers of the international community. The shadow minister goes on to make representations for: Seed funding. of up to $200,000 for the event, either as a straight out payment or in an underwriting c\lpacity. I just point out that Port Douglas is in a marginal Labor seat-well represented. So we have the position where the Liberals have argued, all through the debate about sports funding, that the honourable member for Canberra should not have provided money to schools for new ovals and that she should not have provided money for bowling greens for retirees. But the shadow minister for tourism says that we should be providing $200,000 for yachting regattas. That is the Liberal position. Like a true blue Liberal, he says that yachting regattas are more irriportant than school ovals and bowling greens. Prime Minister: Piggery",80
65,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I preface it by reminding him that, when he attacked former Treasurer Lynch in September 1978, his attack was based on not matters relating to the zoning of land but the claim that no financial institution would finance a unit development on a 2.5 per cent equity basis. I ask the Prime Minister: will he explain how the Commonwealth Bank continues to finance his halfownedpiggery company, which has no equity whatsoever, with the holding company having assets of $18 million and liabilities of $24 million? How and by whom are his piggery companies being kept afloat?",80
66,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Prime Minister might just wait for a moment. I have listened with great interest this afternoon to' the questions that have been asked because there were some asked earlier in the week relevant to this. But, again, I point out to honourable members standing order 142 where it states: Questions may Pe put to a Minister relating to public affairs with which he or sheis officially connected ... I have allowed the questions this afternoon because I believe that there has been a degree of that standing order contained within them. But, again, I just simply point out to honourable members that, in framing their questions, they must always keep that in mind. For further explanation, I point honourable members to pages 516 and 517 of House of Representatives Practice. Of course, if people want to take issues further by way of substantive motions, that is something always open to the House. MrKEATING-Notwithstanding your point, Mr Speaker, let me just make this clear to the honourable gentleman: he knows, but he would not have the decency to say it, that this was a business that the Commonwealth Bank gave loans to-very large loans-years before I took an interest in it. In the everit that those properties had gone on the market in the recession, the bank would have got very little for them and would have suffered massive losses. To have had the prospect of that business joining a major international partner, the world leader, in a new business must have been music to the ears of the Commonwealth Bank. The honourable gentleman makes clear or implies in the question that, because the Commonwealth Bank is in some way tied up with the government, there is some benefit for me there. As Treasurer, I was the steward of the Commonwealth Bank for nine years. I too had a state bank: the Commonwealth Bank. It finished the 1980s in superlative condition, with a high stock market price, with the State Bank of Victoria as a new institution. My relationship with the Commonwealth Bank is no business of yours any more than your relationship with the Commonwealth Bankor those of any of - the rest of you who bank with the Commonwealth Bank-is any business of mine. The honourable member for Bennelong was out in the media this week talking about conflict of interest. It takes someone as brazen as the honourable member for Bennelong to sit there taking money from a consultancy, selling the knowledge of his party and that which is advanced to him because the Liberal Party knows that he is its favourite son and that he is facing another three years in opposition. He is being looked after by the Sydney Liberal Party establishment. He has been put on the staff and is being looked after.",81

I would never lower the flag to' have anyone look after me as the Liberal Party establishment is looking after you, and has looked after most of you, as I well know. You must think we live under a rock and that we do not hear all the scuttlebutt about each of you that you hear. Do you think we get around Sydney and Melbourne with our ears shut?

73,Ms CRAWFORD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Consumer Affairs. Has the minister's attention been draWn to a statement by the Australian Consumers' Associatiort headed 'New Banking Code-good for banks, bad for consumers'? Is this assertion correct? Is it still intended that the Australian Payments System Council will monitor the operation of the code, as the government announced last year? If so, can the minister advise whether or not the Australian Payments System Council can protect consumers' interests adequately, especially in the light of the criticism of the council monitoring system published in the latest edition of the Australian Consumers Association's own journal, Consuming Interest?",82
74,Ms MCHUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Forde for that question. I did see the article. It had quite a cute headline, but course it was totally wrong. The Australian banking code of practice is an extremely important· first step for consumers. It will provide consumers with better privacy and more. information; it will ensure an efficient and fair disp:ute resolution mechanism; and it will ensure that documentation is in plain language. Best of all, the banks have agreed to be bound by the code. That means that when it is in operation it will be enforceable. Our task in government is to make sure that the code works. The key to this is the monitoring of the code. The government has publicly stated that it is committed to the Australian Payments System Council, the APSC, doing the monitoring: It will get information from the banks; The banks will provide information to the Reserve Bank. The APSC, if it considers it' appropriate, can also get information from the wider community. The APSC is administered by the Reserve Bank and has representatives from the banks and from consumers. It has continuous oversight of the code, and it will provide a full report to the Treasurer within three years. The APSC has set up a subcommittee which is now working on details of how this' will operate. That subcommittee comprises two consumerreprese'ntatives, two bank representatives and the chair of the APSe It is preparing a full questionnaire for· the banks, which will ask for very detailed information on eachipdividual aspect of the ·code-for example, privacy,. disclosure of information, and guarantees. The subcommittee has nearly finished. its work and will report to the full APSC later this month. I say again that the negative, cynical attitude displayed in that article gets us absolutely nowhere .. The monitoring is the key to all of this. We take it very seriously. The press release that was put out by the then Treasurer and me at the time made absolutely clear how important the monitoring was. That monitoring will pick up any problems. The gov-rn­ ment will then see whether anything more has to be done. Prime Minister: Piggery",82
75,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directof ed to the Prime Minister.

National Crime Authority Mr CHYNOWETH""-My question is addressed to the Minister for Justice. Is he aware of comments today by the Premier of VictoriaMr Leo MCLeay-Who is that? . Mr CIIYNOWETH- Mr Kennett! Is the minister aware of Mr Kennett's comments attacking the record of .the National Crime Authority, claiming' if is a very experisive operation that has hot been particularly successful? Does the minister share Mr Kennett's views? Mr KERR....:.I thank the honourable member for ,his question. Honourable' members will. of .course be aware. that a major investigation of yesterday's cowardly murder is under way. I certainly d() not want to, canvass anything that will traverse that investigation; the investigation task force has to be allowed to get on witli its irnportant job. ' , I can inform the House that earlier today the Prime Minister announced that the federal government will contribute a quarter of. a million dollars, .towards a reward of half a million dollars J)-irig offered' by the South Australian govenjrnent for info[IllCition'leading to the charging of a person or persons with this murder:ReIudantas I am to go to the operational matters, I cannot let Mr Kennett's attack on the record of the authority go unanswered. TheN-tional Crime Autho-ity's curr-nt investigations cover the spectrum of organised crime, . including drug trafficking, fraud, murder, extortion, illegal gambling, money laundering and bribery and corrUption. In 1993-94, to date,courts have made orders, including forfeiture and pecuniary penalties, worth $152 million. One of those orders was'made against Mr Ian Saxon for $69.2 million and is the largest' pecuniary penalty ever issued. More than $12 million has been recouped' this year to ,date and been paid into the confiscated assets, trust fund.' , So far this year, 64. people have been charged with 193 offences, in the course of national task force investigations., That compares with 41 people charged with 206 offences over the last financial year, and demonstratesthe increasing effectiveness of the National Crime Authority's cooperative national investigations. In addition, 34 people have been charged ·directly by the NCA with 125 offences. The National Crime Authority's intelligence assessments are making valuable contributions to all law enforcement agencies' knowledge of' organisations involved in organised criminal activity. , This work being' done-I think under the very strong leadership of the current Chairman' of the NCA, Tom Sherman-is a record that I am proud of and I believe that all Australians should be proud of. I believe it does enormous credit to the dedicated staff of the NCA, whose position and circumstances in the face of obvious danger have been illustrated over the last couple of days. Their work should receive nothing but praise frorn this House. Budget Deficit",83
79,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Minister for Finance. I ask the minister: in light of the fact that growth this financial year has been stronger than was expected and that the government has reduced its budget deficit this year from around $16.1 billion to $14.75 billion at this stage, is the minister aware that the starting point for the deficit in 1994-95 will therefore be substantially lower than was projected at the time oflast year's budget?If the minister is aware of. that, what in fact is the starting point on a no-policy change basis for the deficit in 1994-95?",83
80,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,".:.It is about $600 million higher than it would have been if you had taken responsible attitudes towards the deficit during the consideration of these matters last year. Do not think that that was simply a product of blocking off tax increases, though obviously tax is one way in which deficits are traditionally addressed; it also cut offa series of options for cutting outlays that was put up by the government at the time. Indeed, at the same time as you were making statements about the need to get $4 billion off the deficit, the honourable member for Menzies in this place was unctuously criticising some of the minor cuts that were put in place. He ""also lectured us on social justice issues in the same way that he lectured us on social justice issues last. year. I really wonder how you intend to get $4 billion out when you cannot take the first little step. Anyone who objectively considers these things ought to wonder.

Therefore, we do not speculate on it. Mr Downer-What is the amount of money?",84

85,Mr BEVIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Can the Minister for Resources advise the House of rec-nt developmentsin petroleum exploration activity in the Timor Sea? What is the importance to Australia of these developments?,84
86,Mr BEDDALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Brisbane very much for his question. As honourable members would be aware, in 1989, we negotiated a very - uccessful treaty with Indonesia over the Timor Gap, Until then, there had been a degree of boundary dispute between Australia and Indonesia, which meant that exploration in the Timor Gap area had not taken ' place. It was a watershed because without the agreement between the two countries that area could not be explored. I am therefore, pleased to note a promising oil discovery which occurred this, month in theElang-l well in the Timor Gap area., This is the first such oil discpv-ryii1 that area.and it is extremely encouraging. However, I do stress that this discovery does 'not prove up any major' oil field. So far, only five wells t have been drilled in the Timor Gap. But to strike oil so soon is extremely encouraging. Another 23 wells wiil be drilled in the Timor Gap between now and the end of the year, with the possibility of 25 'more. This level of commitment to,exploration is important'to Australia as Bass Strait comes off 'its peak.

103,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for 'Bennelong (Mr Howard) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The threat posed to states such as. Western Australia by the Prime Minister's plan to radically alter the Senate voting system. , I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",86
104,Mr HOWARD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I would like to start this discussion of matter. of public importance by sharing with the House some of the tactical thoughts of the opposition during question time today. I have to say to you, Mr Speaker"" as you leave, that we felt a tinge of disappointment when you gave the call to the honourable, member for North Sydney (Mr Mack) rather than to me. I do not contest your decision""-I am always duly respectful-but we felt a tinge of disappointment because, as the House was later to learn, I was rather keen to ask the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) a question. But that disappointment we felt in your giving the call to the honourable member for North Sydney rapidly dissolved as the Prime Minister indulged himself in one of his favourite pastimes; that is, unloading on the Senate and unloading on the rights of the less populous states to be equally represented in the Senate via the existing voting arrangements. We wanted the Prime Minister to go on and on. I said to my colleag].le the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Dr Wooldridge) as the Prime Minister went on, 'I hope all the radio sets in Fremantle are turned on as they listen to question time this afternoon'. If ever there was a prime ministerial plan which was a lethal dagger aimed at the heart of these less populous states'. representation in the Senate it would be··his plan to radically a,lter the voting system for the Senate. I could not believe my ears. We collectively in the opposition could not believe .our good fortune today when the Prime. Minister unloaded himself once again. He really does hate the Senate; He, really does regard the Senate as unrepre-entative swiJl. The thing he hates most about,the federal Senate came out today: he hates the iactthat there are the same number of Western Australians in the Senate ,as there are people from New South Wl,lles. He really hates th,at. I say to those people who are going to be casting their votes in the Fremantle by'election that the·Prime Minister has really put federalism at the top of the agenda as far as that by-election is concerried. I wonder what the attit].lde of the. Labor candidate, the former premier of Western Australia, is to the Prime Minister's plan to slash Western Australia's representation in federal parliament, because that is what he wants to do. The. Prime Minister wants to reduce the number of Western Australians in. federal parliament. He said on Brispaneradio yester<Jay; 'Isn't it outrageous that 400,()()() Tasmanian- have the Satne number ofSenatorsas the people from New South Wales?''- Does the Prime Minister not know enough about the history of Australia to understand that, had it not been for the equal representation in' the Senate of all the states at the time of Federation, there would 'never have been a Federation? Does he not know that a crucial element of the federal compact was the notion of single member electorates for the House of Representatives and an equality of representation in the Senate? Anybody who knows the first' thing about Australian hi,story would know that,but that does not .include the Prime Minister. The only contact the Prime Minister has with Australian history is when he rewrites it. . .The Prime Minister described Adam Smith as a 19th century robber baron when in fact he was an 18th century 'Scottish moral philosopher, he described the Malayan peri insula of 1941 as Malaysia and ,he did not know when Captain Cook first came to Australia; so I suppose we could not expect him to know anything about the constitutional history Australia.. But a lot of people in Western Australia .know a lot, about Western Australia's role in the Federation. A lot people know perfectly well that, if the equalithe ty of representation from all. of the states undermined-in other words, the states have an equal number of senators in the federal Senate, not more for the big states and fewer for the smaller states-that is fundamentally altering the original federal compact. It betraying the basis on which states such Western Australia enter the Federation. as simple as that. There is no way on earth that this Prime Minister can escape the odium of that arguHawke's ment. What he said about Tasmania on federal-state Brisbane radio yesterday was compounded the remarks he made today. It was the most 'scornful, arrogant, contemptuous attack on equal treatment of the states in the Senate, which is the essence of the federal compact, that I have ever heard from an Australian Prime Minister. I have .no argument at all with the Prime Minister's view that we should have a strident national spirit. We on this side are as good nationalists as those. on the opposite side of the House. The great difference between us is that we are not centralists. There isa difference between nationalism and centralism. Nationalism looks to the overall interests of the nation; centralism is the automatic assumption that a decision made in Canberra is always. better than a decision made in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, Adelaide or Brisbane. That man who, regrettably, sits at the dispatch box in question time on two out. of four occasions is a dyed-in-the-wool centralist. He could not restrain himself today. It all just came pouring out. We know-hat a strident centralist he has been over the last 12 months. We all remember how much the Prime Minister cared for the interests of Western Australia when the Mabo legislation was being put together. We also know how much he cared for the interests of Tasmania when, as a member of the Hawke government,. he overrode the legitimate interests of that state on numerous occasions. Most of all, we.· know of how he deliberately set out, when campaigning for the leadership of the Labor Party, to torpedo the one authentic attempt that has of been made over the last 10 years to improve quality of federal-state relations. That was is the attempt made by Bob Hawke-nobly supported by the then Liberal Premier of New South Wales, Nick Greiner, who as a true Australian nationalist was prepared to put the interests of Australia ahead of any narrow is provincial interest and who was prepared to as support the federalism· push of the Prime It is Minister of Australia at that time. But who set out to destroy it? Who wandered around in the caucus room and nobbled attempt to bring a bit of sanity to relations? It was none other than by the honourable member for Blaxland, the now Prime Minister of Australia. He did not care the about the national interests. He was not interested in decent federalism. What did the honourable member for Swan, the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), do to defend Mr Hawke? He did absolutely nothing. The present Prime Ministerjust pushed the former Prime Minister aside and he torpedoed that of the House One decent attempt. After the Prime Minister has wrecked any hope of a decent restoration of federalism, he now has the unbelievable gall to try to pose as some kind of born-again believer in federalism. He went running off to the COAG meeting .in Tasmania last week saying, 'I believe in competition, provided I do not have to be in the race and provided the trade union movement does not have to be in the race'. The Prime Minister says, 'Lawyers, accountants, state electricity authorities and state water authorities have to compete but, gee, you can't ask the ACTU to compete, that is unfair; you've got to draw the line somewhere. Asking unions to compete? Break it down; you can't do that'. What did the Prime Minister do with the help of his mate, the. Minister for Industrial Relations, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton)? He put a bill through this parliament, including the federal Senate, that reduces the exposure of the trade union movement in Australia to competition. So lawyers, accountants and electricity authorities go in one direction and trade unionists go in the other. The Prime Minister believes that that is fair. That is a nice, decent place live in-Keating style. It is a pretty odd set of priorities and it stamps him as a politician of rank hypocrisy. None of that could possibly equal what has come out of the·mouth of the Prime Minister over the last couple of days on the question of Senate representation. Do honourable members know what these characters want to do with the Senate? They want to destroy the notion of a senator representing an entire state. For 93 years, even though we had a voting change in 1949, when we went from simple preferential to proportional representation, we have always had the notion that a senator represents the whole state. What they have· in mind now is not only to reduce the number of· senators from Western Australia and Tasmania-everybody mark my words: the Prime Minister's plan says fewer senators from Western Australia-but also to have senators in future elected not on the basis of representing a state but on the basis of representing a region or an area of the country. The honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) nods his head in assent. That is what they really want. Two things have come out of this little exercise by the Prime Minister. If those opposite have their way, there will no longer be senators from New South Wales, Victoria or Western Australia. There will be senators from the Riverina, western Sydney, the North Shore, the great south-west and North Queensland. They really want to alter the fundamental nature of the federal compact, yet they try to pretend that they have a minimalist republic in mind. Every time we scratch the surface, the maximalist Prime Minister comes oozing out. He cannot help himself. Old motormouth runs away at the mouth. He thinks he is clever. He looks around to the boys and girls behind him and theycheerhim on. He does not realise that he is just running off at the mouth. He did it in true grand style today. We could not believe our luck that he was going to dump as much as he did. In the process, he underlined yet again what a radical centralist he really is. Regardless of how he dresses himself up, he is about radical constitutional to change. He goes quiet fora couple of months. Those opposite got onto him and said, 'Look, Paul, every time you speak in favour of the republic, the support for it goes down in the polls; so please keep quiet' . They shut him up for a while,· but he breaks out again. He reveals that he is very much about radical change. There are a lot of people in Australia who believe that in a country as .big as Australia we need to have a nationalistic approach and the true national interest must always take priority over provincial interests. I will never argue anything else because lam an unapologetic Australian nationalist. The truth of the matter is that the national interest is not always synonymous with Canberra. It is not always synonymous with the decisions of a central government. The national interest often is to disperse and divide power. That is what our constitution was built on. We would never have had an Australian federation if we had not had equality of representation in the Senate. It is as simple as that. . Yet the Prime Minister has a dagger aimed at that. I hope every voter in Fremantle and every person in Western Australia who cares about a dispersal of power understands what the current· Prime Minister is all about. He is about busting that original essence of the federal compact. He is about abolishing the Senate if he could get away with it. He is about having a much reduced federal structure in this country. He is about reducing the number of senators from the less popular states in the federal Senate and he is still very much about centralising power in Canberra. When the political commentators have talked about the Labor Prime Ministers over the last 20 years they got it right when they have compared Paul Keating not with Bob Hawke but with Gough Whitlam. I notice once again the honourable member for Werriwa (MrLatham), who is becoming my resident tutor on Labor Party folklore on these things-and I am very grateful for that-is nodding again. On these things the Prime Minister is very much like Whitlam. Whitlam wanted to destroy to states. Whitlam wanted to have 25 regions. Whitlam wanted to have a strong central government and to alter the federal compact and this bloke is exactly the same. Mark my words, the Prime Minister is about destroying the power of the·federal Senate. He is about tearing. up the original federal compact and there is no part of Austndia that has more to lose from that than the people 'Of Western Australia.",86
105,Mr BEAZLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Let me set the mind of the Manager of Opposition Business in the House (Mr Howard) at rest immediately. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is not talking. about changing the balance of representation between the states. That is not something is in his gift, it would require a referenlikely dum. The Prime Minister is talking about the system of election, with equally based reprehave sentation between the states. The issue he has referred to is whether or not the 12 senators from New South Wales and the 12 senators from Western Australia should continue to elected by proportional representation or whether they should be elected by a preferenactually tial syst-m such as in the House of Representatives.· The Prime Minister is not talking about altering the baiance between the states in Senate representation, and nor can he. The claim that he has put in place, that somehow or other Western Australia's power would be affected, is a piece of nonsense. If we are going to have a discussion whether' or not. proportional representation within that framework or first-past-the-post voting would necessarily diminish the power of the small states-if honourable members want to look at it in that context-we would have to go to a reasonable analysis of what the performance has been electorally in the small states over the last 20 years or at within the living memory of people in this chamber. Whatever else those opposite might say about it, and whatever agreements or disagreements they might have with the process of elections, the one thing they could not say is that the smaller states' influence would be diminished; in all likelihood it would be increased. The small states with the more simple socio-economic divisions than the large ones have tended to manifest much more emphatic election results than has been the casein either Victoria or New South Wales. In Western Australia at different times the Labor Party has been virtually wiped out and at other times the Liberal Party has come quite close to it. In Queensland the Labor Party was frequently quite effeCtively wiped but more recently has done a great deal better than that. The major states have not had the same split as the smaller states where the balance of representation has tended to be much more equal. Oddly enough, if we take New South Wales and Western Australia, the that last result in New Sciuth Wales would be to have produced, in its 12 senators, a seven to five split on single member constituencies; in Western Australia it probably would produced a nine to three or a 10 to two split in the Liberals' favour. If we look at the result in those terms and we add the New South Wales and Western Australian results be together we would find that there would be a majority of Labor Party votes, but they were outweighed in' the Senate voting outcome by dividing the chamber up in that way. That would be the potential consequence. We could make many arguments around the proposition that we ought to have direct election for senators to make them responsible to constituents and not have a PR system about associated with it, but one argument we cannot make about it is whether or not it impacts on' the smaller states. That is an outcome which is completely irrelevant to it. At the time of federation the states focused not so much, on the equality between the states in the Senate, though that was important to them, but on· the nexus between the least Senate and the .House of Representatives. There has been one effort to change thl.).t nexus by a constitutional referendum-a change in the constitution instigated by the Liberal Party, but which the Labor Party supported at the time. It was argued against .it at the time correctly-though I do not think correctly in terms of an outcome desired-that the nexus had been important in the original federation compact - to the small states in agreeing to enter into that compact. The Liberal Party at the time tried to change that nexus. On that particular occasion the Liberal Party, in advocating that course of action, found no difficulty with what it now describes as centralist principles.. The harum-scarum, fearsome. consequence that the Manager of Opposition Business was going into on this, I simply <;:annot comprehend. I can see an argument around whether or not we ought to have direct elections and PR, but an argument that, somehow or other, what the Prime Minister proposes diminishes in any way the authority <>f .the Senate as a states' house, the impact of the states, I think is just absolute and complete nonsense. I cannot fathom where he gets his argument from. I would be delighted, however, for members of the opposition to pay a .·little more serious attention to the issues of democracy which they believe they. uphold. There is only one corrupt electoral system left in the entirety of this country: the electoral system in Western Australia, which is the subject of this motion. That electoral system is fiendishly corrupt. It is so fiendishly corrupt that it was a matter of scandal before· the Western Australian royal commission. It stated: This electoral reviewthat is, changing the boundaries to remove the malapportionmentis central and of vital importance to the recommendations of the Commission. Through our committee proposals, through the inquisitorial powers we consider the Parliament should· have, but, most importantly, through the independent parliamentary agencies, the Commission's recommendations, if implemented, would arm the Parliament, particularly the Council, with inquiry and scrutinyTheir capacity to serve that role will depend substantially on a Parliament so structured and motivated as to be able to share their objectives and full)' support them in their respective tasks. Well might the Western Australian royal to be commission have drawn attention. to the bit corruption supported by the Liberal Party in Western Australia of those electoralbQundaries. Virtually all the royal commission's recommendations .brought down for the processes of government to prevent corruption have been rejected by the Court administration in Western Australia. So that honourable members know where the opposition comes from, this is what they produce. In the various legislative council regions this is the result: in the north metropolitan region, enrolment per member is 41,000 and it is about the same in the south metropolitan region and the east metropolitan region; in the south-west region, outside the metropolitan area, it· is one for 15,000; it is one for 16,000 in the agricultural region;and it is one for 12,000 in the mining and pastoral region. Those opposite might say, 'Oh well, that· is the Legisl-tive Council, it is not the House in which the.government is formed'. So perhaps we, should tolerate corruption in the Legislative Council! Then· we move over to the Legislative Assembly, where the government is formed. We find this: in the metropolitan area, the quotient per member is 22,000. There is a 15 per cent plus or minus deviation. The lowest quotient is 20,000 and the highest is 28,000. The average quotient in the rural districts in the remainder of the state is 12,000, with the iowest at 8,000 and highest at 16,000. So in Western Australia the corruption removes from the Legislative Council and is manifest in the structure of the Legislative Assembly. What have Liberals said about it at different times? Let me deal with comments made by a former Liberal Speaker in Western Australia who was.· so disgusted with the tasks that he was obliged to perfonn·from time to time that he had this to say: . and One of the most un-sual occurrencesformidable powers of 'for himwas just after the 1974 election when a LiberalCountryPaityGovemmenthad been elected. 1 was invited to join a couple,Of other people kneeling on the floor of the Liberal Party meeting room ,to make a suggestion on where. the electoral boundaries should be, because there needed to be a redistribution. I did not quite understand why there needed a redistribution until a little later 'on. I was a naive in those days. It was needed because a ·couple of liberal seats were in jeopardy. That was ,when the electoral boundaries were changed so that the seats of Kalamunda and Darling Range stayed in the country, but seats like Rockingham were directed into the metropolitan region. At _the same time the northern boundary of the metropolitan area went out a little to encompass the northern suburbs because it was felt that if those suburbs remained in a country electorate another couple of Labor Party members would come into this place. There has been some jiggery-pokery with the electoral boundaries. He went on: I have not just arrived at this position. I suffered the embarrassment of having to sit in this _Parliament behind a conservative Government knowing that what it was doing was absolutely crooked ... I repeat, absolutely crooked. He continued: It suits the conservative forces to have the Electoral .Act the way it is because they get a greater number of seats in this place and, on occasion control both Hquses. . In fact, they have always controlled the Legislative Council. Is it any surprise that, when we hear the unction of the Manager of Opposition Business, we dismiss it out of hand? He defends the last corrupt parliament in Australia, the last corrupt parliament in this country. It is not just a Labor Party epithet .that this situatioJl is utterly corrupt; it is a finding of the royal commission that this situation is utterly corrupt. When the Manager of Opposition Business says that we must not do anything with any set of constitutional arrangements that upsets people in Western Australia, he says it on this basis: the people in Western Australia are unfree when it comes to these democratic practices. What he says he wishes to do is to channel power to a parliamentary situation which is unrepresentative, the only unrepresentative parliamentary situation-in the entirety of the country. In this particular instance, as I explained at the outset of my speech, he has no grounds for complaint. A small party might have a few words to say on that matter because in that sort of situation the small party; as we know it, might well disappear from this chamber. But in. terms of the balances between the states, nothing is disturbed. If anybody wanted to disturb them, it could not be done by prime ministerial fiat; it would have to be done by a referendum in which everybody would have a chance to vote. It would also require a majority of the states for it to be carried. But I am glad that he raised it in that way because the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) also came out and said a few words about disunion. It is terribly important to say a few words about disunion. I say at the outset that secession is treason. What disturbs me more and more about the sort of commentary that we get, given that nobody else is raising the issue-Liberal party members in Western Australia always say, 'We are not for secession, we are fora better federal system' - is that it is only the Liberal Party which is raising secession. It set up the straw man; it opposes the straw man. That is the proposition that it puts forward. In so far as there is any secessionist agitation, treasonable agitation at all in Western Australia, it is a product entirely of Liberal Party officials and some Liberal Party members. It ought to be named for what it is, dealt with for what it is and we should have no truck with it. If ever there was an indication that the federal arrangements continue to be supportive of Western Australian interests, if ever there was an occasion of that, it is the blue that is currently going on about Grants Commission recommendations. Those matters will have to be sorted out by the governments. But it sure as heck does not indicate that Western Australia, under this government, has had an unfair carve-up of the resources that go to the variou- states. Of course, who would pay the pensions? Who would defend a country of two million people with the population massively centred on the south-east corner of the country? People's living stapdards and very survival as the nation in the long term would be threatened by any successful outcome to that secessionist sentiment. As I said before, it is only the Liberals, who have benefited so much over the years from the continuing corruption of the Western Australian parliament, who are the force now raising that issue of secession. Is it any wonder? What a wonderful little bailiwick they have set up for themselves off there in the corner-with their pocket boroughs, with their massive imbalance between country and rural interests, with the only corrupt electoral system in the entire country supporting the continuation of their abused executive power in that state. The Manager of Opposition Business has come into the chamber, so to set his mind at rest I will conclude where I began. The Prime Minister was not talking about changing the distribution of seats between the states; he was talking about changing tpe mode of election for those seats. That is a matter for argument and discussion. It is not a matter for characterisation by the opposition as somehow or other working against the interests of the small states. If anything, an argument could be sustained that it would have exactly the opposite effect. But that would not be a reason necessarily for doing it either. More broad principles of discussion about· what does constitute a better form of representation ought to apply. (llme expired)",89
106,Mr TUCKEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"O'Connor) (4.37 p.m.)That was quite an amazing speech. It was about the most illogical thing I have heard in a long time. In one breath we are assured, contrary to the statements of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on a radio station as reported intoday's press, that we have absolutely nothing to worry about in regard to the Prime Minister's designs to change the representative base of each state as currently guaranteed in the constitution. We were informed by the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) that it is in the constitution. Then he spent the rest of his speech referring to the corrupt system in Western Australia where he says that representation is not necessarily proportional. The Leader of the House wants to make corrupt but, as a good Western Australian, would not hang around and listen. He says that if there is anywhere in Australia where each vote is not of equal value, that is' corconditioning rupt. Then, of course, he wants us to believe that he does not think that system should apply in the Senate. He lectured us on the situation in Western Australia where, in some numbers. rural and remote area electorates, frequently represented by the Labor Party, the number voters is less and said that that was wrong, but that we could trust him when he told us that that same system, when applied to the Senate, was right. That is totally illogical. It is a pity he did not spend more of. his time addressing the actual situation. The reality is that his assurances carry no. weight. It was not the Prime Minister who talked .a:bout a new system of voting in the Senate; it was the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Evans. Last Septem.ber Senator Evans briefed the ALP National Executive on a different Senate voting system. Yesterday the Prime Minister is reported as saying: And you understand, of course, that there's 12 senators for Tasmania with 400,OOO-odd people, as it is for Queensland, as it is for NSW ... Surely that is a hint that he totally opposes the concept as laid down in our constitution. The constitution, when dealing with the Senate, states: Until the Parliament otherwise provides there shall be six senators for each Original State which the parliament ha- provided,The parliament may make laws increasing or diminishing the number of senators for each State, but so that equal representation of the several Original States shall be maintained and that no Original State shall have less than six senators. There is the point, but there are the views of the Prime Minister adequately reinforced today when, in response to the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack), he complained about this House-'carefully constructed to represent equally the interests of the people in the smaller states and the larger states' - 'usurping executive authority' . That is exactly what we are worried about; that is what we are terrified about in Western it' Australia:. We are terrified that with his he imperial attitude to executive authority-and I believe he sees that authority as himselfhis whole republican debate has been about people, under cover of a national identity, that it is time to change the basic representative position of the Senate and how it represents the smallest state with equ-l I have to grin when I hear members from of the Western Australian Labor Party grizzling about the fact that there are too many votes in rural Western Australia. It is about time they asked themselves why they cannot win a few seats in rural Western Australia. They have equal chance; they can oppose me any time they like. But they cannot get the votes of the people. They do not trust them. But in Queensland a similar gerrymander stood for years, introduced by the Labor Party because . in those days they could get the votes in the country; people voted for them. There is no. inequality in this arrangement when one considers the··massive distances associated with this country called Australia. The founding fathers were adamant that the political system had to provide for minorities. It is amazing hQW we can be told about the minorities that are going to parade this weekend and their rights, but the rights of the minorities as they represent the people of a state with a very small population do not have the approval of the Prime Minister because they might, ashe said today, 'usurp executive authority'. He got 'unrepresentative' in about three times and 'the spoiling chamber' in a couple of times. Apparently it is all an upon good, responsible government, he told us. We have just seen a minister resign for being most irresponsible. ·These are the points that worry me. But I am further worried as a Western Australian because the balance of power in favour of this centralist government-if the Labor Party has its waY""""7is about to be increased. The Labor Party wants to send us the ex-Premier of Western Australia as a member of this House and a close supporter of the Prime Minister. It is commonly said over there that they are going to get Keating's representative in Fremantle, not Fremantle's representative in Canberra. This person's history as Premier was one of conceding everything that the state holds dear to Canberra. We have the only segment of the international rail system in Australia that makes a profit and provides good work for Western Australians. She rushed off to Queensland and without any payback said to Bob Hawke, 'You can have it'. That was one blank piece of paper she signed. Then she signed another to say that we would go into a national licensing system for road transport, notwithstanding the very special circumstances of Western Australia, where railway lines cover a quarter of the state and where road transport is the only means of servicing people and, in fact, large numbers of Labor electorates. She signed a piece of blank paper that committed OUT state to multiplying the licensing fee of those vehicles by four, quad:rupling them, and, of course, passing on that cost to people living literally thousands of miles away-further than from Melbourne to Brisbane-from the central supply system of Perth. These are the things she did. She has totally endorsed the attack on one of the fundamentalsof our constitution....,...51 (xxxi), as I recollect-that is, the right of states to administer land. She has stood solidly behind the Prime Minister in the matter of abandoning Western Australia's rights to administer its own land in the manner which the people of Western Australia see fit. Of course, there is other evidence of how determined the Prime Minister is to take over attack the entire country, be it by changing the structure of the Senate or by all the other devices he has used. He. honestly believes that he-and I guess to a second degree Canberra-is the repository of all the morality, all the economic capacity and administrative skills for the whole nation. He gives nobody else any rights. He does not recognise that the people of Western Australia have a view that is contrary to his own and that they have elected a state government to represent that view. No-he wants to take it all over for himself. The area of great worry to me is the device which is being used day by day, and which is just further evidence of that; that is, this Prime Minister trying to denigrate the Senate, trying to denigrate our constitution, by attacking our very tenuous links with the British crown today, rushing off to the United Nations and signing 112 treaties to give himself centralist power, but selling out the rights of Australians even to conduct their own business.· . I told the House the other day that it was like being hit with a bullet when senior representatives of the mining industry told me the other day in the most matter-of-fact way that they had gone off to somewhere in Europe to see the World Heritage Commission to find out how to conduct their mining enterprises in the future. They did not even complain about it; they have just accepted that we have sold out the rights of our businessmen. We have told them that they must head off now to Europe or somewhere else and get foreign countries to tell us how we are to perform. The Prime Minister's representative did not stay around to further promote his views-(Tzme expired)",92
107,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am genuinely touched by the newfound concern of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and of other honourable members opposite for Western Australia. The reality is, having put forward a matter of public importance on Western Australia on Tuesday and again today, they are not concerned about Western Australia at all; what they are concerned about are their electoral necks in Fremantle. On· Tuesday the MPI was: 'The serious . implications for Western Australia of the constant and continuous erosion of Australia's federal system of government', What did the honourable member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan) and the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) do on that occasion? They spent the vast proportion of their time tipping a bucket on the former Premier of Western Australia, Carmen Lawrence, who is now the Labor Party's candidate in the federal seat of Fremantle. This is consistent with their current strategic political approach which, at every tum, is to engage simply in personal abuse and mUd-slinging, a political strategy which we found discovered on the front page of the Australian and which has not been denied by any opposition member. On the contrary-we have seen it reinforced time and time again in question time. In respect of the MPI on Tuesday, we on this side saw them off on that occasion by referring to COAG and by quoting from Richard Court's document which he released at the recent COAG meeting. Honourable members opposite will recall that the Premier of Tasmania, Mr Groom, when asked whether he had read it, said: 'Ha, very interesting; brings back memories'. I will comeback to the memories shortly. The topic of the MPI today is 'the threat posed to states such as Western Australia by the Prime Minister's plan to radically alter the Senate voting system'. What is that about? That is all about what we found in a headline which appeared in· the West Australian earlier in the week: 'Court misses the States' rights drive'. The article starts off by saying: Channel 7's Canberra bureau chief, Dennis Grant, summed up the mood at the Hobart meeting of state leaders and the Prime Minister last Friday. He told viewers: 'Frankly,RichardCourthas made a bit of Ii goose of himself'. . The view was that the wheels had fallen off Mr Court's States' rights barrow. And his own sortfellow Liberal Premiers-had hardly helped his cause. Further down in that article we find what the MPI is all about today. 'What's behind all this?' asks the Western Australian commentator Malcolm Queckett. He then refers to Professor David Black from Curtin University, and I suspect they both come to the following conclusion: And, a healthy States' rights view had also become a political tool. It was seen as a vote winn-r in WA. This is all about the Liberal Party's electoral neck in the noose in Fremantle. If honourable members opposite think that by running this MPI today it can somehow get a few votes in FremantIe. Let us just address ourselves to the actual substance of the matt.er of public importance rather than the politics. The MPI states: The threat posed to States such as Western Australia by the· Prime Minister's plan to radically alter the Senate voting system. The intellectual point behind the MPI is that somehow the Senate protects the states. That is its basic thesis. Forget about the voting system, the basic thesis here is that somehow the Senate protects the states. Before I move to that, let us see what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has actually said about the Senate's voting system. The honourable member for Bennelongdrew a very long bow, which the Manager of Government Business (Mr Beazley) debunked in his contribution. But no-one actually referred to it what the Prime Minister had said in the course of his radio interview in Qu-ensland the other day. Let me quote from the transcript of that interview. The Prime Minister was answering a question and he said: , ... th- changes of Australia' in the last ten years are right out in front of or up to the best and front of mOst of the OECD area of the western world and I take a lot of pride in the fact that the Australian political system has answered the policy caJl that Australia needed. Again we see that the emphasis on our side is on policy changes rather than personal abuse. The interviewer said: WeJl, I'm glad you touched on the political system. Just a couple of questions. I won't hold you up much longer . - I didn't vote,for the Greens or the Democrats in the Federal election yet it seems these people somehow have gmbbedthe balance of power. They held your Government to ransom at the last Budget, they held t}le Mabo legi&lajionup for quite some, period of time. Australians by and large are a little poncerned that minority groups can manipulate Government and opposition. The Prime Minister responded: I think that's a good and legitimate concern because if you've got twelve senators to be elected in the Senate, the way the proportional representation system works, largely that twelve is devised into a hundred and a quota erids up being around six percent or a little less than six percent to elect a senator. And you understand, of course, that there's twelve senators for Tasmania with four hundred thousandodd people, as it is for Queensland, as it is for New South Wales. ' So it's not a representative c-amber, the Senate. It's not a representative electoral' system and if you get down to these very low quotas, what you end up with is people who could never get a 'majority of public votes holding powerful positions in the Senate as a consequence. I mean, this is a major and legitimate issue in our public and national life. To which the compere said, 'Fllir comment'. What did the Prime Minister 'say today in response to a question without notice on that subject matter?, He referred to the simple presence of a voting system in the Senate 'not being a holy grail. He also made the point that the Senate IS not a states house, it is a party house. That is the fundamental point here: the Prime Minister is referring to the Senate being, a party house, not a states house; he is focusing on its electoral system. Let lis have a look at how the Semite's electoral system might be changed.' The Senate's electoral system 'can of course be out in changed by legislation, bUt that requires the Senate's cooperation. The Labor Party does not have a majority ill the Senate, so the passage of such legislation would naturally entail support from more than one partymore than this party. So if the Senate voting system is to change, it will be done through legislation passed by the Senate. It is hardly the great threat which the honourable member for Bennelong would have us believe and, as the Prime Minister said in his radio interview, this is a legitimate conversation and discussion which we can have. Honourable' members opposite may not actually know it, but this is the subject of some academic interest as well. If honourable members bothered to go to the Parliamentary Library they would see that in October of last year the Parliamentary Research Service actually produced a paper on Semite electoral systems. Thatpllper referred to various Senate voting issues under these subject headings: the objects of the current system of proportional representation, arguments over the relative merits of the various forms of proportional representation, overseas experience and the use of thresholds in PR systems, and estimates for the result of Senate elections with eligibility thresholds. This is a legitimate public issue and is of some academic interest as well. In addition to making the point that the Prime Minister is maki-g, namely that we are entitled to have a legitimate public discussion, about the nature of the Senate voting system, I want to come back to the theoretical or intellectual point of the MPI, that somehow the Senate is a states house and protects the states. I make two points., Firstly, when was the last occasion that the, Senate ,actually voted on state lines? '",94
108,Mr FILING,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,On Mabo.,95
109,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I will come to Mabo. The answer is: we cannot find it. My colleague from Western Australia the honourable member for Moore raises Mabo. Let me simply say this to honourable members opposite: in the course of the Senate's consideration of Mabo,the government put forward amendments to its original legislation, which had the support of industry in Western Australia. What happened? To a man and woman, Liberal senators voted against those amendments. Why did they vote against those amendments? Because they knew that what was in the noose on that occasion was not the interests of those relevant industries in Western Australia but the he;;td. of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). That is a very good example of the point I am making. I am glad the honourable member for Moore raised it. Let us now see what the great paragon, protector and defender of the virtue of Western Australia, Richard Court, has to say about the Senate. What is the paper that t referred to in. the House on Tuesday, Rebuilding the federation, all about? We find in the course of that paper Premier Court lamenting the fact that when the federation was formed it came from colonies with light imperial control. He laments the virtues of John FOITest in 1890. I made the point, an9 I make it again, we on this side innocently thought until some time ago that the opposition was represented by the honourable member for Bennelong handcuffed to his 1955 white picket fence, but now we discover that honourable members opposite from Western Australia are with Richard Court, handcuffed to Lord Forrest's grave in Karrakatta. This is where they are intellectually fixed. In the course of Premier Court's document he laments the fact that external affairs of states are no longer controlled by London. He laments the fact that Privy Council appeals have been abolished. He laments the fact that we cannot have uranium mines in Western Australia. He supports effectively. the· notion of succession, and he laments very gravely the fact that the states cannot have an income tax, which is his secret hidden agenda here. Richard Court basically wants-and honourable members will find it on page 16 of his paper-the states to be equal with the Commonwealth so far as taxing powers are concerned. He wants a separate state income tax. What does Richard Court have to say about the Senate? If the Senate is the great protector and defender of the virtue of the states, what does he have to say about it? We hardly find anything about the Senate in his document other than the reference on page 11 to a check on central. power. He said in his document: The Founders included explicit constraints on the power of the Commonwealth. One of these was the Senate. Unfortunately, the Senate, conceived as a ""States House"" and a House of Review, has not been an effective institution. . . . Richard Court is not even saying that the Senate has. a role in protecting the states. Opposition members here are trying to do damage to Carmen Lawrence and to enhance their prospects in the Fremantle by-election. The Senate is not a states house, it is a party house. We will win in FremantIe. I will tell honourable members opposite one thing for sure: their mud-slinging·· and their bucket tipping· will not· damage Dr Lawrence, the former premier, because when the Fremaritle doctor arrives she is going to blow them away.

110,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The discussion is concluded. SECOND I>EPUTY SPEAKER: NA,96
111,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,APPOINTMENT,"I move: That Mr Rocher be appointed Second Deputy Speaker of this House. This appointment comes as a result of the the report of the committee of privileges. It is important because there are two people who determine. the behaviour of this House: the person who occupies the chair as Prime Minister and the person who occupieS the chair as Speaker or deputy speaker. It has been said before in this House, but I think it is worth reflecting on again, that former Speaker Snedden gave his view on the qualities that a person needed to occupy. the chair: judgment, common sense, patience, tact, a sense of humour, self-confidence, presence of mind and firmness tempered with kindness. Allan Rocher, the honourable member for Curtin, is an ideal person to act as, Second Deputy Speaker of this House. He entered the parliament in 1978 as a senator for Western Australia. He had 2112 years as a senator, and during that tim.e he held two positions. that helped him gain an understanding of the parliament: deputy government whip, and a member of the Senate privileges committee. In 1981 he resigned his position and stood for the seat of Curtin in a by-election when Vic Garland retired. He won that by-election and he joined a select group of people who have moved from the Senate to the House of Representatives-only 14 since Federation. Surprisingly, 12-perhaps soon to be 13have come from this side of the House. In his time as member for Curtin, from 1983 to 1990 he occupied. that chair from time to time as a deputy chairman of commit'tees. In 1990 he was a parliamentary secretary, in 1992 senior parliamentary secretary, and later that year a shadow minister. He has also served on two other committees that helped give him a good broad understanding of the parliament, the House of Representatives, and what is required as a deputy speaker. He was on the standing orders committee for two years lmd he was on the procedure committee for two years. In terms of fairness, I can remember a time in early 1989 when I was sitting in this House and the honourable member for Curtin was occupying the chair. The then member for Franklin, Bruce Good luck, was performing and he named him and had cause to have him suspended from the House. It is not often that a person occupying the chair suspends someone from their own side, Mr Speaker,. and we would commend it to youPrior to standing as· a candidate for parliament, he was a builder. .He is a fellow of the Australian Institute of Building, he was President of the Master Builders Association in 'Western Australia and he is a fellow of the Institute of Arbitrators Australia. He has been actively involved in arbitrating disputes betwee- companies and that sort of quality is excellent for someone to be Deputy Speaker. As I said, all this comes as a result of the report of the Standing Committee on Procedure. I cannot pretend that we on this side of the House are happy with that report and how it has been implemented. The Second Deputy Speaker relates particularly to the main committee chamber and. we are prepared to give that a go, but there are a few things that will not really work there. I dono! think a room on the second floorjust another ordinary committee room-is adequate for the dignity of the main committee of this House; a quorum of three is something of a farce; and the fact that strangers will not be allowed on the floor will mean that the public will not have access, which is an enormous pity. We are also not happy with the way the sit1-bin operates. Mr Speaker, it is two to nothing to our side of the House and, given the behaviour of the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) and the .honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) over recent days, we would like to see you even that up. Question time is clearly not working- We caught the Minister for Employment,. Education and Training (MI' Crean) out cold when he asked' his department for some 'cute' questions. I guess, if you were responsible for nearly one million unemployed, you would want to try to look cute. All that said, in the end we are prepared to give the second chamber a go. We think Allan Rocher, being Second Deputy Speaker, will help that work. I certainly wish him all the best. lam delighted to be able to nominate him to a position where he will serve his parliament and his country. Mr mCKS (Riverina)-It gives me a great deal of pleasure to second the nomination of the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Dr Wooldridge) for the Second Deputy Speaker in the .second chamber of the House of Representatives. I would also like to congratulate the honourable member for Curtin on his decision to nominate and on his preparedness to take on this responsible position. As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has pointed out, the honourable. member for Curtin has had significant experience in the parliament, having been first elected to the Senatefor Western Australia in 1977. He was then elected to the House of Representatives for the seat of Curtin ata by-election in February 1981. He has made a significant contribution to the parliament over the years, having been a member of numerous committees, including the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations, the Senate Standing Committee on Disputed Returns and Qualifications, Senate estiqIates committees, the House of Representatives Standing Comni.itteeon Standing Orders, the House of Representatives Standing CO!11mittee on Procedure and the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, finance and Public Administration-all very responsible committees. He has ,also been a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. ' , '"" , He has also gained great experience from a number of parliamentary delegations, having been present at the European Parliamentary CPA Conference in Canada and having been a member of a parliamentary delegation to the United States. One of his most important roles was that .of parliaqIentary adviser, to the United Nations General Assembly late, in 1991. The honoutable member for Curtin has served in many party positions during his years in' the parliament. He has had long experience as Deputy Chairman of Committees, a position he held for nearly seven years. As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said, he has had amimberof unique experiences to add to the position. Honourable members who have been here for some years may recall an occurrence,on 25 November 1985. I checked 'the Hansard of that date and saw that my colleague the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) was giving a speech on the petroleum revenue bill. The honourable member for Dawson was speaking, and then in Hansard the line appears, 'An incident having occurred'. The honourable member for Dawson then goes on with his speech. The next day Harry Jenkins, the Speaker of the day, said: , Order! Honourable members will have become aware of an incident in the chamber last night when a person dresSed as a chicken entered the chamber and sat on the ministerial bench. Although a number of honourable members have been approached by officers of the House in an attempt to identify the offender, there has been a universal denial of any direct knowledge of the incident. I wish to indicate to the House my disgust that any honourable member would show so little respect for the institution that the honourable member wOlild behave in this way. As I understand it, the honourable .member for Curtin was in the chair at the time of the incident so he was not the milO in the chick' -' en suit. ,To be able to handle that situation .' with verve and to be so good at dealing with 'the problem that arose on that occasion is al1 indieation of the quality of the man. _",96
112,Mr R,APPOINTMENT,"her is a popular figure on both sides of the House and is very highly regarded for his skill, chairmanship, fairness and objectivity. It is, therefore, with a great deal of pleasure that I second the nomination by the Deputy Leader' of the Opposition of the honourable member for Curtin, Mr Allan 'Rocher, to the position of Second Deputy Speaker in the second chamber of the, H.0use of Representatives- On behalf of the National Party, the coalition and no doubf the whole House, I wish him well for the future.",98

114,Dr HEWSON,APPOINTMENT," Mr Speaker, witl1 your in-ul­ gence: I congratulate Allan Rocher on being elected as Second Deputy Speaker in the House. I have had the advantage, since I have been in parliament, of knowing. Allan Rocher pretty well. For part of the time, he worked as a parliamentary secretary to me and as a shadow minister. All that my colleagues have sa'id about All,m Rocher is in no sense to be taken as an exaggeration. Allan is respected onboth·sides oCthe parliament for his objectivity and impartiality. His ,appointment comes ala very important time in, this House. In view of the events .of , recent days and the questions that have been raised in the areas of objectivity and partiality, I think it is very important that a man of Allan Rocher's calibre and experience has beeh .elected to this position. I think he will bring a new sense of impartiality and objectivity, which will be very important, to this parliament. It is important, as we have said many times, that we create a better impression in the eyes of the people .of Australia as to the standing of this place. I do not think it has ever been reduced to as Iowa level as it was not all that long ago. I think it is important that in that context we all see the challenge that is before us. J am sure that Allan will play the part that I know he can play and will set something of an example in that regard. I congratulate you, Allan.",98
115,Mr BEAZLEY,APPOINTMENT," Mr Speaker, with your indulgence: I congratulate my. Western Australian colleague the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) on his appointment as Second Deputy Speaker. I assure him that, whatever might have been said in nominating speeches, we will also see you as Deputy Speaker in this place in the detail stage. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Dr Wooldridge) very· correctly identified what will be a very cult task, though,of getting the new committee, the new process, bedded down. I do not think we have necessarily seen the last of the changes to standing orders associated with that. We will have to see what happens and whether or not it operates satisfactorily. Whether it operates satisfactorily will very largely be a product of how well the presiding officers do. Both in this place and the other, I think the opposition parties have done the parliament well in their selection. We have had an opportunity to see Allan as a deputy chairman·over many years. I agree with the comments that were made about his impartiality and his comprehension of standing orders. There is not a huge number of members who take delight in making themselves cognisant of standing orders. Allan is one of the rare exceptions to that.

118,Mr ROCHER,APPOINTMENT," Mr Speaker, thank you for taking the time to be present in the chair and for your very generous comments. I particularly want to acknowledge with thanks the nomination by my colleague the Deputy Leader of the OppoSition (Dr Wooldridge) and his very generous remarks. I feel flattered and I deeply appreciate it. My long-time friend the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Hicks), National Party whip and a valued coalition colleague, also made remarks which I found to my liking. If there is any way I can return that favour once or twice, I shall. Noel and I have been in the parliament for approximately the same timecertainly. in the House of Representatives for the same time-so we have known each other. He is one of nature's gentlemen. It'is therefore all the more acceptable that he should second the nomination made by the Deputy Leader of the. Opposition. To my leader, thank you very much for your contribution and acknowledgment. We have worked together, closely at times, and I appreciate the fact that you have been able to be in here today and to add your remarks to those that had already been ma:de. The same applies' to the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley). He was very generous indeed. I can assure him that I do not have an encyclopaedic knowledge of standing orders,' certainly not the new standing orders, but I will get a working knowledge of them as time goes by. I know it is not much of a recommendation to have tossed someone out-'-it does not matter which side of the House they come from-but the deputy chairmen of committees acting as deputy speaker all know that sometimes it has to be done. In the case of Bruce Good luck, though, I do take a certain amount of satisfaction. It is the best known secret the world that Bruce was in that chicken suit. Although Hansard does not record my remarks, I remember saying quite clearly, 'Would the attendants kindly remove that person from the chamber?'. I made a terrible mistake. 1 should have said, 'Remove him and detain him'. He was able to get away and dine out on the fact that he was suspected of being the chicken but it was never proven. It was not able to be proven because he took sanctuary with the honourable member for Watson (MrLeo MCLeay) who, I am pretty reliably informed, was a chief urger in that little exercise. Whilst I do not think it did anything for the dignity of the chamber, it'is something of our past now and we might as well enjoy it. I do remember that, when I had to name Bruce and after the formalities were concluded, the Leader of the House came over to me and commented on the fact. 1 said, 'I hope you will be as generous when I have to do the same to one of your people'. And he assured me he would. I was looking very hard to get Gerry Hand. We can remember what Gerry was like. He was like .a magpie-yap, yap, yap. You could not shut him up. I was going to name him the first chance 1 got",99
119,Mr BEAZLEY,APPOINTMENT,We were always willing to sacrifice him.,100
120,Mr ROCHER,APPOINTMENT,"You didn't tell me that! I must say that I did not quite get to him. He took me to the brink. As Mr Speaker knows, some people are clever enough to get you to the brink but not get you over it. We have these new arrangements and my appointment is one of those new arrangements. They involve the creation of a second chamber, as has already been noted, although some of my duties will be in this place. The coalition has expressed its concerns and reservations about the government'schanges and that is now in the past. The,arrangements were proposed and carried by the House,so that is it. I think it now behoves all of us to make the changes work to the' best possible effect and I would expect, with the ordinary patience and ordinary goodwill of all honourable members, to be able to play some small part in that. If it proves that the legislative in and parliamentary processes improve as a result of these changes, I, along with many others in the chamber, will be very pleased indeed. . I look forward to 'a fruitful working association with you, Mr Speaker, with Mr Deputy Spea:ker and with the Clerks of the House. In conclusion, I thank again my colleagues the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Riverina, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the Leader of the House for their kind remarks. Finally, 1 thank the House for what was really a unanimous election.

128,Mr GRACE,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"In accordance with standing order 28A, on behalf of the Committee of Members' Interests I present the report .on the operations of the.comrnittee for 1993. I ask for leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with the report. . Leave granted.",101
129,Mr GRACE,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"The report I have just tabled covers the operations of the Committee of Members' Interests for the calendar year. Honourable members will be aware that it is this committee which was established to oversee the operations of the Register of Members' Interests under which all members of the House are required to register a range of interests for themselves, their spouses and any dependent children. There are three matters contained in the report which the committee has directed I should especially bring to the attention of the House. They are, firstly, whether there is 'a need for the registration of the membership of all organisations, irrespective of the nature of SENATE those organisations; secondly, the need to update the value of gifts requiring registration to reflect current values since those values have remained unchanged since the introduction o{ .the registration requirement in 1984; and, thirdly, whether there is a need for the registration of interest held during the period between the dissolution of the House in one parliament and the provision of full statements of interest in the next parliament. lshall deal with each of these matters. The first is the registration of membership of organisations. When first adopted on 9 October 1984, the resolutions provided for registration as follows: (m) any other interests, such as membership of organisations, where a conflict, of interest with a Member's public duties CQuid fQreseeably arise .or be seen tQ arise. Following consideration of this requirement, the then Committee of Members' Interests on 18 September 1985 dealt with the difficulties Of attempting to lay down a definition of conflict of interest, and went on to say: Whilst the resQlutiQns limit the requirement tQ the Report registratiQn'Qf membership .of QrganisatiQns 'where a cQnflict .of interest with a Member's public duties CQuid fQreseeably arise .or be seen tQ arise' it has becQme apparent tQ. the CQmmittee that membership .of any6rgimisatiQn, be it PQlitical, sporting, recreatiQnal, religiQus .or cQmmunity based, may have the potential fQr a cQnflict .of interest situation tQ arise. For this reaSQn, the CQmmittee is reluctantly fQrced.tQ the cQnclusiQn that it will be necessary fQr it tQ require the registratiQn .of the membership .of all QrganisatiQns. It' seeks the CQncurrence .of the' HQuse in this approach to the registratiQn requirements. The House accepted the committee's recommendation and, on 13 February 1986, amended the resolutions to require the registration of: (m) membership of any organisation, and (n) any other interests where a conflict of interest with a Member's public duties foreseeably arise or be seen to arise. The new requirements caused some concern. On 12 September 1986 the then Leader of the House wrote to the committee suggesting that the amended requirement went beyond what was necessary and suggested a return to the original wording. At that time the committee was not prepared to support the proposed change and stood by its earlier decision. ill 1991 the matter was again considered by the committee. In its report for that year it recoinmended a return· to the original wording. ill doing so, it said: Many of the notifications of membership of organisations clearly have no potential for a conflict of interest situation to arise, ego membership of a small sporting club. It is possible that quite Inadvertently some Members may have overlooked the requirement to notify membership of such an organisation or to have not notified becoming a member within the required 28 days. The Committee recognises that Members are very busy people and can very easily overlook these minor requirements. It is the majority view of the Committee that in many· instances the requirement places an unnecessary burden upon Members and serves little or no purpose. The present committee strongly supports that view and again recommends a return to the original wording of the resolution. The second matter is the need to update the value of gifts requiring registration. On numerous occasions this committee's predecessors have recommended that the value of gifts requiring registration should be updated to current values. No action has been taken on these recommendations. When first fixed in October 1984, the values were $100 for gifts received from other than official sources and $250 for gifts received from official sources. These sums remain unchanged, despite the fact that in current values the sums should be $166 and $415 respectively. In its report the committee again recommends the regular updating of these values and proposes that the sums should be changed immec:iiately to $200 and $500 respectively. It urges the House to make these adjustmen- without further delay. The third and last component is whether there is a need for the registration of interests held during the period from the dissolution of could the House of Representatives in one parliament and the provision of full statements in the next parliament. Once again, this is a matter upon which previous committees have made reCommendations on several occasions. Under the existing resolutions the requirement to register interests ceases at the dissolution of the House in one parliament and does not resume until 28 days after the opening of the new parliament.. In the normal course of events, this has the· effect of causing a substantial gap in the registration requirements for contiriuing members. In the. case of the 1993 elections, this gap was almost four months. It also means that any notification of interests which a member lodges during that intervening period does not form part of the register, causing confusion· for members and persons searching the register. This committee strongly recommends· that urgent consideration be given to this matter. It also recommends that; if the resolutions are amended to close this gap in respect of re-elected members, newly elected members should be required to register interests held on the day of their election and to notify any alteration of those interests which occur from that date to the date of the lodgement of their full statements-that is within 28 days of making their oaths or affirmations at the opening of parliament. On behalf of the Committee of Members'. - nterests, I seek an early response to these outstanding recommendations. Publications Committee Report",101
130,Mr FITZGIBBON,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,I present the ninth report from. the Publications Committee sitting in conference with the Publications Committee of the Senate .. Copies of the report are being circulated to honourable members in the chamber. Report-by leave-adopted. NA Motion (by Mr - aldwin) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Great Barrier Reef: Native Title Claims,102
131,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,"At the time the· Native Title Bill was debated last year, the opposition and .the Liberal Party opPosed very strongly this legislation which we. saw as a disaster. We saw that it ,was going. tQ strike' at certainty. and that it was going to, explode 200 years of settled land law. Yesterday I was reading the Australian, as most honourable members of this place do, and I read that native title claims over the Great Barrier Reef are hampering tourist operators and placing pressure on the reef management agency which is now demanding JIlore public fundS to cope. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority is' asking for $500,000 in the' coming federal budget to handle matters associated with the Native Title Bill. Aborigines have lodged native title claims over very substantial portions of this important national asset.. As we endeavour to encourage the tourist industry to expand,all honourable members must be concerned over the fact that it is impossible at the present time to expedite consideration of many applications being made by .people to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. J'hereare, I understand, about 200 applications every year lodged to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. These relate to reef based developments, mostly for moorings and pontoons. We might think, of course, that these are relatively minor developments in many cases, but t4ey are important developments. to enable tourist operators to properly bring this important national asset to the view of many people who visit our country and who wish to view and inspect it. It is also. interesting to note that a company in North Queen-land actually had to hire Aboriginal. worke.1,'S in exchange for. p-rmis­ sion from a Cairns Aboriginal community to build a pontoon. Quite frankly, this smacks of blackmail and is another indication of how the Native Title Actis not operating the way the government said it would. The Chairinan of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, Professor Graham Kelleher, said: . . . 10 per cent of staff time was being devoted to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander concerns. He pointed out that the need to negotiate with native groups over research, zoning plans and day-today management of the reef had escalated tremendously since 1992, when the High Court's Mabo ruling highlighted traditional rights of Aboriginals. That was the time when the unelected and unaccountable politiCians on the High Court hijacked the law as we had understood it over the last 200 years. . The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, as a result of the law of this land and as a result of the High Court decision, is required to allocate 10 per cent of its budget to deal with Aboriginal concerns. That is a major problem. The result is that the Treasurer(Mr Willis), when formulating the budget for this year, will receive a request from that authority for $500,000 of taxpayers' funds, which the authority claims it needs to enable it t')Carry out its obligations imposed by this parhament and by the courts of the land. This is yet another indication of the failure of the Native Title Act to meet the needs of this country. I will call upon the opposition, when we return to government at the next election, to repeal the Native Title Act so that we are able to bring forward legislation which accurately represents the aspirations of the Australian people. The Native Title Act is an unmitigated disaster. It is a discriminatory act which strikes at certainty in the land law, at jobs, at development and at opportunities for all Australians, including Aboriginal Australians.",103
132,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"I remind the honourable member for Fisher of standing order 75, which he came pretty close to infringing with his reference to the High Court judges. I remind him to be careful next time. Westrail Midland Workshops",103
133,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,ADJOURNMENT," Tomorrow, Friday, 4 March, is a day of shame for the Western Australian Liberal Party and the Court government as a result of their tragic and dishonest decision to close the Midland Westrail .workshops, which takes effect tomorrow. During the 1993 state and federal election campaigns, Liberal candidates, some of whom personally campaigned at the Midland workshops, never once had the decency or the honesty to indicate to Westrail Midland workshop employees that a coalition state government would contemplate the closure of the workshops. On the contrary, coalition candidates actually campaigned for an enhanced role for the workshops. The Liberal· Party's expressed election commitment to enhance and upgrade the workshops has been broken in the most crass and dishonest way. I believe that the closure of these workshops is - a grave mistake, both for Western Australia in general and for Midland in particular. At precisely the time when the Midland region, led by the Shire of Swan and other local groups, is working hard to enhance Midland as a regional centre; the closure tomorrow of the workshops will be a damaging blow to its regional and economic status .. I think it is worth recounting and reading into the record the express election conKnit-:ments with which the Westem Australian Liberal Party went to the 1993 state election. One part of the Liberal Party policy document for that state election says: To re-equip Midland Workshops, which employs 850; To guarantee the long-term future of the workshops; To 'co-locate' an institute of heavy engineering at the workshops; To invite the private sectorto workshops site to make them into a world-class facility. The then shadow transport spokesman, Mr Charlton, now the minister presiding over the dishonest betrayal and closure of the workshops, presented the coalition transport policy at the Western Australian state election 1993. It said: Under a Coalition Government, the· Midland Workshops will be better equipped to fulfil their existing role, and will be given a most important new role that will secure their long-term future. We will: Establish an Institute of Heavy Engineering. It will be co-located with the Westrail workshop at Midland. The Institute will be part of· a fully integrated training institute for the heavy engineering trades; , Re-equip the Midland Workshops; Invite the private sector to participate in the further development of the Midland site and become part of a world class heavy engineering complex to service the needs of the rail, mining, agriCUlture and the new value adding industries. Such is the dishonesty and· betrayal of the Western· Australian Liberal Party. Nearly 12 months ago we saw such headlines as 'Hundreds of rail' jobs get the axe' in the West Australian. In the Midland Reporter we saw an article headed 'Their future is looking bleak', which was about young apprentices at the Westrail· workshops. We saw another one headed 'Closure""a sad loss for the families'''. An editorial under the heading 'End of the line for Midland' in the West Australian of Friday, 30 April last'year said: West Australians have· been given a disturbing insight into the practical application' of Richard . Court's pre-election promise to restore integrity to government. But there could be few more blatant betrayals of trust than the Government's decision to close Westrail's Midland workshops next year-after pledging before the poll to re-equip the plant to ensure its,long-term future; The 750 affected workers have every right to feel bitter and frustrated about a·political somersault which can only cast . doubt on. the Governmept's commitment to other policy promises. An alafllling aspect is MrCourt'S refusaIto admit that a pledge . has been broken and 'his indignance that people have had the temerity tointerpret the decision .in 'co-locate'at the such a way. That was certainly the way that it - as interpreted by the local 'President of the Midland and District Chamber of Commerce. I quote from the Midland Echo of 2 May 1993: The decision to Ctose the workshops ends 90 years of tradition at Midland, and has outraged the Opposition and the local business community. Midland and District Chamber of Commerce President Michael· Chartres said he waS concerned at the effect the closure would have on.retailers:and the psychological effect on Midland. ""Midland seems to be battling all the time, and we have this continual drain on manufacturing operations."" he said. That is a person who one would normally expect to be sympathetic to the policies of the Liberal Party, yet he said that in the local paper. I quote as well from a letter he wrote to the Minister for Transport, Mr Charlton, on 28 April imploring the minister to review his decision: There is little doubt that the government decision as it stands will adversely affect the region as· a whole with a commensurate effect on Coalition credibility. In the opinion of the Midland Chamber of Commerce and Industry the closure decision requires rational review . . . Unfortunately, that review did not occur. I attended a public meeting in Midland at which the President. of the Midland chamber of commerce said that he hoped the government would have second thoughts before 'we close down the whole lot'. I quote from my handwritten note of that meeting. He said, 'It would be absolutely criminal to close down a manufacturing site. of this size'. That is precisely what. the Liberal Party in Western Australia has done-an absolutely criminal act to betray the people of the Midland workshops and the people of the Midland region generally. Bonney, Mrs Lores",103
134,Mrs SULLIVAN,ADJOURNMENT,"Moncrieft) (5.37 p.m.)In TUesday evening's adjournment debate I paid tribute to pioneering Australian aviator Mrs Lores Bonney, who died last week. Mrs Bonney set a series of Australian and international aviation records during the 1930s. Her achievements have received public recognition in a number of ways. For example, her name has been engraved on America's Famous Flyers Wall, which honours the greats of aviation, a Bonney display is mounted at Sydney's Powerhouse Museum, an annual Bonney trophy is awarded amongst British flyers, her achievements have been recognised by the Smithsonian Institution and the International Air and Space Museum in Washington DC, and, until recently, the VIP room at Brisbane's international terminal was named in her honour. Mrs Bonney was awarded an MBE by King George V after her 1933 solo flight from Australia to England-the first woman to have achieved this feat. However, it was not until 1991 that she received the Order of Australia for her services to Australian aviation. Although she was feted in foreign countries she visited, she was given scant recognition in Australia at the time of her recordsetting, extraordinary feats of skill, endurance and courage. Once her flying exploits were interrupted by the advent of World War II, she slipped from public sight and memory almost totally. It was not until the ABC television documentary Somehow we almost forgot Mrs Bonney, which was shown on the Queensland ABC network in 1977, and the publication of her biography by aviation enthusiast Terry Gwynn-Jones in 1979-which I was honoured to launch-that she received appropriate recognition in her home town of Brisbane. The VIP room at Brisbane's international terminal subsequently became the Lores Bonney Room-a fitting tribute given that all her record-breaking flights commenced at Eagle Farm. I was therefore disturbed to be told by a fellow mourner at her funeral that the Lores Bonney Room no longer existed and that the mural dedicated to her, which it contained, had been dismantled and the whereabouts of it as well as a display of her flying memorabilia were uncertain. Yesterday I contacted the Brisbane office of the Federal Airports Corporation .to make inquiries about this matter because I was concerned about the possibility that, once again, this outstanding Australian would slip  absent from Brisbane, but I was pleased to be informed by the officer acting in his place, Mr Cam Spencer, that this was not so. Mr Spencer's explanation of events is that, as part of the internal expansion of the present temporary Brisbane international terminal, the VIP room has been done away with. Mrs Bonney's memorabilia are now in a display case above the staircase to the Ansett international lounge. Mr Spencer informed me that the plans for the new Brisbane international terminal, which is presently under construction, include a Lores Bonney ROOm, the equivalent of the previous VIP room. He also told me that it is planned to have a Lores Bonney display in a public area of the terminal so that this tribute to her aviation achievements will be seen by the general public. Naturally, I welcome this proposal because such a display can only serve to extend public knowledge of this truly remarkable Australian. Today the honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) and I submitted a notice of motion on this subject, which I hope will soon receive the support of the House of Representatives. I am determined that Mrs Bonney's place in history will not again be downgraded or ignored so long as I am a member of this parliament. I am also writing to the general manager of the ABC, Mr David Hill, urging that the ABC arrange a rebroadcast of its documentary Somehow we almost forgot Mrs Bonney. Given the power of television as a public communications and information medium, I hope that the ABC will quickly act on this suggestion and give the documentary national exposure at a popular viewing time. The last and· only time it was broadcast it was shown only in Queensland, and late at night at that. Not only would this be a very fitting tribute to a great Australian, who was an extraordinary contributor to this nation during her long life, it would also make known for the first time her contribution to the generations who today owe so much to the pioneering work done by our early aviators-who were always at risk of their lives-to make possible the development of Australia which followed the development of air travel and air transport. Government Purchasing Policy Australian Manufactures Venture Capital",105
135,Mr OCONNOR,ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to take this opportunity to elaborate on some proposals which I mentioned in the recent appropriations debate that could stimulate the creation of around 200,000 jobs over the next three to five years, thus adding significantly to the job creation that is now accompanying the projected improvements in economic growth. I want particularly to expand on the comments that I made in relation to government purchasing policy. Evidence submitted to the parliamentary inquiry into government purchasing policy now under way touched on the. following difficulties that have been encountered in government purchasing: poorly trained purchasing officers under the devolved system have little understanding of the. whole of life purchasing concept; there is a cultural bias among purchasers against Australian manufactures; the tendering systems are costly and complex and that, of course, is making access difficult for small and medium enterprises; and slow payment by the Commonwealth is also exacerbating the problems of these firms. I think much can b- done to redirect government purchasing to Australian manufactures and stimulate employment, especially in the manufacturing sector. One way of diverting some $2 billion worth of consumption expenditure from imports tolocalmatiufactures could be to step up the public education campaign to encourage Australian citizens and businesses to purchase Australian. Mr O'Keefe-Hear, hear!",106
136,Mr OCONNOR,ADJOURNMENT,"'-I see the honourable member for Burke is in the chamber. He has been a long-time supporter of the buy Australia campaign and I commend· him for that interest and involvement. .The object of this exercise ought to be a diversion of some $2 billion from expenditure on imports to local manufactures. In the process we can create some 60,000 jobs. . This attack via the public education campaign against the cultural bias that exists among Australian households and some businesses against Australian manufactures· would certainly do much to engender confidence in the sector, create demand for Australian goods and services, and create jobs. There is a significant cultural bias in the community against Australian products. If we effectively resource a public education campaign over a long period of time we can alter the structure of domestic private consumption and redirect some of that expenditure to Australian manufactures. My final proposal involves the availability of capital and the enlargement of the venture capital base in Australia. The key problem out there in the business sector is that we have a very innovative and very inventive business sector-we register more patents than any other country' in the OECD of comparable economic size-but, while there are a Jot of inventions, the venture capital market and indeed the banking system do not cater for these smaller enterprises aJ}d they have culty getting access to the capital required to bring their ideas to the commercialisation phase. The government does have a vehicle to partly address this venture capital need-'the Australian Technology Group. It i- currently cashed up to the tune of $30 million. I suggest that that capital base be expanded to between $100 million and $150 million from both government and private capital sources. Its efforts ought to be directed to getting at least 100 new technologies and products into the marketplace; that is a long-termmeasure that would assist the Australian economy. The proposals that I have put can be adequately financed from increased revenues as the economy grows and for a reorientating of expenditures from within existing programs. They are essentially demand driven and attack both the twin task of creating employment and reducing the deficit. As I have said, they are demand driven, they are aimed at import replacement, they are inherently employment generating and they can be used to stimulate economic activity in regional areas. There are some 200,000 jobs there for the begging for a minor outlay by the government and a reorientation of some of its programs. (TIme expired) . Whale Sanctuary",106
137,Mr NEHL,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise on this adjournment debate to talk about' - the actions of some high school students inCoffs Harbour, in my electorate- At the beginning of last week I brought down a number of signatures which those students had ,asked me to present personally to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) regarding the creation of a whale sanctuary south of the 40th parallel. Unfortunately, the Prime Minister was unable to fit that brief meeting into his busy schedule and, since I was only advised of that yesterday, I. thought I would seize the opportunity to publicly pay tribute to the year 9 students of Orara High School, who collected 570 signatures seeking the establishment of a whale sanctuary, and in particular to .one young lady, Kristy Reynolds, from Coffs Harbour High School, who personally collected 612 signatures. It is important and wonderful that the youngsters of Australia diffihave become so environmentally conscious. It is their world that they are going to inherit. The kids of Australia' provide us all with a wonderful example of enthusiasm, and in this case action, on behalf of the environment. I would particularly like to pick upa point made by the students of year 9 at Orara High School. In their note to Mr Keating they said: The Australian government has a responsibility to not only strongly oppose the reintroduction of whaling at the next summit meeting but to ban all imports which have used the whale in its production. . That particular point is absolutely spot on; it is correct. Just as Australia prohibits the import of ivory from elephants, tiger skins and a number of artefacts made from endangered species, we should also seek to ban whaling and provide the sanctuaries south of the 40th parallel. We should as a nation take a deliberate bipartisan attitude to ban the imports of all products coming from whal-s. ",107
138,Mr NEHL,ADJOURNMENT,"I thank the honourable member very much for his support. In this year, 1994, and as the century comes to a conclusion and we move into the 21st century, there is absolutely no product from whales which cannot be provided from another source that does not involve the butchery of these innocent mammals. I know, that there are other hono-rable members wishing to speak,' so I will finish on this note. I just want to say thank you to - the schoolchildren of Coffs Harbour ·for their great support for the estah.. lishment of a whale sanctuary. Co-trimoxazole",107
139,Mr CHYNOWETH,ADJOURNMENT,"On 12 June 1988 the Heatherhill branch of the Australian Labor Party in the electorate of Dunkley moved the following motion: That the ALP Dunkley FEA, strongly urges the Commonwealth Government to Review the drug calIed co-trimoxozole, the drug is marketed under the names Bactrim and Septrin. The reason being that in Britain, the Committee on Safety of Medicines has reported 64 deaths from side effects of the drug in 1970-84. Most of these were blood disorders in elderly people. It goes on: The Dunkley FEA; recommends the Minister for Health place a ban on the' drug . . . until the ADEC's recommendation is confirmed or reviewed. The Dunkley PEA deplores two giant pharmaceutical companies fighting to keep a lucrative antibiotic on the national health scheme, despite recent evidence of toxic side effects. I remind honourable members that the motion is dated 12 June 1988. The motion Was moved by Jean Stemmer, who is one.of the stalwarts of the party, and seconded by Colin Hampton, who is the ALP candidate for Frankston East in the next state election. He will naturally win that seat. This was the reply from the honourable member for Jagajaga (Mr Staples), the then Minister for Housing andAged Care, in August 1988: The Department of Community Services and Health has been aware of adverse reactions, to these products and the matter was recently considered by the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC). ' ADEC considered that there are specific uses for which these products are appropriate. ADEC's area of concern related mainly to the use of these products in the elderly. It therefore recommended that the product information for alI formulations of trimethoprim with sulphamethoxazole should be amended to include a warning of the increased risk of Serious adverse effects in elderly patients and that the use of these products should be discouraged in this age group. These products are still being used'in this age group and people are still being affected. On the 28th of last month, nearly six years later, there was a radio interview on The World Today. The transcript of that interview reads as follows: RICHARD PALFREYMAN: Concerns have been raised in Britain, 'today, abOut the safety of two anti-bacterial drugs that are also commonly used in Australia. The British committee on the safety of medicine says that .hundreds of people may have died in that country over the past 20 years, after taking Bactrim and Septrim. The drugs contain two rival anti-bacterial products, one of them sulphur based. The safety of Bactrim and Septrim has been reviewed in Australia, and they now carry a warning that they can be dangerous for the elderly. Dr Ross Bradbury, a specialist in infectious diseases at Sydney's Concord Hospital and a member of the federal Adverse Drug Reaction Advisory Committee, said: They have been widely used around the country because of their great value, particularly for treating urinary, tract infection and, to a lesser extent, for treating respiratory infection. But more' recently, those of us who ,advise in this area for treatment . . .' have tried to advise people to avoid the Bactrim andSeptrim because of their sulphur content. Increasingly, particularly for urinary tract infections, organisms have become resistant to sulfur, and we no .longer need to use the mixture which is sulfamethoxazol and trimethoprim, but rather just advise using trimethoprim alone. These drugs are still being used six years after the Dunkley FEA raised its concern with the minister, and they are still killing people. It is a disgrace. Many people are experiencing horrendous side effects from these drugs. Who knows how many people have died in Australia. If these drugs can kill the elderly, who knows what long-term effects they will have on those, of us who use them while we are still young? I call on the Minister for Health (S-nator Richardson). to direct the Adverse Drug Reaction Advi-oryCommittee to hold an. extensive review of these drugs and determine whether the deaths warrant the continued use of this product. Accommodation for the Aged  modation of ageing, Australians is being neglected by this government. The situation ' is now one of deep crisis in my state of South Australia. Many' elderly people are currently unable to obtain positions in nursing homes and hostels, placing pressure on acute hospital beds and the families of elderly people waiting at home for a bed to become available.. The Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services, however, is quite convinced that accommodation for the aged is adequate. It has calculated the number of nursing home and hostel beds for each state and region based on a formula. According to the. magic equation, there is no additional need for beds above the levels determined. This is despite the' fact that there are currently no beds listed with the Bed Vacancy Register in South Australia. If we examine the number of clients registered for accommodation year by year, it becomes - lear that greater numbers of elderly people are requiring nursing home care.' The average number of clients registered increased by 33 per cent in 1991-92 and 44 per cent in 1992-93. The situation has worsened. In the last three months, current registrations doubled. The demand for beds has outstripped supply toa point where there are very few vacancies available at any nursing home throughout South Australia., FOUf months ago, an e"",pected bed wait was days to weeks. It is now a matter of months: The paucity of nursing homes and hostel beds is effectively turning many hospitals in South Australia into sitter services. Hospitals are forced for ethical reasons to accommodate the elderly. People who need a nursing home or hostel bed are never able to return home and look after themselves. This is an inappropriate use of resources. Hospitals ex'ist to sick people; not to bear the brunt of inadequate aged care and' social services. The health system is being forced to accommodate inappropriate cases and so is often unable to take the elective surgery cases, causing waiting lists to continue to grow unnecessarily. The department clearly needs to adapt its policy. The writing has been on the wall for some time. But the department's equation has staunchly remained as the determinant for the number of beds required. According to the equation, South Australia is short of hostel beds but is oversupplied with nursing home beds. But for the elderly people, their families and the social workers who are endeavouring to find them a bed, the equation's results do not ring true. In Victoria,the hostel-nursing home balance is reversed. There are apparently too many hostel beds and not enough nursing home beds. Some war veterans who are accommodated in private ltospitals would have no chance of obtaining a nursing home bed. A few. years ago, the department changed the level of funding between the states to level out the discrepancies. All it actually achieved . was to reduce funding to its lowest common denominator. Too many good nursing homes are now poorly funded and are unable to offer crucial paramedical services, such as physio.. therapy and craft activities, which contribute so significantly to residents' well-being. The 'situation will only worsen with time. It is astounding that it has deteriorated so far without the department acting upon it. It had time to see that a crisis. in aged care was inevitable. In its refusal to provide more nursing home and hostel beds, it has caused difficulty to many elderly citizens and their families and unnecessary cost to the Department of Veterans' Affairs and has encroached upon the' funding and the function of state health commissions. Bowen, Detective Sergeant G.",107
140,Mr FILING,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise with sadness and regret this evening at the terrible murder yesterd,ay of . Detective Sergeant Geoff' Bowen, a . former colleague of help mine in the Criminal Investigation Branch of the Western Australian police force. I pass on my sincerest regrets to his wife, Jane, and his sons, Matthew and Simon, and to his brother, Simon, with whom I did work. I did not know Geoff very well, but I certainly worked very closely with his brother, Simon. It was a terrible murder yesterday. It was a direct attack on the law, the state and the justice system. Detective Sergeant Geoff Bowen was a brave, conscientious police officer. He was intelligent, resourceful and a dedicated member of the Western Australian police force. In the words of the officer in charge of drug operations in the Western Australian police force, Superintendent Bob Bowers, he was an outsblnding officer ai1d a person marked out for a bright career. I have no doubt about that. He was' resourceful, as. I mentioned, showed initiative and was certainly somebody who was going to go far in the field of police investigation. His time with the NCA, since June 1992, was also marked with outstanding successes. I know that my colleague the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) wantsto make some comments in relation to Peter Wallis, the solicitor who was working with the NCA and who was injured in the same bomb attack. All I can say is that this is an awful reminder to us all of the terrible danger under which police officers,' investigators and those associated with the, criminal justice system work. It is a reminder of that danger and perhaps also a remJnder of how serious a threat organised criminal activity is to this country. It is an insidious threat, and one that has obviously led to a bomb a:ttack against the National Crime Authority resulting, of course, in the murder of Detective Sergeant' Geoff . Bowen. This 'will go; down as one of Australia's most heinous murders because of the circumstanceS. lhave always supported the return of the death penalty. In the circumstances under which this terrible crime has been committed, it is time that we look at restoring the death penalty in cases of wilful murder of law officers ,and those associated with the justice system. I say at this terrible time that I pass on my deepest regrets to Jane, Matthew and Simon and the rest of the family on the terrible murder of Detective Sergeant Geoff Bowen. ",109

145,Mr NUGENT,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services, and the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 16 November 1993: (1) What direct monetary assistance or benefit is . available on an individual basis to Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders under programs operating within the Minister's portfolio. (2) Which forms of assistance or benefits are not means tested. (3) How many persons received each form of assistance or benefit in 1992-93. . Mr HOWE - As indicated above, the honourable member has asked identical questions of both ministers. The following answer is provided on behalf of both ministers: Medicare and Pharmaceutical Benefits (I) Medicare and Pharmaceutical Benefits. are available to Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders on the same basis as for all eligible' residents of Australia. (2) Medicare Benefits are not means tested. Although access to Pharmaceutical Benefits is universal, Social Security concessional cardholders contribute less to the cost of their medicines through a lower copayment and safety net threshold than non-cardholders. (3) As Medicare and Pharmaceutical Benefits claims and benefits documentation does not include information on whether claimants are Aboriginals or Torres Strait Islanders, it is not possible to state how many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people received them. Dental Care (1)-(3) The Commonwealth penta I Health Program will not make any specific provision' for dental services to Aboriginals and Torres' Strait Islanders. Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders will, however, be able to access dental services under the program, providing they are.a health card holder. Domiciliary Nursing Care Benefit (1) The Domiciliary Nursing Care. Benefit means tested (DNCB) is a tax-free payment of $52 per fortnight payable to carers who provide, at home, continuing nursing care to a chronically ill or disabled aged relative or friend who would otherwise be eligible for admission to a nursing home. (2) The DNCB is not means tested. (3) No information is available Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people receiving DNCB as collection of tJtis data is compulsory and relies on self-identification. Emergency Relief Program (I) The Emergency Relief (ER) program provides one-off financial assistance to people in crisis. Assistance is provided in the form of cash grants, food vouchers, or paying of bills on behalf of client. 8% of the total ER allocation is set aside to assist Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. However, they may also access otherER funds which are distributed through mainstream agencies. ER funding for 1992-93 totalled $20.35 million, including an additional $2 million from the One Nation initiative. $1.47 million of ed to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander component of the program. (2) ER assistance is not means tested, although the community organisations which distribute the funds use criteria to target the funds appropriately. (3) Data on client numbers is not available. Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service (CRS) (1) Clients of the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service (CRS) undertaking vocational training programs who are also Social Security beneficiaries are entitled to a Training Allowance. For those whose training is on-the-job with an employer rate is $46.35 full time and $23.20 part time per week. If they are attending a college or university studying a formal course the rate is $30 per week full time and $20 part time. Clients in receipt compensation payments are generally not paid that allowances. Other forms of assistance provided to clients include an allowance for books and equipment required for the course being studied and include: assistance with transport costs related to the program. The book and equipment allowance per year is: Full time TAFE course-$3oo Part time TAFE course-up to $200 Full time university-$5oo Part time university-pro rata on subjects Course at private institution-up to $500 (2) Monetary assistance offered by CRS is not (3) In 1992-93 a total of 384 indigenous people commenced rehabilitation programs and 581. were provided with programs during that period (some would have commenced their program before the 1992-93 period). In 1992-93,43 indigenous people received the training allowances mentioned in (1). on the number of Childcare Assistance (1) Childcare Assistance (formerly called fee not relief) is a Commonwealth Government subsidy to help Australian families, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families, meet the cost of child care fees. Eligibility for Childcare Assistance is based on family income. The maximum level of Childcare Assistance is $92.50 a week for one child the in care (rising to $94 on 1 April 1994). While Childcare Assistance benefits families, it is not paicl directly to them; instead it is paid to approved child care services to enable them to reduce the fees they charge eligible families for child care. (2) Childcare Assistance is means tested in all approved child care services except Multifunctional Aboriginal Children's Services (MACS). In MACS services, all families receive the maximum level of this was allocatChildcare Assistance. (3) It is estimated that, as at30 June 1993, there were some 272,000 children attending child care services which were in receipt of Childcare Assistance. Of these children, it is estimated that between one and two per cent were from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families. Western Airlines (Question No. 628) Mr Sharp asked the Minister for Transport, the upon notice, on 22 November 1993: (I) Is it a fact that the senior flying. operations inspector and airworthiness inspectors at Wagga - Wagga, NSW, wrote to the regional manager of the of Civil Aviation Authority in Sydney recommending Western Airlines lose its air operator's certificate because of a number of significant deficiencies all CRS which had existed over a long period. (2) Did the deficiencies referred to in part (1) (a) failure to employ an adequate number of qualified maintenance staff; . (b) employment of an unlicensed chief engineer who was thereby unable to sign out aircraft after having maintenance carried out on them; (c) employment of qualified maintenance staff number of solely on a part-time basis; (d) consistent identification during surveillance audits of the inadequate keeping of operational and airworthiness records as required by Civil Aviation Regulations; (e) aircraft components, including engines, exceeding time in service or overhaul periods; (t) failure to meet pilot check and training requirements under the Civil Aviation Regulations; (g) major oil leaks and losses from aircraft engines exceeding manufacturers' limits; (h) failure to follow the procedures speCified in the air operations certification manual including the responsibility of the maintenance controller; and (i) aircraft defects such as elevators and stabilissystem ers entangled in VHF radio antennae. (3) Has the senior flying operations inspector referred to in part (1) been transferred from Wagga Wagga since raising the matter. (4) When was the reCommendation referred to in part (1) made and what was its outcome..",113
146,Mr BRERETON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (4) No. The Civil Aviation Authority's (CAA) Directorate of Aviation Safety Regulation South East Regional Office in Sydney did not receive a written recommendation from either the senior flying operations inspector (District Flying Operations Manager) or airworthiness inspectors at the Wagga District Office to suspend or cancel the Air Operator Certificate held by Western Airlines. However, there were concerns held about the Western Airlines operations, and a review of that airline's operating practices, standards and procedures was in train when the company voluntarily ceased its airline operations. (2) I refer to the response given to parts (l) and (4). However, I can advise that the Wagga District Office had, in fact,. identified some maintenance and flight operations deficiencies within Western Airlines, including those addressed below. The deficiencies were dealt with by the Wagga District Office. (a) During audits of Western Airlines, the Wagga District Office noted that while the airline's staff levels were minimal, it was capable of performing the normal maintenance requirements, albeit with overtime. This is the prerogative of the operator and does not breach any Civil Aviation regulatory requirement. However, the Wagga District Office continued to monitor the airline's staffing levels. (b) The ""chief engineer"" is an industry position which is not recognised in the CAA's legislative regime, nor is it necessary to have such a position to meet any current CAA legislative requirements. The CAA's regulatory requirements were met by the airline through its having an. appropriately Licensed Aircraft Maintenance Engineer (LAME) certify for aircraft maintenance. The LAME does not necessarily have to be the airline's ""chief engineer"", however, Western Airlines' chief engineer was a LAME. (c) There is no problem with qualified maintenance staff being employed on a part time basis, as long as there is an appropriately licensed Aircraft Maintenance Engineer available to certify the maintenance carried out on aircraft being employed at the time when the maintenance is being performed. This was the situation during the final period at Western Airlines. (d) Western Airlines had in place a computerised of keeping airworthiness records in accordance with the Civil Aviation Regulations. The Wagga District Office only encountered one instance where it was unable to access the airline's maintenance records, due to the unavailability of airline staff. (The Maintenance Controller was not available and the Deputy could not access the system). There were concerns by the Wagga District Office that some flights had occurred which were not recorded by Western Airlines. Investigations were conducted in relation to the airline's administration, and the deficiencies· identified by the· District Office were brought to the attention of the airline. Western Airlines took appropriate corrective actions. (e) The Wagga District Office had tried to assist Western Airlines to set up a nfe development program (DA288 program). However the airline was unable to meet the administrative requirements of such a system, which was subsequently terminat. ed by the District Office at the request of the airline. After the program ceased, the District Office was not aware of any breaches by the airline in respect of time life limitation on its aircraft components. (t) In respect of flight operations matters, the areas of concern related mainly to the recording of flight times. As far as the CAA were aware, the check and training requirements were being met. (g) During a ramp check by the Wagga District Office, it was noticed that an aircraft had an oil leak which it was suspected was excessive. This was brought to the notice of Western Airlines maintenance staff, who rectified the leak under the normal maintenance requirements. (h) Civil Aviation Regulation 42ZV and Schedule 9 of the Regulations details the requirements for maintenance controllers. Western Airline's Maintenance Controller had been accepted by the CAA as meeting the legislative requirements, and there was no evidence from any of the CAA's surveillance checks to indicate that he was not controlling the maintenance in accordance with the regulatory requirements. (i) One of Western Airlines' aircraft's VHF antenna (cable type) broke, and the cable became entangled in the empennage (the forward-facing front edge. of the engine air intake) .. This was subsequently fixed under the normal maintenance control of the airline. This could have cauSed a risk to the safety of the aircraft, but did not in this instance. (3) Following an industry complaint, the CAA conducted two internal investigations, one by"" the South East Regional Flying Operations Manager, and another independent one' by the North' East Region's Administration Manager. The North East Region Administration Manager concluded from his review that the relationship between the Regional Flying Operations Manager and the District Flying Operations Manager at Wagga had reached the stage where it was affecting the efficient operation of the Region. Agre,ement was subsequeptly reached with the Wagga District Flying Operations Manager. that he transfer to the Directorate of Aviation Safety Regulation's central office in Canberra. Airport F-ne Foods (Question No. 756) Mr Jull asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 16 December 1993: ' (1) Does the Federal Airports Corporation's (FAC) report for 1992-93 record a sum of $227,000 as its share of the losses attributable to Airport Foods. . (2) What outcome has the FAC budgetedforin respect of Airport Fine Foods in 1993-94. (3) When did the FAC or its board last review the finan-ial performance of Airport, Fine Foods. (4) Has the board expressed doubts about the FAC's continued participation in Airport Fine Foods; (5) Will the FAG's participation be reconsidered if Airport Fine Foods does not return. a profit in 1993-94. .. . .",115
147,Mr BRERETON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The ariswer to the' honourable member-s' question is as follows:  reports an amount of $251,000 as the Corporation's share· of losses attributable to Airport Fine Foods. Due to a clerical error within the 'FAC, the figure of $227,000 was inadvertently provided in answer to question 401 (Hansard 18 November 1993, page 3249). (2) A profit has been budgeted for 1993-94. (3) In December 1993. (4) The Board regularly reviews FAC participation in Airport Fine Foods and will continue to do so. (5) The Corporation's continued participation .in the venture is ultimately dependent on the profitability of the venture and is subject to regular review by the Corporation. Flight Security (Question No. 762) Mr Newell asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 16 December 1993: (1) Are all (a) international and (b) domestic regular public transport flights from and within Australia required to observe flight security in accordance with the Air Navigation Regulations. .(2) What criteria must be met in collating the pasSengers boarded with flight baggage on (a) intef!lational and (b) domestic flights. (3) Does the counting of empty seats meet the criteria referred to in part (2). . (4) What procedures are followed on (a) internatiomil and (b) domestic flightS when a prospective passenger' (i) fails to board or (ii) leaves a flight before it departs. . (5) Did Flight EW901 from the Gold Coast on 30 October 1993 satisfy the security requirements in respect of (a) matching passengers with baggage and (b) a passenger not accompanying his or her baggage on the flight.",116
148,Mr BRERETON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourFine able member's question is as follows: (1) (a) & (b) Yes (2) (a) & (b) For international and domestic flights usirig an aircraft configured to seat 38 or more passengers, a person who has purchased a ticket and checked in baggage must travel on the aircraft on which they are ticketed. If they fail to board, or leave the flight, their checked baggage must be removed from the aircraft unless the circumstances match any of the exemptions provisions in the legislation. (3) The counting of empty seats is a procedure which may form part of the overall reconciliation system used by the airline. This procedure would have to be combined with other procedures to meet the criteria referred to in part (2). (4) (a) & (b) When aprospective passenger fails to board or leaves a flight before it departs, the airline is required to' assess the circumstances against a set of criterillcontajned in the Air Navigation Regulation and company procedural manuals. As a result of this assessment, the airline will decide whether the bag should be removed orifit can safely be carried on the flight. , (5) (a) & (b) J am informed that on 30 October 1993, a passenger disembarked flight EW901 in Coolangatta prior to its departure. This disembarkation was caused by the passenger's fear of flying. The airline waS fully aware of the circumstances of the passenger's disembarkati-n and this was tak.en into account when matchIng passengers wIth baggage. Department of Primary Industries and Energy: Fraud Cases (Question No. 805) MrHawker asked the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 17 December 1993: (1) How many cases of fraud did the government uncover in the Department or any agency for which the Minister has portfolio responsibility in (a) 1991, (b) 1992 and (c) 1993.

(5) How many persons in the Minister's Department or in agencies for which the Minister has portfolio responsibility have been removed from employment for involvement in fraud. (6) Is the Minister able to say whether any person referred to in part (5) is still employed in the Australian Public Service. Mr Beddall-The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) (a) Eight cases of suspected fraud were discovered in 1991; (b) ten in 1992; and (c) six in 1993. (2) One case was successfully prosecuted. (3) (a) In 1991 the sum of $2940.00 was recovered; (b) in 1992, $1560.00 was recovered; and (c) in 1993, $8207.87 was recovered. (4) 100% was recovered. (5) Nil (6) Not applicable. Australian Quarantine and Inspection (Question No. 818) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Ener.; gy, upon notice, on 17 Decembet: 1993.;... (1) What action is the minister or the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) taking in response to an alleged breach of the minister's department's fraud guidelines in relation to Mastercard misuse and travel fraud by persons acting as senior officers in AQIS's headquarters group. (2) Have the officers been stood down while investigations are carried out; if not, why not. (3) Are the officers receiving salary entitlements. (4) What is the status of their other entitlements such as accrued leave and superannuation. . Mr Beddall-The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question; (1) The Auditor-General reported to Parliament on 31 August 1993 on an investigation of alleged travel irregularities by SES officers in AQIS.· All matters have now been finalised with the exception of the one case referred to in (2) below.· There were no alleged breaches of departmental fraud guidelines in respect of Mastercard use by senior officers in the headquarters group ofAQIS.

Mr Beddall-The, answer to the honoUrable member's question is as follows: (1)Tonnes uranium Australian oxide dollars 1983-84 3,424 318,925,400 1984-85 3,442 317,371,129 1985-86 3,224 295,916,662 1986-87 4,363 388,940,662 1987-88 4,551 411,375,613 1988-89 5,061 402,559,499 1989-90 4,812 314,794,857 1990-91 6,129 331,690,951 1991-92 4,729 244,780,357 1992-93 2,289 122,564,879 Source: Australian Bureau of Statistics (2) The only information available to my Department is based on Western world reactor requirements. These figures, listed below, do not give any indication of the available market because of uncertainty in the drawdown of inventory by utilities. It is not possible to provide an estimate of the value of the world market because of the commercial-in-confidence nature of uranium contracts and the lack of information on the proportion of requirements met by spot and long term contracts. 1983 1984 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 Source: OECD Nuclear Energy Agency/IAEA ""Red Book"" (Uranium Resources, Production and Demand) (3) The figures below are those for anticipated Australian uranium exports published by ,the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics in the Agricultural and Resources Quarterly, vol. 5, no. 4, December 1993. For the reasons given in (2) it is not possible to provide percentage figures. 1994-95 4,000 1995-96 3,000 1996-97 4,600 1997-98 4,900 1998-99 5,100 tonnes uranium oxide (4) The officially reported figures for the number of workers employed at Olympic Dam do not 42,200 differentiate between uranium, copper, silver and 44,800 gold production. Based on company advice it is estimated that there are a total of about 385 46,000 workers specifically employed on uranium related 42,800 activities at the two Australian uranium production 44,200 centres. 47,800 50,300 (5) I have assumed that the honourable member's 47,600 reference to the ""Australian stockpile of uranium 53,800 oxide"" refers to the Commonwealth uranium 55,000 stockpile that contained 2 million kilograms 56,600 (around 4.5 million pounds) of uranium oxide. The market price for uranium oxide fluctuates considerably but, if sold on the spot market at the current spot price of about US$9.60 per pound, which would put the value of the stockpile at some A$60 million on the basis of the exchange rate of US71.56 cents = A$1. (6) The sale of the Commonwealth uranium stockpile is expected to be completed by June 1995. In the 1993-94 Budget, the Government stated that it expected that a significant proportion of the stOCkpile material would be sold in the Tonnes Million current financial year. These targets are expected uranium Australian to be met but details about the parties with which (a)oxide (a)dollars the Government is dealing are confidential. In prosecuting this sale, the Government will have 209 regard to the interests of existing Australian 177 producers/exporters of uranium oxide; will seek to minimise any possible market disturbances; and 282 will, of course, conform with all existing nuclear 325 safeguards and other requirements governing the 354 export of uranium oxide by Australia.",118
