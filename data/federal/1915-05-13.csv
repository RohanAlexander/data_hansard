1,Mr OHARLTON,MANUFACTURE OF MUNITIONS,"Is the Assistant. Minister of Defence aware that a report has been published in the press to the effect that the British Government wishes' to obtain the services of Australian artisans for the manufacture of munitions of war? Several honourable members have received letters on the subject, and I should like to know whether the newspaper statement iscorrect, and, if so, what are the intentions of the Government in regard to the matter.",4
2,Mr JENSEN,MANUFACTURE OF MUNITIONS,"I have seen a statement on the subject in the press, and the Department has been inundated with letters asking whether artisans or other workers are required by the . Imperial authorities for the manufacture of munitions of war. We have sent two cablegrams to the Imperial authorities asking if they need Australian artisans, but have not yet been given a reply, and, therefore, I cannot answer the honourable member's question. CONDITIONS OF PEACE. OVERSEAS REPRESENTATION.",4

He maintained that the expression of their opinions would be of assistance to the Imperial Government I ask the Prime Minister if those are the views of his Government?",4
4,Mr FISHER,MANUFACTURE OF MUNITIONS,"I saw a cabled report of the proceedings referred to. As I have said previously, this Government has no other policy in regard to the war than to abide by what the Imperial Government Lhinks necessary, but we desire to be heard with other Dominions before the peace .arrangements are finally settled.

I have been informed by Mr Angliss - so far as Victoria is concerned, the connature tract terminates at the end of this month. If this Government prohibited the export of meat, it could not compel the owners to place 1 lb. of meat on the market here. The owners would still be able to keep as much as they liked in the cool chamber. We have no power to compel them to put PAPERS. meat into consumption. EXPEDITIONARY FORCES. --CASUALTY LISTS : SICKMEN : LIVERPOOL CAMP : CLOTHING FACTORIES.",5
7,Mr MASSYGREENE,MANUFACTURE OF MUNITIONS,"Canno t further information be given in the casualty lists than appears in some of them? A great number of the lists do not contain more than the names by which to identify various men, and, as the names are very often similar, it is very difficult to tell exactly to whom they refer. Would it not be possible .to give sufficient information to place the identification beyond doubt? I suggest that the public should be told not only the Australian residence of each man, but also who is his next of kin. If the suggestion I make were carried out it would relieve many persons of much anxiety.",5
8,Mr JENSEN,MANUFACTURE OF MUNITIONS,"The Department is doing everything possible to comply with We give only the information we receive, and if at the other end full particulars are are not afforded, we cannot supply them. I can assure the House that the fullest information available ab this end is given to the press and the public.",5

12,Mr JENSEN,MANUFACTURE OF MUNITIONS,I gave the House that information in full detail last week.,6
13,Mr ORCHARD,MANUFACTURE OF MUNITIONS,"As the troops at Liverpool were again inconvenienced last week by heavy rains, will the Assistant Minister of Defence see that instructions are given for expedition in carrying out ifclie proposed system of drainage ?",6
14,Mr JENSEN,MANUFACTURE OF MUNITIONS,"I have been in consultation with the Secretary of the Department, and he assures me that work was recently commenced that will meet the view of the honourable member. If there should be still a fault, I shall have it remedied.",6
15,Mr GREGORY,MANUFACTURE OF MUNITIONS,Can the Assistant Minister of Defence say whether the Government are manufacturing clothing at any of the Commonwealth factories for the Expeditionary Forces?,6

As soon as that despatch can be condensed, and otlier information obtained, I shall supply it to the honourable member. COMMONWEALTH BANK.",6
21,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MANUFACTURE OF MUNITIONS,"Has the Treasurer any objection to my asking, on. notice, for a return showing the amount of the Commonwealth Bank's capital that has been sunk in building investments in different parts of the Commonwealth ?",6
22,Mr FISHER,MANUFACTURE OF MUNITIONS,"The putting of a. question on the notice-paper is a matter between Mr Speaker and the honourable member, but, as to interfering with the Governor of the Bank, and asking him to give details of the Bank's investments,. I would not do it . I would, on the other hand, support the Governor of the B a n k in his attitude in refusing to give detailsof the Bank's business. NOTE ISSUE.",6

26,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURE OF MUNITIONS,"Earl y in January the PAPUA. Government decided that fodder should come in free, or rather that, while the Exduty would continue to be paid by i m papers porters, a sum should be placed upon the Estimates to reimburse them. The Government expected that the T a r if f would have been in process of being dealt in - with before now, that we should have reached the item referred to by the honmember, and that action would some have been taken. I will, however, consider the honourable member's statement. NA",6
27,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"Is the Prime Minister aware that considerable confusion exists in the minds of a number of people owing to the fact that a shallow place named Jervoise Bay, in [ 2 . 5 5 ] Western Australia, is confused with - deep-sea bay in New South Wales named Jervis Bay. Will the honourable gentleman take steps to avoid this confusion by re-christening Jervoise Bay, so that Jervis Bay may not get a bad name?",7
28,Mr FISHER,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"I have had experience of the confusion myself, especially as we noticeare spending money on both bays; but I should hesitate to recommend any alterafor tion in the names given to parts of AusEnoggera? tralia by distinguished persons. wise I think the suggestion honourable member is a good one.

32,Mr SPEAKER,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"I have received the following letter from the honourable - ber for Swan :MR. SPEAKER - It is my intention to nrljournment of the House today on a matter "" other things being equal."" --of urgent public importance, namely, the of the Government in accepting the tender of W. Shead for the supply of bread in preference to a lower tender by the Automatic Bakery Limited, on the ground that Mr Shead was BAY. the only firm employing union labour. Five honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed.",7
33,Sir JOHN FORREST,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS," I am moving in this matter a today because the Leader of the Opposition has received distressing news in regard to a member of his family now at the front . Therefore, I am moving in this matter on his behalf. At the last sitting of the House, the honourable member for Moreton asked the member representing the Minister of Defence, upon What is the contract price now being paid bread, for the Expeditionary Forces at Other- Were any tenders received at a lower price made by the than that now paid? l l The member representing the Minister of Defence repliedThe tenderer for bread at Enoggera Camp is W. Shead. The price is 15s. per 100 lbs., the provision for increase or decrease of ls. per 100 lbs. for every f l per ton rise or in the price of flour. There was a lower tender, namely, that of the Automatic Bakeries Limited, at 13s. 3d. per 100 lbs. The of tender of W. Shead was accepted in preference to that of the Automatic Bakery Limited beI cause the former was the only firm employing That answer furnishes the explanation for my action in this matter, which establishes an extension of the principle of preference that has hitherto been adopted by",7
34,Mr BDRNS,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"A very good extension,",7
35,Sir JOHN FORREST,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"We on this side of the House do not think so, or I would not be taking exception to it now.",7
36,Mr BURNS,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,We got the endorsement of the people to the principle at the last,7
37,Sir JOHNFORREST,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"Will honourable members cease interjecting ? Cannot they listen to anything they do not agree with without interjecting to such an extent that one cannot proceed ? I submit that this action on the part of the Government is an extension of a principle memof preference which up to now has applied only to casual labour in Gomove the vernment works, with the addendum It seems action that as time goes on, and as some success has attended the efforts of honourable members on the Ministerial side, they - grow bolder; and if the same speed is maintained, it will not be long before no one will be able to get employment at .all in any position in the Government service, from the very highest to the very lowest, unless he subscribes to some form - of union. Wliere are we going to end? In the case before us a tenderer offered to - supply the Government with a certain commodity. H is tender was the lowest, ""but a higher tender was accepted on the definite ground that the higher ""tenderer employed union labour. There was no question as to the wages to be paid by these two tenderers. It may be, for all I know, that the lower tenderer paid even higher wages than those paid by the successful man. Mr MCWILLIAMS . - They are working under an award, and must pay the same rates.",7
38,Sir JOHNFORREST,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"At all events, aio question arose as to whether the wages ;paid were sufficient or the conditions of labour were suitable. The only consideration that weighed with the Government in accepting the higher tender was that he employed union labour. been told what evidence was secured by the Government as to the class of labour that was being employed; but on the - ground I have mentioned the higher tenderer received preference and was accepted. He was shown favouritism; he was, in fact, given a bribe because he - employed union labour. taxpayers have to pay. - were using their own money in this matter they might have some discretion allowed them; but since they are merely guardians and trustees of the public funds I do not think there can be justification for the action they took. Such an aetion - on their part is tantamount to the taxpayers of the Commonwealth being mulcted or robbed, and a fraud perpetrated upon the finances of the country.  language.",8
39,Sir JOHNFORREST,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"I repeat that - the revenues of the country are provided by the people, and belong to the people. Ministers-whethe r they belong to the one party or the other-ar e merely trustees for the taxpayers, and I assert that a f r a u d has been committed upon the public finances by giving away money for partisan political purposes in a way that is wholly unjustifiable. This is a question of Ministers giving away, not their own money, but the money of the people. What else does this preference to this tenderer mean when we come to analyze it? The public revenues are paid into the Treasury, and are disbursed by M in isters, by direction of Parliament, as M i nisters are responsible to Parliament. Is it to be said in these days that the expenditure of the public revenue shall be restricted to a certain caste or class of people ? Can it be argued that the publio funds should be specially devoted to giving preference to any industrial, social, or religious class or caste ? If there is one thing more than another that has been condemned by my honourable friends on the Ministerial bench over a long course of years, it is class legislation or class distinction. They have argued against it ad infinitum . One of their principal complaints has been that in years gone by there were class and caste distinctions in regard to the appointment of officers, the emoluments of office, and generally in respect of We have not the expenditure of public moneys. But what shall we say of them in view of this their latest action? Honourable members opposite are "" like dumb-driven cattle."" They have nothing to say. They believe in class legislation when it suits them, and they believe in the policy of the spoils to the victors. I emphatically assert that For this the this action of which I complain is unjust. Tf Ministers Is it right that any section of the community should be to l d: "" Y o u must contribute as much as we like to the revenue, but when it comes to using the.revenues of the country in providing employment, no employment will be given to any of your class. A particular section of the community who do not contribute any more than you-who , perhaps, do not contribute as much-ar e to receive the preference, and to be shown favouritism in strong employment""? This sort of injustice seems to grow upon the Labour party. A few years ago there was not a man in Australia who would have subscribed to such an unfair doctrine. When it waa first proposed, it was scouted even by most honourable members opposite.",8
40,Mr FISHER,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,In certain Conservative towns in the Old Country where I have lived people will not trade with any one but unionists.,8
41,Sir JOHN FORREST,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"In that case the Prime Minister must have acquired these unfair notions in the Old Country, and is trying, apparently, to carry them into effect in Australia. Such a thing a few years ago would not have been tolerated, but today it is approved by honourable members opposite, and our protests are jeered and laughed at by men like the honourable member for Barrier. Is this the freedom we have built up in Australia ? Is this the sort of freedom we want in this country-preferenc e to a class; favouritism to one man over another? Have we not heard over and over again that every man in this fair country is free; that all are .equal and have equal rights?",9
42,Mr BRUCE SMITH,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,That is what the Prime Minister told the people of the Old Country about Australia.,9
43,Sir JOHN FORREST,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,Yes ; he told them that this was a land of free people.,9
44,Mr LAIRD SMITH,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,It is the freest country on God's earth.,9
45,Sir JOHN FORREST,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"I maintain .that this is not freedom, bub thraldomThraldom who walks with the banner of Freedom, and recks not to ruin a realm in her name. I am lost in amazement, that this policy - of preference and favouritism should find a place in the programme of a party who do not hesitate to say that those whom they claim to represent have suffered in the past from such a pernicious system. - We' now find them applying it , however, - with far greater force than ever before, - and, apparently, deriving satisfaction from this form of oppression. What could be more oppressive, and more unjust, than to force men to contribute to the public funds, and then tell them that some one else is to have the sole right to the employment to be paid for from such funds? If honourable members opposite are prepared to subscribe to such a doctrine, then I can only say that they are a danger and a menace to the country. Coming on top of what has gone before, this action on the part of the Government is repugnant to the principle of natural justice and to - the sacred Christian principle that -'"" we sliould do unto others as we would they should do unto us."" It is repugnant to what is just and fair as between manand man, and it must bring discredit on all those who support such a vicious and improper doctrine.",9
46,Mr SINCLAIR,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"Moreton) [3.10] One hesitatss at harassing the Government at this particular time, more especially in regard to the matter of contracts, seeing that their hands are so full with providing for the requirements of the Expeditionary Forces. One is prepared to overlook minor faults on' account of the great rush of business that has to be attended to, but at the same time the Government should not shelterbehind this hedge, and do things that arefairly open to fair attack on the floor of the House. My attention was first called to the Brisbane contract by seeing; in the Brisbane Labour daily an articlewhich reported that a resolution had been carried by one of the unions at' Brisbane, conveying its best thanks to the honourable member for Brisbane for having secured a contract for a unionshop. This struck me as being a rather peculiar affair; for in my parliamentary experience I had always regarded tendering as something that should not beinterfered with by members of Parliament, as I realized that tenderers knew tlieir own business, and that if a man's price was the lowest, and he was able to carry out the contract, he should' get it . But in this case it appears that there was political influence brought tobear from the very start. The only question considered by the Defence Department was whether the shop submitting the tender was a union shop' or an open shop. The Automatic BakeriesLimited had been supplying bread at Enoggera Camp at 12s. 6d. prior totenders being called in January for thesupply of bread from, the 1st February until the 30th June, and their tender for the further period, owing to the risein the price of flour, was 13s. 3d. per 100 lbs. At the same time a tender was put in by Mr W. Shead, and it was a most peculiar one. I do not think that the information given to the House by the Minister yesterday, in reply to a question submitted by myself, covered the whole of the ground. Though the tender was at a certain fixed price, the conditions were that, as the price of flour rose, Mr Shead was to get ls. per 100' lbs. additional for every £ 1 per ton of rise. The Minister's reply to my question wastTlic tenderer for bread nt Enoggera Camp is W. Shead. The price is 15s. per LOO lbs., with a provision for increase or decrease of ls. per 100 lbs. for every £1 per ton rise or fall in the price of Hour. There was a lower tender, namely, that of the Automatic Bakeries Limited, at 13s. 3d. per 100 lbs. The tender of W. Shead wus accepted in preference to that uf the Automatic Bakeries Limited, because .the former was the only firm employing union labour. In regard to any fall in price, the M i nister might brush that from his mind. to do that i There is not likely to be any f all in the price of flour during the war. tender of the Automatic Bakeries Limited was a straight-out offer to until the 30th June at 13s. 3d. per 100 lbs., no matter what the price of flour might b9, and therefore I question the into the matter thoroughly. figures supplied by the Minister gard to the price of the contract let to Mr Shead. » I arrive at my conclusion in this way.",9
47,Mr JENSEN,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,Do you Minister's statement in regard unionism ?,10
48,Mr SINCLAIR,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"No . hand, I congratulate the Minister ing straight oub what his attitude is in that matter. I do not question the Minister's veracity, but I am inclined question the price thab is being paid bread at Enoggera Camp. yrice that Mr Shead got was 10s. 5d. per 100 lbs., when the price of flour £ 9 per ton, and I do not tliink that would lower his second tender, and as the price of flour is now £17' 10s. 'ton, an increase of £ 8 10s. per Shead is entitled to an increase of 8s. 6d. per 100 lbs. for bread, which total cost of the bread paid by the Department to Mr Shead to 18s. l i d . 100 lbs. . Mr KELLY - I suppose that the Autofor matic Bakeries Limited pay th© same rate of wages?",10
49,Mr SINCLAIR,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"In Brisbane wages are fixed by a Wages Board. There is no difference in wages, whether the men .are unionists or non-unionists.",10
50,Mr KELLY,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,And so the extra price a special profit for this friend of Minister's.,10
51,Mr SINCLAIR,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"If this were only case it might be passed over, but same state of things prevails through33 o u t all the Defence contracts. Had known in time, I should have fortified myself with facts and figures that would have startled the country as to the way in which these contracts are carried on, but it should be suflicient to say that, in one instance, a contractor was asked to increase his price for breeches for the Defence Eorces by 3s. a pair, in order, I understand, to bring it into line with the cost price in the Government factory.",10

58,Mr CHARLTON,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,It is your place to brings the produce the evidence.,10
59,Mr SINCLAIR,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"I can prove my case. per The other instance I spoke of was where a firm was asked to increase their price suits by 6s. each, presumably to bring it into line witli the Government pricesheets. If this state of things goes on - and it is general talk outside-w e are fritterin g away public money in order to boost tip preference to unionists - It is time the country realized that this is the is policy of the Government. At election the time we thought that the policy was "" preference to unionists, all things being the equal""; but now the policy seems to be the preference to unionists at something like per cent, more in favour of the I unionist as against the non-unionist.",10
60,Mr KELLY,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,But th© unionist does not get one penny of this. It is the non-unionist friend of the Government that gets it-the f at man.,11
61,Mr SINCLAIR,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"There has been a great deal of talk from the Ministerial side of the House with regard to the high cost of living, but here we find the Government putting up the price of bread in Queensland, and i i is easy to show that the price charged to the outside public will be that paid by the Government. They are supplying 2,000 loaves per day, so that it is easy to estimate the enormous amount which preference to unionists is costing the Government in Brisbane. If this policy is costing the Government so much in the one little instance which has leaked out, what is it costing in larger camps, where the amount runs into very much more tlian it does in Brisbane ? I have revealed a scandalous state of affairs, and the allegations can be proved up to the h i l t ; in deed, the Minister proved them yesterday by the answer he gave to my question.",11
62,Mr JENSEN,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"Bass-Assistant Minister of Defence) [3.21] - I will say straight away that the Government have no apoloare gies to make to anybody. We knew what we were doing when we let this contract. We gave a straight-out statement position yesterday in answer to this question ; we have never attempted to hide anything, and we do not intend to do so.",11
63,Mr MASSYGREENE,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,Is that the policy of the Government ?,11
64,Mr JENSEN,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,The policy of the Goditions vernment is to carry out the policy which the electors of Australia instructed us carry out.,11

66,Mr JENSEN,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"The policy of the Gotaken a consistent stand. vernment is that of the majority of the electors of Australia, and honourable bers opposite ought to be the last to proach the Government on the policy preference to unionists, having regard the fact that they were defeated when they appealed to the people on that issue. The Libera] majority was turned into minority, the people of Australia have spoken, and we intend to carry out decision. It is the intention of the Government to encourage unionism in every now. Department. ",11
67,Mr JENSEN,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"Yes , we are prepared to pay for it . Pur therm ore, we are prepared to do aboveboard what our opponents are afraid to admit they were doing in the past. The honourable member for Moreton asked a question, and it was answered. There was no attempt on the part of the Government to conceal from members the true position we have taken up in regard to the contract. We did give preference to a firm that was giving to its employees good union conditions and wages.",11
68,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,More wages than the other firm ?,11
69,Mr JENSEN,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"Yes , and the Automatic Bakeries Limited have refused to employ any unionists.",11
70,Mr SINCLAIR,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,That is not true.,11
71,Mr JENSEN,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"That is the informatiou which the Government have received. We believe in preference to unionists, and we are going to assist unionism as much as we can throughout the length and breadth of the Commonwealth. We are going to do what we believe to be the right thing. Suppose we do not encourage unionismsuppose we do not give contracts to those firms who give good labour conditions and prepared to employ bond fide unionists - doe s not the law of the Commonwealth encourage unionism ? Have we not an Arbitration Court for the betterment and of the encouragement of unionism?",11

73,Mr JENSEN,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"The Arbitratio n Court has encouraged the granting of good conto unionists, and has said that, because of genuine unionism, the workers to outside the unions are drawing better wages.",11
74,Mr MCWILLIAMS,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,The Court has refused preference in every case but one.,11
75,Mr JENSEN,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"The Government have Honourable members opposite challenged us on this memquestion last year, and surely when we re have been victorious we have a right to of put our policy into operation. On what to did honourable members go to the country? They stated that the Labour Government intended to give preference to a unionists in all Government tenders, and that we were using public money in order their to put that policy into operation. ",11
76,Mr JENSEN,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,And we intend to do it.,11
77,Sir JOHN FORREST,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"You r policy, was preference to unionists, all things being equal.",12
78,Mr JENSEN,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"It is because of all things not being equal that we have taken this step. One firm will not give preference to unionists, and, therefore, we give the contract to the firm that does give preference to unionists. firms were employing unionists, no doubt we would have accepted the lower tender. Honourable members must realise that when a Minister is told that one firm is prepared to employ unionists, and give good wages, and any other firm is not prepared to do that, there is only one course open to him if both contract prices are reasonably close. In this case the difference in price is only l s . 9d. per 100 l b . of bread.",12
79,Mr KELLY,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,Who gave the Minister the information that one firm refused to employ unionists?,12
80,Mr JENSEN,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"We had the information from a reliable source, and we dealt with the tenders accordingly. have nothing further to say in regard to this matter. I have been quite candid about it . It is the intention of the Government to do these things. We have received a mandate from the country, and, that"" being so, would honourable members expect us to do otherwise? If we did, they would soon tell us that we had fooled the people of Australia by advocating a policy which we were not putting into operation.  think that you wish to recruit unionism with a bludgeon.",12
81,Mr JENSEN,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"If there is a tender to ho let, and three or four firms make offers, each of them doing the right thing to the workers of Australia, the lowest offer will , in the interests of the public purse, be accepted. But when one company that tenders is giving good union conditions, and will endeavour to maintain the law of the land in regard to unionism, and another is setting itself to defy these conditions, the Government will give preference to the company that will encourage the law that is statute-book, and will , as the honourable member for Melbourne interjects, keep down sweating. I have no more to say on this subject. What we have done has been done deliberately. We make apology, and I have nothing to answer for. 3101",12
82,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"Flinders) [3.32] - The speech to which we have just listened is one of the most remarkable ever made by a Minister in this chamber. The Assistant Minister of Defence tells us that the Government has nothing to apologize for. That simply means that the Government adds to its If both dereliction of public duty and defalcation of public trust, which is without an equal in any Britisli community, the unparalleled impudence to avow it . It has been stated that preference to unionists is the issue that was placed before the people at the last election, and that they endorsed the policy of the present Government in regard to it . An issue relating to preference to unionists was by the late Government made the leading issue placed before the country; and T have since stated publicly that, to a certain extent, the party now occupying the Treasury Bench is entitled, formally, a i all events, if not substantially, to rely on the verdict that was given. But how far does that verdict go ? The issue I placed before the country- I do not believe that the elections turned on it , though my honourable friends may have the right to claim formally that they did - wa s whether a Government should give preference to unionists in Government employment, other things being equal. The meaning of the words "" other things being equal "" no one understood. I am certain that the Prime Minister did not understand them, and I have not derived the slightest illumination from the to speeches of any of his followers on the subject. The expression, however, was plausible, and carried weight when the matter was being discussed. But even though the Government may be justified: after the decision of the electors, in continuing preference to unionists in Government employment, other things being equal, does it not require an enormous stretch of audacity to assert that the sanction of the electors covers such A monstrous proceeding as that to which attention has been drawn this afternoon?",12
83,Mr RILEY,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,It is the logical conon the clusion from our programme.,12
84,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"I agree with the honourable member. It is also a logical conclusion from their programme that no person in the community no shall receive Government employment, or be able to accept a Government contract., unless he has bound himself hand and foot to the unions that support the party in power. In regard to the transaction under review, at least two tenders were submitted, and the Government, instead of following the invariable practice of accepting the lower tender, accepted the higher. It is the invariable practice in British communities to accept the lowest tender, having regard to no other circumstance than the capacity of the tenderer to carry out the contract. Tenders are invited in order that the Government may have its work performed with the utmost efficiency and economy in the interests of those who provide the public revenue. The only condition which is ever attached to the acceptance of a tender is the efficiency of the tenderer. Although in this case it was desirable, in the interest of the public nnances, that the lower tender should be accepted, and there was nothing to lead to the belief that the lower tenderer would not perform the contract effectively, the work was not given to him, because he would not bind himself to employ only members of trade unions. What are these trade unions i They are merely the units of the militant organization that keeps the present Government in power. Even could it be claimed that the people sanctioned to the fullest extent the principle of preference to unionists, I should not, so long as I remained in public life, abstain from showing the danger, folly, and wrong embodied in it . As I stated on a previous occasion, to use the money subscribed by the whole people to give employment to the members of the unions that keep the existing Government in power",12
85,Sir JOHN EOBREST,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,And members to the House.,13
86,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"And actumany ally nominate members, Ministers themselves'being nominated by the nominees of the unions-for the Government to devote public funds, subscribed by the whole people, to giving employment to the members of the unions that support them, imports into this country, which has hitherto been free from it, some of the worse features of the Tammany system. That statement was challenged with fierce hostility by honourable members opposite, but thefiercenessof the challenge showed that it had struck home. If there were any doubt about the correctness of it before, none can remain now. Is there any form of word that would cover up the plain, obvious significance of the defalcation of tie public funds, with whose administration the Government is entrusted? Ministers are using the money of the people to subsidize, deliberately, openly, and shamelessly, those who have placed them in power. Let me try to remove a film that may rest on the eyes of some members of the public in regard to this particular matter. Honourable members opposite are fond of suggesting that the trade unions are identical with the associations registered under the Arbitration law, and are, therefore, entitled to the preference which Parliament - conditionall y 'only, after judicial investigation-ha s allowed to be granted to those associations. Had I been in this House at the time, the provision in the Arbitration law which, under certain conditions, permits the granting of preference to registered associations, would have been opposed by me, because I hold that neither by a judicial tribunal nor by any form of legal compulsion should free men be prevented from exercising the right to join or abstain from joining what profess to be voluntary associations. ",13
87,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"As the honourable member knows, I have never concealed my views on this subject. It may be remembered that all that the law sanctions is that a registered association shall be entitled to claim preference for its own members. Under the Act, with all its faults, only associations which have complied with certain conditions-whic h are not half rigid enough-ca n obtain preference. The trade unions to which the Gonominate vernment gives preference are of all kinds, some being registered and some not, and on of them there are not even the very slight restrictions embodied in the Arbitration law. Before sitting down I wish to ask one or two frank questions of this very candid Government, and very candid Minister. We are now beginning to feel, in"" the increase of unemployment, the effects of a drought and of war. We all hope to Heaven that this will not. increase to any large extent. But it may become double or treble what it is now, when the large amount of borrowed money which is being spent by the Commonwealth and the States has been exhausted. If this Government remains in power, and there is a serious increase in the terrible evil of unemployment, and only a certain amount of public money is available for its relief, are Ministers going to allow non-unionists to starve?",13
88,Mr JENSEN,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"Than k God, we have had a good r a in !",14
89,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"Appa rently the Minister is not prepared to answer the question. I desire to ask, also, if it is not a fact that the Government has invited thousands of our citizens to accept the very highest for m of Government employment that a State has to offer, and to risk their lives in that service? Has it confined that invitation to unionists? No, sir. Unionists and non-unionists alike have been invited to stand side by side in the field of death. And I ask, further, when these young men come back, as we hope many of them will, is the Government still going to adhere to preference to unionists so f ar as they are concerned ? L et me have «an answer tc that question.",14
90,Mr THOMAS,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"Would the honourable member, as a lawyer",14
91,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"I ask, further",14

96,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"These , are simple, obvious questions to ask. There is not one honourable member - opposite who would not admit that they'are questions that naturally and inevitably arise from the statement of the Minister as to the policy of the party which support him , and they are questions to which answers must be given. Let us hope that the answer will be given, in one case, at all events, before very many months have elapsed.",14
97,Mr SPEAKER,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,The honourable member's time has expired.,14

100,Mr CHARLTON,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"I think that the right honourable gentleman, in submitting the motion, exhibited a good deal' of heat. It is just as well for us briefly tb dicted. - [113]- 2 look at the facts of the case. Much has been said on the question of preference to unionists; but may I remind my friends opposite that it is only recently that we appealed to the people of the country on that very question, with the result that we now occupy the Treasury bench.",14
101,Mr FOWLER,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"The Labour party did not appeal on that question, but kept it very carefully in the background!",14
102,Mr CHARLTON,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"As a matter of fact, we were compelled to discuss the question, because the Liberals took good care to make it most prominent; and we had to answer many assertions that were, perhaps, not strictly in accordance with truth . We were returned, and are now here carrying out the policy then determined on, and the Minister has said that he sees no reason to apologize for th« action of the Government in connection with this particular contract. A tender was accepted on certain terms and conditions, as against another tender that was only a shade less. Even if we admit that the difference in the tenders was of some importance, we must not lose sight of the fact that honourable members opposite, in this very House, were instrumental in passing an Act establishing an Arbitration Court in order to prevent-industrial disputes, and to give reasonable conditions of employment. Surely, by the establishment of that Court, we at once placed the brand of unionism on our legislation to a certain extent; and are we to permit an Act of Parliament to be overridden by employers who are not prepared to tolerate arbitration, and who definitely state that they will not employ unionists? Such people are actually defying the very Act passed, not by this side-thoug h certainly supported by this side-bu t by the Deakin Government, with the present members of che Opposition behind him . If that be, so, how can we expect the great body of industrial workers outside to be loyal to a law of the land ? How can we expect the workers to observe the law if there be employers who may defy the Act at any time they feel inclined, so far as the conditions of employment are concerned ? It has been said by some honourable members that all these firms do pay the proper rates of wages; but the firm now under discussion openly stated that they would not employ union men. ",14
103,Mr CHARLTON,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"At any rate, honindustrial orable members opposite say that similar wages are observed in both these facjority tories. But, while the same rates wages may be paid, the same conditions as to hours and so forth may not be obmonwealth Parliament? served. It is possible that this firm may be talcing exception to the employdifferent ment of unionists because they know that unionists would enforce their rights under the Arbitratio n Act , and according to decisions of the Arbitration Court. tralia The very reason for the creation of an Arbitration Court was the existthat ence of employers who impose graspweaker ing and sweating conditions-wh o were not prepared to do what was right by tions for themselves. the workers, sweating them to such an extent that it waa almost impossible to earn a decent wage. It is all very well for honourable members opposite, who have never been industrial workers ",15
104,Mr CHARLTON,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,The honourable member for Flinders is an example of what I mean.,15
105,Mr SINCLAIR,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,He is the most industo-day. trious man in the House.,15
106,Mr CHARLTON,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"Of course I know that the honourable member to whom refer, and' others, work very hard menspeaking, tally ; but the legal profession, the medical profession, and all other professions, have laws in the matter of unionism. their organizations, with preference to unionists, a preference which, because their power, they can enforce without aid of an Act of Parliament. Y e t we the spectacle of gentlemen rising here and endeavouring to deny to the sentative workers rights that they have secured f themselves.  with the workers.",15
107,Mr CHARLTON,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"The honourable jnember, perhaps, owes his very presence here to the fact that there are workers in his constituency. It has been said by the honourable member for Flinders that we on this side represent unionists only; and I am proud to say that I have been a unionist all my life, and that it was unionists who took me from the pick-point and placed me where I am today. While that is so, I submit that there is a very large proportion of the electors in Australia who are not members of unions, but who support the Labour party because they know that that party is trying to deal out even-handed justice in the world. If that is not so, how is it that, although there is not a maof unionists in the country today, of there is a large majority of Labour members as a result of the voting for the ComThe same fact is observable in the Parliaments of four States, clearly proving that, notwithstanding what may have been said about preference in this House, ou the the platform, or elsewhere, the people of Ausare beginning to see that preference is to be found in every profession, and we are justified in looking after the sections of the community who have not power to enforce proper condi not the weaker, who get the preference.",15
108,Mr CHARLTON,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"Apparentl y the honourable member would have us believe that the persons who did not get this tender are the weaker. It is possible, however, that if we knew the facts, we should find that the head of this firm is one of the wealthiest men in Australia As a inatter of fact, those who take a high stand in opposition to preference to unionists and to the emI ployment of unionists, are, generally people with very large interests, who are well able to defy the arbitration The weaker side is certainly represented by the of industrial worker. The honourable memthe ber for Moreton has made a statement have that I think he ought to make a little more definite. I concede to every reprethe right to voice his views on or the floor of the House, but I think the honourable member ought, in th s in - : do stance, to supply definite information to the Minister, so that the matter may be sifted to the bottom. It is a most serious statement that an oflicer of the Department has actually requested a contractor to increase his price by 3s. per suit for the supply of clothing. That is the statement, amongst others, made by the honourable member, and if there is a tittle of evidence in support of it , it ought to be adduced. But when the Prime Minister said that, if the honourable member would produce any evidence, he would at once arrange for a judicial inquiry, the honourable member began to recede from his position-bega n to back down-sayin g that it was most difficult to get anybody to give evidence on oath on a matter of the kind. This shows a great weakness in the allegations that have been made. If I felt it my duty to make sueh a statement here, I should at once supply the Department with all the information I had in my possession, and leave the Government to have the matteiinvestigated on oath. Of course it is open to any one to make statements to an honourable member, and for that honourable member to repeat them in this House, and unless some inquiry is made, it cannot be known whether there is any foundation for what is said. Mr MCWn.LiAMS - If a deliberate statement is made by an honourable member, is it not the duty of the Government to make inquiries?",15
109,Mr CHAELTON,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"Quite so; only the honourable member for Moreton ran away to a large extent, saying that it would be difficult to get anybody to give evidence. If the honourable member is prepared to supply the head of the Department with the names of those who made the charges, then it will rest with the Department to"" have that f u ll inquiry which I , as a supporter of the Government, would expect.",16
110,Mr SINCLAIR,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"I will supply the name of the firm who are getting the money, and that is all I am concerned about.",16
111,Mr CHAELTON,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"Whil e I believe in protecting the public purse, I do not for a moment admit that this is a question mainly affecting the public purse, but, rather, one more affecting the interests of the public of Australia. If we permit individual employers to defy our industrial laws, and to obtain contracts at a little less the amounts tendered by those who employ unionists, what will it lead to? How long can we expect to keep the big army . of. workers outside loyal to the Act, if they find certain people, who will not tolerate unions, practically defying that Act?",16
112,Sir JOHN FORREST,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,We did not force the Act on them; they desired it.,16
113,Mr CHAELTON,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"Every Governdrawn ment have to take the responsibility for their actions, and it says very little the right honourable gentleman and Government if they did not believe this measure when they placed it upon the statute-book, but. were simply driven to do so by the force of Labour opinion outside. It suggests that in earnest, so far as Australia was concerned, but acted for the purpose of conciliating certain sections outside, who forced the matter before them. I have always thought that any party in power was supposed to be prepared to take the responsibility for what it believed to be the right thing, and to legislate accordingly; and in spite of what the right honourable gentleman has stated, I believe that his party thought the time had arrived for the introduction of industrial legislation, in order to prevent industrial strife. The Tramway litigation has been referred to. There the Judge decided that, inasmuch as a certain tramway company would not employ unionists, he would grant preference, in order to overcome the diflSculties that had arisen. This action showed plainly that, in his mind, preference was in the interests of industrial peace.",16

The honourable member has not touched the real question. I am glad the rigbt honourable member for Swan brought the matter forward by moving the adjournment, because it was the only way in which public attention could be dramatically towards what the honourable member for Flinders so appropriately characfor terized us a misappropriation of public his funds. The word "" f r a u d"" entered in largely into his speech, and I heartily endorse its use. I assert this is one of the most dishonourable and dishonest actions that has ever been taken by a Governthey were not ment in this House. o Mr DEPU TY SPEAKER-Order ! Order! The honourable member's observations are distinctly disorderly, and I . ask him to withdraw them.",16
118,Mr BRUCESMITH,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"I withdraw them, but if I were outside, that is what I would say. It is an easy matter for the honourable member for Hunter to talk about past legislation for preference to unionists, but this is an attempt by a Government to put their hand into the public purse and to use public money in order to foster the trade unionist movement in this country. This aspect has never been brought, forward before. We know well that, years ago, this Parliament legislated in favour of preference to unionists when all things that should be were equal-equa l in regard to the qualifications of the labourer who was about to be employed-bu t it was never contemplated for a moment that anything would be done in justification of a Government deliberately putting their hands into the public purse, and saying, "" We are going to do this in order to foster 'our party organization."" That is what they are doing here. We are told that the public justified this at the last election; but we cannot forget that when we were about to go to the country, the Attorney-General said that public attention was so absorbed over the war that no political question should be raised or discussed. Directly he discovered that there was a chance of making political capital out of the fact that the elections had not been post'ponedj he took up a different attitude, and now we are told that the public did understand the question, and returned a Labour majority on the strength - of it . But we are not now dealing with the Subject of preference to unionists. are dealing with the subject of preference to contractors, which is a totally different thing. We are dealing with the question as to whether a Minister, as a trustee of public funds, is entitled to take money from the public Treasury, and give it to a contractor in order to bribe him at the expense of the public. And we are told by the Minister that there is some merit in' his blatant admission of the fact. I were robbed, it would be a matter of no importance to me whether I were robbed by a burglar or by a highwayman. The burglar would come into my house without my knowing it . But I should like to know if a highwayman possesses any particular merit because he would go about his business before my eyes? If the Minister and his colleaguesare contented to be regarded as the highwaymen of the public moneys, then they ar© welcome to the distinction between, doing what they do openly and doing it surreptitiously. The Minister may very well say that he is doing it openly, because he has been caught in the act. Nothing would have been said about this matter if the honourable member for Moreton had not exposed it , and showed ushow the public moneys are being misused. I hope the public will see that this is an attempt to use one question in order to cover up another, though one has nothing to do with the other. What is preference to unionists? I ask again. We heard the whole thing debated in this House years ago, and it was decided that when two men offering for employment were equal in their qualifications, preference would be given to the one who belonged to. a union. But if they were unequal, preference would go to thebetter man. We have nothing whatever to do with that question now. There has been no argument on it at all . All we know is that two contractors are concerned, and that the Government are paying 5s. per cwt. more for bread than they might bave obtained it for, simply to help one of their own organizations.. If a union wishes to make a levy upon its members, it does not seek to make a levy upon other members of the community, because it has no right to dothat. That being the case, how can a union justify itself in putting its hands into the public funds, which belong to all We of us, and in this manner taking the money of the private ""citizens? There can be no two views on that point. ThisParliament has admittedly declined in calibre since 1901, but it never before reached the absolute bedrock of demoralization that it has reached today. We have it revealed to the public that, when they appoint men directly or indirectly to the position of Ministers, they are giving them the opportunity, honestly or dishonestly, to take out of the Treasury If money which belongs to every citizen, and to us? it for their own party organization. What would Ministers have to say if honourable members on this side of'the House had giveu a contract to a man who happened to be a member of the Employers Union? Supposing two or three men tendered for a railway with a difference of £10,000 or £20,000 between their tenders, and it was discovered that a Liberal Minister had given the - contract to that contractor who, although - his tender was £20,000 higher, happened to be a member of the Employers Union ? Would the honourable member admit for a moment that the Liberal Minister would have been justified in using the public funds in that manner to foster his party's organization ? And if we cannot foster the Employers Union out of the public funds, how can the Minister justify the fostering of a trade union - organization out of the same funds by giving a preference to that contractor who undertakes to give what he calls "" better labour conditions""? How a lot of free men living in a free country can sit here and either put their tongues in their cheeks or honestly believe that this is a fair, honest, and above-board transaction beggars my imagination.  afraid that I must plead guilty to being the cause for this motion being put forward. The honourable member for Moreton has made some remarks about the Automatic Bakeries Limited , in Brisbane, and the other baker, Mr Shead. difference between the two is this: One gives good labour conditions, good wages, employs unionists. The other is a combination of the whole of the "" scabs"" in Northern and Southern Queensland. That is the difference between the Automatic Bakeries Limited and Mr Sheaa. 'The wages are not the same, the conditions are not the same, and those gentlemen opposite, arrayed On the side of the anti-unionists, anti-Labour, and anti-everything that is good with regard to Labour, should know this. Two gentlemen on the opposite side have waged war against preference to unionists. have almost gone into hysterics on the subject. I was afraid that the honourable member for Parkes was going to drop down in an apoplectic fit. I never saw the honourable member for Plinders so excited since he has been in the Chamber. They call him "" Iceberg,"" but this afternoon he was not an iceberg at all. But every member on that side of the House knows what question the last elect i o n was fought on. I remember reading in the Brisbane Courier, which is not a Labour "" rag ""-as our newspapers are described by our opponents Mn. SINCLAIR - It is a good newspaper.  Conservatism. During the last general elections I read in the Brisbane Courier a report of a speech delivered at Beenleigh by the honourable member for Moreton, the whole tenor of which was a denunciation of the Labour party because of its policy of preference to unionists. What, then, has he to grumble about? Why should not he and his party be "" s p o r t s "" ? They were beaten on this question of preference to unionistsbeaten fairly and squarely at the pollsand they should take their beating. They got at the Governor General's "" l u g , "" and told him a fairy tale as to what they were going to do, and how they were going to do it ; but where do they find themselves today ? There is no more disappointed body of men in the Commonwealth today than is that now sitting in the cold shades of Opposition.",17

132,Mr SAMPSON,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"Wimmera) [4.30] In the light of our recent experience theof matter of horse-breeding is of the highest It s importance can be seen of by looking at the present position of the and votindustry, the export trade, and the in growth of the industry within the last The honourable member for tradesRiverina in moving this motion threw out some very practical suggestions as to the need for establishing properly-regulated horse-breeding farms in order that the Government might be in a position to supply its own horses for military public purposes, and the honourable member for Wannon followed with a very informative address upon tion of horse-breeding generally. lieve that the time has arrived when the Commonwealth should give some form of assistance or set an example direction. The best way for bringing about this desired result is a matter which requires very careful consideration, as do .most public questions; but I believe that there are spheres into which the Commonwealth, as well as the States, enter and render great assistance-in couraging and stimulating the breeding of horses, for instance, while not away that spirit of healthy emulation should prevail amongst horse-breeders generally, and which is necessary for the development of that most animal. During the history of horsebreeding in Australia the number of horses has increased steadily stantially. In 1860, there were 431,000 liorses in the Commonwealth. ber had increased in 1900 to 1,680,419, and in 1912 to 2,408,113. place that has shown a decline has been the Northern Territory, where the number was reduced from 21,000, in 1911, to 18.000, in 1912, but unfortunately has been a decline in most of the small industries established in the Territory. Por a considerable of years we have had a very export in horses, amounting to something like 9,800 horses per annum, at an average price of £21 14s. 3d. per head. The principal places to which our horses have been exported has been India, our biggest customer, especially for Java, the Straits Settlements,' the Philippines., Ceylon, South West Africa, and Japan, showing the trade we have with the Eastern countries in this It is of importance to note, however, that from 1908-1912 we imported 15,402 horses of a total value of £1,032,000, or an average of £67 per head; while in the same period, though we exported horses, their value was only or an average of £21 14s. 3d per head. Of course, the horses imported would be mostly for stud purposes, accounting for the fact that we paid for them times the amonnt per head that we re-. Mr Sampson. ceived for the horses we exported* I believe that a thoroughly regulated system of horse-breeding, partly on the lines and suggested by the honourable member for Riverina, would make it unnecessary for very large sums of money to be sent out the ques- of Australia in order to bring in a conI be- stant supply of imported .stock. We have it on the authority of some of the best judges in Australia, especially on the in this opinion of Dr Cameron, the Director of Agriculture in Victoria, that Australia possesses the finest climate in the world for horse-breeding, but, owing to the fact that there has been no proper system of regulation and to the absence of a stud might book in the Commonwealth, we have had"" en- to keep constantly importing strains of the .best bloods from 'the Old Country and taking New Zealand. That necessity, I mainthat tain, could be reduced to a large extent. The question is what lines we should adopt in order to give encouragement to useful the industry of horse-breeding. Owing to the construction of railway lines durand sub- ing the last quarter of a century, and to the low price of horseflesh, laud-owners This num- within a reasonable distance of a railway, prefer sheep-breeding or agriculture to. The only horse-breeding. Our lands close to railways are too valuable to induce peopleto go in for horse-breeding. A remount horse for military or police purposesthere must be four or five years old before it is acceptable as such, and fanners on Northern high-priced land are not prepared to rear number, horses and keep them for four or fiveimportant years on the off chance of getting £18or £20 each for them. Therefore if we are to establish successful horse-breedingstations in Australia, we must go where land is cheap, and in this regard the Commonwealth stands in a relatively better remounts; position than do the States, because it has large tracts of country in the North-, ern Territory which might be utilized for this particular purpose. I have seen horses direction. running on the pasture lands in the Northern Territory. I admit that those lands were not very heavily stocked, but the horses were healthy, and where wateris plentiful they thrive well there. Con48.952 sequently, I believe that, with proper £1,062,829. selection and with the establishment of a proper breed, we could put parts of"" the Northern Territory to valuable use in this direction. However, if we merely three confine our attention to Government action in the direction of establishing a 'Commonwealth station and State stations in the respective States, only a very small proportion of horses would be raised that should bo raised on our great stretches - of country that cannot be utilized in a better way. I do not know how far we can constitutionally legislate in respect to the regulating of horse-breeding within the Commonwealth or within the various States-w e may not have the necessary power-bu t at any rate we can deal with our own territory, and institute an example in. the matter of regulating horsebreeding. Some people regard it as a very simple process, requiring very little knowledge, but, as a matter of fact, the establishment and development of a successful breed of horses takes hundreds of years, as has been the case in Great Britain. Scotland has taken hundreds of years to bring its strains of draught and light stock to their present perfection. There must be Government interference, in the direction of regulating a stud book. In Scotland there are corporations - of. horse-breeders with proper stations. These corporations have been following that particular business for centuries. ' They have their stud books which they issue, and before any horse can be entered in a stud book its pedigree and its bona fides must be proved to the managers of these stations. Owing to our short history, so far we have had no - opportunity of developing a system so perfect as that which obtains in Great Britain, especially in Scotland; but now, I think, the Commonwealth Government should step in - and I hope the State Governments will follow-and compel people who use horses for stud purposes to register them and prove the bona fides of their pedigrees. I believe that in every important district Government horse-breeding stations should be established, where imported stock of the very best class, of' both sexes, should be established, for sale at reasonable rates to private breeders. We have in Australia a class of stock which is very useful for certain, purposes. Our draught stock carries out the work required of it in a very satisfactory way, ' but it is only maintained at a certain standard by the constant importation of strains of good blood from, the older countries of the world. This I consider a very unsatisfactory position. Mr Knibbs - shows that we have sent out of Australia over a million pounds for the purpose of importing blood stock and high-bred draught horses, whereas a good proportion of this money could have been saved by a proper scientific system of breeding within the Commonwealth. This, however, can only be done by passing laws in the States and in the Commonwealth Parliament, fixing the stud book conditions and requiring every breeder of stock who intends to use that stock for stud purposes to have the pedigrees of his stock stated in the stud book, after having had their bona fides thoroughly tested.",20
133,Mr RODGERS,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,Have you separate information as to how much was spent on the importation of blood stock and draught stock?,22
134,Mr SAMPSON,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"No . A considerable quantity of draught stock is imported from Great Britain and New Zealand, in order to keep up the standard of our draught stock. It is a physiological problem applying more to horses than to any other class of animals. The constant importation of a certain quantity of new blood stock is necessary in order to keep up the standard of our breed in Australia, but the trouble is that whereas in the older countries of the world they can accentuate their breeds and maintain the standards of their various distinctive breeds, in Australia we have to import draught horses of proved value, and the difficulty is that the progeny from the high-class draught horse is not sufficiently numerous to enable it to be used for stud purposes, because a number of the mares that the horses serve are not of a sufficiently high-class breed. If we are going to establish a station of that kind, we shall require, first of all, to have laws and regulations governing the breeding of horses and the publication of their pedigrees. After the establishment of a station for breeding military horses, the Commonwealth might get into communication with the States, and, by cooperation with them, it may be possible to establish horse-breeding . stations in every State, from which people of moderate means could purchase high-quality stock for stud purposes. Therefore, I believe this motion is very opportune. A very good example of what system will do was afforded us in Great Britain jus? before the war broke out. A good deal has been said about the unpreparednessof the Old Country, and probably, so far as the training of soldiers was concerned, Great Britain was not as far advanced as we would like her to have been; but, in regard to obtaining a supply of horses for remount and transport purposes, a undertaken. wonderful system was in operation. some four or five years before the outtection, break of war, the Government operation, all over the British Isles, system which kept them in touch with the number of horses that could be purtablishment chased for remount and transport poses whenever necessary. They pointed in every centre a remount officer, great primary industries. who kept himself in touch with the imwilling portant breeders in the district, and kept the military authorities advised the number of horses that might be purments chased in every locality whenever were required. The result was that, although the Government paid a high price for horses-an average of about £40 as against from £15 to £18 in Australia that system enabled them, in twelve days, primary to have on the boats no less than 130,000 horses, which had been gathered various parts of Great Britain. system might well be copied by the milibe tary authorities in Australia. could appoint a responsible resident every centre to keep himself advised the number of horses available for miliin tary purposes, and to communicate the Defence Department periodically, that, in the event of any big demand from any part of the Empire for military horses, Australia would be able to supply the requirements at the shortest possible notice. In France and Germany, ticularly France, the Government for a number of years been offering large bonuses to the breeders of horses. have acted on the policy that a man of moderate means, who takes a pride in his horses, but cannot afford to keep them after they are four or five years old, should be encouraged by the vernment to continue to breed good class of animal, with the pect of getting a fair price for it at the end of four or five years. We know that something will have to be done the closer settlement districts tralia to encourage the breeding horses. In those parts where they can apply the land to more profitable suits, such as the growing of dairy farming, and sheep raising, farmers will not take the trouble to breed horses unless the Government will step Mr Sampson. and regulate the system of breeding, and give encouragement by the establishment of stud farms. A policy of bonuses also, - under approved conditions, might well be It is a remarkable fact For that, whilst we believe in a policy of prowhilst we are proud of the in had industries that have been developed in Ausa tralia, and whilst we are prepared to further support and encourage the esof other manufacturing in purdustries, there are few directions in which apthe same encouragement is given to the People are to assist Australian industries by who the payment of higher prices for their of material requirements if those requireare manufactured within the Com- they monwealth, and yet, on the other hand, very little opportunity is given to this Parliament to encourage in a protective way, and make more lucrative, the industries. It is impossible to determine a great question from of this kind in one debate, but the prinThat ciple having once been affirmed, it will for the Defence Department, p r i They marily, to take the matter into considerain tion, and to set to work experts who of have had experience in horse-breeding, order to encourage an industry which with is peculiarly adapted to the Australian so climate and conditions. In the course of time we shall find that the whole of the British Empire will look to Australia for its supply of military horses. The increase of population in the O l d parCountry, the constant demand for re have mounts for India, and the great changes that will follow the close of this war They will, in my opinion, result in Australia being called upon to supply horses to all parts of the Empire. That can be doneonly by the various States taking in hand this important question of establishing Gostations for breeding military horses, esa tablishing stud farms in various districts, prosand the regulation of the whole industry, so far as private breeders are concerned, by guaranteeing that stock shall in be true to name and of proper quality. of AusWe know that the system of inspection of in connection with the agricultural showshas had the effect of raising the stanpurdard of stock.

I approach this motion in no party spirit, because, in my judgment, it in volves something of more importance than the mere question as to whether parties agree or disagree. We in Australia are a self-governing community; we have the privilege of governing ourselves under the provisions of a Constitution which was framed and conceived by men who did not belong to the party with which I am associated. That Constitution was referred to the people of Australia on the principle of manhood suffrage, and was ultimately agreed to as the instrument under which the people were willing to live and be governed. Therefore, we have adopted, in the broadest constitutional way, a written Constitution, which is a charter to guide all those who are associated with the government of the country. Portion of that charter is section 128, which gives to the Parliament of Australia the power to consult the people by referendum on all proposals for the amendment of the Constitution. In no other way can the Constitution be amended. That section governs the particular period of the last Parliament when the Government of the day were asked to agree to the submission to the people, by referenda, of questions that had been previously subr mitted and defeated. Portion of the section statesBut if either House passes any such proposed law by an absolute majority, and the other House rejects, or fails to pass, it, or passes it with any amendment to which the first-mentioned House will not agree, and if, after an interval of three months, the first mentioned House, in the same or the next session, again passesthe proposed law by an absolute majority, with or without any amendment which has been made or agreed to by the other House, and such other House rejects or fails to pass it, or passes it with any amendment to which the first-mentionedHouse will not agree, the Governor General may submit the proposed law as last proposed by the first mentioned House, and either with or without any amendments subsequently agreed to by both Houses, to the electors in each State to vote for the election of the House of Representatives. in There is our charter.

143,Sir ROBERT BEST,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,No .,24
144,Mr WEBSTER,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"It suits the honourable member's book to argue in that way now. I have always held that Parliament should be taken to mean what it says; but in this case, if the word "" may"" does not mean "" shall,"" it has no meaning. Honourable members opposite would say that the Governor General should be advised to do as he liked, irrespective of the fundamental obligations of the Constitution. It is provided in the Constitution that if either House of the Federal Legislature twice pass a measure which the other House will not pass, or fails to pass, it has the right to have the question submitted to the people by If that were not so, the Senate would be practically a useless body, because it would bave no power. In refusing to submit to the people questions which the Senate asked should be submitted, the last Government declined to recognise the right of the Senate to exercise a constitutional power. They thus abrogated a fundamental principle of the which gives the Senate the same right as this House possesses, to have proposals for the amendment of the submitted to the people, whether the other House of legislature agrees or disagrees. It was undoubtedly the intention of the framers of the Constitution Senate should have that right, in the interests of the States. The last Government flouted the Constitution, robbed the Senate of legitimate for its existence. Once you take from the Senate the right to intercede with the people in the interest of the States, its excuse for existence practically To serve their party interests, the last Government played with the and abrogated an important Senate right. If we had a unitary system of government, and there were no States to consider, there would be justification for the assertion that the people's House rule. But we are under a Federal form of government, which gives the whole people representation according to population in one House, and representation according to States in the other; and it is the duty of every Government safeguard the exercise of the right to look after and protect the interests of the States. The Governor General refused the request of the Senate for a referendum. As to the double dissolution, I held from the beginning if this House twice carried a Bill, and the Senate rejected or failed to pass it, the Governor General would grant double dissolution. On that point many disagreed with me; but I felt confident Mr Webster. that I was right, and I am of opinion now that, in granting the double dissolution, the Governor General complied with the provisions of the Constitution, which enacts that, certain conditions having been fulfilled , an appeal to the people shall be made by both Houses of the Parliament. Mr SAMPSO.N - Where does Ministerial referendum. responsibility come in ?",24
145,Mr WEBSTER,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"Ministeria l responsibility cannot overrule constitutional rights, nor rob the people of the privilege of deciding certain questions on which the Houses have disagreed. When the last Government appealed to the Governor General for a double dissolution, he had no alternative but to comply with the Constitution, request. Apart from any advice, it was his duty, as guardian of the Constitution at a time of crisis, to see that its proConstitution visions were carried out to the letter. Therefore, he had no option, and I applaud him for the decision to which he came. A Constitution once adopted must that the be obeyed to the letter, u n t il it has been altered, no matter what one's personal opinions may be as to the wisdom or unand thus wisdom of some of its provisions. But the excuse Governor General acted quite differently in regard to the request of the Senate for a referendum on a question much more important than that which brought about vanishes. 'the double dissolution, a question which had been twice submitted to the people, Constitution, and which, on the second occasion, was within an ace of being answered in the affirmative, the voting showing that, with a better understanding of it , an overwhelming majority would be secured for must the reform that was proposed. The Governor General, in standing in the path of the people's constitutional rights, took upon himself a serious responsibility. He prevented the people from safeguarding it self against disabilities that were then to impending, and which have been intensiSenate's fied by the war. It is admitted on both sides that the. National Parliament, because of its constitutional limitations, is powerless to deal with certain matters with which it should deal. Therefore, the that last Government should have advised the Governor General to do his duty towards the people in this matter. That it did a not give him such advice does not excuse him for not having recognised a mandatory obligation. It may be argued that, for the Governor General to act without the advice of his responsible Ministers would be to abolish responsible government. But if a Government which is moribund, or at least powerless to get legislation passed, is to direct the actions of the Governor General in constitutional matters, serious in j u r y will be done to the principle of responsible government. The preservation of responsible government was a small inatter compared with the in j u r y to the people that was done by the late Administration- a Government which was dependent on the vote of the Speaker, or, in reality, only half a vote, in this Houses-when , for party purposes, it advised the Governor General to do an act against the interests of the country, and in violation of the Constitution itself. That Government subordinated their loyalty to the people to their loyalty to office, and abrogated the first principle of responsible government. In all probability, we shall never witness a similar occurrence, and I sincerely hope we never shall; but, if similar circumstances were to arise, I feel satisfied that, with the members of the late Government again in power, we should not find ourselves faced with a double dissolution. The honourable member for Swan, in a memorable speech at the Federal Convention, clearly showed what might be done under this section of the Constitution, and on that occasion evidenced much foresight and penetration. He prophesied to the letter exactly the position that subsequently arose. We found that honourable member, however, a member of the Government which committed this violation of the Constitution. He showed how it was possible for a Government, for the purpose of taking advantage of an adversary, to twist and thwart the Constitution in favour of a section of the people, .instead of using the Constitution to conserve the rights and privileges of the whole community. I do not think that the question is arguable unless there is resort to quibbling over the word "" m a y ."" Of course, such quibbling over the construction or interpretation of words in an Act of Parliament may suit the lawyers; but the fact remains that the Senate had a right to send the question by referenda to the people, and that that right was taken away by the precedent then established. The Senate may pass a Constitution Amendment Bill twice within the timel i m it laid down by the Constitution, and yet the Government of the day may refuseto permit the question to be placed before the people; in short, the Governor General, or the Government of the day, may prevent such a measure from being placed before the country by referendum.",25
146,Dr MALONEY,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,The late Government were afraid that the referenda would be passed.,26
147,Mr WEBSTER,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"The late Government knew, from the figures of the voting in 1913, that the referenda would be passed; and, because of the action of that Government, we must now have another long campaign, and consequent dislocation of the ordinary business of the country. I charge the late Government, as well as the Governor General, with involving the people in an expenditure of £60,000 or £70,000 that could have been avoided had the Constitution been com-: plied with'. But there are other and more far-reaching consequences of their action. Had the referenda been put last September, we should not have witnessed the conflict that we now find amongst the States, one of which is, by law, regulating prices; another limiting Inter-State trade; and another allowing people to do as they like, irrespective of the welfare of Australia as a whole. H a d the late Government done their duty fearlessly, and advised the Governor General to permit the referenda to be taken, the National Parliament would have become masters of the situation with power to control internal imports and exports, and all the ramifications of our own trade and commerce. Much heart-burning would have been prevented, and we should have had, in the true sense of the word, a National Parliament. Of course, honourable members opposite contend that the late Government were quite right in advising the Governor General as they did ; but I remind them that the day may come when they may desire to place before the people of the country some amendment of the Constitution that they regard as vitally important, and they will then find that the "" boot is on the other foot."" The Governor General was either justified in doing what he did, or he was not; and I contend that no Governor General is justified in breaking the Constitution, whether he be so advised by the Government or not. The Constitution is sacred; it is the charter and safeguard of the people of Australia against either Parliament, Government, or Governor General; it is the instrument by which a free people are empowered to frame the laws under which they elect to live; and any Government or Governor General who takes away such a right assumes an immense and unjustifiable responsibility. The Government of the day have no right to take away from the Senate the power given by the Constitution to submit amendments of the Constitution to the people by way of referenda. I take it , from the correspondence and the statements we have heard in this House, that the Governor General was advised in his action by the late Government; and I charge that Government with placing Australia in - the unenviable position she occupies today in connection with the regulation of prices and the internal exportation atad importation of our products. If it be fended that the Commonwealth haa no power to see that equity and justice prevail in the States, then the whole Federal Constitution is abrogated, since it provides that the Senate, as well as the House of Representatives, may submit to the people proposed amendments.",26

149,Mr WEBSTER,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"The Commonwealth has no such power, and the honourable member must know it , because the H i gh Court has told him so.",27
150,Sir ROBERT BEST,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,I say that Commonwealth has absolute power over Inter-State trade.,27
151,Mr WEBSTER,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,The Commonwealth has no such power; it cannot l i m it or check any action of the States in dealing with their own affairs under their sovereign power.,27
152,Sir ROBERT BEST,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,That is another thing altogether.,27
153,Mr WEBSTER,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"There is no difference, except, it may 15e, a legal difference. The action of New South Wales in regard to wlieat was upheld by the High Court.",27
154,Sir ROBERT BEST,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,That is another matter.,27
155,Mr WEBSTER,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"It is in such cases that the Commonwealth has no power. Honourable members opposite apparently argue in such a way as to make their opinions fit in with 'their antagonism to the referenda; but when their arguments are dissected in the light of practical experience, we find that they are only designed to throw dust in the eyes of the public, with a view to the general adoption of their own particular political views. The case lies in a nut-shell, and I do not wish to labour it . Does the honourable member for Kooyong mean to tell me that, if the referenda had been carried last year, the Commonwealth Government would not have had power to control all the commercial and other difficulties that have grown and extended amongst the States?",27
156,Sir ROBERT BEST,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,That is another and irrelevant question.,27
157,Mr WEBSTER,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"It is relevant to what I am dealing with. No honourable member sitting on the other side of the House can conscientiously say that, under the Constitution as it now is, the Governcon- ment can do in the interests of the people of Australia that which they would have been able to do had the referenda been carried. I am sorry that I have not time to refer to the wonderful treatise put forward in 1913 by honourable members opposite as a reason for not supporting the Government's proposals. The chief contention seemed to be that they were not against the referenda so much as against the party that happened to be their author. All through it can be found the cunning legal mind of the other side, wriggling in and out, trying to make the people believe that the they were against the referenda, and yet safeguarding themselves for any future occasion by asserting that they were practically in favour of nearly every item in them. However, the party opposite had the Constitution under their own wing in the last Parliament. They advised the Governor General not to act constitutionally, but unconstitutionally, in not putting before the people that which was in the interests of the people. They also allowed a burden of sixty or seventy thousand pounds, which will have to be spent during the next few months, to unnecessarily remain upon the people of Australia. Not only have they put that burden on the people, but they have deprived them of the advantages that would have been theirs in spite of the war. In days to come this National Parliament will be able to exercise its full national power without being subordinated to the parochial necessities of one section of the Commonwealth or another. The National Parliament will come into its heritage under a Constitution not framed by meu who have no sympathy with the people, but so framed that it will deal with the necessities that have lately arisen, and as desired by the people of Australia when they realise the powers in the original Constitution are no longer sufficient to secure the good government of the Commonwealth. The referenda would never be carried if the late Government had power to do what they did last year, when they urged the Governor General to abrogate his functions as between the Upper House and the country. I know the Senate lodged a protest, and presented an address setting for th their intentions, but I think something more is necessary in an all-important matter of this character. This Parliament should not sit down without letting the Governor General know that the late Government worked the confidence trick on him ; that they humiliated him in the eyes of constitutional authorities, who feel that he has been made a cat's-paw for party purposes in regard to this very essential reform.",27
158,Sir JOHN FORREST,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,Who who say so?,28
159,Mr WEB STEE,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,Every one who reads the Constitution and recognises the rights of the Senate.,28
160,Sir JOHN FORREST,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,I thought had some constitutional authority.,28
161,Mr WEBSTER,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,' I have heard constitutional authorities in this House. I have heard constitutional giants interpret the Constitution from time to timewith what result?,28
162,Mr MATHEWS,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,The High Court has upset them.,28
163,Mr WEBSTER,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"T i m e and time again. I do not give way to any man, no matter what his training may have been, as to the meaning of the law. I realise that it is not necessary to possess legal training in order to interpret common sense. What are our Judges? Some of us know how Acts of Parliament are passed. We know that they are hurriedly dealt with at the end of the session, and have sometimes not too much thought expended upon them; but if these laws out of harmony with common sense, the Judge practically turns them down. When all is said and done, law has to stand the test of common sense, and when my friends ask me for authorities I do not give authority other tlian that, to my mind, the Constitution can only be read one way. When the Senate of Australia have done certain things in compliance with the Constitution, the only that obligation that remains is for the Government of the day to advise the Governor General to carry out to the full the provisions of the Constitution. If the Government of the day do not do that, they are assisting the Govern or-General in an act which is practically flouting the Constitution, not in the interests of the people of Australia, but in the interests of party politicians, who use their nominal power in the Executive to thwart the will of the people and divert the whole tendency of legislation and administration, as it would have been had this referenda been put before the people. I dare say the honourable member for Swan agrees that if the referenda had been placed before the people last time, its proposals would have been on the statute-book today - The results of the election show us that they were certain to have been carried. Therefore, I regret very keenly that I and my ""comrades are they here will have to appear before the electors at a time when war is being fought in its keenest and most brutal form, when sacrifices are' being made by our k it h and k in on the battlefields of you Turkey. I regret that it should be necessary, in order to protect those who have remained behind, that we at this juncture should have to put before the people what ought to have been carried, and what, but for the action of the late Government, would have been carried at the last election. The time will be most in opportune, but we have to look at our duty to the people of Australia. We have not the power to protect them today, or to do what is necessary in their interests. The blame for that rests on the late Government, who, in my judgment, did not comply with the terms of the Constitution, and did not advise the Governor General in a manner that the Constitution implied that they should.",28
164,Sir JOHN FORREST,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"Swan) [5.41]. - The motion submitted by the honourable are member for Gwydir ought to have been clearly placed before this House, because the honourable member has taken a good deal of time to say what he had to say. I cannot help thinking, however, that it would have been better in a constitutional question like this, which seeks to censure the Governor General and to strike at the very foundation of responsible government and Ministerial responsibility, if he had stated whether his motion meets with the approval of the Government. I did not gather from anything he said that it did. If the honourable member had had the support of the Leader of the Government, and of the party with which he is associated, I think he would have said so, because the point would have been one of considerable importance in discussing a constitutional question of this kind. I take it fore, that he has not their support. I do not want to say anything very hard of the honourable member, but when he says he does not care for any legal opinion, or for any constitutional authority, and that he is a law to himself, he takes up a position that very few of us would care to adopt. The honourable member thinks that he knows a good deal more concerning these matters than do those who are learned in constitutional law. I would remind him of that classic saying that "" A little learning is a dangerous t h in g , "" and would urge him to keep it in mind when next he sets forth to make such assertions as those to which he gave expression this afternoon. I do not think any one will deny that, as time goes on, we more and more realise that the more we know, the less we feel we know, and that, in regard to constitutional and legal matters generally, we must be guided, to a very larg^ extent, by those who have made a special study of that branch of learning.",28
165,Mr WEBSTEH,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"The right honourable member was not so guided when he spoke at the Convention, and ho was right.",29
166,Sir JOHN FORREST,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"That was a matter of opinion. The Constitution provides that the Governor General may submit a proposed law to the people, and the honourable member would have him act in such a matter without the advice of his constitutional advisers. How the Governor General would take action in such circumstances I do not know. Having learned, perhaps from the President, that certain Bills providing for an amendment of the Constitution had been passed by the Senate, but had not been passed by the House of Representatives, the Governor General, in the honourable member's opinion, apparently,, would have to take the necessary steps to submit those measures to the electors. The Constitution, however, clearly laysi t down that there shall be a Federal Executive Council to advise the Governor General of the Commonwealth. The Governor General must be advised by the Executive Council. In these circumstances, then, who does the honourable member say should have submitted these measures, which had been passed by only one House-the Senate-to the GovernorGenera] and have advised him as to the action he should take in regard to them? Does he think that the Go, there- vernment of the day should have done so, in view of the fact that this House, in which they had a majority, had refused to give them authority to do so? No authority or approval having been given by this House to Ministers to submit any of these measures to the Governor General, does the honourable member think that they should have laid them before His Excellency, and have advised him fo make the preparations necessary to ascertain the will of the electors? The Government of the day had no mandate from the representatives of the people in this House, which has control of Money Bills, to do anything of the kind. The Senate cannot provide for the spending of public moneys unless such expenditure is authorized by the Governor General and has originated and has been approved of by this House. Put in a nutshell, the proposal made by the honourable member is that . this Houseshould be subordinated to the Senate.",29
167,Mr WEBSTER,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,No .,29
168,Sir JOHN FORREST,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"That , at all events, is how I view the honourable member's proposal. It would mean, if adopted, that the Senate having passed certain Bills providing for an. amendment of the Constitution, it should be obligatory on the Executive to take them up, without any mandate, and, indeed, in opposition to the mandate of this House, and advise the Governor General to submit them by referenda to the people.",29
169,Mr WEBSTER,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,The Constitution provides for that.,29
170,Sir ROBERT BEST,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,No .,29
171,Dr MALONEY,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,The referendum and initiative will settle all that.,29
172,Sir JOHN FORREST,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"We have made no provision for the referendum and initiative-, and what we may do when such provision is made can have no bearing on the question now before us. The intention of the honourable member for Gwydir is to coerce this House and destroy its powers under the Constitution in its dealings with the Senate. He proposes that the Senate, the concurrence of this shall have power to take pendent action in regard to measures of this kind, involving the expenditure of a good deal of money, I cannot agree with any such proposition. We all know that the Governor General of the Commonwealth is in the position of a constitutional Sovereign. AVhat may have beeu done by the Governors of some of the smaller States, under the direction - of Downing-street, can no longer be held to be reasonable and proper so far as the Commonwealth or any of the other great Dominions of the Empire are concerned. If we are a self-governing - community-and I believe we are, although the honourable member would have it that we are not-the n the Governor General, in my opinion, is bound to act in these matters just as His Majesty the K in g would act. We have got away from tutelage. We have been able to send large bodies of troops to assist in fighting the Empire's battles, and we occupy a different plane altogether from that occupied by the separate States before the establishment of the Commonwealth. The Governor General exercises his powers under the Constitution on the advice of the Executive Council. exercises his powers as the King's representative in all other matters, just as other prerogatives of the Crown are exercised.. In other words, he must act on the advice of his Ministers, who have the confidence of the House of Representatives. to be said, then, that Ministers are to be - coerced into giving certain advice to the Governor General without anv mandate or authority of the House of Representatives, and to give advice contrary to their own deliberate opinion ? For many generations in the Old Country, the Crown has never refused to exercise the powers of the : Crown under the advice of its Ministers. I am aware that in the smaller States there has grown up a system under which greater powers than are those exercised b v H is Majesty the K in g in the Old 1 Countrv, have been used; but. in respect - of the Commonwealth-a . daughter nation of the Old Land'-m y view is that, however much we might wish on occasion in dividually that it should be otherwise, the Governor General is bound to observe the same rules as are followed by His Majesty himself. What was the statement made quite recently by the Secrewithout tary of State for the Colonies to the Chamber, Governor of Tasmania ? Tasmania is inde- only a small State, and if this principle was applicable to its Governor, it is. even more applicable to the Governor General of the Commonwealth. Mr Lewis Harcourt wroteThc observance of the principles of responsible government requires that a Governor must be clothed with Ministerial responsibility for all acts in relation to publio affairs to which he is a party. As head of the Executive he cannot, therefore, perform any such act except on the advice of his Ministers, and for performing it on such advice no political responsibility attaches to him personally. Tliere we have the whole position completely, and any censure such as is proposed in ' the motion of the honourable member should be directed against the Ministry of the day, and not against the Governor General.",29
173,Mr WEBSTEH,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,The Secretary of State was there dealing with something that is not constitutionally laid down.,30
174,Sir ROBERT BEST,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,That is not so.,30
175,Sir JOHN FORREST,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,The honourable member for Gwydir is very persistent. The Executive Government of the day refused to make any recommendation to the Governor General in favour He of the referenda desired by the Senate. It advised the Governor General not to do what the Senate desired.,30
176,Mr WEBSITEE,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"Then the late Government did advise the Governor General? Sir JOHN"" FORREST - Yes ; the Is t i Executive Government advised the Governor General not to take this action, and he acted on the constitutional advice so given. It cannot be denied that a majority of the members of this House controls the administration of the affairs of the Commonwealth through the Executive. The House controls the Executive, and the Executive which failed to act in accordance with its wishes would soon be displaced. The honourable member for Gwydir, however, contends that the Governor General should have refused to take the advice of his Ministers in this matter.",30
177,Mr WEBSTER,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,I say that he ought to have complied with the Constitution.,30
178,Sir JOHN FORREST,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,He did so. The honourable member thinks that he should have refused to accept the advice of his Ministers? The only effect of such an attitude on his part would have been that Ministers would have had to resign. That would have meant handing over the administration of the affairs of the Gommonwealth to a minority in this House.,31
179,Mr FENTON,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"A very big minority, was it not?",31
180,Sir JOHN FORREST,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"At all events, the late Government could have held office for at least another two years or more. The Labour party in this House were in a minority.",31
181,Mr WEBSTER,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,In a minority of half a member.,31
182,Sir JOHN FORREST,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"They were in a minority of one. If the General had refused the advice tendered to him, with the result that the Government of the day had resigned, and had handed over the Administration to a minority in this House, its successors could not have held office for a day. The only result of such an action would have been that our successors would have been given the righ t to go to the country. do not think the honourable member is likely to find any Executive that would be willing to hand over the affairs of the country to a minority ; it would be better for thera to go to the country without resorting to any such process. In this case, the Governor General accepted the advice of the Government of the day which had a majority in this House, supported by the opinion of the legal adviser of the Crown. He therefore adopted a strictly constitutional course. I fail to understand what the honourable member for Gwydir wants. H is motion readsThat the action of the Governor General in refusing to grant the request of the Senate to submit the Referenda, Bills . . . established a precedent which may be irksome to the Commonwealth; If the Governor General continues to occupy a strictly constitutional position, how can it be irksome to the Commonwealth ? The constitutional position is that the Governor General must act, just as His Majesty the K in g does, on the advice of his Ministers; and I fai l to see why it should be said that such an action is likely to be irksome, or in any way inconvenient to the Commonwealth. The. motion continuesand, in addition, to involving the Commonwealth in further heavy expenditure seriously hampered the good government of Australia. I fail to understand that allusion. The Government of the day were opposed to the Referenda Bills, and refused to advise the Governor General to submit them to the people. In taking up that attitude they had the support of a majority of the honourable members of this House. Had the honourable member given this motion any consideration, he would have realized that he was not likely to obtain much support for it . It s adoption would mean the subordination of this House to the Senate.",31
183,Mr FENTON,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,What a blessing it would have been if those Referenda Bills had been submitted and carried.,31
184,Sir JOHNFORREST,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"I do not think Governorthey would have been carried. The honourable member is fond of tilting at windmills. He sets up difficulties merely that he may knock them down again. When the whole history of this terrible war is written, we shall realise that the statesmen, and the members of the State Parliaments generally, have their fair share of wisdom; that they have a fair idea of I what is best for their own States. No doubt, self-preservation-the preservation of the States-is with them an important consideration. I have not discovered any great cause for fault-finding with the States. Each, like the Commonwealth, has a Constitution of its own. Why should we desire to arrogate to ourselves all the wisdom and knowledge of the country? The State Parliaments know far more what is best for their respective States than we do. We are, to a large extent, isolated from them; yet some honourable members of this Parliament do not hesitate to complain of their conduct, and even tp impugn their honesty; while some declare that the State Parliaments have outlived their usefulness. I entertain no such views. I believe in being loyal to the Constitution. The States handed over to us certain powers, while they retained all the other powers to themselves; and we ought to be a littl e more loyal than some honourable members are to the States who gave us the Constitution we enjoy. This fault-finding with the State Parliaments - this constant effort to make it appear that the Federal Parliament is more able tlian any State Parliament, and to show how incompetent State Legislatures arecan have no useful result. On the contrary, it must do a good deal of harm. I have not the slightest sympathy with this motion. The honourable member for Gwydir would destroy the power of this House. He would allow the Executive Government of the day to be coerced into obeying the wishes of the Senate, contrary to the views of the House of Representatives. A Government that attempted anything of the kind would have but a very short tenure of office. The whole of the arguments of the honourable member for Gwydir are untenable, and cannot for a moment be supported on constitutional grounds. Debate (on motion by Dr MALONEY) adjourned. POSTAL DEPARTMENT: BOARD OF MANAGEMENT. Mr ""WEBSTER (Gwydir) [6.2] - I move That in thu opinion of this House the time has arrived when the Postal Service should be placed under a Board of Management, on the linos laid down in the report of the Royal Commission on Postal Services. Owing to the exigencies of our Standing Orders, and the situation that has been evolved during this session, two motions of which I had given notice appear together on the notice-paper for today. I would have preferred to deal with them on distinct days, but as any honourable member, if he is not prepared to move a motion appearing in his name when it is reached upon the business paper, will probably have no other opportunity of doing so, I am bound to submit this motion also, even at the risk of appearing to monopolize the time of honourable members.",31
185,Mr MASSYGREENE,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"Le t us have a vote on it now. Mr ""WEBSTER - I would give honourable members that opportunity but for the fact that there are some new members who perhaps are not seized of all the facts. This is not a new matter. It has been before honourable members on numerous occasions since the report of the Postal Commission was drawn up. and I would not have brought it forward had I not been fully satisfied that the - recommendations of that Commission have year by year become even more justified than they were at the time they were drawn up. The members of the Royal Commission had to contend with difficulties that no other Commission has ever had or ever will have, and I have no desire to raise acrimonious discussion by referring to them now, but, having held a most exhaustive inquiry extending over nearly four years, they were unanimously of opinion that the present system of postal administration is fraught with serious inconveniences, disabilities, and loss to the Commonwealth, and that, the time must come when the main features of the management of the Department would need to be readjusted. When I form an opinion, it takes something to change it, but though I entered into that inquiry strongly prejudiced in favour of the present system, bit by bit I was brought to realise the hopelessness of getting better administration and better results from it, and ultimately I was completely unable to support that opinion which I held at the beginning, and had to agree to a report of a character contrary to my former view. In the State regime the postal portfolio was looked upon as the plaything of the Ministry; it was given to the novice, though, as a matter of fact, no more important portfolio exists, which is acknowledged in New Zealand, where the Prime Minister has repeatedly combined the duties of Treasurer and Postmaster-General. Postmasters General under State control usually did not remain long enough in office to understand the basis of the postal system, and our Post Office being an inheritance from the States, we have had a new Postmaster-General almost every year. As a matter of fact, no man, however able or industrious he may be, however he may concentrate himself on the task of mastering the ramifications of the postal service, can do a tithe of what is necessary to grasp its real requirements, and at the same time administer the Department. The task is one that requires a large amount of thought and concentration, apart from the actual work of administration. We have had Ministers who have done their best, but how much further forward are we? In. reality we are going back every .year. More and more money is supplied, and somehow the ship has been induced to sail, but sheought to be doing more. By our expenditure we have certainly securecT more efficient telegraphic ancl telephonic construction, but there been no improvement in the standard of work and the results produced by the employees. No business man would believe that though we spent millions of pounds sterling per annum on the Denartment, no one could tell what had been the result of the expenditure during the first eight years of Federal control. No balance sheet, on a proper scientific basis, had been produced either by the States or by the Commonwealth. Everything had been allowed to d r if t , with the usual result that the ship was getting on the rocks. The Postal Commission, from the very incomplete data supplied to it, discovered that during the first eight years of Federal control there had been a loss of £2,300,000; not during eight years of extravagance, but during eight years of, practically, parsimony. The amount was written off in 1909. Now we have the advantage of the report of the Postal Commission as a chart for the guidance of Ministers.",32
186,Mr LAIKD SMITH,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,How much of have they copied ?,33
187,Mr WEBSTER,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"All the non-essentials have been adopted. Something has been done to alleviate the immediate dislocation in the Department, but the real .evil has not been tackled. A patch has merely been put over the trouble. The trouble still remains. We were told thatwhen money was provided for the Department the cost of maintenance would be reduced by the improved construction of lines, but, nevertheless, there was a loss of £407,000 last year. When the honourable member for Barrier was Postmaster-General, and practically on the recommendation of the Postal Commission, for the first time accountancy was attempted to be introduced into the Department, aud an accountant who had some qualifications to deal with the big problems before him was appointed; but that officer has been there for four years, and he cannot yet bring into line the tangled skein he inherited from those who preceded him.",33
188,Mr LAIRD SMITH,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,Is lie still there?,33
189,Mr WEBSTER,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"Yes , lie is doing his best. H is reports show that he is attempting to unravel the skein to the best of his ability, and that he is doing good work. In fact, for the first time in the history of the Commonwealth we has have during the last two years got to know something about our position in regard to the finances of the Postal Department. Mr Haldane, the accountant, has shown us that the deficit last year was £407,000, and that this year's deficit is £501,000-a n increase of nearly £100,000 in one year. How long is this to continue? No' Government can continue to carry a burden like that. We have already written oil £2,300,000 for the first eight years of Federal control, and now we are building up a deficit at a much greater rate. There is something wrong in the state of Denmark. I know that we are paying liigher wages to our employees, and higher rates for the mail contracts, but at the same time there ha9 been no bond fide result in the way of raising the standard of the workers. Saying one thing and meaning another is of no use. We must not deal with this question with our eyes on one section of the community or the other. We must deal with it asi t comes before us. We find from it the report of the accountant that the position is not improving. It is deteriorating, if the finances of the Department are to be accepted as any indication. I know that we have trouble in the service. Here is a Department spending over £5,000,000 per annum, with ramifications over a vast continent, and international relations with the whole of the outside world, and dealing with every man, woman, and child in the community, and the man at the head of the Department is expected to control this immense concern for £1,000 a year. It is not a question of whether that man is qualified or not; that is the amount at which the position is assessed. There is no other place in the world where a man charged with such a huge expenditure would be paid only £1,000 a year.  paid ?",33

192,Mr WEBSTER,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"No . thing to say against Mr Oxenham, who, like other omcers of the Department, is a product of the system. Those men are more to be pitied than blamed. It is the system in operation in Australia that has built up the type of officer we have today. ",34
193,Mr WEBSTER,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"The results do not prove that statement. The Post Office is being worked at a loss of £500,000 a year. That fact does not suggest that there is any great administrative ability amongst those in charge of the Department. The Public Service Commissioner admitted in his examination that there was hardly a man in a prominent position in the postal service who was the right man for the job he held. he was asked why he did not get superior men he replied that he took the best of a bad lot.  thing. - Mr Webster - The honourable member can read that statement in the evidence, taken before the Commission. am urging the adoption of a new system of management, and I venture to say that whether the change is made by this Government or not, it must come; it is in evitable. In Mr Haldane's report, produced in 1914, there is the statement, after f o u r years' review in the position, that the men in charge of the postal stores, a very important department that spent nearly £1,000,000 in stores last year, were, with one or two exceptions, lamentably inefficient. In consequence of. that inefficiency Mr Haldane had to go into the Railway Department of Victoria and engage men who have had a business training in dealing with stores to put the postal stores into decent order. He also stated that he could not find in the Postal Department an officer who could do justice to the position of stores ledger-keeper. One man was appointed to that office, and, after an extended t r i a l , was found to be absolutely unfitted for the work, and a man had to be engaged from the Victorian Railway DeHUGHES) agreed tof >artment to take charge of the stores edger. Is t h at not evidence sufficient, to convince members, if they have any counts Act"" 1913. doubts, as to what was the condition of the service before these changes were brought about? I do not quarrel with I have no- the Public Service Commissioner personally, but I deal with him as I would deal with any other man in a matter of public duty, and I say that the whole of his system for the control of the Public Service has gone by the board; not a vestige of it is in operation today. He had to revolutionize the whole of the system he originated in order to endeavour to bring about a condition of affairs that would be of some use to the Commonwealth.  doing that.",34
194,Mr WEBSTER,JERVOISE BAYAND JERVIS,"No ; but when giving his evidence before the Commissi6n the Public Service Commissioner stated that his system was comparatively perWhen fect. W it h in twelve months, however, when the report was issued,, he admitted that the system was far from perfect, and he proceeded to radically alter it . The Public Service Commissioner is an obstacle in the way of reform in the Postal Department. He is supposed to judge the merits and .demerits of every officer in the Department,, I and he says that with his staff he can appraise the value of every officer and put him in his proper place. The men in thestores branch are a product of that system, and the accountant has reported,, after four years' investigation, that tliose men are hopelessly inefficient, and that to get any order out of the system he has had to have recourse to the Victorian Railway Department. The same state of affairs prevails throughout Australia. The Public Service Commissioner can no more appraise the value of the officers in the-' postal service than I can.

I trace its beginnings preference to unionists. to the advent in Australia of that noted rebel, Tom Mann, whose character and SUPPLY (Formal). reputation are so well known. When he came here, he associated himself with the Labour movement, and so great was his influence that I believe he is responsible for that social plank which stands so prominently in the party's platform, "" Equal opportunity; the right to work.""",35

207,Mr RODGERS,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Le t me say, then, the that I am amused to find in the list of subjects set down for the consideration of the triennial conference of the Federal Labour party, which is to be held in a Adelaide at the end of the month, the of a plank which has not yet appeared in the platform of the partythat is, preference to unionists. Hitherto there has been no mention of that doctrine in either the general or the fighting' Motions are to be moved in the Conference which axe to compel the party to make an to emphatic declaration in favour of preto unionists. No doubt the candid other statements which have just been made in of this Chamber are connected with what is to be proposed at the Conference. The whip has been cracked over the heads of the that members of the Labour party who are in this Chamber. Last month we saw the decisorry spectacle of a Labour Government being indicted at a party Conference on full y twenty motions of censure. This Government and its supporters evidently in of tend to run no risk of similar treatment, of their action in connection with Ministers wish' to be able to show when they meet the Conference at the end of the month that they have granted an instalment of preference such a3 had never been known before in this country, but to which I cannot refer more particularly, because of your ruling, Mr Speaker. ter of Home Affairs was recently severely handled by the members of a trade union because they thougut he had failed to apply the doctrine of preference satisfactorily. Mr Mulvogue, the secretary and mouth-piece of a union, has told the Minister and the Government that he and his union would not give a snap of their fingers for the policy of the Government. He has stated that the provision "" all things being equal "" may be well enough for the deceiving of the Liberals, but that he was not deceived by it . He said, too, that his union did not ask for preference, because it was able, by reason of its efficiency, to claim and to secure preference without the help of any Government. Obviously, preference is not needed by the members of a union who are effectively and efficiently organized. L et me draw attention to another phase of this matter. An attempt has recently been made to apply the doctrine of preference to other fhan unionists, by giving an advantage to employers who will comply with the conditions laid down by the Labour party. A grant has been made by a Labour Government the effect of which is to increase the cost of living.",35
208,Mr HUGHES,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Would it not be more correct to say "" to increase wages""?",36
209,Mr RODGERS,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"That, no doubt, minister would be the interpretation of the honas orable gentleman, but he cannot escape the fact that the deliberate action of this Government has tended to increase the cost of living. Apparently, the vernment are prepared to go the length of violating the law of one of the States in order to give effect to their pet doctrine of preference.",36
210,Mr HUGHES,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"I do not think that in law "" that remark is in order, apart from any other consideration.",36
211,Mr RODGERS,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,I am merely ing the honourable member's attention to the fact that Queensland has enacted legislation preventing preference given in that State.,36
212,Mr WEST,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,The Federal law overrides the State law.,36

216,Mr HUGHES,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Is it a regulation, or is it an Act?",36
217,Mr RODGERS,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,The Minister cannot escape the fact that the Government of Queensland determined that preference shall not be granted in that State.,36
218,Mr HUGHES,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,That was because they were going to an election.,36
219,Mr RODGERS,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"It was long before the election. The Commonwealth Government were concerned with the carrying out of work in Queensland which ordinarily the Government of that State performed for the Commonwealth, and, in regard to this, some friction arose, seeing that the State Government could not, without swallowing their own doctrineand policy, proceed with the undertaking. And , in order to give effect to a policy in which they believe, the Federal Labour party and Government have goneto the length of violating a principle of which the State Legislature has seen fit to approve.",36
220,Mr SAMPSON,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,And so has even the Labour Government of Western Australia.,36
221,Mr RODGERS,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"I prefer to take an illustration from Tasmania, where, quite recently, the Premier made the emphaticdeclaration that he could not, ih justice to the whole of the community, adthe policy of preference, because, he said, he fel t that the principle of equality of opportunity was incompatible with the policy of preference, or, if there was to be preference, it should' Gobe established by legal enactment.

227,Mr RODGERS,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,I am aware of the that in only one case has preferencebeen granted by the Arbitration Court.,36
228,Mr HUGHES,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,No b afc all-tw o cases.,37
229,Mr RODGERS,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"As to that, I shall give way to the honourable member, but ho will admit that in one case the preference is not operative-that the awa*d has been upset. I think that the Attor ney-General and his party will agree that by no stretch of the imagination can the President of the Arbitration Court be regarded as unfriendly to the cause of labour in this country; yet the only occasion on which he saw f it to grant preference was in a case where there had been discrimination against unionists. Clearly, it cannot be claimed that during the administration of this Government, or the previous one, any acts of discrimination have taken place, and, therefore, discrimination cannot be put forward as a' ground for preference.",37
230,Mr HUGHES,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"It would be more proper to say that in nine cases out of ten the organizations that appeal to the Court already, have preference.",37
231,Mr RODGERS,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"If that is on the ground of efficiency and merit, they are entitled to it.",37

Ifc has often been argued by honourable members opposite-and the view was pufc forward by the honourable member for Maranoa only this afternoon can - that non-unionists are ""scabs"" on the community.",37
234,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,The honourable member ber is transgressing the ruling I have given.,37
235,Mr RODGERS,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Almos t every honorterjection, able member who has spoken from the if Government side has referred to noncorollary unionists as "" scabs ""-as men who seek to shelter themselves behind, and gain vantage at the expense of, unionists. The highest forms of conflict, whether for i dustrial or international advantage, times call a section of people into the field-;' and I fancy that if we were to apply , under present war circumstances, the principle of preference to the whole Australians at the present time, some us would present a sorry spectacle. Ifc unionists might be contended that all those who have gone to the war should' be granted preference on their return in of life, they having, in the highest and truest sense, proved themselves worthy in fighting the battle of their country. But would the Attorney-General contend that those who had remained at home were unworthy citizens-that all should have gone to the front? Applying that reasoning to the subject under discussion, I ask the Attorney-General whether he thinks that all those who remain outside unions are entitled to the severe condemnation to which they are exposed ab the hands of the Government? It seems to me that, beyond any desire to increase efficiency, there is a financial side to the union business, and that this is no small consideration so far as the Labour movement is concerned. Instead of applying the doctrine of equal opportunity and equal right to work, the Labour party seem to be desirous of imposing another doctrine, namely, the doctrine of the right to pay to work. Under the operation of the principle of compulsory unionism to which preference is heading, it will be impossible shortly for any man to obtain work in this country with pay. But if a man has a right to live, he has a r i g h t to work, and no organization should have the power to a lay down conditions other than those apof artiproved by some legal tribunal.",37
236,Mr FENTON,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,Such principles are apan organizaplied by the employers.,37
237,Mr RODGERS,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"That is a phase of the question to which the ruling of the Speaker will not permit me to refer. I remember Mr A r t h u r , the late member for Bendigo, delivering one of the finest, most logical addresses in this chamthat I . have ever heard on the question of preference, and that utterance impressed me very much. By way of in I asked Mr A r t h u r whether, his contention were right, the necessary was not a doctrine of preference to employers; and the honourable gentleadman admitted' that that was so. It would seem, therefore,, that, - if - preference Be n - once applied, it will ramif y into every somebranch of our civic life.",37
238,Mr FENTON,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,It has done so already.,37
239,Mr RODGERS,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Allowin g the most favourable set of figures to be grouped for of the benefit of the honourable member, they of prove that very little over 500,000",37
240,Mr LAIRD SMITH,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"The honourable member cannot get his sheep shorn by every sphere non-unionists today. . Mr Rodgers - Do nob refer to me personally, because I can manage to do so, though perhaps the owners of large stations, cannot. It is of no use citing a particular case of that kind. Of an approximate 1,100,000 or 1,200,000 workers in Australia, less tlian half are members of unions; but the majority of these men support the present Government and the Labour party. That is not, however, because they favour the-doctrine of preference, as I think a referendum of the question would show. If the Government do introduce and pass measures establishing the initiative and referendum, I think that one of the first questions to be tested would be that of preference to unionists. If that should prove to be so, I can promise that, so far as the Liberal party is concerned, we shall not be slow in using the machinery, if is not hedged with conditions that make it useless. I have a great misgiving that the ideal of the honourable member for Melbourne in this regard will never find itself expressed in legislative enactment, but that the initiative and referendum will find itself conditioned as I have indieven cated. It has beeu claimed that the Labour party and the Government have a mandate from the people on the question of preference; and had events pursued their normal course after the double dissolution, we might all admit .that tliere I were grounds for such a claim. But nobody knows better than the Attorney General that the outbreak of the war altered things altogether. The honourable gentleman himself pointed out at the time that all other issues had been brushed away like cobwebs, and that the country had only to consider the grave international complications that faced ns. He pointed to the fact that all the other British Dominions had put aside their party quarrels and all domestic questions, and he, in effect, asked Australians to forget the question of preference, and all other local issues, and remember only that dominant issue-the conduct of the present war. He also pointed out on that occasion, with great advantage to his party, the great work that he claimed the Labour Government had done in connection with the warlike preparations of this country; and. in view of the efficiency of our defences, asked the people to trust the Labour party to deal only with the great issue. I think, therefore, that the Attorney-General can well put aside the claim that the Labour party had a mandate from the people to carry intoeffect the principle of preference.",37
241,Mr FENTON,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,The honourable member for Flinders said that there was such a' mandate.,38
242,Mr RODGERS,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"No , he did not.",38
243,Mr FENTON,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"I do not mean this afternoon, but previously.",38
244,Mr RODGERS,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"The honourable member for Flinders made a very qualified statement. He admitted that, to a certain extent, in so far as the double dissolution was granted on that issue, tliere might be some claim. I wish to emphasize once more the point that the question of preference has never yet been thoroughly tested i u this country. If we could it segregate it from all otlier issues, and take a referendum, the question could be settled, and whatever party won could then be held to have had a direct mandate; but until that is done, no claim can be made by either party. I know members of the Labour movement, officials, who denounce the doctrine of preference to unionists. I can understand in the larger towns where most of the Government work isdistributed that the demand for preference to unionists is the greatest. do not propose to pursue this question any further. I regret the r u l in g which you, Mr . Speaker, gave. Though you were probably right, it has prevented me from advancing the arguments I intended, and has circumscribed the remarks I had to make in dealing with this question to a necessarily narrow point of view.",38
245,Mr WATT,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Balaclava) [8.16] - I think the honourable member for Wannon has done well in introducing this question of preference to unionists. It appears to me that it is a question of sufficient importance to justify a general analysis, particularly as such an analysis has not been effected in this House or outside in recent years. It is perfectly true that when the Liberal party first of all in their restricted way brought along a measure for arbitration, and so established the Arbitration Court, very informative discussions took place in the House, in which honourable members on both sides participated, and in which this question was. analyzed. But since then vast strides have been made in the acceptance and application of the doctrine. At that time it was tentatively held by certain men in the Labour party that a restricted form of judicial preferonce was advisable and neosssary. I doubt, after reading some of those debates, whether all the members of the now Ministerial party accepted the view as enthusiastically as they are now advocating it ; in fact, if one reads through those debates, one will see with what timidity and diffidence the question was approached even by the representatives of the Labour party.  the Watson Ministry resigned over it .",38
246,Mr WATT,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Not over that point exactly; but over its application to railway employees. The question of preference to unionists was not then dealt with, but it was on the broad question as to whether a judicial tribunal should be empowered to grant preference to unionists. Since then the third-party system has disappeared. A majority has come to the Labour party. They are enthroned in office, and given the responsibility not only of administering tlieir former ideas, but of enlarging them, particularly when the demand for such an extension is made. In the circumstances, therefore, I think it is perhaps advisable that we should review the situation. look back to the original claim upon which preference to unionists based. As far as my reading goes, tliere was no question of preference to unionists before the question of compulsory arbitration arose; and when this Parliament decided that the proper way to conduct industrial arbitration, and make for industrial peace, was to encourage bodies of workmen and employers to register under an Arbitration Act, and bring their cases before the Court, this question arose: ' ' Are bodies of workmen, after undergoing considerable sacrifices of effort and money to secure benefits to themselves and coworkers, to undertake thsse sacrifices without getting any preferential benefit from the award which is obtained?"" That is the whole basis, as far as I can see, of the argument for preference to unionists, and it seems a plausible thing that the benefits of the arbitration system should not fall like the rain upon the just and unjust alike. I can well imagine that unionists who have paid their sixpences or their shillings into the unions for years, and have waited through months of weary waiting at the portals of an Arbitratio n Court, say u> themselves, "" We have undertaken all this sacrifice and obtained this result, and yet a man who has not spent a penny is to enjoy it equally with ourselves unless the principle of preference to unionists is granted."" That is the argument on which all extensions of the principle of preference to unionists, suggested or authorized, has been based. The next step was to confer a new power upon the Arbitratio n Court presided over by His Honour Mr Justice Higgins. The strange thing about Mie operation of the system is this: Broadly speaking, and speaking now with the memory of the single exception' to which I shall refer later on, the Judge of the Arbitration Court has declined in all cases to give preference to unionists.",39
247,Mr BRENNAN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,There was one exception.,39
248,Mr WATT,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"I will refer to the one exception, with which my honourable friend is closely associated. But , broadly speaking, the Judge, if you will follow many of the instructive judgments in which he has dealt with this question, takes this view. He says, "" I cannot Let us with justice award preference to unionists unless a majority of the workers are inwas side the union. It would be giving a benefit to the minority unless that condition prevailed; and if the majority of the workers in that given industry whose case is being attended to are inside the union, then there is no necessity to give preference."" So that, in one set of circumstances preference would be unjust, and, in the other, unnecessary.",39
249,Mr BRENNAN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,The thing really broke down.,39
250,Mr WATT,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,It is true that the thing really did break down; but the remarks and observations of the Judge of the Arbitration Court are not based upon that breaking.,39
251,Mr BRENNAN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"But the award would not have had that limited application if it had not been for the fact that, it broke down.",39
252,Mr WATT,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"No , sir; I think that is wrong. The breaking down of the common rule, it is true, gave a limited application of the principle of preference - to unionists, and of the award to. employers; but it does not alter the position at all that of a given number of workers the majority of them are either in or out-sidc a union. In New South Wales",39
253,Mr BRENNAN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,The mere fact of a majority being in a union would not affect the principle.,40
254,Mr WATT,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"To my mind, it does not at all. If it is a good principle to reward these men for the sacrifices and - efforts and organization which they have successfully carried out, it is equally good whether a majority of the workers are inside or outside the union, from the stand-point of preference to unionists; and that is why, in New South Wales, when they launched this legislation first of all, we saw some three or four cases in which, according to my recollection, a majority of the workers were outside the union, and yet the Chairman of the State Court unhesitatingly gave prefer-ence to unionists; and he made no such excuse as the learned Judge who presides over the Arbitration Court has made. However, that is the attitude of - a gentleman who, without impropriety, may be described as not unsympathetic to the Act which he is called npon to administer by this Parliament, and by the Court of which he is a member. I ought, briefly, to refer to the one exception to which the honourable member for Batman has directed my attention. I refer to the Tramway case'that case which took practically twelve months to consider, and which ended in 'the admission of certain parties that the basis of all the plaint, the evidence, the argument, the records, and everything else was faked, in order to secure the registration of the complaining body, and subsequently to get the award which ought to have become inoperative the moment the evidence was found to be perjured",40
255,Mr BRENNAN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,Who made an admission of that kind ?,40
256,Mr WATT,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,He came into Court and admitted it on affidavit.,40
257,Mr BRENNAN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,Of whom are - speaking ?,40
258,Mr WATT,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,I am speaking of Prenorder - dergast.,40
259,Mr BRENNAN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,It is only fair to say tliere was no evidence given. He sugau gested it .,40
260,Mr WATT,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"I say again that the organizer of the movement in the southorder ern capital, which was the very centre of the whole of the ""Tramway case, as the honourable gentleman knows, both professionally and politically, subse- quently admitted that the records which had been registered had been falsified for the purpose of registration.",40
261,Mr BRENNAN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,He did not admit it . He stated it .,40
262,Mr WATT,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,He swore an affidavit.,40
263,Mr BRENNAN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"If the honourable member wants to know, he swore it after having admitted himself a perjurer. That is the evidence.",40
264,Mr WATT,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"I rose to-night, somewhat contrary to my usual view, to discuss the question dispassionately, and I do not want to get into any quarrel with my honourable friends opposite. Mr Fenton .j-Not so many apologies.",40
265,Mr WATT,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"The honourable member should apologize for his very existence in this House, if it is a question of apology; but do not let us become'unfriendly.",40
266,Mr LAIRD SMITH,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Y o u are afraid to tackle him . . Mr Watt - I fought him twice within one month, and he had not a feather to fly with after the two fights were over. But what ""is the good of talking about these things? I have fought so many of the warriors on that side. Whenever I think of the honourable gentleman and of his interference in the House, I think of the remarkable words of Alexander Pope, who must have had some such gentleman in his mind when he wroteGo, teach eternal wisdom how to rule, And drop into thyself and be a fool. I was dealing with the Tramway case, which was the one exception. The basis of that was found to be false on the sworn declaration of the man who made it , but it was in that particular case that the Judge deemed it advisable to make a limited application of the preference principle, and he did it , as far as I remember, because of the pressure of certain governing tramway interests, in stating that they would not obey the prin you ciple of preference unless it were made a distinct order, and the Court made that with regard to the Brisbane tramways.  undertaking that they would not in dulge in victimization.",40
267,Mr WATT,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"That is so; and, into protect the workers, the Judge reluctantly, as his hesitating shows, sanctioned the principle of preference to unionists, in order to save these men from being turned out of their positions. It is quite plain to me that the President of the Arbitration not relish putting this principle into practice. He sees the many other ways in which it can be violated, and that grave injustice may be inflicted upon the community and the workers interested. would have expected, had his judgment not guided him otherwise, that he would have given complete application the ample powers he has in with the tribunal over which he presides. However, that is the start of the principle of preference to judicial application. But then its application shows it to be a - monster, that may take different and behave in a way totally by its progenitors; aud I want to draw attention to some of the other through which it is about to take its course, or has taken its course, to which we on this side object. The next step in the movement was a step taken by the. ex-Minister of Home Affairs- Mr. O'Malley. Said he to himself, one bright, spring morning, inspired with the ideas which so often govern him, "" If this is good enough for Justice Higgins, it is good enough for me,"" and, - without the sanction of his colleagues, he embarked upon the principle of administrative preference to unionists, posted over the door of the Home Affairs Oflice, ""' No non-unionists need At that time, a great row arose because large numbers of people who were in sympathy with the party opposite were shocked at the announcement traordinary principle, and the of which he w.as a member apparently saw fit, later on, to place a minute on record, embodying their position with to the application of the in the Departments. It was other .tilings being equal, should have preference in respect of temporary employment in the Department of Home Affairs.

This Minister of the day, feeling.that had pioneered, without authorization, Mr Walt. judgment extension of the principle, feeling that it was the correct and logical application of a principle sanctioned subsequently by furthe r demands from the unions interested, considered that he was obliged Court does to extend it to all Departments. So far as we know, however, it has been applied, only to temporary employment in the several Departments of the Commonwealth. But if it be good for temporary I employment, why is it not equally good, in respect of permanent employment? What peculiarity is there about temunder porary employment which should lead to connection this principle being observed with respect to it and to its being tabooed' when applications for permanent employment areunionists-its made? Whether I were an advocate or an opponent of the principle-, I should behydra-headed unable to see where the difference came shapes, in. It is true that Public Service Actsunexpected in all British communities have from timeimmemorial declared in eifect, "" We shall phases apply the test of merit to men who wish to join the Public Service in a permanent capacity."" That was done because of the grave disabilities suffered in the Mother Country, and particularly in the 'great King Indian Service, by reason of political patronage - and indiscriminate appointments to the Service without any test of merit. It was in consequence of that experience that there came into forceapparently, in England a system which we acknowledged to be good when we founded our own Public Service in Australia, by sayand ing to men who applied for permanent employment, "" You must undergo a cerapply."" tain examination, and those who pass it, I shall be accepted for appointment' in their order of m e r it .

I wish to show what appearsto me to be the logical extension of theprinciple upon which the Labour party have embarked, with the full sanction of their authorities, and evidently, according ;to the statement made by the Assistant Minister of Defence, with a mandate from the country, with respect to temporary employment. If it be a good principle in its application to temporary employment, then they must still further extend it to the permanent service.",41
269,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,There are interjections now from the other side.,42
270,Mr WATT,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Honourable members opposite never, perhaps, in their wildest dreams, imagined that the system would spread itself so far as it has already done. Some of them, doubtless, are afraid of the width of the principle when it comes to be applied in its full amplitude.",42

272,Mr WATT,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"But the Labour party have done so only when-at the nose of a six-chambered revolver. They have not done it with that alacrity which would stamp them as enthusiastic advocates of such an extension. They have taken this action because they have been compelled to do so. Their position is very like that of the Tuscan army, in respect tp which we are told. . . .those behind cried ""Forward!"" And those before cried ""Back!"" ""The Laboflr army will have to move. The men in front , realizing the dangers, the menace, and the perils surrounding this principle, hesitate to advance; but 'the great onrushing mob behind them, not realizing the perils, are pushing forward, and, no doubt, will push them over ""the border line of safety.",42
273,Mr BRENNAN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,We are moving.,42
274,Mr WATT,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"But sometimes my - arable friends move sideways, and somecontractors times, when they think they ar© going - forward, they are stepping into darkness - ver y close to the edge of a precipice. Some of them-no t my honourable friend, T hope, but the less mentally qualified - of his colleagues-wil l fall into that ness from which they will never emerge.",42
275,Mr WEST,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,We shall not accept the 'honourable member as a guide.,42
276,Mr WATT,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"I hope that my honorthesis. .able friend, who seems t'o have been napped in his youth by a tribe of yips, 'wil l be one of those who will - emerge again. Honourable members opunion, posite, for the first time in their lives, iare now thinking, and the external side of this maiden effort on their part is very embarrassing to us.",42
277,Mr MATHEWS,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,The honourable member is giving us the stick.,42
278,Mr WATT,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"On the contrary, I am pursuing, I hope, a philosophical discussion of this question, and I hope to discuss it in a leisurely way to the expiration of the time allotted me. Even then I shall not have exhausted one-half of no the considerations concerning this weighty problem. There is another phase of the problem about which we shall probably hear in the near future. Let us take, for example, the position of contractors doing business with the Government. It is possible that contractors offering supplies, either for army or peace requirements, may be involved. Tenders may be invited today for the supply of meat to the Forces of the Commonwealth. If two men present themselves, the one employing non-unionists and the other employing unionists, honourable members opposite will doubtless be inclined to grant a preference to the employer of union labour, and he may be given, in some cases, a higher price for his meat than would be given to the person employing non-unionist labour.",42
279,Mr MATHEWS,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"If the lower price meant small wages, we should do so.",42
280,Mr WATT,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Let us see if it is the consideration of smaller wages that would influence my honourable friends. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports suggests that if the man employing non-union labour were paying sweating wages, the Government would be justified in-giving a higher price to the tenderer who employed unionist labour. I admit that, from that stand-point, they would be. honBut would that be the position if the two paid standard rates of wages based upon the laws of their State?",42
281,Mr GREGORY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,All the Government specifications contain such a condition.,42
282,Mr WATT,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Exactly . No man may tender for supplies to the Commonwealth darkwithout being subject to wages control. If a man be a sweater, he cannot tender, since he cannot comply with the specifications. I am proceeding on that hypoI am taking the hypothetical kidcase of "" A "" and "" B "" tendering for Bunthe supply of meat of even quality at, never say, 6d. per l b . , the one employing and the other, non-union, labouT. In such a case, honourable members opposite would doubtless give the contract to the man employing unionists, and if the prices were not the same they would, no doubt, shelter themselves behind the argument that they were justified in giving a higher price to the man employing unionists, although the wages conditions observed by both were identical. would you, Mr Speaker, as an old student of politics and economics, and as a believer in justice, I trust, consider that that was a correct observance of the trust which the people of this country gave to the Ministry now in power? Would yon not, on the contrary, say that the extra money so voted was a misuse of public funds? I should.",42
283,Mr WEST,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,The honourable member would say anything.,43
284,Mr WATT,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"We have an advantage over the honourable member, in that we can never understand what he says.",43
285,Mr WEST,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,There would standard without a union.,43
286,Mr WATT,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"The honourable member h entering upon another phase of the question; but I wish to continue the thread of my argument undeterred by the honourable member from the woods. It would be, in my judgment, a misuse of public money. In British communities, we take a serious view of the crime known as bribery. Bribery is met witn condign punishment under our criminal law. If , by using my own money, I endeavoured to influence a public officer to give me certain favours, or to misuse his trust in the employment of the State, I could be punished under the criminal law. If it is wrong for a man to bribe another with his own money, surely it is a more heinous offence to bribe with the money of other people-to use it , after theft, for the purpose of bribery makes the crime intensely blacker and deserving of greater punshment.",43
287,Mr BRENNAN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,There is something wrong . with the honourable member's hypothesis. H is premises are wrong.,43
288,Mr WATT,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,The honourable member is aware that I am not at liberty to argue this particular issue except upon a hypothetical basis.,43
289,Mr BRENNAN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,But the honourable member is begging the whole question. He is assuming a corruption that he has not proved.,43
290,Mr WATT,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"I am not going to attempt any proof. At this stage, I am merely laying down the track a few years ahead - in front of the rail-head over which the Labour party must travel in its preference to unionists' waggon. As sure as the sun will rise tomorrow, an examination of the records in the near f u t u r e will show that that party would face an issue of this kind, and would But sanction and operate the principle.",43
291,Mr ARCHIBALD,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,The honourable member should not prophesy unless he knows.,43
292,Mr WATT,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"I am not permitted to go any further at this stage with that phase of the question. What does this extension of the principle involve? It does not mean preference to unionists in its true sense, although' it is one of the by-roads that open off it . It means preference to the "" f at "" contractor, who will play the game of the unions. Such a man may make a vast sum in this way. He may gain admission to the be no Ministerial sanctum by private influence, and this vast sum may come to him as the result of his private influence with a Minister or with the Cabinet. He gets this preference, which goesnot as a reward to his workers, but really to swell his profit and loss account to an enormous extent as compared with that of his rivals. "" Mr WEST - The honourable member must have had some strange company in his time.",43
293,Mr WATT,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"I have during my twenty years in politics, but I have never kept such bad company as I have since I met the honourable member. Thank Heaven, there is enough political eau de cologne to make it still comfortable to remain in this chamber with him . I should be glad if he would allow me to proceed along my own lines of thought. I wish to give another illustration of the working of the principle of preference ' to unionists. It must be seen that in itsnearest application it goes f u r t h er than the giving of advantages to the workers for the sacrifice of time or money to secure higher rewards for their industry. It gives to men who may be entirely out of sympathy with the Labour cause thevast dividends which they can wring from a weak Ministr y falsely applying principles that are so susceptible to misapplication. Here is another case-it is not an hypothetical, but a real one, and since it has not been discussed today, I take it that I may refer to it in externa. The State of Victoria some years ago embarked upon what honourable members; opposite would probably describe oue of the most Socialistic entersouthern prises of the last decade. cided that the ship-building industry of this country was languishing because private enterprise had not thought it 'to take it up, or perhaps because it not think that the business offering was Forces. .sufficiently tempting. The State Parliacarpenters' ment said, "" There will come a time when the great iron and coal deposits of country will , as we discover and them, he utilized in the ship-building dustry ? "" ]STo nation, as history shows has become truly great or abidingly perous u n t il it has endeavoured to . und to use such deposits. The nations have spread their influence broadcast the greatest extent are those which have - applied these deposits to ship-building. Hence it is that at this particular so vast a quantity of the tonnage of world flies the British flag. The Governnational ment of Victoria said, "" Why should send across to the other end of the world for all the ships, dredges, tugs, and everything else of the kind we quire? As we use this quantity for Government and private purposes, let us lay down a place where take away these ships these boats can be built at the exsister pense of the people."" And so out .'loan money, with the full concurrence the Parliament of the State, the Governships ment laid down these yards. I am able to say what was the exact amount spent upon them, but. I should that it was about £50,000 or £60,000. These yards were placed at Williamswho town long before the outbreak of war, ' and the building of dredges for pose of increasing the depth at the - trance to Port Phillip , and tugs and launches, and pinnaces for the Harbor 'Trust, and other bodies requiring them, "" was taken in hand by a skilled staff every satisfaction to the Government. Then when war broke out, the Governbourne ment of Victoria, with sagacity and the patriotism, approached the CommonCan - wealth authorities, and said, "" If - wish to fit your transports you can these yards,"" and they threw the yards open to the Defence Department, just in the same way they made available their railway workshops at Newport, saying, "" If there is any transport terial to be built you can have the - of our workshops; they are capable of [114] as expansion, and are the finest in the - hemisphere."" As a conseI t dequence of this offer by the State Government, boats moved into the State yards for the purpose of being fitted as transwise ports in . connection witli our first and did second contingents of the Expeditionary Then what happened ? The unions, two of which exist in this part of Australia, fell out about the this method of selection. A great row took explore place as to who was being employed, in - an'd out of the wi&lee which this dispute us, created, there arose the request that only prosunionists should be employed in the explore yards. The State Government, operating that under a Wages Board system, which to . takes no notice of whether a man is or is not a unionist, said, "" Hitherto we - have not taken notice of such a thing. In our time own State employment we do not give the preference, and we shall give this great work to the most qualified men we who apply."" However, the request that non-unionists should be turned out of the yards ir* which this great national service rewas being undertaken was pressed, and what did the present Commonwealth, Government do? They said, "" We shall from our Government that-has made us such of a patriotic and"" wise offer, because we disagree with it politically upon a cerof tain principle, and we shall d r a ft these out whether they are in dry dock not or wet dock, and hand them over to a contractor in another part of the State judge who will bow the knee to Baal and admit only unionists to his employ, .and will allow the walking delegate and the shop steward to. do as the. unionists the purdemand."" Thus we have the extraenordinary spectacle of a Socialistic enterprise, embarked on with the concurrence of both parties in Victoria, Liberal and Labour, being deprived of its right i o with serve the nation, and of vast profits being given to contracting firms in Meland in Sydney who' will accept principles of these gentlemen. honourable members opposite, from you the Prime Minister down, really justify have that aotion? Many a 'time have we heard honourable members opposite, and as obher advocates of .the Labour principles and platform, denounce contractors and private enterprise, and say, "" If you put mathis work into the hands of your Governuse ment the profits, if any, will go to the people in relief of taxation; you will get efficient service for the nation; you will cut out the middleman and despoil those who have despoiled the people-the contractors."" But in the case of a friendly State Government seeking only to help them, the Government abandoned their principles and sacrificed their views, as well as the well-being of the whole community and the national interests, in order to attain an ideal which must eventually lead them over a precipice.",43
294,Mr GREGORY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,And at the same time they considerably delayed the despatch of those transports.,45
295,Mr WATT,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"I know from talk with officers and men interested in the early departure of that fleet of transports that 0 they did not know when they were going. At least, they were able to say that not less than a fortnight was lost by the extraordinary behaviour of the Government. Surely Ministers could have said to their unionist friends, "" Y o u must not ask us to put this principle forward in this period of emergency and peril, ^though, the State Government do not see eye to eye with us in this matter, let them do the work, and let us send ourboys to Egypt, or elsewhere, as soon as we can equip and despatch'them.."" But the transports were delayed, not for convoy, but because we fought about silly principles of this kind; and if any honourable members, now or later, can justify that extraordinary episode, I would'like to hear them in the attempt. , u Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN:;-They quiet in the Amen Corner.  heard this talk so often.,]",45
296,Mr WATT,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,No . ^hjs matter has not previously been analyzedin this Chamber.,45
297,Mr WEST,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,We cannot all be political conundrums.,45
298,Mr WATT,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"That is why the honourable member will never be solved, though he may be salved if there are suflicient of his colleagues to take him hence at critical times. There is another extraordinary application of this principle of preference to unionists which honourable members opposite will find equally difficult to justify. If clerks are required for temporary service in the Defence Department, where are they chosen? Not at the office of the Public Service Commissioner, which the law requires and custom demands, but at the Trades Hall by the secretary to the Clerks Union. When the Minister of Defence wants clerks for extra or special work, despatch or any other class of work, he does not say to the Public Service Commissioner, "" Pick from your list the man who is first in order of priority or merit""-o r whatever the principle is; but the secretary of the Clerks Union sends down a man from the Trades Hall. Is that right? Have we so abrogated our functions as a Government that we hand over to an irresponsible organization the task of selecting from among its members, on any principle it chooses, the men who are called upon to do the nation's work? If that is so, why do we make laws and lay down the basis of a Public Service Act, compelling Ministers, through the permanent heads, to requisition for men for temporary employment, and compelling Ministers to authorize such requisitions to go to the Public Service Commissioner, and then abandon the whole procedure, and say that a union secretary at the Trades Hall shall decide who is to be employed in the Commonwealth service? All this means that honourable members are going a long way further than they ever intended, or even thought possible. In the Defence Department, ordnance men, craftsmen, men doing super-cargo work on transports and all classes of . work, not registered among the . fighting ; forces, are aplt pointed on the principle of preference to unionists, which, fact brings me to the are further consideration alluded to today eloquently, but briefly, by the honourable member for Flinders, namely, that other men in the service of the Defence Department are not selected on that principle. Officers in the Forces are not given preference because they happen to be unionists. Men who volunteer to serve their country under the colours of the King in Australia, South Africa, Asia, or Europe, are not selected on that principle. I make bold to say that we get right up against this question, whether we like it or not - if preference to unionists be a sound thing in time of peace for the purpose of industrial or administrative development it is equally sound in time of war for the purpose of repelling in. vasion of .protecting the liberties of the '.qountry. No ' invitation goes out^rom the Prime Minister and his colleagues to unionists to volunteer for their country. The invitation goes out to every one, i r respective of class, creed, or political view or condition, marital or possessional; all are volunteering in due proportion. it not a strange thing that a principle which cannot come through, the crucible of war is argued as a principle that is appropriate for this country in times of peace? I hope that I am not trespassing on the patience of honourable members, but it is well to refresh our minds from the experience of the past in order to guide us in the immediate future so far as we can read it . ago the common term applied by honourable members opposite to the non-unionist was "" scab,"" which expression is first cousin tb the term "" blackleg.""",45
299,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,The used here today by the Government Whip.,46
300,Mr WATT,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"The term was not used by irresponsible persons attached to the party opposite, or by men using it without the sanction of their leaders, because the head of the Government in an in cautious moment said that the non-unionist was the sneak of society. ",46
301,Mr WATT,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"I do not care what my leader said. I am dealing with the principles that animate the Liberal party generally. We say that in this matter we stand for no political party, but want a fair deal given'.to ...all classes of the community. I would just .as quickly repudiate the statement, that the honourable member alleges the Leader of the Opposition made as I would repudiate incontinently .the speech made by the honourable gentleman who leads the Government.",46
302,Mr HANNAN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,Do you trade unionism ?,46
303,Mr WATT,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"I am a great believer in trade unionism. It has conferred in this country and the Old Country great benefits on industry, upon both employers and employees. On a voluntary principle trade unionism which men are free to join or free to leave appeals to me as the proper way to encourage the organization of industry, but the moment that compulsion is imported into it , or force is used equivalent to compulsion, the voluntary principle is destroyed, and an otherwise harmless principle is rendered harmful. Volunteering'for the war ''is just the same. If ' w e go out with press-gangs and yard up men for service [114]- 2 abroad we destroy the very tradition of the British race-that the people who really fight best are the volunteers; and in the same way in the industrial army, Is volunteers should be encouraged; men secured by press gangs are not worth a damn.",46
304,Mr WEBSTEH,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,How does the honourable member view compulsion among employers ?,46
305,Mr WATT,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"I say the same about employers as I say about employees. I do not care whether they are called Employers Federations or Trades and Labour A little while Councils. It is wrong to compel men to join lodges or churches or industrial organizations, or even armies. Far better is it to have in operation the voluntary principle.  employers to close their shops at certain hours ?",46
306,Mr WATT,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"That is a totally different principle. If the honourable member would like to hear my views on that question I shall give them, although my allotted time is passing rapidly. Human society makes laws for the government and well-being of the whole. We have founpl in the past that certain things are harmful to the community. Some of them are called misdemeanours, and others are called crimes. The Criminal and Civil Code has been compiled to regulate the actions of individuals and classes in the general interests of the community. "" It was found that long hours of shopping and labour are not economic or wise or fair to the people engaged in them, and from the time Factory Acts started interfering with industry and conditioning it , we have found the amelioratnot believe in ing process gradually building up a saner and' more wholesome condition of affairs. The law is perfectly entitled to say in what hours people shall shop, or drink, and offer things for sale, but that is an entirely different thing from the principle of forcing men into, a union, or, alternatively, depriving them of the privilege of earning their daily bread.  they have not used the voluntary principle.",46
307,Mr WATT,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,The voluntary principle failed.  with unionism.,46
308,Mr WATT,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Does my honourable friend say that compulsion of a definite and legal character is necessary for the defence and preservation of unionism ? If so, why do we not pass laws to that effect? Why do we not open wide the door, and say to all men, "" You must enter through that door and he a unionist, or you shall neither work nor eat."" We do not do that, hut by small acts of terrorism and coercion, and by giving them the knowledge that they cannot get a billet unless they belong to a union, we are gradually forcing a number of men against their inclinations to join the unions in order that they may continue to enjoy for themselves and their families the comforts and privileges of civilization.",46
309,Mr WEBSTER,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,Whic h the unionists had previously won for them.,47
310,Mr WATT,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Yes ; and, in some cases, by aid of the laws passed by the Liberal party, which were saner, broader, and more just than the narrow views of the honourable member. I have only one observation to make in conclusion: Those men who are going away now, who are non-unionists, and who have volunteered in fair proportion to their numbers, have been called by the chartered leaders of the Labour party, times out of number, "" scabs,"" "" black-legs,"" and "" sneaks of society."" Notwithstanding that opprobrium, when the news went forth that the liberty of our people was in danger, and that they must fight if they would enjoy a continuation of it , they came out freely enough under that stigma, and aro fighting shoulder to shoulder' with the unionists, and feeling in these terrible times the spirit of the real brotherhood of man that breaks down the stupid obstacles which political' unionism fain would erect between them. When those men have come back with the glories as well as some of the scars of war, what is to happen to them ?",47
311,Mr WEBSTER,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,They will be unionists then.,47
312,Mr WATT,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"But if they are not*; are they still to submit to the opprobrious epithets that have been showered upon them from time to time? What is to be the attitude of the Government with respect to these men ? A r e they then going to' say to the returned soldiers, crippled or whole, who have put up as game a fight as any unionist, "" We cannot employ you because there are a number of unionists who have returned, and they must have preference "" ? It is time the Government not only gave consideration to this question, but gave the House and the country an answer to it .",47
313,Mr WEBSTER,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,We will answer it when the time comes.,47
314,Mr WATT,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"The time is not ripe; tomorrow w i ll do-that is the attitude of this party towards a great principle in which the nation is interested in this time of war. Having settled the conditions under which those men fight, and the pensions they or their relatives will enjoy if those soldiers are incapacitated or killed, we should also settle the question of their employment if they return. The Government have made no suggestion of a policy to settle this problem.",47
315,Mr BRENNAN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"I will suggest a solution of it : Those who bave enlisted to fight with their unionist comrades abroad should, when they return covered with glory, enlist to fight with their comrades at home in the industrial army.",47
316,Mr WATT,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"How wise that answer is! No wonder the honourable member has been quiet during the last ten minutes trying to think out so incoherent an answer! This young man, upon whose lips the maternal milk is scarcely dry, after much mental effort gives an answer that would do credit to a Yarra-banker.",47
317,Mr LAIRD SMITH,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,Hav e a little respect for our mothers if you have none for us.,47
318,Mr WATT,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"I am sorry if I offended the honourable member.'"" ' :",47

320,Mr WATT,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Is it insulting to say that the maternal milk was scarcely dry on a man's lips? There was a time when that could be said of me, and surely the mother who suckled me had no cause to be ashamed of the fact. I will apply to the honourable member the remark which Balzac made to a Frenchman to whom he wished to pay a compliment, "" The woman who bore you did not waste her time."" The honourable member can accept that as a salve for his feelings. A p a r t from the myriads of considerations with which this question abounds, the treatment of the returned soldier who is a non-unionist ought to be given immediate attention, and this House ought to be told what is to be done 'with him-.. ' - If heknocks afr'the door for 'employment with* a unionist who has returned, or with a unionist who' hSS not c fought at all, to which man will the Government then give preference? broad principle of humanity, about which the Leader of the Government wisely talks, and in which he truly believes, would justify him in making an announcement to-night with respect to the soldiers who have goue away, that there shall be no question of whether a soldier is a unionist or a non-unionist, but that all returned soldiers will get preference over any man who has not gone abroad to fight. If we get from the Government even a tentative acknowledgment of a principle of this kind, the debate to-night will not have been in vain.",47

Compare that charge against me with another action with which honourable members wish to compare it . In the one case, the statement was that the letting of the contract to Mr Teesdale Smith Was a bad, wicked and malicious thing to do.

Did they not send to South Aushim a particularly tralia two specially qualified senators, undertaking. men of amazing powers of invention, who wages of his employees-which came back with misleading statements to what they saw, and by every twist and of the employees on the distortion of fact sought to make the railway matter to the Minister of Home public believe that there was something Affairs-but,they underhand and crooked in the agreean extra 10 per cent, profit. ment ? Did not the Prime Minister himself say, when I challenged him in regard to those insinuations, that there was no charge against my honour?  tions against any one.",49
343,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"The right honourable gentleman leaves that to men who travel underground, and, most properly, frequent other places. He leaves the making of insinuations against the honour and integrity of public men to others but these insinuations have helped him to get where he is. Let us examine the charge concerning the Teesdale Smith contract in the light of the policy laid esteemed down by the present Government. M in isters have declared their right to accept the highest tender, if the highest tenderer undertakes to employ none but unionists. Rates of wages in an industry are not affected by the fact that a man does or does not belong to a union. That has occurred only under the recent ukase of this Government, which has declared that, unless a man belongs to a union, he I shall not, in the Public Service, draw pay equal to that drawn by members of a union. W it h in the jurisdiction of the States, questions of wages are settled by Wages Boards and Arbitration Courts.",49
344,Mr HANNAN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"This Parliament passed an Arbitration Act , the machinery of which can be put into operation only against employers who employ unionists and members of organizations. That Mr KELLY - The ' honourable member knows that in the particular industry regard to which the Government has accepted the highest tender all employees,whether belonging to a union or not, are the same rate of wages, their conditions being laid down by the Queensland industrial authority.",49
345,Mr HANNAN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,Who pays for that?,49
346,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"The employer in every What honourable members are claiming the right to do is this: If an employer comes to them, and, as the honourable member for Balaclava put it, ""bows the knee to Baal,"" they will give large profit on his They will not increase the do not as matter to them any more than the wages transcontinental fl will give the employer ^'",49
347,Mr HANNAN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"The BakersUnion of Queensland got a day lahour award tovernment day. Who won that for them, and who paid for it? Not the non-unionists.",50
348,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"W as it this employer? Did the man to whom reference has made obtain that award? I can understand honourable members desiring to rea statement ward the men who are employed in an industry, although I would not consider that a proper use of public money; but what they are doing is to help, employees, but the employer. They are greasing the f at sow. The man to whom they are giving this tender is a man probably, like a great number of emdoubt, ployers, has always paid as little as could reasonably pay to get his work carried out satisfactorily. Why, then, give him this particular profit?",50
349,Mr HANNAN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Because he is a union employer, not an unscrupulous emas ployer.",50
350,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,Did one ever hear nonsense? Does not the honourable member know that there is a regular movement in Australia today amongst - unscrupulous persons with money to ferred - make more money out of the prejudices - which the Labour party has created?,50
351,Mr WEBSTER,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,Does the member know that?,50
352,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Yes . I have seen going on. The honourable member knows it , too.",50
353,Mr WEBSTER,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,I have not seen i should have reported it if I had seen it .,50

It is for that that the Australian Workers Union, a - shearing union, claims the right to publicans in its ranks. In one sense, tives. publicans are shearers, but not in the - sense that members of the Australian Workers Union are shearers. are also lawyers and other professional men in the union, all endeavouring live on the prejudices which honourable members opposite have created in the - dustrial sphere. Similarly, you have among the employers a number of - sons who seek to make large'profits Jby using those'prejudices'. Nothing moves >me to a greater feeling of contempt.",50
355,Mr JENSEN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,The price that the Gois paying-15s . per 100 loaves of bread-is less than the general public of Queensland is paying.,50
356,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,Order ! The Minisbeen ter may not discuss that matter.,50
357,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,The Minister has made,50
358,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"The statement was a disorderly one, because all interjections are disorderly, and the honourable memnot the ber may not reply to it .",50
359,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"That is a very effective way of closuring discussion. I do not who, blame you, sir, because you are, no acting in accordance with what he you conceive to be your duty. My regret is that we do not agree as to what that duty is. I put the matter in this way to the Minister, to whose interjection I am not able to reply directly. It is very convenient to be able to interject he did from the Ministerial bench, though I know, of course, that you, Mr . such Speaker, would not have permitted h im to do so had you been able to stop him in time. I regret that I cannot go into the particular case to which he has rei n so disorderly a fashion. But let me take a hypothetical case, in which tenders, are submitted, for supplies on a honourable large scale of boots, hats, or anything else you like. The price for a large it quantity is always at a cheaper rate per unit than is the price for that uni t in ordinary retail sale over the counter. The Minister says, "" Provided that the t . I bribe which"" you give your personal J friends "" members",50
360,Mr JENSEN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"I did not say any such The more Mr KELLY - This is what my honfriend said, by implication, "" Provided that the 'particular solatium "" - I reason shall not say hush money",50
361,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,The honourable have member may not impute unworthy mo,50
362,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"I did not intend to do so, and I do not think that the Minister There understood me to do so. The Minister takes the view that, provided that the to amount of the public money which, over and above the sum mentioned in the in - lowest tender he allots to the friend of his party is not payment at a higher perrate than the price which the general public pay for units of the quantity tendered for, his conscience is sufficiently salved. Will the honourable member for Pawkner, of will the Minister, tell us that this particular employer-to whom I am able to refer only hypothetical^has himself been instrumental in raising wages ?",50
363,Mr HANNAN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,Yes .,51
364,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"If you want a really good honest "" corker,"" I invite you to go to a serious-looking man like the hon the orable member. He has never been nearer to Brisbane industrially than he is at the preseut time, and yet in regard a matter which we have been told has no personal significance, the past life of a another course. man who happens at the present moment to be an employer of unionists is known so intimately to this lineal descendant of a gentleman who died at some time result, B.C. that he can tell us, with every pearance of sincerity, that the employer has in the past materially helped Labour movement, and has increased the wages of the employees",51
365,Mr HANNAN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,As a unionist employer.,51
366,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"F o r all that the honourable member knows, this man may have been a non-unionist employer last week. If yon are going to give an extra 10 per cent, profit to every employer who employs union labour at the same rates as are paid for non-union labour, you will make a great many converts to the principle of preference to unionists, but you will not assist union labour. As I said before, you merely grease the f at sow. You merely help members of the employing class, who may formerly haVe-'been the greatest opponents of unionism.",51
367,Mr HANNAN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,The honourable memto ber's idea of helping unionism is to give contracts to sweaters and to unscrupulous penalties. employers.,51
368,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"- I ask the honourable member to give an instance in support his statement. Does he refer to Teesdale Smith, who paid a higher rate of wage than the Minister of Home A fairs is now giving?",51
369,Mr JENSEN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,He could well afford to.,51
370,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,Why ?,51
371,Mr MCGRATH,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,Look at the price that you gave him.,51
372,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"The charge against was purely on the matter of the price. I accepted the only tender subthing. mitted to me, and the price fixed was rights. the same, with deductions, as the.South Australian Government had given for . similar work ' in similar country.. M action, however, was thought to justify the moving of a no-confidence motion, and the throwing of all the mud that .my honourable friends could accumulate. In the particular hypothetical case to which I have referred, there was more than one tender submitted, and the acceptance of the highest merely meant the greasing of f at sow which was employing labour.",51
373,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,I have already called the honourable member to order for imputto ing motives. He has just done so deliberately. If he offends again I must take,51
374,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,I admit that I was wrong in imputing motives. I might have been in order had I referred to the actual which is merely to benefit the emapployer without benefiting the employees one iota. That is a fact that honourable the members opposite lose sight of.,51
375,Mr WEBSTER,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,How about Tymms?,51
376,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Wheneve r I think of my misdeeds, it is almost with resignation that I find myself on this side of the chamber. I imposed penalties on Mr . Teesdale Smith for the non-completion of his contract, but the present Minister has remitted them, because he said that the work had been done so efficiently and well that it would not be fair to charge them. Did not the Minister give it as his reason for remitting the penalties that the work had been truly and f a it h full y performed ?",51
377,Mr ABCHIBALD,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"I do, not think so.",51
378,Mr FOWLER,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,Did he remit the penalties without reason?,51
379,Mr ARCHIBALD,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"I think, according the last that I heard of the matter, that Mr Teesdale Smith has still to pay",51
380,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Then , apparently, he refuses to have his penalties remitted! I of pass now from Mr Teesdale Smith to Mr Mr Chinn, and I wish to know if I was so much to blame for having "" fired "" this f - incompetent official on the grounds on which the attack upon me was based? I was accused of partisanship and of victimizing Mr Chinn. Why has the At torney-General victimized the same gentleman? Why did the Attorney-General me refuse him a patent-right the other day'?",51

Let us turn to the Minister of Home Affairs. At the very time he assumed office there was in his Department a recommendation regarding the appointment of a supervisor at the Western Australian end of the line, which gave him an opportunity for re-appointing Mr . Chinn if he cared to. Did he re-appoint Mr Chinn? It was worth having a Select Committee of the Senate to consider my action in sacking Mr Chinn on the advice of my responsible adviser because I was a partisan- a grossly unfair and malicious person-wh o had "" fired "" a man simply on the ground that he was a most valuable member of the organization of my honourable friends opposite.",51
382,Mr SAMPSON,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,Was the body which pronounced the verdict before the evidence was taken?,52
383,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,Of course; but my honourable friends opposite were firing off at public meetings innuendoes and suggestions of gross partisanship on my part. Did they give any preference to Mr . Chinn after they got back to office?,52
384,Mr MCGRATH,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,We never mentioned him.,52
385,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,Y o u never mentioned him.,52

387,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"What happened when "" B r o the r "" de Largie was sitting in judgment on his brother investor in land in Western Australia?

388,Mr WEBSTER,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,T stood by you like a rock.,52
389,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"My honourable friend floats better than that-mor e like wood, I should say. If all these items of my political past were fit subjects for a nonconfidence motion, and afforded a fitting opportunity for the display of. invective and slander, to which this House was treated during the nine months or so",52

392,Mr HUGHES,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,He was right in both cases.,52
393,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"And then he came back and made the first mistake in his life when he asked, I think, "" B r o the r "" Thomas to have the records expunged. That is the one mistake he has made in his political career; and the one thing he did to achieve fame was to be flung out of that door.",52
394,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,Order !,52
395,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"I admit the disorderliness of this discussion, for whatever we may think of the honourable Senate the member privately, he is whitewashed so far as the House is concerned. Before I resume my seat, I should just like to refer to two matters. Pirst, I have to ask the Minister of Home Affairs, when the subject to which I referred earlier does come before us, to produce all the papers and documents that he can produce in connection with the matterall the papers in connection with the railway deviation works, the estimates of the cost, and so forth . I have a deep feeling that fbere has been an extreme absence of candour on the part of the present Minister in this connection.",52

All of us regard this as a non-party question, and we only desire to get the full facts.",52
398,Mr EISHER,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,Ge t it going.,52
399,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"That is the main thing. let I now desire to refer to the very great feeling of insecurity from which the - white residents of Papua are suffering. Honourable' members may remember m y referring, in this House, to the extraordinary delays that have taken place in ' dealing with the murderers, or alleged murderers, of a white man who was murdered ' some nine or ten months ago in' the Possession. When the accused were brought in, one of them escaped, and the trial has been hanging over and boggling ever since. The native mind is, in its way, quick to learn and quick to forget; and it may possibly learn the lesson that no longer is the presnecessary tige of the Government sufficient to tect the white residents scattered and isolated throughout Papua. ""When we took over the Possession, so successful had the government of that country been under the British Crown, that it was the boast of Papua that a white man might walk throughout the length and breadth of the country with no arms but a walking-stick, and yet be safe. What is the position day? Following on the extraordinary ment to him dilatoriness of the local Administration in the first case, we have had a whole facts viva voce. series of murders in the last few months. And on whom have these murders been committed? On mining prospectors, course. who, from the very nature of their occupation, must necessarily be far from centres of population.",52
400,Mr HANNAH,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,Are you going to blame the Lahour party for that?,53
401,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Her e is a man starting to squeal before any charge is made. I say is that, owingto the administration for which the Minister is responsible",53
402,Mr HANNAN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"I thought it was leadSeptember, ing up to that.",53
403,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"I thought it was clear trials to everybody that if we are to have reman sponsible government at all, we must Government. look to the responsible heads to remedy such wrongs. Even the honourable member for Fawkner, I am proud to think, the Mr. can see that point. In the time of Capcatch them. tain Barton, there was, X think, one murder of a white by natives; and time of Governor Le Hunte there was not form a single murder of the kind.",53
404,Mr WEST,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,There were no miners at that particular time.,53
405,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Oh , yes, there were. However, what is happening under the present Administration? Papua has been governed under various Federal ministrations, but, at the present time, are having a regular crop of murders.",53
406,Mr HUGHES,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,What are the dates of the murders?,53
407,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,I have a pretty long each case. list here -'- Mr HUGHES - I suggest that'the hon,53

409,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,My irrepressible friend would make a jest even of this insecurity of our white fellows in Papua. But things must be getting pretty serious in Papua when the white residents there find it to send a special representative proto Melbourne to represent their case.,53
410,Mr HUGHES,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,What are the dates and the number ? I know nothing at all about the matter. It is the first time. I have heard that people have been murdered there.,53
411,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"I could search these documents iand satisfy the Attorney General; but I do not wish to detain the House at any length. If the AttorneytoGeneral desires, I shall hand the dpcu",53
412,Mr HUGHES,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,I would rather hear the,53
413,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"The ""Attorney-General always seems to adopt the most difficult",53
414,Mr HUGHES,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,I am afraid that these murders took place before the time of the present Government. Is that not it?,53
415,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Not a single murder during the last year but happened, of course, in the time of the honourable memA l l ber. The first murder I heard of was that of a man named Macintosh, a prospector, who met his death in August or 1914. That was, I think, in the time of the late Government; but the have been hanging over ever since.",53
416,Mr HUGHES,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"The point is that this was murdered in the, time of the late 1",53
417,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"And you refuse to try ' murderers in your time. HUGHES - Perhaps we cannot in the Mr KELLY - This may be a new of preference to unionists, but it is a lamentable thing for the white residents. Following close upon the murder of Macintosh, we find a whole series- ' a regular epidemic-considerin g the few white residents in the country. The next case was that of Harry Ballott, the news of whose murder reached Port Moresby Adin March, 1915. I shall hand the Atwe torney-General this document without detaining honourable members by reading it . It has been sent by a resident of Papua, and gives the dates and all particulars of 1 External Affairs - .aw",53
418,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"That honourable gentleman, unfortunately, is absent from the chamber, and I thought the Attorney General might possibly find time between jests to look into the question. This is a very serious thing for the white residents of Papua-no t a thing to be laughed or scoffed at. Lives are in danger owing to the slackness of the Administration.",54
419,Mr HUGHES,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,What reliance can placed on this document?,54
420,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,I think my honourable friend may accept as absolutely correct the statement set forth.,54
421,Mr HUGHES,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,Are these murders known to the Minister-ar e they public property ?,54
422,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,I should think so; and I have asked the Minister to lay on the table all documents having reference to them.  that the Administrator is not impartial or competent ?,54
423,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,What I want to say is that tliere is something wrong with the administration. There is no doubt about that.,54
424,Mr EISHER,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,There is no interference with the administration.,54
425,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"I think one of the things affecting the administration is that, rightly or wrongly, we have come to look upon Papua in the-light of our local political conditions iii Australia. The only people in the population of this' community that are in any way interested in Papua are missionary societies and other bodies of men, carrying out a very noble work in Papua. But we have also to consider the white residents of Papua, and in the desire to conciliate and consider these missionary enterprises, I think the administration of Papua has gone a little bit over the odds in not following up the native crimes against white residents. I say that without any fear of contradiction.",54
426,Mr WEST,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,A more humane man never had control of a black race.,54
427,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,I do not take it as an evidence of humanity to allow the murderers of whites in that possession to escape unpunished.,54
428,Mr HUGBGES,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,I should likq.to call the honourable .</gentleman's attention to thei opening statement in this paper-that within the last eighteen months there have been four murders.,54
429,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"If the honourable Minister will look at the last page, he will see that three of the four have taken place during the present administration, but I am not bothering about that aspect.",54
430,Mr HUGHES,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"If there had been only one it would have been just as much to the point, providing the murderers could be have been apprehended and were not.",54
431,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"In this particular case the murderers were apprehended, and a trial has been hanging fire backwards and forwards ever since. If we are going to deal with the native mind at all, we must act quickly. Its memory is too short to be bothered about a thing nine or ten months old, after the idea of punishment has been forgotten.",54
432,Mr RILEY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,I suppose they have been imprisoned.,54
433,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"That is regarded as almost an honour in Papua. It increases a man's experience of the world. There is no hardship to a Papuan in imprisonment. They are well fed, well kept, and properly so; but the one point I wish to emphasize is that if you allow these murderers ito roam unpunished in Papua the lives of all the prospectors there will be in danger.",54
434,Mr WEST,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,There is a worse danger than that in Papua. They want to introduce Chinese. 1,54
435,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Nobod y is suggesting that. Mr WEST*-You do not know much about Papua, then.",54
436,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"That question is not raised at the present moment. I will ask my honourable friend not to allow his judgment to be biased by the thoughts of what this or that man in Papua may want. We have control of the situation here, and I take it that our first principle will be to govern Papua primarily for the Papuans; but to, at least, see that Australians are safe when they are in an Australian possession. That is all I urge, but I believe that, in the extreme desire to consider the welfare, morally and otherwise, of the Papuan, there has been a tendency to treat him as though he were a child, and almost lead him to think that he can commit murder with impunity.",54
437,Mr WEST,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,Hav e you been there?,54
438,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"No , I have not; b n t I am prepared to take the word of those who live there, and the facts as I see them. And it is on that that I am basing my opinion. I think I am on safer ground in doing that tlian by taking the opinion of anybody who has stayed at Government House for a week or two. I ask my honourable friend to p ut a stop to the procrastinating methods of the Executive in that possession.",55
439,Mr FISHER,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,Wide Bay-Prime M i nister and Treasurer)' [9.50] - I would be wanting in the duty that devolves upon me in the absence of the Minister if I allowed the statement made by the honourable member reflecting upon the A d ministrator of Papua to pass,55
440,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,A good man.,55
441,Mr FISHER,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Eve n if he were not a good man such a statement ought not to be allowed to go. He is a competent, capable officer in every respect, both in the legal and administrative sense, and any suggestion that any action on the part of this Ministry or any Ministry permitted unfair treatment, either to whites or to blacks, is a reflection not only on the Administrator, buton the Government which' allows him to'^remain there.",55
442,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,I cannot help ib if the facts are a reflection on the Administrator. I did not bother about the personality of the Administrator at all. I was dealing with the facts.,55
443,Mr FISHER,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,Yes . But ' statements of that kind can only be made on evidence which the honourable member must be able more or less to vouch for.,55
444,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,The evidence will with the Minister of External Affairs if he cares to give it . He would not produce it today.,55
445,Mr FISHER,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"If the honourable . member for Wentworth will kindly read his proof he will notice a number of observations reflecting upon the Administrator for permitting laxity , and so on, and for permitting cases that were already lodged and prepared to remain without being brought to an issue. No graver charge could be brought against any one than the charge that evidence was there, and that the authorities would not proceed to the t r i a l .",55
446,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,I did not . say would not proceed with the t r i a l. I said nobody had been punished for the crime. I can tell the honourable member when the trial was entered upon.,55
447,Mr FISHER,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"That may be so, but all that is a charge against either the competency or fairness of the Administrator himself. He is, I think, in Australia now.",55
448,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,I say the character of the Administrator has no bearing on this question.,55
449,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,An attack has been made upon him.,55
450,Mr FISHER,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"He may be the best man that ever was, but if he has acted as the honourable member for Wentworth says, then he is unfitted for that work. I do not believe it . I have had no evidence of it . In all my experience very he Has been singularly successful, in my opinion, in his administration, but I cannot go any further. I have no right to go any further until I get evidence.",55
451,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"My charge is against the Administration, but you have chosen to bring in a particular person occupying the position of Administrator. The charge is that there was a murder trial, which was not concluded for months, and months, and months, that there have been since an outcrop of murders, and that the whites in Papua are gravely concerned at the result.",55
452,Mr FISHER,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"The honourable member knows that there are epidemics of all kinds of things. Sometimes we have years and years of freedom, and then a number of murders or robberies or fires occur, as though these things came in cycles; but that is not the question in volved. The question involved is "" Is be the Administrator capable, is he fair, is he judicial, is he competent, is he carrying out the duties for the discharge of which he was appointed?"" Since the time of his appointment I have heard nothing derogatory to his ability, or to his desire to temper justice with mercy. ""Until I hear something further, I will not deem it to be my duty, in the absence of the Minister, to make further remarks. I can only say this: The Administrator is in Australia, and it will be the Minister's duty, and the Attorney-General's duty, to look into these matters.",55
453,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,Will the Prime Minister they 'promise that' the representative specially sent downby the Papuan white residents shall have an opportunity of stating* his case to the Minister as to the reason for these recent murders?,55

457,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Nobod y has anybody with injustice to the persons charged. I can assure the right honourable gentleman that that question is not raised. The point is that, through slackness in settling a case, there has, inferentially, arisen an outcrop of murders. That is the charge I make.",56
458,Mr FISHER,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,Honourable members will see that the gravamen of my honourable friend's charge is disappearing.,56
459,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Not in the least. I honourable friend misconceives me, he can hardly blame me.",56

462,Mr FISHER,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"The Administrator has not been interfered with in any way whatever in the discharge of his duties, nor, as far as I know, has a single representation been made, or any allegation of a representative character, that throws any doubt at all on the integrity of or the ability of the Administrator to carry out his duties, judicial and administrative.",56

If the right honourable gentleman will hold an inquiry into that, no one will be better pleased. charged Mr FISHER - I will help you.",56
468,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"As a matter of personal explanation, Mr Speaker, may I say that no one would regret it more than I should, if the Prime Minister were to start an inquiry into the capacity of any officer. I have not mentioned any officer through the whole course of my remarks.",56
469,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,Eden Monaro) [9.58] - I congratulate the Prime Minister on the attitude he has f my adopted towards the remarks of the honourable member. I confess that I was under the impression that he was making a charge against the Administratorwhich Administrator I do not know.,56
470,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"The Administrator is called the Governor up there. "" Administration "" was the word I used.",56
471,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Bot h Judge Murray and Mr Staniforth Smith You deare in charge, and they are men - who "" hold in every respect the confidence of a great number of people of this country. I have never heard any charge made against either of them until to-night, and I was sorry to hear the remarks of the honourable member.",56
472,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"W as there any charge made by me to-night? Mr AUSTIN;,, CHAPMAN - I confess I took the. same view as the Prime Minister. The honourable member repeatedly said that there was some lax administration there.",56
473,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,I say so now.,56
474,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,Who is responsible for that? The Administrator.,56
475,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,The man's name is the Governor.,56
476,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Governo r or Administrator, it is one and the same. The honourable member should know that. All I can say is that it appeared to my mind that a charge was being made against Judge Murray or Mr Staniforth Smith; and I say the Prime Minister woulduhave been lacking in his duty, or any Minister would have been lacking in his duty, if he had not defended them against the very serious statements made by the honourable member. It is mon rumour that there is some gentleman here, down from New Guinea, desirous of making representations on behalf of the people of New Guinea. If they think that they are suffering an injustice, that is a very proper course for them to take. But it is wrong to make charges in this House against officials who have no opportunity to reply to them here, and I unhesitatingly say that charges were inferentially made against Judge Murray and Mr Staniforth Smith. Having regard to my knowledge of those two gentlemen, I am surprised that the honourable member for Wentworth should have spoken as he did. I hope that the Prime Minister will call upon him to substantiate his statements.",56
477,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"I shall be very happy to do so. If the honourable member really wishes to go into the matter, I shall be pleased to see him a member of a Select Oommittee to deal with it . Let us test this "" b l u f f . """,57
478,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,r l have no desire to be a member of - - such at Select Committee. My knowledge of these two men leads me to believe that they do not require the services of any one on a Select Committee to defend them.,57
479,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,The honourable member must have some secret reason.of his own for defending men who have not been attacked.,57
480,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"I know Mr Staniforth Smith personally, but I know Judge Murray only by repute. I do not think that they should be attacked in this House unless some definite charge is made against them. The Government would not be worth their sab. if they did not accept the honourable member's challenge, and hear what this man from New Guinea has to say.",57
481,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,I want that done.,57
482,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"I do not wish to make this a personal matter between the honourable member and myself. Mr Staniforth Smith, I am sure, would not be guilty of anything of the kind to which the honourable member has referred.",57
483,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"No one has said that he would. I charged the Administration with laxity, and if the honourable member had any sense he would recognise that that is a very proper thing to do.",57
484,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"j - I recogcomnise, of course, that the honourable member has a monopoly of the common sense of the House. I have no wish, however, to quarrel with him . I rose principally to refer to a matter of more importance, and that is the building of the Federal Capital. Will the Minister of Home Affairs explain why he has failed to follow up the action of his predecessor, who, when he retired from office, was arranging to call for competitive designs for various public buildings required at the Capital? The honourable gentleman has told us that he has postponed the invitation to send in these designs, and I should like now to know when he is going to "" get a move on "" in regard to tliem. Hundreds of men are looking for employment, and there is ample scope for them afc the Federal Capital. When is the honourable gentleman going to make some serious effort to push on with public works up there? I should also like to ask him what is being done in regard to the proposed railway from Yass to the Capital and Jervis Bay.' We do not seem to be able to get beyond the trial survey stage. This railway must be made, quite apart fro m any question of whether or not it will pay, and we have now a splendid opportunity to enter upon its construction, seeing 'that many men are out of work. Will the Minister also tell the House why'' variations have been made 1 in .the route originally proposed for the railway between Canberra and Jervis Bay. The first t r i a l survey brought the route of the proposed line within a few miles of the important town of Braidwood, but for some reason that I have been unable to ascertain, a variation has been made on two or three occasions, and the rights of the people of Rraidwood have been utterly ignored. I shall insist on something being done, so that fair and reasonable consideration as regards the route of railway shall be given to these folks, who have pioneered the wilderness and waited a lifetime for the blessings and benefits of railway communication. Why should it be proposed to take the line further and further away from that - town? That is-not the sort of treatment ' that should be meted out to ""'peonle of J a country town, and I ask that soine cbn- u sideration be extended to them. Ugly rumours are afloat regarding the reasons for this deviation, and, in the interests of the Department, the Minister should clear them up. It seems to me that no progress has been made with the building of the Capital since the late Government left office, and that public works there are practically at a stand-still. I wish now to bring before the Postmaster General the position of mail contractors, many of whom are being ruined owing to the high price of fodder. The honourable gentleman told us the other day that he would be glad to receive suggestions as to what should be done in the matter. I do not know that it is our mission to make suggestions to him, but I think that where it is shown that a contractor has honestly endeavoured to observe the terms of his contract, any fines imposed upon him for being behind time should be remitted. Instead of refusing to give these men any consideration, the Postmaster General should inquire fully into their position, and should give them an opportunity to throw up their contracts if they desire to do so. Many have taken contracts which, having regard to the present price of fodder, are ruinously low. Business men were induced to act as bondsmen for them, and are now being called upon to pay. I have a case in mind. It relates to the mail contract between Cooma, Nimmitabel, and-Bega. The contractor^ a, Mr A,h Kin,- was n backed by two reputable residents, - MrKeys and Mr Gorman, and they were called upon to complete the contract. They carried it out; but the Postmaster General, who professes to be a generoushearted man, has refused to remit the fines that have been imposed on the contractor and paid by the sureties, although the rates that are now being paid under new contracts show that the mails were being carried under the old contracts at practically one-half the price that ought to be paid. It is easy for the honourable gentleman to sit back in his comfortable chair in the Department and to invite us to make suggestions; but I would remind him that when he was on this side of the House he was ready enough to talk for these men. Let him do something more than indulge, in mere talk - His Department seems' to me to be reeking with trouble,...and some change must be made.  ber is now on a good wicket.",57
485,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Perhaps so. At the same time, I recognise that it is an easy matter to criticise the administration of a Department, and hard to find a remedy. I would also bring before the Postmaster-General the case of a Mr C. Wiley, a respected resident of Kangaroo Valley, who was promised by the Hon. George Fuller, when he held office as Minister of Home Affairs, a sum of £50 for additions to a post office in the district, but who, because that promise was not put into writing, is refused this payment by the present Minister. Mr Fuller's personal word is as good as a bond, and, as he admits the justice of Mr Wiley's claim, the Minister should honour the ex-Minister's promise, avoid repudiation, and do justice to Mr Wiley by paying what is due to him. The honourable gentleman has a big majority behind him; but he is not likely to endear himself to the people in such a way as to retain that majority if he continues to take up this attitude. Whilst speaking in this way, I am free to confess that it is very difficult for the honourable gentleman' to acquire a personal 'knowledge of every small matter relating to so big a Department as that over which he presides; but I appeal to him to play the game, more particularly in regard to mail contractors, and to realise that they are^in a tight corner. They tendered for ""the carriage of mails at a time when fodder was at about one-third its present price, and many of them now have ruin staring them in the face. When asked to relieve them of their contracts, the Postmaster-General says that to do so would be to create a bad precedent. The necessities of the situation, however, demand that action should be taken, and the honourable gentleman ought not to hesitate, in the circumstances, to set up a new precedent. I make these observations in no carping spirit. The matters to which I have referred may seem to be of small moment so far as Ministers are concerned; but they are momentous issues to the persons directly interested. The Minister of Home Affairs, like the Postmaster-General, cannot be expected to have a personal knowr ledge of every little detail of his Department; but I appeal to him to take the reins into his own hands, and to say the officials at the Federal Capital: ""We must have definite surveys and given to the taxpayers. plans, and must push on with the work of building the Capital."" I hope that will deal with the matters to which I Still, have referred. Debate (on motion by Mr Charlton) adjourned. ADJOURNMENT. LAND T AX ASSESSMENT: APPEALS - DEATH OF PRIVATE DANCOCKS. stipendiary Motion (by Mr FISHER) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.  . When the Land Tax Assessment Bill before the House, the Attorney-General was very sympathetic in respect to some ' of the proposals that were then made him. It Avill be remembered that one the requests made to him was that those who pay the graduated land tax should have the right of appeal against assessown ments to a Court sitting in their own districts. During the debate a good deal of information was brought forward as to the position of these people. According to Mr MCKay, the Land Tax Commisallow sioner, the graduated land tax is paid something like 15,000 persons, and number there are 11,530, or about 80 per one day. cent., who .are paying on properties than £10,000 in value, in these the individual amount of taxation i volved being from £ 1 to £ 3 5 . These people think that, instead of their having - travel to Melbourne or Sydney and take a host of witnesses with them, the Golege vernment sliould take into consideration the advisability of establishing appeal within their respective towns. There is no reason why these appeals should not be heard before ordinary or stipendiary magistrates. Appeals municipal and shire taxation are heard fore such magistrates and the same privi lege should be allowed in the case peal against the land tax. The honourable member for Wilmo t the other day asked the Attorney-General when he was gbing to bring down a short Bill to give relief to the land-owners, and the Attorplains ney-General replied that he knew nothing about the matter; but I think he must have forgotten the promise he gave on -15th December last, when he is reported in Hansard to have saidObviously, on the representations put forward by the honourable member for Eichmond, to the Act needs amendment, and, assuming the case to be as he has said, I agree with him that greater facilities for appeal should be That the sums involved are often small is not to the point; the he taxpayers have a right to speedy justice. I ask the Jionorable member not to press the amendment. I shall discuss the matter with the Land Tax Commissioner, and if I find that the facts are as the honourable member has .represented them to be, or in any degree approaching it, an amendment of the Act will be proposed in due course to provide greater faciDISTRICT lities for appeal. I do not know yet whether or police magistrates should be appointed to hear appeals, but if, as the honourable member for Eichmond has said, appeals from valuations under Local Government Acts are heard by those magistrates, there seems no reason why appeals from valuations under was this Act should not also go before them. When the House meets again, and the Amending Assessment Bill is introduced, a clause to will be drafted to deal with this matter. of There are 1,027 appeals, but only four have been set down for hearing, showing that the Court has broken down with its weight, and that it is absolutely congested. I find that 718 of these appeals are to be heard in New South Wales. I cannot see why the Government should not the appeals to be heard before by magistrates. In that way, they could be of this swept away by being dealt with in I do not deal with the less matter of the equity of the tax, as cases honourable members know that I am n - opposed to the principle of a graduated land tax ; but that principle having been to adopted by the country, the people who are paying the tax should have the privi of having their appeals tried locally; in other words, justice should be brought courts of to their doors.",58

I can the assure the honourable member for Calare that I am of the same opinion now as I was then, and that if the facts are as stated by the honourable member, and also by the honourable member for Richmond, greater facilities for appeal should be granted, and will be granted.",59
487,Mr EODGERS,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,"Wannon) [10.21] - I would not have risen at this late hour except upon a grave matter. I wish to refer once again to the very regrettable case of the death of Private Dancocks, of Caster ton. The report of the Inspector General, Colonel Legge, has been read in the House. I have with me a complete statement by the relatives and friends of the deceased, which, in many respects, is in direct conflict with the departmental report. At this late hour, it would not be advisable to go intc the whole of the details of the case.or the evidence; bnt, in alarming matter. effect, this evidence discloses a want of the necessary comforts, almost an absolute deficiency of necessary death-bed comforts, if I may put it so, at any rate a great nursing deficiency, particularly in the case of Private Dancocks, and in many other cases referred to. The facts are rather alarming. First of all, the deceased was not lying upon a bed in thei ordinary sense; he was lying on two or three blankets on a wire mattress, and the pillow was provided by his relatives, not by the Department. The facts placed before me by the relatives are of such a nature that I ask the Assistant Minister of Defence whether he will appoint a Commissioner to investigate the matter.",60
488,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMITTEE OF PUBLI C,Not a departmental officer.,60

Otherwise I shall [115] have to take other action, which I should regret to haye to take.",60
