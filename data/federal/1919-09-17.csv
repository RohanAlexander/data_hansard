1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. W. Elliot Johnson) took the chair at 3 .p.m., and read prayers. PERSONAL EXPLANATION. PEACE TREATY : REPARATION. . Mr HUGHES.'- I desire to make a personal explanation. In the course of my speech in moving, on Wednesday last, that .the House approve of the Peace - Treaty, I quoted from memory some figures relating to reparation. I find that the figures I gave vere not those which were in my notes. I , therefore, desire to' make a correction, to which I shall ask the press tp give the widest publicity. I also ask the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) to make a special note of it. Instead of stating that Australia's war expenditure amounted to £300,000,000, and that the capitalized value of pensions, &c, was £54,000,000, I should have said that our actual war expenditure was £364,000,000, and that the capitalized value of pensions, repatriation,' loss to civilians, arid civilian property, &o., incidental to . 'the war, amounted . to £100,000,000. As the matter is of vital importance' to Australia, and is entirely non-party, I have, with the permission of Mr 'Speaker, already made the necessaay corrections in 1%ansard. . PAPERS.

P RESENTATION OF BIBLEAND government LECTERN TO PARLIAMENT .",21
2,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown," I desire to announce that H i Excellency the Governor General, Sir Ronald Munro Ferguson, accompanied hy Her Excellency Lady Munro Ferguson of and representatives of the British and Foreign Bible Society of Yictoria, assembled in the north lobby of Parliament House on Friday afternoon for the purship pose of presenting to the Commonwealth Parliament a Bible and lectern from Bible Society as a souvenir of the signing* of Peace. Their Excellencies were reJohnson),  on hehalf of the Parliament, and by Chapthe lain-General Rentoul, D.D., and Mr . 'John M . Griffiths on behalf of the British and Foreign Bible .Society. The followappreciation ing' is the official report of the proceed™ ^ HISEXCELLENCY , in making the panying presentation, said-It is my privilege present this copy of the Scriptures to Commonwealth Parliament on behalf of Commonwealth the Bible Society, an organiaztion which has a long, ancl illustrious history. douht, many members of Parliament are storation, familiar with the works of the society's greatest colporteur, George Borrow, and have n-ead his celebrated book, The Bible in Spain. In his day, centuries ago, need for the activities of the Bible Society were very .apparent, and evidenced by story of one great coal master betting another that he could not say the Lord's Prayer, and paying the for f e it when friend triumphantly vindicated his knowledge by repeating the 23rd psalm. In contrast to this we can trace in the most mundane deliverances of a hustled and bustled Prime Minister evidences of fami liarity with . Bible - language) wi thout which no man can measure the strength,' preflexibility, the majesty aud rhythm of the English tongue. I come from a country h where, as in Wales, the Bible has played great part in moulding national character and stimulating the intellectual deScotland has, with. no doubt, had other pre-occupations-sh e . has never neglected a bawbee-bu t she owes her moral stability and her attachto the eternal verities to the fact that 1918. for centuries the Bible has been the standard work in the home and in the school. The Bible Society and parliamentary are typically British institutions. One strives to promote the good of man and of the nation by implanting s high ideals in the heart of the individual, and the other by engrafting such ideals and giving them permanence in the laws the country. It is fitting, therefore, that. this Book should be given, by the - Bible Society to Parliament to stand in its Library as a symbol of the co-partnerof two forces working in very different fields for the good of the country the and the up lift of national life. "" Mr SPEAKER (Hon. W . Elliot in accepting the g if t , said.Your Excellency and representative's of Victorian .branch of the British and Foreign Bible Society: I desire to express, on behalf of honourable members, a deep of the handsome g if t of this 'beautifully-bound copy of the Bible aud the appropriately-designed lectern accomi t . N ot only will the Bible, to with its historical inscription, be a the v.alued and distinctive addition to the Library, but it will stand as a constant reminder of the fact that its No presentation was .associated with the reof a condition of peace following upon four years and a half of unprovoked warfare, waged with relentless ferocity and unparalleled cruelty and inhumanity the against peacefully disposed countries by a nation intoxicated with the mad lust of the power, ambition, and world conquest. A gigantic world-encompassing conflict was precipitated as the ultimate consehis quence of. the vicious ethical and moral training ,of tke '""people of Germany, and flagrant disregard'<of the principles ,and noble Christian ideals .enshrined within the .covers ©f this sacred Book. Honourable members generally, I am sure, heartily appreciate the gift, and the spirit by which it was prompted. May I express the hope that, it will ever serve to inspire us all in the performance of our duties as legislators to strive to mould the destinies of Australia in harmony with its great ideals, its lessons, and its precepts. I commend to the earnest consideration of honourable members, before they return to the chamber to renew their legislative duties, a quotation inscribed on the - cover, from a psalm with which, dotibtless, many, if not all, of them are familiarBehold 'how good and how pleasant it brethren to dwell together in unity. ""The PRIME MINISTER (Mr the  dent, and Mr Speaker --J _ feel ill - our thanks and. appreciation. equipped to speak those words .that ought to be spoken upon such an given. occasion, as this. Whatever gifts - of speech >I may have, - are, I fear, utterly unsuited to serve .my present ""purmy pose; but, on behalf of my fellow-memmotion bers, .1 desire 'to say as well as ' I can how gathering. much we appreciate this manifestation of that which His Excellency has signalized as 'the joy which is in the hearts himself and of the - people - of Australia, of the Empire, and of the world, that Peace has come :at last. Tn what concrete form could he have expressed that joy which would be one-half so suited to the occasion as in the presentation of this Bible? "" On earth jjeace, good-will toward men !"" That is in our hearts.; and that is our .purpose. The Australian nation - emergin g as it is after dreadful trials in the Valley of the Shadow of Death.; and, turning its face towards the rising sun, heavily laden, surrounded on all sides by pitfalls, ""beset by difficultiesshall find in those words which are here set out that consolation, that counsel, advice, that stimulus for courage and patience, which alone can see us through. _ ""Your Excellency, on hah alf of the liament, I thank you. I hope that terminate succeeding generations will' 'regard this able hour. as ..one .of those things which .mark the rspirit in which - the Australian [people, who hiafve dene their duty 'nobly in the wa<r, .accepted .a great victory-no t arrogantly, not in a spirit - of^ vengeance, hut in a spirit of true thankfulness; offering up to the Diety who has had us in His kindly keeping these many and dark years those thanks for all that we owe 'to Hiirn.

6,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIA N NURSES IN, The 'Prime Minister has just intimated that notice must be given of all questions addressed to him.,24
7,Mr WALLACE,AUSTRALIA N NURSES IN,"Then I shall address my question to the 'Minister for Trade and Customs. A recent notification sets out :fhat the Postmaster-General has reduced 'the commission on the sale - of postage stamps by small retailers from 2i,per cent, to 1 per cent. Are we to take this as an indication of the profit that will bo allowed traders generally when the Government decide to deal with profiteering?",24
8,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIA N NURSES IN,The .honourable member's question should be addressed to the Postmaster-General. EMPLOYMENT OF ^RETURNED SOLDIERS. GRA NT TO MTTRICIEAL COUNOIUS.,24
9,Mr MACKAY,AUSTRALIA N NURSES IN,"Will the Minister representing the Minister for Repatriation state whether particulars have yet been obtained ias to the number of local governing bodies that have made application for a grant out of the sum of £500,000 ^allotted to them .by the Commonwealth to provide employment for reTurned soldiers?  tion, and after questions have been dealt shall make a statement on the subWAR WORKERS.",24
10,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIA N NURSES IN,"I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Repatriation whether consideration is likely to given ,to the claims of the returning returned war workers in.regard to reallowance and sustenance?  two deputations of munition and 'others 'have made representations to the ^Department on the subject. The first of these, which took place some time ago, and was received by me, requested that wav w-orkers should be"" allowed to participate in the Department's housing and land schemes. But they pointed out distinctly that in neither case did they wish to be placed on the same footing as returned soldiers. In other words, they were quite agreeable that the latter should have preference. The Minister for Repatriation (Senator Millen) has since made an announcement that Cabinet has approved of making representations to the .States, asking them to treat war workers on the same footing as returned soldiers in regard to land ment and of placing war workers on the same basis as returned soldiers in regard to'housing. In regard to the latter,'an amendment of the Act will be necessary. At the subsequent deputation on Monday .last the request put forward was more extensive, and I am not aware of what the Minister's decision was. AUSTRALIAN IMPERIA L FORCE.

13,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA N NURSES IN,Has any arrangement been made to release those members of the Australian Imperial Force who are still in gaol?,25
14,Mr WISE,AUSTRALIA N NURSES IN,"It has already been pointed out that all members of the Australiam, Imperial Force convicted of military offences have been released, and that others will have certain remissions of their sentences for each year of imprisonment. REFRIGERATED iSPACE ON OVERSEA VESSELS.",25
15,Mr SAMPSON,AUSTRALIA N NURSES IN,".Can the Minister lor Trade and Customs give the House any further'information in regard to the arrangements made for securing extra refrigerated space on vessels, for the purpose of conveying foodstuffs to the Old Country, and thus relieving the congestion in the cold stores of .Australia ?",25
16,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIA N NURSES IN,"The latest information from Great Britain is that 40,000 tons of refrigerated space will be made available for Australia for the month of October, and this will materially relieve the existing congestion in the cold stores. If a similar allotment is made in the following months, I do not anticipate that there will be any great difficulty in dealing with all the refrigerated produce in Australia that will be available for storage settle- before the end of the year. ' NORTHERN TERRITORY. TAXATION PROSECUTIONS.",25
17,Mr BRENNAN,AUSTRALIA N NURSES IN,"(The attention of the Minister for Home and Territories has doubtless been directed to a certain condition of affairs in the Northern Territory, where a resident has declined to pay income tax, and I ask him whether he knows of a better method of collecting the tax than by giving the residents of the Northern Territory representation in this Parliament?",25
18,Mr GLYNN,AUSTRALIA N NURSES IN,"I do not know that the giving of representation in this House will lead to the collection of the income tax, though, of course, it is a matter that deals with the essential principles of representation. However, I was not aware that a writ had been issued. It is entirely a question for the Taxation Department. WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT. PROSECUTIONS.",25

24,Mr HUGHES,INTERNATIONA L LABOU R,I am not responsible for what appears in newspapers. There is no truth in the statement. HIGH COURT.,26
25,Mr BRENNAN,INTERNATIONA L LABOU R,"Has the attention of the Minister for Works and Railways been directed to some judicial and, no doubt, judicious observations made by Mr Justice Powers, in the course of which he pointed out that he was a kind of refugee in Victoria looking for a house in which to administer justice, there being no court-room available for him, and that he would protest to the Government. I address this question to the Minister for Works and Bailways, because in his capacity as Acting Attorney-General he has possibly been more in touch with this matter than any other Minister, and I ask him what is prbposed to be done in order that the housing question shall be settled so far as our High Court Justices are concerned ?",26
26,Mr GROOM,INTERNATIONA L LABOU R,"The Victorian Government have been treating the High Court very generously in supplying buildings for its purpose, but last year difficulty arose about procuring a suitable room, and the Crown. Law Department immediately wrote to the State Attorney-General expressing appreciation of what had already been done 'by the .State Government, and asking them to meet the wishes of the Commonwealth. The reply was that a certain court-room was available for the High Court. A copy of the communication, was forwarded to the Justices of that Court, and nothing further was heard in regard to the matter until the complaint was made in' open Court the other day. I have already given instructions that a letter shall be addressed to the State Attorney-General, in order to prevent a recurrence' of the incident. ANZAC TWEED INDUSTRY.",26
27,Mr FENTON,INTERNATIONA L LABOU R,"Is the Minister representing the Minister for Repatriation aware of the present condition of the ANZAC hand-weaving tweed industry?

HUGHE SThat this House approves of the Treaty ot Peace between the Allied and Associated Powers and Germany signed at Versailles on the 2Sfch June, 1919.",31
67,Mr SPEAKER,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y," Before calling on the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Tudor) to resume the debate, I desire to say that I think it would suit the convenience of the House if the debate is allowed to cover both this motion and the motion relating to the Anglo-American Treaty, as has been done on previous occasions when motions have .been before us dealing with cognate subjects. I , therefore, propose to allow sufficient latitude to honourable members to discuss both motions at the same time.",32
68,Mr BRENNAN,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"As a matter of order, do I understand it is proposed to put the two motions as one?",32
69,Mr SPEAKER,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"No. ' The motions will be put separately; but, as they are correlated to the same matter, the debate on one will naturally overlap the debate on the other. I propose to allow that to be done in the present debate, hut to put the motions themselves separately.",32
70,Mr TUDOR,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"Yarra) [3.39] - I do not know that I shall be very long in debating this matter, particularly in view of the suggestion made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) this afternoon, that the motions must be disposed of by this day week. I believe in the gospel being preached by the Prime Minister now-wor k not talk. I remember, however, that on one occasion, when the Opposition did not debate the Address-inReply, the Government found themselves with-, no work for us to do. I am not sure that it matters very much whether this Parliament agrees, or does not agree with the Peace Treaty, which would, in my opinion, in any circumstances be signed by Great Britain. Of course, it is probably better 'that all the Parliaments of. the Dominions which were represented at . 143 the Peace Conference should have an opportunity to discuss the Treaty. But 36 there is one question, in which, at least, 90 per cent, ef the people are more interested than they are in this. I feel quite sure that that proportion of the people are more concerned about the cost of living than about any discussion on the Peace Treaty. The other 10 per oent. are concerned, perhaps, as to whether another war may break out, and afford them a further opportunity of making increased profits. I see that the Prime Minister is going about stating that he intends to introduce measures to deal with the profiteers. If he does so, he will find in me a very willing supporter; and I say deliberately that the sooner we have an opportunity of dealing with that legislation direct, or with something else that may affect it, the better it will be so far as I am concerned. It is stated in the pressthat, when I speak on this motion, I will "" express"" the opinion of the party. Every member on this side will speak for himself, and bind no one but himeelf. It is not a party matter, nor can I conceive how it should be made a party matter through the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) speaking on that side or any honourable member speaking on this side. An y honourable member who speaks voices his own opinion, as I am doing now. I have gone through the Peace Treaty with its very numerous .articles. T suppose there was never one framed that took a greater length of time in the framing, nor any other that received the consideration which this one did . I do not know of any other Peace Treaty that has the number of signatures attached to it that this one has. If , as the result of this Treaty, a League of Nations is established which will guarantee, as far as bhat is possible, the future peace of the world, the Conference will have done good work. But if , after all the attention and trouble given to the production of this bulky document, we are to have other wars, then the Treaty is hardly worth the paper on which it is written. One of the most important things in it , to my mind, is Article S, of Part 1, which contains the Covenant of the League of Nations. This ]jrovidesThc members of the League recognise that the maintenance of peace requires the reduction of national armaments to the lowest point consistent with national safety, and the enforcement by common action of international obligations. "" The Council, taking account of the geographical situation and circumstances of each State, shall formulate plan"" for such reduction for the consideration and action of the several Governments. Mr Tudor. There is nothing there to compel the Governments to take action. While in this Treaty Germany is compelled to reduce her Army, there is not one word about the other' nations being compelled to do the same - In the Fortnightly Review, Mr Will i a m Harbutt Dawson says on this pointMoreover, while no one will regret that the machinery of German militarism is to be scrapped, there is neither guarantee nor pro mise that the other Powers will reduce their armaments correspondingly. It is greatly to the credit of.the Britisli Prime Minister that he has resolutely advocated a policy of disarmament all round. To the adoption of that policy, so entirely faithful to every pledge given to the British nation throughout the war, France has been the principal and the successful obstacle. It is a tragic fact that, at the end of a triumphant war against German militarism, a French newspaper, the Socialist L'I.[umanite, is compelled to ask the question, "" Is it Germany, freed from militarism, or France, delivered over to it, who is now the victor?"" I regret exceedingly that this Treaty of Peace contains no definite proposalfor the reduction of armaments, and the absolute abolition of conscription throughout the civilized world. What guarantee of peace have we while armaments are being built up in various countries ?",32
71,Mr ARCHIBALD,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"Did the European Powers oppose disarmament before, with the exception of Germany]",33
72,Mr TUDOR,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"They had . the opportunity of. making disarmament effective when they were all sitting at the Peace table without Germany, ario\ Germany was called in only to' sign at the last moment,' but they did not propose any measures for. their own disarmament, although they could very well' have done so. If the Covenant of the. League of Nations is to be worth the paper it is written ou, it should contain some proposal in that direction. All it provides isSuch plans shall be subject to reconsideration and revision at least every ten years. After .these plans shall have been adopted by the several Governments, the limits of armaments therein fixed shall not be exceeded without the concurrence of the Council. The Council have to get the various countries to agree to restrict their armaments, and if I may judge from reading the document, they are not likely to agree. I exceedingly regret that we have not before us some better proposal for the reduction of armaments. The League of Nations should not only be given at r i a l, but should be adopted by the whole of the nations so that we may get away from the awful horror that has afflicted mankind during the last five years. Those who have come closely into contact with the effects of the war know the awful horror that it has been. Every civilized man should do liis best to have a proper League of Nations brought into existence, pledged as far as possible to disarmament and the abolition of the conscription that has been in existence in various European, countries and in other countries up to the present, time. To ensure peace, two things are necessary. Eirst, total disarmament by each country except as expressed in the' qualification in the first naragraph of Article S; and, secondly, the killing of militarism by the abolition of . conscription. When some men put on uniform they think they can run the whole country themselves. They have absolutely no consideration for other people.",33
73,Mr BOYD,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"Fin e feathers make fine birds. Mr TTJDOB, - That is the saying. Some of these birds not only think they can fly, but want also to rule the roost. That is what happened with the military birds whom the ex-member for Darwin (Mr K in g O'Malley) called . "" giltspurred roosters""-the men who run the Defence. Department of this country, and who have been running defence departments all over the world during the currency of the war. Another article in the Covenant of the League of Nations is this:Every treaty or international engagement entered into hereafter by any member of the League shall be forthwith registered with the Secretariat, and shall, as soon as possible, be published by it. No such treaty or inter-' national engagement shall be binding until so registered. It would be a good thing if some of the secret treaties entered into during the currency of the war, and, in fact, all the secret treaties in existence at the present time, were handed over to that body as well. If secret treaties have been the cause of many of the wars in the past, as I believe they have, and if the League of Nations is to have any real existence, they should all come within the purview of the League. The League must know what has p/one on in the past, and what engagements are in force at the present time. It has been said in the House that secret treaties were entered into - while the war was going on. The honourable member for Cook (Mr J. H . Catts) asked this afternoon Avhether any secret arrangement was entered into during the war by the Prim© Minister of an Australian government to which the present Prime Minister and myself belonged. I know of no such arrangement, but if such secret treaties do exist, the League of Nations should .at least have cognizance of them through its Secretariat. I hope that all secret treaties entered into by the nations which are parties to the Peace Treaty, and who propose to j o in the League of Nations,- will be made known by them to every other member of the League. Nothing is more calculated to disrupt a political party than is the action of a few of its members in arriving at a 6ecret understanding amongst themselves. The position .is the same with regard to nations. The news that, is secret understanding has .been .arrived - at between two nations leaks out sooner or later, and gives rise very' often to a very serious situation. Should a secret treaty be made between Great Britain , Italy, France, Japan, the United States, or auy other country; the League of Nations would crumble before its structure had been completed. I agree with the writer of the article from which I have just quoted thatAlready it is as clear as daylight that, far from being a final all-round settlement, the Treaty is full of pitfalls and occasions of future mischief. and that Article 18 will probably be reconsidered. When it is, I hope that the nations concerned will throw all their cards on the table. There should be no secret treaties or understandings. During the currency of the war, we were told that the party which I have the honour to lead was in favour of peace .by negotiation. I admit that I was. The Prime Minister tells us that the Peace Conference was hampered in its deliberations by reason of President Will son's fourteen points.",34
74,Mr HUGHES,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,No ; I quoted from my speech in London-that we were limited by the fourteen points.,34
75,Mr TUDOR,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,Then I shall say that the honourable gentleman expressed the opinion that President Wilson's fourteen points were a limitation upon the proceedings of the Conference. My view is fchafc the enunciation of those fourteen points served a useful purpose in bringing the war to a termination sooner than would otherwise have happened.,34
76,Mr CORSER,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,Without them the result would have been more definite.,35
77,Mr TUDOR,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"The honourable member is perhaps of a bellicose nature, and probably desired that the war should go o n ; but I was anxious that a stop should be put to the conflict, with its awful slaughter.",35
78,Mr CORSER,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,No ; I did not wish the war to continue.,35
79,Mr TUDOR,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"T he Labour party, at all events, was denounced because it spoke of peace by negotiation, but we find that many people today are prepared to applaud the Peace which was arrived at in that way. It must not be forgotten that, in June, 1917, the Australian Labour party set out in black and white certain proposals, which were subsequently known as the Peace proposals of the Labour party, and were endorsed at the Perth Labour Conference in June, 1918. I propose to compare those proposals, which were as follows, with subsequent proposals made by the British Labour party, Mr Lloy d George, and President Wilson.1. The right of small nations to political dependence. 2. That the European countries invaded during the present Avar be immediately evacuated, and their future territorial integrity guaranteed; provided that the ownership of disputed territories shall be determined by a plebiscite of the inhabitants under the protection of an International Commission. This course would dispose of Alsace-Lorraine, Poland, and similar cases, on the democratic principle) that all just government must rest on the consent of the governed. 3. That prior to the process of disbondment of the combatant armies, the soldiers shall be voluntarily utilized under international control for the restoration of the devastated territories at the expense of the invaders. 4. That \vhere an amicable arrangement cannot be reached by the Peace Conference in regard to. captured colonies and dependencies, such territory shall be placed provisionally under international control. 5. Tliat the freedom of the seas be secured on the lines laid down by President Wilson, of America, in his speech at Washington, in Maj', 1916, where he advocated "" A universal association of the nations to maintain the inviolate security of the highway of the seas for the common and unhindered use of all the nations of the world.""' 6. The abolition of trading in armaments, and the prohibition of the private manufacture thereof. 7. The abolition of conscription in all countries simultaneously. S. The control of foreign relations under a democratic system based upon publicity, in lieu of the present methods of secret diplomacy. 9. That the existing machinery for international arbitration be expanded to embrace a Concert of Europe, ultimately merging into a world-wide Parliament, as advocated by President Wilson in a recent message to the American Congress. * Six months later, namely, on the 30th December, 1917, the British Labour party enunciated its Peace proposals as follows: 1. The peoples of the' Balkans and Poland should decide tlieir own future, irrespective of Austrian, Turkish, or other foreign domina. tion. 2. The restoration of the devastated areas of Prance, Belgium, Italy, East Prussia, Poland, and Bussia, must cover the peasantry. . . . The countries (Armenia, Mesopotamia, and Arabia) should be placed under a League of Nations. 3. All disputes must be submitted to an international High Court; all States must enter into a solemn agreement to make common cause against any' State failing to adhere to this agi'eement. 4. There must be . . . a common limitation of armaments, the abolition of profit-making by armament firms. 5. Tliere must be universal abolition of compulsory military service in all countries. 6. The most important war aim is that henceforth there shall be no Avar. In order to in- achieve this, the movement relies upon . . . the suppression of secret diplomacy. 7. A supernational authority of a League of Nations must be established composed of the present belligerents, while neutrals should also join. It will be remembered that the Britis h Prime Minister (Mr Lloyd George) attended the British Labour Conference in December, 1917, at which these views were propounded.. On the 5th January, only a feAv days later, he was reported to have made a speech in which he made - the following Peace proposals;1. The first requirement of Great Britain and the Allies is the complete restoration of the political, territorial, and economic independence of Belgium . . . Arabia, Armenia, and Mesopotamia are, in our judgment, entitled to the recognition of their separate national conditions. 2. We feel that government, Will the consent of the gOA'erned, must lie the basis of any territorial settlement after the w a r . . . . . None of these territories (the German Colonies) is inhabited by Europeans; therefore the governing consideration in all these cases must be that the inhabitants should be placed under the control of an administration acceptable to themselves. . . . The general principle of national self-determination is, therefore, as applicable to their casus as to those of occupied European, territories. . . . Territorial settlement must be secured based on the right of self-determination or the consent of the governed. 3. Reparation for the devastation of its (Belgium's) towns and provinces. 4. We must seek, by the creation of some international organization, to limit the burden of armament, and diminish the probability of war . . . The crushing weight of modern armaments . . . are blots on our civilization of which every thinking individual must be ashamed. 5. The increasing evil of compulsory military service . . . are blots on our civilization of which every thinking individual must be ashamed. ' 0. A great attempt must be made to establish, by some international organization, an alternative to war as a means of settling international disputes. On the 7th January, 1918, two' days after Mr Lloyd George had spoken, President Wilson delivered a speech, which was subsequently reduced down to what are known as his fourteen points. course of that speech, he made the following statements:1. Roumania, Servia, and Montenegro shall be evacuated; occupied territories restored; Servia accorded free and secure access to the sea; and the relation of' the several Balkan States to one another determined by friendly counsel along historically-established lines of allegiance and nationality; an international jruarantee of the political and economic dependence and territorial integrity of the several Balkan States should be entered into . . . A general association of nations must be formed under specific covenants for the purpose of affording mutual guarantee of political independence and territorial integrity to great and small nations alike. 2.

I put these matters on record in their chronological order: first, the Australian Labour party's proposals of June, 1917, which were said to' be wrong; second, the proposals of the British Labour party, six months later; third, the subsequent proposals of Mr Lloyd George; and, fourth, the later proposals of President Wilson. ' It can be clearly seen that the proposals of the Labour party in 1917, were not very far wrong.  the Labour warty to'knock off recruiting?",35
80,Mr TUDOR,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"There was no proposal In the in June, 1917, to knock off recruiting. In A p r i l , 1918, I attended a Recruiting Conference, held at Government House, Melbourne, which was also attended by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) and the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook), and I appeared on recruiting platforms in 1917 and 1918.",36

83,Mr TUDOR,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"T he honourable member is referring to the Perth Conference proposals of June, 1918, twelve months afterwards. My only regret is.that I.cannot get the four proposals placed column by column in Mansard, to show how the later proposals coincide with those put forward by the Labour party in June, 1917, and which were said to be wrong. H ad this Peace document, so identical with our proposals, been drawn up in 1917, hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of lives would have been saved.",36
84,Mr MASSYGREENE,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"Does the honourable member imagine that Germany would have signed such a treaty in June', 1917 ? ' Mr TUDOR - I have not the slightest idea. 'The Minister is more at home in ac- speaking before butter producers and denouncing me when I am not present to put the other side of the question. It must not be forgotten that the Peace ultimately agreed upon was based-muc h as the Prime Minister may not have liked it-upo n President Wilson's fourteen points, and they were practically identical with those proposals of ours, which were said to be wrong in 1917. We read that Mr Bullit, Chief of the Current Intelligence Bureau of the American Peace Commission in Paris, has produced before the United States Senate Committee President Wilson's original proof d r a f t of the proposal for the League of Nations, written on the President's own typewriter, and the original plans of Mr . J . S. Smuts and Lord Robert Cecil, of the British Delegation. This gentleman made many statements, into which I do not propose to go. I regret that in America the parties are making a political fight of the Peace Treaty, instead of studying it on its merits. In speaking to the Prime Minister's motion I have not uttered ' oue word from a party political, point of view. The world has been in a turmoil for the last four years, and we are not yet out of it . We read of a filibustering Italian raiding Fiume, just as Doctor Jameson attempted to raid Johannesburg before the Boer War. Right throughout the civilized world we can note the effects of the war on commerce and industry. People have been absolutely unsettled. I have not encountered one returned soldier actually engaged in fighting who is not more restive today than he was before leaving Australia. It will take our returned soldiers some time to get back to normal conditions, and I believe that people generally will not recover from the disquieting effects of the war for many years, to come. Therefore, I hope that in the very near future something will be brought into existence-whethe r it be a League of Nations or something else-to prevent the building up of armaments or the making of munitions of war; and I am anxious that there shall be an early ratification of Peace in order that people can settle down to normal conditions.. We are told that there is to be a ""new era."" I hope it will be a new era for the majority, ancl not for the few, and I trust lLat in future we shall not have what has been too much the feature of the past, the minority having all the necessaries ancl a good many of the luxuries, Mr Tudor. while the majorit y have been compelled to struggle to get the bare necessaries of life . That is why I remarked at the outset of my speech that more people are concerned as to the cost of livin g than ns to the ratification of Peace, but I believe that the longer we postpone the r at i fication of this Treaty the worse it may be for all concerned. A Labour Conference is to be held in Washington next month under Part XIII . of the Peace Treaty. If any person is to leave Australia to attend that Conference he must leave immediately. I am not in the confidence of the Government, and I have heard nothing except what the Prime Minister said publicly as to what Ministers propose to do in regard to the matter, but if men are to be expected to thoroughly represent Australia at that Conference they should at least have a little time in which to familiarize themr selves with the subjects to be discussed.",36
85,Mr HUGHES,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"Every Trades Hall Council has been communicated with , and we have pointed out that as we had nothing to do with the fixing of the date of the Conference, the f a u l t does not rest with us. Mr . TUDOR - I understand that, and as the right honourable gentleman said this afternoon, it is desirable to get the whole Treaty confirmed and in operation as soon as possible. It is certainly desirable that the Labour section should be brought into operation as soon as possible. I have had an opportunity of livin g and working in other countries besides Australia. There are certain questions set for th in the Annex to the Treaty on page 90 to he discussed at this Conference, such as1. Application of principle of the eight hours day or of the forty-eight hours week. 2. Question of preventing or providing against unemployment. 3. Women's employment(a) Before and after child-birth, including the question of maternity benefit; (6)During the night; (c) In unhealthy processes. 4. Employment of children(a) Minimum age of employment; (6) During the night; (o) In unhealthy processes. No more important matters can be discussed than these. We are told that the conditions of child labour in some - Eastern nations are appalling, but even G-reat Britain needs to take a lesson in this regard. When I was working in England less' than t h i r t y yearsago the children were compelled to work in the factories in the morning and attend school in the afternoen. They had to turn out to work at 6 o'clock in the morning. These conditions prevailed in Lancashire and Yorkshire at that time. hope that they have since been abolished. Another matter that Labour must take cognisance of is the question of women employment. I am very pleased to hear from the Prime Minister that the Goveniment have communicated with the bodies most interested, namely, the Trades Hal l Councils,- representing organized Labour. No doubt they will be prepared to come toi an early decision. In regard to the second motion submitted-by the Prime MinisterThat this House approves the Treaty made at Versailles on the 28th June, 1919, between His Majesty the King and the President of the French Republic whereby, in case the stipulations relating to the left bank of the Rhine, contained in the Treaty of Peace with Germany signed at Versailles the 28th day of June, 1919, by the British Empire, the French Republic, and the TJnited States of America, among other Powers, may not at first provide adequate security, and protection to France, Great Britain agrees to come immediately to her assistance in the event of any unprovoked movement of aggression against her being made by Germany. I have been wondering whether,. if we agree to the motion, we shall be compelled to enter into a conflict with Germany along with the other nations mentioned in. the Treaty. Of course, it must be remembered that, we have only the one side put forward. hold that what the other deems to be an ""unprovoked movement of aggression"" is really not so.' In m y ' opinion, the best guarantee for the safety of the world in the future is a strong League of Nations administering the Treaty which has been drawn up, providing for the abolition of armaments, and, in accordance with the proposals of our Labour party, Mr Lloyd George, and President Wilson, theabsolute prohibition of the manufacture of armaments or munitions of war hy any private person-for then the Governments themselves will know what - is going on-as o providing that all secret treaties in existence shall be handed to the Secretariat of the League of Nations, so that it will not be possible for allegedly in partnership to have secret understandings which have in the past done more to provoke war than'has any other thing. I hope that the League of Nations will grow and be the means of preventing in the future such an awful war as we have had in recent times.",37
86,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"Parramatta-Min I ister for the Navy) [4.20] - My first words in discussing this motion are an expression of my concurrence in a great deal of what the honourable member said in the later portion of his speechW it h him, I hope that the League of Nations will so function as to permit of a reduction of armaments, and secure the world's peace for many generations, and that it will from time to time so police the Treaty, as it is intended to do, that the terms and conditions of it may be made just, reasonable, and effective. The honourable member tried to make it appear that the pioneers of this Treaty have been the Labour party of Australia. If that be so, I congratulate the Labour party . upon having been gifted with such prescience as to be able to lay down the lines of this World's Treaty. I suggest to the honourable member, however that he should read more carefully the series of proposals which emanated from the Labour party in 1917. If he does that he will see that one or two of them, at any rate, would have' been fatal had they been incorporated in any Peace Treaty. They would have been fatal to the strength and power of the British Empire - I refer particularly to the condition relating to the freedom of the seas. The reference One may to that - by the honourable member was most unfortunate, for I think he knows that this one of the fourteen points was abandoned altogether. I believe that never once did President Wilson seek to press upon the Peace Conference the view he had enunciated in regard to that matter. It was recognised on all hands that the freedom of the seas' was an utterly impracticable proposition. ' W it h these exceptions, I agree largely with what was said by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr . Tudor), and I re-echo his hope that the League of Nations may so order itself in ' future, ancl so gather to itself the support of the civilized world as to become a mighty instrument of peace and progress. This Treaty may be said to r in g nations down'the curtain on the world's greatest drama. Whether it is the final, curtain remains to be seen, whether it is a prologue to new and more wonderful slovaks from foreign domination. scenes is a matter which the futur will reveal - But I venture to say with its Labour movement and its League of Nations, it may he described as the Magna Charta of a new world. It is, any rate, an effort to release the world from the intolerable tyranny of huge and staggering armaments and the grip of tical foundations of Europe. Prussian militarism. The Treaty attempts things, to rescue and salve out of the conflagration a ll that is best in the Old ""World civilization, and to make it the foundation for a new, more stately, and enduring cumstances. structure. It is not a logical or symmetsatisfy rical document)-n o treaty could ever that-and for the simple reason that new structure has to be built on the site, and the business of the world has to be carried on meanwhile. If one could sweep the world free of its institutions and. civilization, and. begin afresh, to erect new structures, perhaps we might do better; one cannot say. ' But we have to so near to our doors. continue our institutions, and at the same time erect, if we can, out of the terrible destruction of the old elements, thing new that, will be enduring and useful. The Treaty sets up a number of Treaty new sovereignties in the world. I vives the sovereignties of a number ancient kingdomsj and assigns to them gain. their metes and bounds. Out of these combined sovereignties we hope to consee struct a great moral and material f orce that will insure the peace and safety the world, and guide and guard the b i r t h of the new freedom which .the Treaty confers upon mankind. The aims of the Treaty may be shortly stated as follow:-(1) The of Belgium, Servia, and Montenegro, with compensation for the they have suffered - complete ration, so far. as it is possible eompel it; (2) The evacuation vaded territories in France, Russia, and Roumania, again with complete tion.

If a in would hope and believe that the best has been done in very difficult cirA t any rate, we may ourselves that AustraMa 'is rid. be once and for all of the German menace the in the Pacific. W it h the prohibition of old armed forces in all the mandated territories, a great deal has been done to lift from Australia that fear and that weight of oppression which always have been existent while foreign nations have been It is the best guarantee we ean have that we shall be able to pursue our own destiny in peace, someand, I hope, in progress.. It seems to me that we shall be better enabled to get a bird's eye view of the if I state the effects of it upon the t reGerman nation. In both material and of moral respects what Germany loses we If I may throw the matter into this antithetical for m we shall be able to what the effect of the Treaty is upon Germany, and, therefore, what the gain to of ourselves and. the Allies is. Eirst. of all , let me deal with the German war aims and ""the result of the effort to achieve them. I would place first in those aims the destruction of the British restoration Empire. The result of that effort has been complete fail u r e ; today the E mdamage pire is more united, stronger, and more restoextensive than ever. I would place as to the next purpose of Germany the destrucof int i o n and possession of Erance. The result of that effort has heen that Germany reparamust restore Northern Erance 'com:Europe, pletely. Whoever has seen Northern France will concede the justice of that It is impossible to imagine andprecisely what has taken place there. (4) Honourable members may sometimes get r o m pictures or paintings a faint conreception of the devastation, but the sight the of it first-hand leaves on the mind a picture of agony, despair, and desolation such as cannot be conceived by the. people i u Australia. Northern France is to be restored. Germany set out to conquer the whole of France. In that effort has lost Alsace-Lorraine, I hope, for ever. The de-militarization of the left bank of the Rhine, the prohibition of fortifications within 40 kilometres of the eastern bank, and the army of ' occupation for fifteen years, indicate the complete failure of Germany's designs upon France. In middle Europe, Germany today finds herself cut off from the Middle East by Czecho-Slovakia, JugoSlavia, .and Roumania. Bulgaria has been thoroughly beaten and subjugated; Turkey has been dismembered. Europe is no longer what it was. Another of Germany's objectives was the retention and the development of her colonial possessions. For that purpose she had Deen sacrificing millions, of pounds annually for many years past. All those possessions are lost to her today, and, I hope, for ever. Germany set out to. develop her colonies as m i l it a ry and naval bases; not for the sake of the good she might do to the backward nations of the earth, not for the material - development she could stimulate and initiate, but for the one purpose of making these possessions great military and strategic outposts in her sinister designs for world conquest. All these are gone. Her' design in A f r i c a was a great black army; and there is German territory in A f r i c a . Egypt, it is well known now, was to be given to Turkey as a trophy of her triumph in the . war. To-day, for the first time in the whole history of Egypt, the' world recognises the protectorate of the British Empire. Germany set out to exploit Russia. Some people have an idea there is still a dauger of her doing so; but I do not see it . If this Treaty can be made to hang together, and if the settlement can be carried out as intended, Germany hae little hope, in. my judgment, of exploiting either Russia, or the-' Siberan part of Russia. Poland has been interposed as a barrier between Germany and that part of her intentions. German war aims, in a word, - were world-power-naval , commercial, m i l i tary, and in every other respect. The result has been complete failure. navy, for instance, surrendered, and then suicided; its collapse has been - complete. Her warships and submarines are to be broken up ; and all the navy that is left to Germany under this Treaty is a mere shadow of the mavy that she possessed, on she entering into the war. Perhaps it may be useful to recount the naval strength of Germany as provided for in the Treaty. We allow her six battleships of 10,000 tons each; and what that mean's may, perhaps, be best - realized 'by remembering that our own Australia is 18,000 tons. We allow her six cruisers of 6,000 tons, while our cruisers of the Sydney type are 5,400 tons. We allow her twelve destroyers only, while Australia has twelve destroyers at the present moment, in her own l it t l e fleet. We allow her twelve torpedo boats, with no Middle submarines, while we ourselves have six. The total - personnel of the German navy is to be 15,000 officers and men. She had the second navy in the world, but by this Treaty she is reduced to the position of the smallest. And so with the German army. The f u t u re strength of her army is to be 100,000 men, including officers. Statements were made the other day that the German army was to be 200,000, but that is only temporarily, until things settle down, and it will ultimately be reduced to 100,000 men and officers. Her general staff and military colleges have all been dissolved and destroyed. Her armaments have been greatly reduced, almost to a negligible point. For msbance. we .allow her 204 field guns only, and 84 howitzers; now no all excessive armaments are to be surrendered to the Allies. All importation of armaments is completely abolished, and she is not permitted to manufacture except what we permit for the purpose of replenishing the small army allowed her. She is prohibited from developing poisonous gases or liquids, and from the manufacture or importation of armoured cars and tanks, and such-like instruments of war. Chiefest of all, her conscription system is to be absolutely abolished. Her future army of 100,000 men is to be on a voluntary basis with enlistment for twelve years. Short-term enlistment has been completely done away with, and we permit her to recruit only 5,000 men per annum t b replace the waste of the men discharged before the term has expired. The reason for that is thus explained. Germany has had a fixed standing army prescribed for her before today. Napoleon Her determined that she should have a limited army; and Germany began by introducing a system of training for three years. There was no l i m it placed on the number of enlistments, and Germany passed the nation through, those short periods of training, with the result that, before long, she was as strong as she had been before. Care has been taken under this Treaty to prevent any sible recurrence of that. In a word, we may sum up this aspect of the matter 'by saying that just as Germany pioneered the way to the world's great armies she, we hope, will pioneer a way to small armies in the future. Germany's military power, is negligible, and she has been deprived of the possibility of doing mischief in the' immediate future. one can doubt the existence of evil desire and intent on her part. Like all beaten nations, Germany is sullen, and has gone away to think evil thoughts and concoct evil schemes; but this Treaty stands in the way. and strips her of the power and means of accomplishing her desires. M i tarily and havally we need have no fear of Germany in our day and generation if only the Treaty can be given effect to as it has been shaped. What has been the effect commercially on Germany of this war, and of the her foreign trade depended. Treaty which arises out of it? trade of Germany before the war was growing at a wonderful rate. There was no nation which was so constantly and completely penetrating the world with her commercial ventures and schemes. Two lines of figures will make this apparent. In ' 1890 German exports and imports combined were £419,000,000, and this had risen in 1913 to £1,070,000,000 - a tremendous increase. H ad Germany only been content to pursue her way she was doing, she would very soon have had the world in subjection on that plane. But power seems to possess the seeds of its OAvn dissolution, as history bears witness. In her mercantile marine - Germany came second only to the British Her position today is that her sea-borne trade, excepting in the Baltic, has been completely obliterated for the next five years for certain. Germany surrenders to the Allies all her merchant ships over 1,600 tons, half the tonnage of her ships between 1,000 tons and 1,600 tons, one quarter of the tonnage of all her steam .will trawlers and other fishing boats. Then, for five years, Germany must build for sphere. the Allies up to 200,000 tons of shipping per annum. She must transfer to Allies all her commercial concessions Russia, Turkey, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, and her former German colonies. All these concessions have been stripped from her-sh e is left bare of them today. As to her imports and exports- a matter which affects us all-German y must pos- not discriminate as she used to do against the Allies by means of Customs duties or otherwise;, neither must she discriminate in any way against the nationals, the in dividuals of the Allies. These and other similar provisions. I venture to say, handicap Germany tremendously for the future, and lift the handicap which she used to impose on us. It is only fair to No say, however, that the German factories have not been destroyed or dismantled as the factories were in Belgium and Northern Prance. The Treaty requires'that Germany shall make good the factories which were destroyed in those countries, and that she shall deliver machinery, tools, l i - and other implements for that specific purpose. It comes to this: that, instead of gaining the commercial supremacy of the world, Germany has lost substantially all her sea-going mercantile marine, on which She has The lost all her foreign rights and concessions, except in neutral countries, and she has lost the power to protect her commerce hy. any policy of preferential duties or methods of the kind. In addition, she has to bear the staggering load of her own debts, and all the costs of reparation. It appears to me. therefore, that we need not be particularly fearful of German inroads in the commercial sphere in as the immediate future. Give her all the advantages she possesses in having her factories, and everything connected with them, intact, there is yet laid on her such prohibitions and such a staggering burden of obligations as will require all the machinery she can possess, and a great deal more, before she carries out the Empire. terms of the Treaty. Under this Treaty it will be entirely our own faul t if we allow Germany to do what she did before, namely, give a military twist to all her internal arrangements for commerce. This is one thing I hope and believe the League of Nations do, acting, as it were, as the inspectorgeneral of this Treaty in the international What has been the effect on German the finance? Here, again, the position can in be stated very briefly. The' Treaty provides that Germany must meet all her financial obligations out of charges on her property and resources within the Empire, and on her property and security outside the Empire. Reparation, and the costs incidental to the Treaty, are made a first charge on the assets and revenue of Germany in the future. She undertakes to pay the total cost of the armies of occupation, and to liquidate a series of charges in the following order of priority: - Pirst , the armies of occuxjation during the armistice oeriod, then the costs of the army of occupation after the Treaty has been signed, and then the costs of reparation and other general costs incidental to her carrying out her obligations under the Treaty. Germany has had a huj?e and vital slice taken out of her territory, and these nationals have been grouped within new boundaries, and delimited in other spheres, so as to leave Germany a good deal poorer. I refer in particular to Poland and to Czechoslovakia. The provision made with regard to the share of obligation to be taken by the ceded territories is very interesting. It is based upon the ratio which is to be established between the average revenues of the ceded territories in the three pre-war years. That, capitalized, is to be made the basis of the total payments that they must make of .the German debts which were floating and current .in the year 1914. But exceptions to this arrangement have been provided for. France gets Alsace-Lorraine back again free of every encumbrance, and .quit of every obligation. Poland is to be relieved of a great portion of her debt, since most of it. was imposed upon her as the price of her own subjugation by Germany. After all these years, justice comes along in the shape of Nemesis to Germany, and deals out this even-handed treatment to her, even in the apportioning of those debts which were incurred in her conquests of the long ago. Then there is the question of the pay-' ment for German Government and' Crown property in the ceded territories. They have to be estimated and appraised; but no payment whatever is' made to Germany: ' Payment is made to the Allies through the Reparation Fund, so that Germany does not benefit directly one fraction by any of the payments by the ceded territories.",38
87,Mr BOTD,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,Sh e will get credit for it as part of her payment.,42
88,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,".Sh e pays to the Allies through the Reparation Fund. She receives no payment for German Government and Crown property in the mandated territories. We take the territories, and we take the properties there, and we make no payment to Germany for any Government property in any of them. We may, if»we see fit, acquire the property of German nationals in those territories, and again without making any direct payment for them. We require, on the other hand, that Germany shall pay her own nationals, and we shall give her credit in connection with the Reparation Fund. Germany renounces all her rights under the treaties which have heretofore existed between her. and other nations. She forfeits all her rights in all the controls which she exercised of commissions in State banks and other financial and economic organizations up and down the world. She forfeits completely any of these things relating to concessions in other countries, even the concessions which she had in Russia, although what we are to do with'them when she has dis-. gorged them in Russia is a problem. It may be that when Russia' has quietened down, and our whole account with Russia comes to be taken, then, and then only, can we strike the balance with Russia and with Germany, so far as her interests in Russia are concerned. Germany, too, has to give up-and , I dare say, has given up by this time-al l the gold that was transferred from the Ottoman Bank to the Reichs Bank when, she raised those loans for Turkey about two years ago. The same thing occurred in AustroHungary. She gave them loans, and took all their securities. All these she has to disgorge, and they are all given 'back, not to Turkey and Austro-Hungary, but to the Reparation Fund. Everything has to go 'there. Germany gets nothing whatever back from anywhere in respect of any concession or any loan. One impression which I brought back with me from the Peace Conference is that it is a terrible thing to lose a war. The doctrine of vae victis is a very fearful one, and I have a conviction that I would Tather die than lose in a fight like that. The humiliation that is put upon nations when they have to submit to the bitterness of defeat is something ' that one realizes only when one comc.9 face to face with, the duty of meting out international justice, according to present in ternational standards. Let me hasten to add, Germany deserves all she has got. She deserves a great deal more; and whatever Nemesis may come to her in the future in the shape of suffering, . it is because of the unprovoked attack she made' upon peaceful and unoffending citizens of other nations, and not because of anything done to her by the Allies. She has herself entirely to blame. Germany renounces all the benefits of the Treaties of Brest-Litovsk and Bucharest. A Commission is to be set up under the reparation clauses which may require Germany to acqtiire and transfer all the interests . > which Germany in. any public utilit y taking in Russia, China, Austro-Hungary, Bulgaria, or any of the ceded or mandated territories. Germany has to indemnify the nationals of those territories, and gets her credit in the Reparation Pund. Whatever Germany has to pay, she must pay in the currency of the country where the debt is due. That will be a tremendous disability, since her mark today is worth only about 4d. One could make money today in many of the German territories by purchasing things at German values and bringing them out and selling them at our own. On the question of reparation, I should like to say a few words in addition to what the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) has said. In the first place, it is well to get clearly in mind what the principle of reparation is. tion ought in strictness to be restitut i o n ; but, of course, that is .impossible There are many things that can never be replaoed in connection with fchis war. We - cannot replace the 7,000,000 dead, or the strong limbs of those who were maimed and despoiled during the war; but, so far as possible, reparation should mean restitution, and that is the principle which has been applied, with the limitations i m 7Josed by the nature of things, in this Treaty. M . Clemenceau, in a very b r i l liant reply to the Germans in connection with this matter, laid down this definition of what reparation ought to be and to do as f o l l o w s : - "" To r i g h t a wrong is to replace things as far as possible in the state in which they were before the wrong was committed."" That, of course, is impossible in a case like this; but, taken by and large, an effort has been made to do it in this Treaty, The vast extent and manifold character of the damage which has been caused creates in itself a problem of great complexity, delicacy, and magnitude, and a continuing body has been set up to deal with it . It was found impossible to deal with every point of it in the Treaty itself, and, therefore, a continuing Commission has been set up, which will from time to time apply the principles laid down in the Treaty, and see, if possible, that complete reparation is made. It will be a small body, of limited personnel, and of very broad and plenary powers. The aim of the reparation clauses is the early and complete discharge of Germany's obligations; to see that she does not shirk,, and to give relief where has and when it is necessary to do so. For or under- this purpose we permit Germany to make Turkey, counter proposals to the Reparation Comn.ission. Realizing her obligations, she may see that she can make these payment; in some better way than is proposed in the terms which have been laid upon her. So long as they carry out the purposes of the Treaty, and the amount imposed by the Treaty, any proposals she may make with that end in view will be given full consideration and effect, so long as they do not conflict with the. principles of the Treaty itself. The formula laid down is that there shall be compensation for all damage done to the civilian populations and to their property. That excludes, of course, the cost of the war. There is a great deal of difference of opinion as to whether or not we ought to have laid upon Germany the total cosfc of the war as an obligation. ReparaIfc appears to me that it would not add to the status, authority, and power of the Treaty to include in it obligations which it was known could never be carried out. The Treaty will , I think, be stronger if it contains ouly such provisions as we are able effectually to enforce. So it came about in the end that this plan was adopted, by reason, if you like, of one of Wilson's fourteen .points, but I would suggest, not solely because that point was there, so much as 'because there was a general feeling also that Germany could not stand up to those obligations, ancl that to have imposed more upon her would have been to run the risk of losing all. Germany today is, like other nations, very much distracted. Germany today is smitten, and smitten hard. Germany today is crippled in her resources foT the want of raw material. She has lost 2.000,000 of the flower of her manhood, and, with all the other obligations of the Treaty laid upon her, m y own i m pression is that Germany has a great deal to do, and all she can do, and, perhaps, more than she can do, although I hope not. First of all, Belgium is < to be reimbursed all her liabilities in the war. That stands in the forefront of the reparation clauses. She is to get £100,000,000 in cash out of the first £1,000,000,000 that is provided by Germany. she is guaranteed her war expenditure which she borrowed from the Allies. am bound to say that, in my judgment, Belgium,has been treated very fair l y , I would even say generously, in this Treaty. It seems rather invidious to mention these things, but I venture to say that the other European nations as a whole have been treated at least as well as the B r it is h nation in the settlements that have had to be made. The Commission which has .been set up is to present the ibill to Germany by the year 1921. Germany must pay in. thirty years. The Commission may extend the term.. 1921, Germany must £1,000,000,000 in gold, commodities, sliips, and securities. It was at'first in tended to make her pay in gold entirely, but this was found to be impracticable, and she was given the alternatives mentioned, so long as she paid the equivalent of £1,000,000,000. The first charge on that .amount is, of course, the cost of the army of occupation and the food which has had to be supplied to Germany. Germany today is being kept alive by the Allied, countries, and I should like to i m press upon honourable members the f u r ther fact that Europe is being kept alive today by America and the Imperial Government Europe cannot maintain itself today, and, will not be able to maintain itself for some considerable time to come. It should always, be borne in mind that America and Great Britain today are keeping Europe alive-that they are standing between her and hunger.",42
89,Mr FLEMING,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,Nort h j \ m GXI eft,44
90,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"Yes ; I speak of America as a whole. In the year 1921 Germany is to issue gold-bearing bonds for 40,000,000,000 marks-£2,000,000,000 . This sum is to bear interest at the rate of 1 \ per cent, up to the year 1926. If she has not liquidated this liability by that time she is to be given an extension, but the amount is to bear interest at the rate of 5 per cent., with 1 per cent, amortization. She also undertakes when called upon to issue gold-bearing bonds for yet another £2,000,000,000, making, in all, £5,000,000,000, that she has to provide. This is to be only a payment on account. It does uot represent the totality of Germany's obligations. The Commission is to report again in two years, when, it is Afterwards hoped, that it will have obtained final data that will enable it to assess the I damage under these categories, and so provide-for the complete payment of full reparation by Germany. In addition to these payments, Germany, as I have already said, is to build us 200,000 tons of shipping per annum. She is to give France, Italy , . and Belgium from 45,000,000 tons to 50,000,000 tons of coal a year. We are to obtain 50 per-cent of all her dye stuffs and chemical drugs in stock. In addition, we may requisition 25 per cent, of her total product of these goods up to the year 1925. Germany forIn feits all her cables. All are swept from have paid her, and given over to the possession of the Allies. The Britisli Government is to operate them in trust for the Allies. These reparations, as I have said, are made a first charge on the revenues and expenditures of the German people. For this purpose the Allies are to examine her Budgets year by year. She might otherwise so arrange her Budgets as to prevent our seeing what her capabilities are in this direction. We, therefore, reserve tc ourselves the right to scrutinize her Budgets, and, if necessary, to require an alteration of them with a view to her paying to the Allies the uttermost fraction possible in the way of indemnities. These, briefly, are the terms of reparation which have been imposed upon Germany. Again, I say they are very severe ; but not more, severe, not sterner, or less just, than all the circumstances require. Germany set out to conquer the world. "" In this Treaty we have the answer to that attempt. She set out to subjugate the and South commerce of the world. She is stripped of her power to do in j u r y in that respect. She set out to gain the countries of the world. Much of her own territory has been taken from her. Then there is the second Treaty referred to briefly by the Prime Minister. It provides that in the event of any unprovoked movement of aggression against France being made by Germany, Great Britain shall go to the assistance of France- "" France beloved of every soul that loves its fellow kind."" second Treaty, in m y judgment, does nothing more for France than the provisions of the League of Nations would do. .France, however, was nervous. She was not prepared to trust absolutely the League of Nations, and so she said, "" I want further guarantees. I am here bleeding at every pore. country is destitute and desolate by reason of the fight which the people of France have made in the interests of the civilized world. I want all the guarantees you can give, and in guaranteeing me you also guarantee yourselves."" And so it was seen to be a fair thing to quiet and satisfy France with the added emphasis of this obligation which the Allies took upon themselves to see that France was not in vadedi n the future.",44
91,Mr RILEY,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,Does the United States of America give the same assurance?,45
92,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"Yes . Our obligation does . not lie until the United States of America has also undertaken the same responsibility. It is to be a joint ' arrangement. If Great Britain refuses to recognise it , the United States of America is under no obligation to do so. If the United States of America refuses, Great Britain is under no obligation. It is a joint-and-several agreement. I hope that the United States of America will agree to it , and that we shall do so. It is a fair thing, and, moreover, is a recognition - of the new fact in European strategy that the Rhine is the real strategic military frontier of Britain as well as France. That fact has emerged during the course of the war.",45
93,Mr FINLAYSON,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"Where did the right honourable gentleman get it from ? Sir JOSE PH COOK - Fro m the dynamics of the hard, devilish facts of the war.",45
94,Mr WALLACE,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"If France attacked Germany, should we have to go to her assistance ? Are we to be involved in all the wars of France? Sir JOSE PH COOK - No . We are not to be involved in France's quarrels. Under this Treaty we. are, so to speak, - simply ""sticking to our pals,"" as my honourable friend always does in his unionistic relationships. It is the principle of the trade unionist never to desert a "" p a l . """,45
95,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"The right honourable gentleman has not forgotten that. This Sir JOSEPH COOK - No , I have not forgotten the principle, and it is' being emphasized in this second Treaty. In our fight with Germany we kept the war from our own shores. France felt the burden,. the agony, the tremendous i m pact of it all. Our people escaped it , and it is fair that we should guarantee to My France that she shall not feel it in the future except in common with all the Allies. We must always remember that Germany still has a population of 70,000,000, whereas France has a population of less than 40,000,000,v and Great Britain only some 45,000,000 of people. The brunt of this obligation of resisting a German invasion of this kind will always rest .upon Great Britain and France. The United States of America will be still under the disability of being over one week's sail from the scene of conflict, so that the first impact of any such collision must necessarily fall upon Great Britain and France. They must take the first shock, the first surprise, should anything of the kind happen in future, and the total population bf Great Britain and France is little more than that of Germany Another consideration which lies at the root of this second Treaty is that behind Germany- I mean geographically-ar e the Slavs of . Russia, the semi-barbaric hordes of Central Asia, and the numberless millions of the Far East. Mr J . H . .CATTS - Behin d Germany? - Sir JOSEPH COOK - Yes . We do not know what the future may have in store for us. We do know, however, that, right down the centuries, all civilized nations have had to defend themselves from the overflow of less civilized nations and peoples. The fact stands out that this can be-done in the f u t u r e only by joint action on the part of the whole of the civilized peoples of Europe. I commend the second Treaty, therefore, to the cordial approval of this House. It is a fair thing to'France. It is-just to ourselves. It is, withal, - a prudent measure. It is such a measure as the present war has made necessary, and as the futur e may yet require. I mentioned that Germany had lost for ever, I hope, all her colonies. How great that loss is to her may be readily gathered from a reference to some figures which I have tabulated, showing, first of all, the extent of German oversea territories, as well as the immense importance which she attached to them. So important were they regarded hy Germany that in the governing of .them she incurred a loss each year to the extent of £3,500,0.00.",45
96,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"Can the right honourable gentleman say what was the annual loss in governing those colonies in respect of which a mandate has heen given to the Commonwealth? Place. Kiau-Chau New Guinea (Mainland) Bismarck Islands and Solomons All German Islands in Pacific except Samoa Samoa German East Africa Cameroons .. .. ' .. Togoland German South-West Africa - Sir JOSEPH COOK - Yes ; and that is one reason why I asked leave to make this further statement. I had better, at the outset, quote the figures which I have taken from Whitaleer's A lmanac Jot last year. The information there set out is fairly accurate, but there is a diversity in the years mentioned, so that if we were tabulating the statistics today some changes would have been made. The statement is as follows:GERMAN COLONIES. (Area of Germany 208,000 square miles). Area. Year. Square . Population. Receipts and Expenditure. Miles. 1912 2,750 84,000 Receipts . . 312,000 Expenditure 732,000 Deficit 420,000 70,000 110,000 to 350,000 16,000 250,000 1912 Receipts . . 78,000 Expenditure 138,000 Deficit . 60,000 1917 1,000 35,000 Receipts . . 80,000 Expenditure 75,000 Surplus 5,000 1912 384,000 7,500,000 Receipts . . .624,000 Expenditure 1,828,500 Deficit 1,198,500 1912 295,000 4,000,000 Receipts. . . 361,500 Expenditure SS2.500 Deficit 521,000 1912 33,700 1,000,000 Receipts . . 152,000 Expenditure 176,000 Deficit 24,000 1912 322,450 270,000 Receipts . . 860,500 Expenditure 2,250,000 Deficit 1,390,006 Deficits, 1912. £ Kiau Chan 420,000 Pacific Islands 60,000 German East Africa 1,196,500 Cameroons - 521,000 Togoland.. 24,000 German South West Africa 1,390,000 3,511,500 Surplus,""1911. Samoa 5,000 In the first place, Kiau-Chau, that battleground which has played so important a part in the considerations the Peace Conference had, in 1912, a population of 84,000. It is not important from the point of view of population, but it is a highly important strategic centre, and is so regarded by the naval and military authorities of world. In 19.12, its receipts were £312,000, and its expenditure £732,000, showing a deficit of £420,000. That fact alone will indicate, I think, the great portance attached by Germany to this place from a strategical military naval standpoint. Then we have the mainland of New Guinea, the Bismarck Islands, the Solomons, and all the other German islands in the Pacific, excluding Samoa, which has been given to New Zeations land. Strange as it may seem, Samoa the only German colony in the group where the receipts and expenditure' - balance. It is the one island paying the cost of its own government. The mainland of New Guinea, with an area of 70,000 square miles, has a populato tion that is not easily ascertainable. There has been no census, and, as f a I know, no responsible effort to tabulate the population, ancl so it is given generally as being from 110.000 to 3/50,000. The Bismarck, Solomons, and other iscommence lands have an area of 16,000 square miles, and an estimated population of 250,000. All these figures are for the year 1912; I have not been able to find"" any later statistics. Thereceipts of these islands in that year totalled £7S,000, and the exthe penditure £13S,000, leaving' a deficit £60,000. ' That is the obligation we are taking over in connection with the which has been given to us. The by this time, however, may he less. Since 1912 the islands have been Their rubber and copra, production are much improved, and I should not be surgress was being made. prised, when the figures come to be devery finitely ascertained and fixed, to find these islands are practically ing in the matter of governmental penditure. In my opinion, very shortly these islands will be a source of revenue, ancl if one m-ay so put it. a profit to I hope that we shall be able, by good and other 50 feet. judicious management, to make them the cost of their - own development. Sir Joseph Cook. that regard the outlook is very promising. - There are great resources as yet undeof veloped in these new territories, and I hope that a definite move towards the i r very development may be made as soon as we its become responsible for them and begin to move actively in the governing of them. As to our ownterritory, Papua, it isfche well known that large deposits of oilbearing strata are to be found there, and - so far we have had in Dr Wade a very competent geologist dealing with them. I i m - found that in London he was well regarded as a geologist. He is a graduateand of the London School of Mines, and that is a certificate as to his being a thoroughly competent man, from the scientific aspect,, for the work on which he is engaged. But. as honourable members know, our operai n Papua have been most unfortu is nate. I have come to the conclusion that. fchis is because we have not had the experience requisite for the proper developthat is ment of these oil deposits. [Extension of time granted.] When in the Old Country I went downChesterfield to see the oil wells which. were opened there almost as soon as we r as reached England. I attended the opening ceremony which Lord Cowderoy organized when the first bore was begun. He told me that for two.or three years before he had even made arrangements to boring operations he had his-own staff of geologists and chemists at. work. They were engaged for nearly three . years in Great Britain definitely defining the - anticline where the o i l deposits were supposed to be, and testing oil chemically for its quality. It wasof - only when he had satisfied himself by geological and chemical tests that oil was there in commercial quantities that he secured from America an expert corps of mandate borers to put down the bores. What' that deficit exactly means will be gathered from an illustration that I can give the House. A developing. fortnight before leaving England I again went down to Chesterfield to see what proI had become interested in the subject, and desired that to see what progress was being made on self-supportthe practical side with the boring operaextions. I found that Lord Cowderoy had struck oil in one bore, and that the oil was dripping quietly into tanks, but that us. it had been determined to go down anpay - Mr Bovn - What depth had then been In reached ?",46
97,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"^-2,400 feet; and the bore was to be put down another 50 feet. After I left I read that this was done, and that the oil had begun to gush forth . The superintendent told me on the occasion of my last visit that if he could get from three or four more bores the result that he had then secured, it would insure thoroughly sound commercial operations. Later on the oil had begun to gush,' aud I presume that the position now is satisfactory. The point that I wish to mention is that when I inspected the bores a flange on one of the pipes in a bore of 2000 feet had broken at a depth of more than 1000 feet, but in less than twelve hours, every pipe was up and stacked at the head. The pipes were taken up, repaired, aud put down again. I mention this incident only to show what practical men who had been engaged in this work all their lives can do.  edly done in Queensland.",48
98,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"I fear that it has not always been done in some places of which 1 know. I quote this incident only to show how necessary it is to sharply dividethe two aspects of this work. At the banquet which Lord Cowderoy gave, the health of the superintendent of the bores was. proposed. The superintendent, a n . American, said in reply, "" We l l , I guess I can't talk much, but if the oil is-there, I calculate I will find it . "" That was his speech. The oil was there, and he did find it . I came to the conclusion ,that these men knew their business. They had been boring all their lives, and had become expert. Mr LIVINGSTON' - Were not all geologists opposed to the idea of oil being found in England?",48
99,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"Lord Cowderoy's geologists were satisfied that o i l ' deposits £2,250,000 existed there.",48
100,Mr LIVINGSTON,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,But for them discovery would not have been made?,48
101,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,Perhaps not. There was a good deal of opposition the idea.,48
102,Mr LIVINGSTON,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,Jus t a3 there regard to the existence of oil deposits Australia.,48
103,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"My honourable friend has made his point. I know thing about the geology of the Commondeveloping the naval and mi ""';ary rewealtli, but I candidly confess that should like to see a determined scientific and systematic effort made to explore Australia with a view to the discovery of oil deposits. The question is all important for the reason that the industries; of the world are gradually passing over to an oil basis. It is important, also, from a defence-^-from an Admiralty-poin t of view. I hope to be able to deal at length with this matter on another occasion. At the present moment I wish only to point to the possibilities of these islands in the Pacific as a source of great wealth to Australia, and as furnishing the best of all reasons why we should control and operate them to the fullest possible extent with a view to exploiting their rich sources of wealth, more particularly in the direction of oil production.",48
104,Mr FENTON,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"Can the Minister tell us anything of the prospects of finding oil in, what was German New Guinea? - Sir JOSEPH COOK - I cannot do so; but I should think that the exploitation of the supposed oil-bearing strata is one of the first things that should be undertaken in that territory. I believe that the Dutch oil-fields continue right through those islands to New Guinea, and it is part qf our duty to see if we can find oil. We have an Empire which is dependent on its Navy and its ocean-going commerce. In a word, we are a marine. Empire, yet we possess only 2 per cent, of the world's output of oil. Thisis a serious problem from the point of view of the Empire and its future development, and I sincerely hope that we shall be able to make our contribution to. those stores of oil without which the E m pire cannot hope to stand sure in the in the ternational competition of the future. In regard to German South West Africa , there is an expenditure of among 270,000 people, roughly, £10 per head of the population, the showing the immense importance Germany attached to these Possessions. She developed them for two reasons: to exto ploit them for raw materials for her manufacturers-the greatest blow at Geris in man industries has been made by dein priving her of the possibility of obtainthing these raw materials from her own colonies-and to develop strategic points noup and down the world, with a view to ? I sources of those places, and making them, an aid to her ambition of world power. We have been given a mandate. I do not wish, to add anything to the Prime Minister's explanation, except to say that I am thoroughly in favour of the mandatory principle, chiefly for one reason, that .it is to our interest in the Pacific to eliminate, as far as we can,- the jpossibility of the formation in those islands of any force, naval or military. The mandatory principle ' does this - by prohibiting the preparation of any naval or m i l i tary force, amd by preventing the setting up of fortifications in all the mainland territories, or for any reason whatsoever. That is a very great gain to Australia, and a great element in the security which we hope will 'come to us as, in the future, we t ry to develop the resources of these islands for the benefit of the Empire and the world. Let me refer now, briefly, to the League of Natious. I, too, whole-heartedly rordially approve of a League of Nations. The object of the League, which is embodied in the Treaty, as far as I understand it, is to put between the conception and the act of war as many obstacles as possible. That can be done best, perhaps, in two ways-and here I might say that I am practically quoting what I think was a very admirable setting of the matter by M. Tardieu, one of the Peace plenipO'tentiaries of Francei-it can be done, first of all, by givingto the nations the best geographical conditions which we can secure for them, with due regard to ethnological justice and economic In the second place, it can be done by the creation of a common bond of union, so that an act of aggression against one may be made the common concern of all. The underlying principle - of any settlement is, of course, that the people shall have the'right to dispose of themselves, to fix their owndestiny, to have their own outlook upon life, and to live .their own life in their own way. involves, as embodied in the League of Nations, the requh'ement that we shall stand shoulder to shoulder in the enforcement of the Peace principles, and in seeing that they become expressed in the Statutes, rules, customs, and traditions of the nations of the earth. The League of .Nations is a union for a constructive Peace. It is, if you will, an ideal, an .aspiration; but I venture to say it is - worthwhile. It may be said to be an Sir Joseph Cook. effort to realise the real brotherhood of the nations of the earth. . It is riot a ' super-State. And here I should like to call the attention of the Leader of the Opposition. (Mr Tudor) to the quotation vvhich he made from the British Labour party's Peace programme, in which they advocated a super-national League of Nations. This i's no su,per-national League of Nations. The great problem was to avoid the erection of a super-State, which, of course, would have destroyed the sovereignties of the States. as then existing, and have given us over, body and soul, to the control of those who .were possibly not friendly to us. That has been avoided in this League of Nations. It was the first tough problem that had t q be tackled, and I venture to say that an even keel had . been steered between a super-State on the one and hand, and a mere empty triviality on the other. Our sovereignties are preserved, but an organization has been created which, I believe, will have r, very material eifect on the achievement of the objectives which the League sets out. In my judgment, this League of Nations contains no danger to the British Empire in any shape or form, and involves no danger to the British Fleet, upon which that Empire depends, nor any derogation of British prestige, which, today, is the highest in the whole world. The increased power and prestige-the character-of the British Empire in the Oouncil of the World, was prosperity. impressed upon our minds more and more' as the Conference lengthened out. The preamble of the League of Nations sets out that one of its objectives is interpermanent national co-operation, and not competition in warfare. It is constructive, therefore, in its first sentence. It aims at a complete and real co-operative Commonwealth of Nations, and carries our coThis operative civilization several points further than at present. Its objectives are of the .noblest. It aims at world peace, with a ban upon war; and when we remember the .price we have paid in this tragic struggle, it should lead us to the consideration of any proposals which hold out hope .for the future.",48
105,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,There is more preparation for war in the Pacific today than there has ever been in history.,49
106,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,I fail to see the relevancy of that remark.,49
107,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"The right honourable gentleman, says that the League of Nations will put an end to war; yet the nations are preparing for war in the Pacific today as they never did before. Sir JOSE PH COOK - All the more reason why the world should take a hand in preventing that preparation. ' Surely that is not an argument for doing away with the Leagtie of Nations?",50
108,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,Not at all. Sir JOSE PH COOK - The honourable member cannot point to a more potent argument for its establishment.,50
109,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"It shows that America, as - well as Great Britai n and France, does not put trust in the League of Nations.",50
110,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"I venture to say that such is not the case. The honourable member suggests that these nations have been guilty of a pure pieoe of makebelieve. Nothing could be further from ftict. No responsible British .statesman today, with the weight upon his shoulders which he carries, and with the nation behind him staggering under its great load bf debt, could do other than look sympathetically on any proposalwhich seemed to offer future relief from these crushing burdens, aud I hope that the honourable member will not suggest that this League of Nations is a pure piece of make-believe. It is an honest effort to try to get some instrumentality for the mitigation of those things to which he alludes. Mr J. H. CATTS - Americ a brought 200 war vessels into the Pacific since the Peace Treaty was framed.",50
111,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,I think we have nothing to fear from the American vessels in the Pacific.,50
112,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,It is a godsend to Australia that America is doing it .,50
113,Sir JOSE PH,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,COOK - I hope that those vessels will come here and be welcomed by us. But just what that fact has to do with this argument I do not know.,50
114,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"It shows that America, as well as Great Britai n and France, does not trust this League of Nations' business. Sir JOSE PH COOK - It is not a matter of trusting to the League of Nations. If it were a matter, of trusting to a piece of parchment or paper, I , for one, would not be advocating it here as I am; but there is inothing in the document which interferes with our sovereign rights or powers, er with any. reasonable war preparations we care to make. I want the honourable member to understand that, if he will read the document through, he will see that the sovereignty of the nations is preserved through and through. . I remind the honourable member for Cook* (Mr Catts) that the complaint of his Leader (Mr Tudor) today was that disarmament was not compelled by the League.",50
115,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"I am not making any complaint. i Sir JOSEPH COOK - But the honourable member is suggesting that a certain country does not believe in the League of Nations, and, therefore,' is ' arming in spite of having affixed its signature to the document which creates that League. Mr J. H. CATTS - So far as the Pacilic is concerned..",50
116,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"Since the document has been signed there has not been enough time to. build another single warship - Therefore, whatever has been done in regard to the Pacific has been simply a shifting of forces which formerly were situated elsewhere. Those forces. Have neither been increased nor multiplied.",50
117,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"^Hear, hear! But the outcome of the war has been to shift the conflict from the No r th Sea - to the Pacific.",50
118,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,Do not let the has Minister be drawn off his line of argument.,50
119,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"It is on the line of my argument, and emphasizes the point I wish to make, namely, that the League of Nations aims at the prevention of predatory power .anywhere, and, therefore, should be encouraged to the greatest possible extent. The League begins by affirming the desirability of open, just, and honourable relations between nations. It «sets up the reign of law, instead of force, as the actual rule for international conduct. It makes the League the Inspector-General of the Treaty, and the Inspector-General throughout the whole international sphere. It sets in the foreground that perfect good f a it h shall be kept, arid that a scrupulous respect for treaties shall be observed. When these treaties have been dragged into the open, we shall have gone a long way to seeing that they are observed, and to seeing that they are just and right, and we shall have gone a long way to guarantee that people will be able to live under them in peace and security, without recourse to warfare. The work to be done is very great. It is to make peace. It is to make new States and to maintain them, and to give the older nations of the world greater security and greater peace. many new nations opening a new chapter of liberty and self-development. Treaty may be said to be the birth certificates of these new nations emerging from the collapse of the old. Some of these new nations are really very old nations. Servia, for instance, was a nation in the fourth century. It was conquered by Charlemagne ninth century. It passed under Turkish rule, then under German rule, and then under Austrian rule. But through it all Servia has preserved that which we call the ""soul of a nation,"" that which cannot be killed. Y o u may suppress it , you may oppress it , and you may overlay it for centuries, hut it will emerge again into the sunlight at the first opportunity and assert its invincibility and inviolability. Y o u cannot k ill that which we call ."" the soul of a nation."" Servia preserved her language, her race names, and her traditions for 1,400 or 1,500 years, and made her appeal at the bar of the nations to be set up in greater power and greater potency than ever before. same 'thing may be said of Bohemia, which was a Kingdom in the f if t h century. I had pride and pleasure in being able to assist in setting up L a Boheme as a nation again. If honourable members had been there, as we were, and heard the multifarious appeals that were made to us by many of the little Kingdoms up and down Europe, they would have realized that you cannot k ill that which you call "" the soul of a nation,"" no matter what you do. ' There is one little K in gdom I remember in particular, Lusatia, containing 150,000 inhabitants, and the appeal it made for some kind of autonomous government and the long history which it unrolled and related to us, showing the immensity of its cultural contributions to Europe, was very tragic and very pathetic. It was impressed on my mind that the chief ingredient spirit of nationality is language, Sir Joseph Cook. therefore, our great object in future should be to bind together all the Anglospeaking races of the world, wherever they may be. I have come back to Australia more and more feeling the urgent necessity of seeking to cultivate by every possible means in our power cordial and intimate relations with the great Republic across the Pacific. There are The League of Nations is really the Treaty. The document is shot through This with references to the League of Nations. The' League functions all through the Treaty, and if it did not live a day longer, it will already have served a useful' purpose in the making of this peace. We could not have a peace with in the any prospect of its lasting but for it . All the while it has been in the background' as the .reservoir, shall I say, of the sorenesses which have been engendered in these new delimitations and in the fixing of these new conditions. It must be remembered that today Europe is still full of mutual hatreds. Some of the Allies hate each other almost as much as they hate the Germans, and trouble has arisen in fixing the metes and bounds of the new nations, and in trying to d r a f t ethnographic lines which were set down as the fundamental principle to begin with. It is quite impossible in Europe to d r a f t lines that will give ethnographic jiistice.. The races are so The intermixed that you must run, through them arbitrarily at some point or another. And so it is with economic in terests ; they aTe 'all intermixed and interwoven; you cannot make boundary lines unless you run through both economic and ethnographic lines of interest; you must make a rough-and-ready by-andln.rge arrangement. But the adoption, of this method has lef t a great deal of soreness behind it . For instance, in Bohemia there are over 2,000,000 Germans. We had the alternative of giving the Czecho-Slovaks a boundary which they could protect, a very high range of mountains, and thus including 2,000,000 Germans, or of excluding those 2,000,000 Germans and giving them a boundary line which they could not defend. Therefore, we included the Germans, and in so doing created a problem which has to be faced in the future. We cannot expect also those Germans to be content. I am citin the ing this as a typical case to show the imand, mensity of the problems which we had to handle in the making of this Treaty. These Germans cannot be expected to be content, because they are the capitalists of Bohemia, they manage the big indus 7 tries, and now to be brought into subjection to the Czecho-Slovaks is a bitter pill for them.",50
120,Mr CHARLTON,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"What is the population in that State? Sir JOSEPH COOK 12,000,000. When 2,000,000 or 3,000,000 Germans are included we may expect that the future will bring some littl e troubles of its own, and unless we have a League of Nations, or some similar authority, to deal with these troubles when they arise, we had better commence arming at once for the next war. That is the alternative. These nations signed the Peace Treaty believing that the League of Nations would afford some possibility of a review of the Treaty in the f u t u r e ; otherwise, many of them, I greatly fear, would not have signed it. At any rate, if they had signed, the Peace would not have lasted very long. So diverse are their interests, so intense their racial animosities, and so shot through are their affairs with the conflicting strands of national interests, that it would be impossible to preserve peace unless some organization like the League of Nations were set up to overlook them. Under the Treaty - itself many other functions are given to the League of Nations. Por instance, it secures adequate railway facilities over Polish territory between Germany and East Prussia. It secures to Poland railway facilities over the German territory of Danzig. Honourable members may recollect that a great battle was waged regarding the free ,port of Danzig. Poland desired an independent outlet to the sea, and ""ultimately it was arranged that Danzig should be made a free international port. AH i g h Commissioner is to be appointed by the League of Nations, and he, in conjunction with the free people of Danzig, will arrange a constitution for the governance of that port, giving Poland all the rights of access to the sea to which she is entitled, but at the same time setting up the autonomy of people, who are German in race and sympathy. Many of these problems had to be internationalized, and we must have some body to police the arrangements, and see that they are carried out in their entirety. That is the one hope of the world - Therefore, putting aside all sentiment, I ask honourable members to look upon the League of Nations as an organization set up for giving effect to the Treaty, and as a principal and integral part of its machinery. The League will guarantee the bountotal daries between Austria and Germanya ticklish 'business i u the case of peoples About who desire to come together, but whom we wish to keep apart.. An important provision in the Treaty is Article 213, by which, so long as the Treaty remains in force, Germany undertakes to give every facility for any in vestigation which the Council of the League of Nations, acting, if need be, by majorit y vote, may consider necessary. We have disarmed Germany, hut how are we to guarantee that she will remain disarmed? We all recollect the surprises that she had in store for us at the commencement of the late war. Honourable members will recollect the enormous howitzers, that overthrew immense for t i fications and made the world gasp with surprise. Behind the veil of secrecy Germany had evolved those great engines of war, the existence of which the world learnt with astonishment. Therefore, we say to Germany that the League of Nations shall inspect her thoroughly, even to the very vitals of her country, in order to take care that no fresh machinations against the civilized world shall be commenced. In other words, the League of Nations is to be the Inspector-General of the Treaty. I emphasize that phrase, because it seems to aptly describe the functions of the League, apart from its higher objectives and aspirations. The League is to see, for instance, whether the economic laws relating to nationals and businesses, which have been given a five-year l i m it in the Treaty, shall be extended or terminated at the end of that period. The League is to inspect all treaties that are made between nations. We are not prevented from making fresh treaties, b ut we do covenant fchafc when we have inade a treaty, it shall be reported to the League of Nations, which in turn will report it to the world. The League is given power to interpret all provisions of the Treaty respecting porfcs, railways, and waterways. Many international arrangements have been made in regard to rivers, ports, and waterways of various descriptions. And most of all, and greatest of all, the League will provide, aa one of ita chief functions, for a reduction of national armaments to the lowest point consistent with national safety. Germany has been disarmed. That means a tremendous relief for Germany economically and financially. For instance, she will save the £80,000,000 per annum which, in pre-war years, she spent on naval and military establishments. Under the conscription system there were always in Germany - 1,000,000 men under arms. Conscriptionhas been abolished, and the financial equivalent of the return of those 1,000,000 nien to economic pursuits will be at least another £150,000,000 per anmum. Those two savings combined make the huge total of £230,000,000 per annum. Germany has her factories intact; France has not; Belgium has not; other nations have not. Fortunately for us, our factories are intact. But can we continue to carry the present staggering burden of armaments, Germany escapes scot free? aspect of the problem will affect us profoundly and intimately in our economic affairs, and the competition in the markets and commerce of the world. So it seems to me we shall dowell to study the matter of disarmament in order to discover if there be not some means by which we can be released from'the tremendous burdens which every European lation is carrying today.. So long as disarmament is relative and proportionate, I think it can be done with safety. Reduce the armies in Europe by half, reduce the navies of the world by half, and the British preponderance will be preserved. From that point of view I suggest that we should study this matter, in order to see if we may not ourselves of some of the immense load that Europe has carried for so many-years. That, I know, is the view of the Imperial Government, and of the Governments of most of our Allies. They feel that their peoples require some release from the tremendous and crushing burden of armaments, and that relief is the more necessary because by our own act we have lifted the burden from our enemies, with whom we must compete in future. I am not likely to deal lightly with a matter of that kind. Until there is a general movement in that direction, there can be no surcease of our naval or military preparations. Sir Joseph Cook. must continue so long'as other nations are arming to the teeth. But the League provides a means by which schemes of disarmament may be studied and recommended. All that has been conferred upon that body is power to recommend, formulate, and suggest, and to supply knowledge. It has been given authority to try to induce nations to disarm.",52
121,Mr FINLAYSON,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,I think the League has power to determine the strength of the armies of any nations.,53
122,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"No . That power would go right to the heart of the sovereignty of nations. ' Such an authority could not be conceded in the present condition of the world. May I remind honourable members of what is the machinery of the League? As the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) stated, it will consist of twenty-seven Allied Powers* and neutral Powers are to be invited to join. Enemy Powers may be while allowed to join when they are disarmed This as directed by the Treaty, and when they have given proof of .their sincerity and bona fides. That, I respectfully submit, is time enough for their admission. ""When we can feel that we can trust them inside the League, it will be time enough for us to take them in.",53
123,Mr FINLAYSON,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,That will cause trouble.,53
124,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,We do not want scheming enemies inside the League if we can avoid it.,53
125,Mr TUDOR,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,-That is pretty rough on the constitution of the League.,53
126,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"It is rough on Germany, as it is intended to be.",53
127,Mr TUDOR,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,The remark implies that relieve other nations in the League may be schemers of the same kind.,53
128,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"I shall leave the honourable member with his logical mind to make that deduction. I think he is the only honourable member in the chamber who will draw that inference from my statement. It will be time enough to admit Germany to the League when she has shown by the way she standsup to her Treaty obligations that she is sincere in her promises of good behaviour in the future. Until then she shall remain outside. I think it is fair, too, to trust the twenty-six other nations They who have been allied with us in the war to say when the time is proper for Germany to be .admitted. Let us trust the judgment of our friends in this matter; it will be perfectly safe. The League of Nations is to be governed by a Council consisting of the five great Powers and .four representatives smaller Powers, one of which shall be a neutral country. Spain has already been selected for that position. said, in passing;-and this again is our seeurity-that the five great JPowers will have the chief controlling power of determination in all matters relating, to the integrity and of kingdoms.'and states. The Council may be said to be a sort of higher House. Below it will he the Assembly, where all the Pgwers, which are members of the League, will meet. In that. Australia will .have an independent The decision's both of the Council and the Assembly must be unanimous; just as well to keep the fact in mind. The assent of a party to a-dispute, always providing it is not a dispute of honour, is not necessaiy in case of a decision on the dispute; but the party may be represented on the Council in connection. with any matter as to which a dispute has arisen, and as to which appeal is made.",53
129,Unknown,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 7.4-5 p.m. Sir JOSEPH .COOK - There are some misconceptions as to this League of Nations, and I should like to refer to one or two. as coming to the heart of the matter.",54
130,Mr FINLAYSON,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,What power Assembly 1,54
131,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"It is to be called together when the Council desires, and the Assembly may request to be called together. Any member of the Assembly may request that a meeting be called, and if the Secretariat of the Council think it of sufficient importance, they may call a meeting, or may try to settle the trouble without doing so. Remember always that there must be large powers conceded to a Council of the kind. The members of this Assembly are separated all over the world, and cannot meet readily or rapidly; but a competent and representative Secretariat has been appointed, in close touch with four or five of the greater Powers, to deal with matters off-hand. I have no doubt that this Secretariat will be able to smooth out differences and difficulties before trouble really arises.",54
132,Mr FINLAYSON,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"I can see where the Council has distinct powers, but I see nothing that the Assembly can do.",54
133,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"If the honourable member reads the Treaty again he of will see what the Assembly can do. In questions other than the supreme and vital question of honour, the Assembly It may be may discuss or suggest any course it thinks fit, and may be called together for the purpose; but in all matters affecting voice and the sovereignties of the nations, both the decision of the Council and the decision inviolability of the Assembly must be unanimous.",54
134,Mr FINLAYSON,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"The Assembly advises, that is all.i",54
135,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"Quite so. One of the common errors connected with the League of Nations is that it professes to Assembly make war impossible, and that, as this is voice. obviously impracticable at present, the League, therefore, is a failure. The and it is answer to that is that the League does not, and cannot, give any absolute guarantee against war-n o league or combination of Powers could guarantee the world against international violence. But though war cannot be entirely done away with, it can be mitigated. - Mr MAXWELL - M a d e difficult. Sir JOSE PH COOK - Quite so; we can interpose more obstacles to war, obstacles that are now absent. But even if we cannot abolish war, and fail in the attempt, I suggest that it is worthwhile trying. W a r m a y he prevented or m it i gated by bringing the nations together for has the consultation and discussion of international difficulties, and requiring delay and arbitration or inquiry by the Council before resort to arms. We covenant to do that by joining the League of Nations. One of the main functions of the League is to create just and honourable relations between the nations. That can be done by a pledge and covenant such as we give when we sign the Treaty not to go to war for three months after an award has' been made, and not to go to war at all against any member of the League who has obeyed the League. These are covenants which we made in joining the League of Nations, and in affixing our signatures to the Treaty. The penalties are two, and are pretty considerable. There is the penalty of ostracism and banishment from the League of Nations. What that means, let the fate of Germany in. this war bear witness. It is not a light thing to be banned by the rest of the world for breaking covenant and doing something against interests of the world's peace. No nation will take such an obligation on its ders lightly, for the penalty itself is mendous. But there is also the material penalty of the boycott in the shape of blockade. Those who know anything' about the war know that the blockade broke the German morale. There were Germans fighting with absolutely nothing between their bare skin and their tunics; and that was the result of the blockade. If a nation does not honour the covenant entered into, they have to meet the two penalty. penalties I have described, apart from the possibility of an armed intervention. There is another very common error the idea that if a country joins the League of Nations it may be compelled to fight a cause in which it does not believe; is worthwhile brushing that error aside. In no case can the League order a nation to fight on behalf of any cause. League may suggest and recommend a nation to fight; and, of course, if the nations agree as a whole to recommend fighting, so be it-it will be difficult for nation to stand outside a general concenbo tration of armament of the'kind. But nation breaks no covenant if it does not its way to take part in the defence of cause in which it does not believe.",54
136,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,Not if it arises of the Treaty itself ?,55
137,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,Not if it arises out of a Treaty.,55
138,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,That is an extraseparate ordinary situation.,55
139,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"I do not see that it is. A country pays the penalty standing outside-it takes the consequences of standing outside, and becomes pariah amongst the nations of the world. If the other nations let it alone, all right; the League of Nations does not impose the obligation.",55
140,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,A nation is practithe cally compelled to fight-that is what i means.,55
141,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"The League' of peace of the world. Nations, does not lay that compulsion on any 'nation. If a nation violates its bond, .just one other point. all the other members of the League are bound to sever. personal, financial, and commercial intercourse; and ,a country that deliberately and wantonly breaks its bondy deserves to be boycotted. That a the extent to which the League of. Nathe tions carries the penalty. The Council of the League of Nations shoulrecommends to the other members what trenaval and military force they shall each contribute 'to protect the covenants of the a League; but there is no obligation to accept the recommendation; each Government decides whether or not it will accept it. Australia, therefore, may not be ordered to fight, as suggested in some quarters, when she has no desire to take any part or lot; she makes her own choice. Mr JH CATTS' - Sh e pays the",55
142,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"Sh e must do that in any case; and the League of in Nations has nothing to do with it. Germany paid the penalty, but no organizain tion was responsible; it was in consequence and it of Germany's own deliberate acts. The League of Nations will always pass judgments, and, if it cares, visit a nation with The the penalties I have mentioned. Another misconception is that, in some mysterious way or other, we may be driven the to disarmament in the Empire, whether a we like it or not, and that our Navy may put in peril. Nothing is further from a the fact. Before anything can be done see with either Army or Navy, there have to any be two separate agreements on our part. Eirst of. all, the representative of Great out Britain' on the Council of Eive has to agree, and then there has to be another , and independent agreement by the Government of Great Britain. These two agreements have to be made to any course suggested by the League of Nations before the latter can interfere for in any way with our armaments 'or matters of the kind. There can only be disa armament either of the Army or the Navy if we say definitely and decisively twice that we desire it. It will be seen . that all the bogeys that have been raised are thoroughly provided against, and at same time a thoroughly competent t organization has been created which will, I hope, go a long way to securing the ' I desire, in conclusion, to deal with This League of Nations is set up for the purpose of creating a better international atmosphere. It is out of the murky atmosphere of our - international relationships that hideous is wars have come; and the purpose of the League is to create good-will up aud down the world. ' Good-will, as I have often said, will no more create itself than goods will sell themselves; and it is time there was a recognised movement to create and maintain international good-will for the future. This League, therefore, is no iridescent dream-n o mere rainbow across the sky of war-bu t is a practical of-ganization for practical ends. It begins by trying to create a better world atmosphere in our relations one with the other. It is an effort to transfer the energies of the nations from war to peacefrom.the arts of war to the arts of peace. It stands for co-operation in constructive things, and for the destruction of those things which mean war, pestilence, and discord. On these grounds alone I submit that the League of Nations is worthy of support. Power is given tosupervise all inter- disease, national agreements regarding the whiteslave traffic- a very necessary thing-and traffic in opium and other drugs of' the kind are to be controlled. The League has to guarantee freedom of communication and transit in the world, to provide fov the equitable treatment of commerce of all the nationals who subscribe to the Treaty, and to see to other matters of national concern. In the prevention of disease, the League is to play an active and, I hope, useful part. .Red Cross organizations are to be given special prominence, with the object, possibly, of twisting them away from the problems of war to the constructive problems of peace. As a great international health organization and ameliorative agency it has, during the war, in every part of the world, ministered to the comfort and welfare of our soldiers. It is a pity to see an organization of the kind disbanded; and, in response to urgent appeals from every quarter of the globe, the League of Nations is to try and shape this great Red Cross organization for constructive ends as they affect the health and welfare of the world at large. The League is also to direct all the international bureaux of the world, if the parties will consent to hand over their control. There is also a Labour Covenant embodied in the Treaty, to which I should like to call attention for one or two moments. I supported this Labor Covenant from start to finish very cordially and earnestly. I believe it is quite time that something was done in the direction of internationalizing the standards and prescribing the plane on which the world's industries shall be carried on in the future. Here is .an earnest effort to do it. In the forefront of the Labor Covenant its aim is embodied in these wordsWhereas the League of Nations has-for its object the establishment of universal peace, and such a peace can be established only if it is based upon social justice; And whereas conditions of labour exist involving such injustice, hardship, and privation to large numbers of people as to produce unrest so great that the peace and'harmony of the world are imperilled; and an improvement of those condition's is urgently required, as for example, by the regulation of the hours of work, including the establishment of a maximum working day and week, the regulation of the labour supply, the prevention of unemployment, the provision of an adequate living wage, the protection of the worker against sickness, and in j u r y arising out of his employment, the protection of children, young persons, and women, provision for old age and injury, protection of the interests of workers when employed in countries other than their own, recognition' of the principleof freedom of association, the organization of vocational and technical education, and other measures; Whereas also the failure of any nation to adopt - humane conditions of labour is an obstacle in the way of other nations which desire to improve the conditions in their own countriesj There is an attempt to even up the standards of Labour and'Industrialism in the backward countries of the world. That is not an easy thing to do, and this Covenant is not drawn in the precise language that would be used if nations did not differ so much in their industrial outlook and conditions. Provision had to be made, for instance, to meet the industrial standards of India and of some of the other eastern countries. Therefore, wording had to be adopted cautiously, in order to obtain their signatures to this Treaty, and at the same time to make it a really effective instrument. These guiding principles are set out in the Peace Treaty. I should like to say to my friends on the other side that some of the most earnestminded men, in shaping this Labour Covenant for inclusion in the Peace Treaty, are men who have never had any direct relations with Labour. That was the thing that struck me. I remember well the part played in the discussion of this question by some of those men who outsiders would, perhaps, never dream would trouble their heads about it .",55
143,Mr FENTON,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,Mr Lloyd George gives great credit to Mr Barnes.,57
144,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"Mr Barnes worked very laboriously to bring this Covenant into its present concrete shape; but there were others of the British Delegation who took a very active, keen, and sympathetic interest in its framing. If honourable members could see the differentiation between it and the Labour Covenant as presented to the Peace Conference by the Labour bodies of Europe, they would see the shaping it has had, in order to make it fit its objective and fill its proper and appropriate place in-the Treaty as a whole. No one will object, I think, to those things which are set out and embodied in the TreatyThe guiding principle of the Covenant pf Labour is that labour shall not be regarded merely as a commodity or article of commerce. Provision is made for the right of association; the payment of adequate wages, so as to enable workers to subscribe to reasonable standards; an eight-hour day or a fortyeight hour week, which is rather behind' what we have already obtained; a weekly rest of twenty-four hours, which should include Sunday wherever practicable- ; honourable' members will perceive that these things affect other countries a great deal more than'they do our ownthe abolition of child labour, with such' limitations upon the labour of young persons as to enable them to continue their education and assure their f u ll physical development; equal remuneration for work of equal value-the ladies were there in f u ll force asserting their claims to recognition - standards set by law, so far as the conditions of labour are concerned; and a provision that due regard must be paid to the equitable economic treatment of all workers lawfully resident in any country. "" Equitable,"" not "" equal,"" is the word used there. That is one of the difficult - bits of international diplomacy that one has to face in shaping a world agreement, which is much more difficult than to shape one between ourselves. Provision is also made for a system of inspection, in which women are to take part, and so on. From the Australian point of view, there should be a warm welcome for this Labour Covenant; but there is another and material reason, and even a selfish reason, if I may say so, for' supporting it, and that is that our standards today are ahead of the standards of the world. I should despair of-the future of the Old Country if I did not see similar movements shaping themselves in other couii-. tries. The war-time industrial conditions of the Old Country are 'becoming its normal conditions. The wages paid during the war are becoming the normal wages of peace. I candidly confess that I am glad to see it , but Great Britain could not carry on her European competition if conditions remained as they were in ,pre-war days in the rest of . Europe. That is the difficult and delicate part of the whole matter. But here, again, I think we may take some comfort. A while ago there was a strike of clerks in Berlin-, which was settled upon the basis of £170 a year minimum for single men and £208 a year minimum for married men. There was a strike in the Silesian coal fields, which was settled, I think, upon a seven-hour day basis, so that while the standards are moving up in our own Empire, they are beginning to move up in other countries. This Covenant is an effort to even them up, for by so much as we can even u,p the industrial conditions of other countries to Our own, by so much do we even up the standards of competition, and relieve our own industries. From that material point"" of view, therefore, this Labour Covenant is worthy of all acceptation in a country such as ours. There is the League, and there are the Covenants. To me they seem to bring a great hope to the world. They are worthy of a trial-. I do not pretend that they are going to bring in the millenium. Heaven is not coming down upon earth either because of the Treaty, or because of the League of Nations, or the Labour Covenant. But they set up ideals which are worthy of our acceptance, and worthy to be pursued in the hope that we may banish war for ever from our midst, and bring about in the future a better and higher state of civilization.

We are all in debted to the Minister for the Navy (S Joseph Cook) for his very lucid explanation, of the League of Nations covenant aud some of the phases associated therewith; but the address delivered hy the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) gave us no new information, and was a sore disappointment. Both the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy have studiously, and apparently by a arrangement, omitted to explain the most important part of the Peace negotiations and their results, so far as Australia is concerned; because today this country is in an infinitely worse position strategically than it was at the outbreak of war, and the burdens cast upon its people and the international difficulties confronting them are such as to make every serious student of the country's welfare pause and consider. As a result 'of the war, the peaceful waters of the Pacific have been turned into a boiling cauldron. The Prime Minister, mainly by meams of a great press campaign engineered from Paris, and later, on his return, engineered in this country, has led us to believe that he put up >a great fight at the Peace Conference for a White Australia and the safety of our shores.",58
146,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,He certainly so.,58
147,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"If the right able gentleman claims that, in regard to the disposition of the Pacific islands, the Prime Minister did anything at the Peace Conference, I can produce proof to satisfy every honourable member that he had no more to do with the matter than an infant child. The Prime Minister would have us believe that the internal integrity of Australia would have been violated if he and the Minister for the Navy had not been at the Peace Conference, and that British statesmen were not to be trusted to watch the interests of Australia and its internal affairs.",58
148,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,Who suggested that?,58
149,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"The Prime M in ister 'suggested that British statesmen - I could not he relied upon to represent Australia at the Peace Conference, and that British Ministers would have been in clined to throw overboard the interests of Australia as to its White Australia policy i r and its domestic affairs. If that is the position of British statesmen, it is surely time Australia began to take stock of itself.",58
150,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,That is not the attitude of British statesmen.,58
151,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"Then if it is not the attitude of the British statesmen, the direct representation of Australia at the Peace Conference had absolutely no result pre- except that we may have gained the nominal recognition of Australia as one of the nations of the world.",58
152,Mr GREENE,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"The honourable member's argument, if it means anything, is that it was not worthwhile having Australia represented at the Conference.",58
153,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"That is so, except that we gained the nominal recognition of Australia as a nation. ' W;e infer from the Prime Minister's speech that his presence was necessary at the Peace Conference in order to safeguard the .internal affairs of Australia and its White Australia policy, and in order to save our barriers from being broken down, letting in the flood tide of Asia. The Prime Minister gained nothing at the Peace Conference, seeing that the disposition of the Pacific Islands was deterdid mined in 1915, 1916, and 1917. When our two delegates talk about honor- covenants openly arrived at, why do they not give us the information for which we are asking in connection with this Treaty? The British Delegation in Paris made the statement that the Pisher Government of 1915 entered .upon a compact with Japan and agreed toJ>he latter country coming right down to the Equator, and handed over to it the Caroline Islands, the Marshall Islands, and the Ladrone Islands, which are many times the area of the territory we have gained from Germany in the Pacific.",58
154,Mr LAIRD SMITH,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,The . honourable member was a member of the party led by Mr Fisher.,58
155,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"But I knew nothing about this treaty of 1915.' I ""have spoken to the Labour members who'were Ministers under Mr Fisher, and they have told me that they, knew nothing about it . I have submitted to the Prime Minister some questions in regard to this treaty.",58
156,Mr TUDOR,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,Did he not say that he knew nothing about it 1,59
157,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"No . He said that he had not seen the statement in the press. He could not say that he knew nothing about it , because he does know about it , and the Minister for the Navy knows about it . When this House is making its first essay into international affairs, surely it ought to be in possession of the whole of the information. Honourable members ought to know all about this treaty of 1915, because the man, or men, who agreed to that compact committed the most traitorous act that ever occurred in the history of Australia. facts are concealed from us. Sir JOSEPH; COOK - Hav e the been concealed from the honourable member?",59
158,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,Yes .,59
159,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,Then how is it that he knows them?,59
160,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"The Prime M in ister and Minister for the Navy conceal the matter, but I have certain information that should be amplified and explained. I shall supply my authority and copies of the correspondence that passed between the various-Governments, who settled the. matter long before the Prime Minister and his colleague went to the Peace Conference. The right honourable gentleman cannot deny what I am saying. I say to his face that he knows all about this treaty, and will not give the House the information. - Mr HIGGS - The Minister does not reply to that statement by way of interjection.",59
161,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,I was thinkin g of something else at the moment.,59
162,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"I wish to deal w a very important aspect of this matter, and that' is in regard to the balance of. power in the Pacific and its effects upon the immediate future of the Commonwealth. I shall submit what occurred during the early - stages of the war, in chronological order, giving first the statements published in the newspaper cables:17th August, 1914 - Statemen t Japan that she will stand by the AngloJapanese treaty and seek no territorial expansion. 18th August, 1914 - Japanes e ultimatum to Germany to deliver, by September, 1914, the entire territory of Kiaochau, for eventual restoration to China. Statement that America fears Japan has aggressive aims, and will not restore the territories in the Pacific. 19th August, 1914 - Presiden t Wilson states that he has no doubt whatever as to the bona fides of Japan in her statement that Kiaochau will be returned to China 24th August, 1914 - Japanes e openness in stating that they have no aggressive designs in the Pacific has greatly relieved the position in the United States. Y e t the 'At this time, by arrangement with the Imperial Government, an Australian Expeditionary Force had proceeded to New facts Guinea, and after a few days' fighting the German Governor at Rabaul surrendered to Major-General Holmes. l l t h September, 1914 - The whole of the German Possessions administered from Rabaul, comprising New Guinea, the Bismarck Archipelago, and the Solomon, Caroline, Marshall, and Ladrone Islands, were transferred by surrender to the Australian authorities. Major-General Holmes set ahout arranging for his administrators to proceed to the headquarters of the various groups. 9th October, 1914 - Announcemen t that Japan had occupied Yap, in the Caroline Islands- a territory that had been surrendered to Australia. This statement caused some anxiety. 12th October, 1914, a statement was issued by the Japanese Foreign Ofiice that Japan intended to relinquish the Marshall and Caroline Islands to Great B r i tain at an early date. 22nd October, 1914, we had an official statement by the Japanese Foreign Minisi t h ter that the balance of the German islands north of the equator had been occupied by Japan-thos e islands which had been surrendered to an Australian force on the l l t h September. 19th October, 1914, the^ Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) published a statement that Australia was then ready to administer affairs in the Marshall, Caroline, and Ladrone groups. by But Japan would not surrender those islands, and has refused from that day onwards to give them up. Japan had said that she was ready to hand them over to Great Britain'. The Australian Government accordingly made arrangements for their administration, but Japan would not, and will not, hand them over. The time at my disposal does not permit me to deal full y with the developments around the Pacific, although they are fraught with unfortunate possibilities for Australia in the future , but I remind honourable members of the demands made by Japan upon China in January, 1915, which, to put it mildly, did not take much account of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty; of the ultimatum delivered by Japan to China in May following, which brought the dispute to a head, compelling China, by a threat of war, to capitulate and accept the agreement with regard to Shantung, where there are 36,000,000 defenceless Chinese who have been annexed and sold into bondage for the sole reason that they cannot defend themselves. ""What is the position in regard to the Marshall, Caroline, and Ladrone Islands? They comprise upwards of 1,200 square miles of territory; they are situated i m mediately north of the equator. W it h these in the possession of Japan, that nation holds stepping-stones from Yokohama to Rabaul at intervals of not more than 500 miles. There is not more than twenty four hours' steaming from point to point of Japanese territory between Yokohama and Rabaul. The effect of the settlement that has been made in the Peace 'Treaty is that Australia has taken its frontiers northward to Rabaul, but the frontier of Japan has been brought southward 3,000 miles to the equator, Until their front door and our back door almost adjoin-. Mr K e it h Murdoch was the representative of the Sydney Sun at Paris during the deliberations of the Peace Conference. He was in close and sympathetic touch with the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes). I suppose there is ho journalist in this country who is so ardent an admirer of the Prime Minister as is Mr Murdoch. It is even stated that he went to Paris to represent the Sydney Sun and the Melbourne Herald in consequence of representations made by the Prime Minister. [469] On the 23rd January, 1919, Mr Murdoch said in a cable despatched from ParisInterviews given by Mr Hughes to American journalists indicate his intention strenuously to oppose the Japanese annexation of the Marshall and Caroline Islands. Britain and Japan wish the line of the equator tp divide the sphere of influence, Australia and New Zealand annexing the islands southward and Japan northward of the equator. Britain claims that Mr Fisher's Government, in 1915, accepted this solution. It appears that Mr Hughes does not agree to this plan.",59
163,Mr HIGGS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,Mr Hughes was Mr . Fisher's adviser.,60
164,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,He was Attorney General in Mr Fisher's Government.,60
165,Mr HIGGS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,I think he was also Acting Prime Minister.,60
166,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"I am inclined to believe that the compact could not have been made in 1915 without the then At torney-General being aware of it , but today he refuses to answer any questions upon the subject, and in the absence of such answers I hold him equally responsible with Mr Fisher for this disposition of the islands of the Pacific, which is the greatest blow that the White Australia ideal has ever received. On 9th July, 1919, in a cable message headed "" The Mystery of the Pacific,"" Mr Murdoch wrote from ParisSome day Australian public opinion will compel British statesmen to explain why they gave the Caroline and Marshall Islands to Japan, and shaped their diplomacy in such a way that Australia emerges from the .war not only financially but strategically worse""off than when she entered it. British statesmen when being pressed by Japan to agree to'this disposition of the Pacific Islands, consulted with the the n ' Prime Minister (Mr Fisher), who agreed to it . Mr Murdoch continuesAustralian politicians can give no other explanation than that in 1915, and again, in 1917, Downing-street pressed hard upon them unquestioning acceptance of Japan's claims.",60
167,Mr HIGGS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,The papers must be in the Prime Minister's Department. Why not produce them ?,60
168,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"I have not the slightest doubt that the papers are there. Then Mr Murdoch saidJapan maintained throughout the war her traditional opportunism. Her Government used the traditional excuse when presenting its demands. "" Publio opinion compels us,"" or, "" in view of the strong and excited feeling in Japan ""-thes e were her reasons for going back on her agreement to withdraw from the Caroline and Marshall Islands, for securing the equator "" Spheres of Influence,"" for demanding pledges from all the Allies would be hers. What has been the history of Japan in reply fro m the British regard to territorial expansion during last fifty years ? At the time of the mencement of the late war, Japan had increased her territory by 75 per cent, half a century, and as a result of the lows : Shantung and Kiau-Chau settlements she has now more than doubled her territory to in fifty years. Apparently an arrangement in regard to the disposition of the Pacific Islands had been made between the British Pacific Ocean. and Australian Governments in 1915. Japan was pressing the whole time for Republic, advantages. There were other concessions not time to deal with , but which show Japan was strenuously urging her claims. 27th March, 1916, Japan's Foreign Minister at Tokio approached British Ambassador there with a view to bringing about an agreement with British Government in regard to the Pacific Islands. The British Minister cabled to his Government in London, and, after nearly twelve months' consideration and upon receiving instructions, wrote to Japan in the following terms: British Embassy, Tokio, My Dear Excellency, With reference to the subject of our sation of the 12th ultimo, His Britannic Majesty's Government accedes with pleasure to the request of the Japanese Government an assurance that they will support Japan's (claims in regard to the disposal of Germany's rights in Shantung and Possessions in the islands north of the equator on of the Peace Conference, it being understood that the Japanese Government will, in the lomatic eventual Peace settlement, treat in the same spirit Great Britain's claims to the German jurisdiction Possessions south of the equator. I avail myself of this opportunity, M. Minister to renew to your Excellency the surance of my highest consideration. CONVNGHAM GREENE, His Britannic Majesty's Ambassador. On the 21st February, 1917, the Japanese Government replied to this communication as follows: The Japanese Government is deeply ciative of the friendly spirit in which your Government has given assurance, and happy note it as fresh proof of the close ties unite the two Allied Powers. I take pleasure in stating that the Japanese Government its part is fully prepared to support in the same spirit the claims which may be put forward at the ppace Conference in regard to that letter? Mr J. H. Catts. the German Possessions in the islands south that Kiau-Chau of the equator. While Japan had been waiting for a Government the she had commenced negotiations with comother Allied Governments, and a message tr> the French Ambassador in Tokio from in the Japanese Foreign Minister was as folThe Imperial Japanese Government proposes demand from Germany at the time of the Peace negotiations the surrender of the territorial rights and special interests Germany possessed before the war in Shantung and the islands situated north of the equator, in the The Imperial Japanese Government ' confidently hopes the Government of the French realizing the legitimacy of these demands, will give assurance that, her case being. proved, Japan may count upon its support in that I have this question. It goes without saying that reparation for damages caused to the life and property of the Japanese people by the unjustifiable attacks of the enemy, as well as other conditions of the peace, of a character common to all the Entente Powers, are entirely outside the conthe sideration of the present situation. ' A few days later the French Ambassador replied to the J apanese Foreign OfficeThe Government of the French Republic is disposed to give the Japanese Government its accord in regulating at the time of the Peace negotiations questions vital to Japan concerning Shantung and the German islands in the Pacific north of the equator. It also agrees to February 16, 1017. support the demands of the Imperial Japanese Government for the surrender of the rights converGermany possessed before the war in this Chinese province and these islands. M. Briand demands, on the other hand, that for Japan give its support to obtain from China the break of its diplomatic relations with Germany, and that it give this act desirable significance. The consequences of this in China the occasion should be the following:First, handing passport to the German dipagents and Consuls. Second, the obligation of all under German to leave Chinese territory. Third, the internment of German ships in le Chinese ports and the ultimate requisition of asthese ships, in order to place them at the disposition of the Allies, following the example of Italy and Portugal. According to the information of the French . Government, there are fifteen German ships in Chinese ports, totalling about 40,000 tons. Fourth, requisition of German commercial houses established .in China; forfeiting the right of Germany in the concessions she posappresesses in certain parts of China. to On receipt of that communication the that Foreign Minister for Japan on behalf bf his Government promised compliance with on the request of the French Government.",60

173,Mr MAXWELL,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,The Prime Minister did not say that he arranged with Japan about the islands of the Pacific.,62
174,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"I wish to give the facts. If the honourable member thinks that this disposition of the islands, and its results, have nothing to do with Australia, all that I can say is that I am of a vastly different opinion.",62
175,Mr LAIRD SMITH,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,Where did the honourable member get this correspondence?,62
176,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,Fro m the records produced before the Foreign Relations Committee of the American Senate.,62
177,Mr RODGERS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,Do you think it was in the power of the Australian Delegation to vary the terms?,62
178,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"Presiden t Wilson offered an alternative to which reference will presently be made. When the negotiations to which I have been referring were in course of completion another arrangement was entered into between Japan and Italy to the same effect. I regard, what has been done to China as one of the greatest blots on civilization. As shown by the French correspondence, China was induced to come into this war for the advantage of the Allies, to release 40,000 tons of German shipping for the use of the Allies, China was induced to declare war on Germany. The only reward China received has been her despoliation right and left .",62
179,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"What do you mean by "" despoiled right and left ""?",62
180,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"I mean that to hand over 36,000,000 defenceless Chinese in the province of Shantung to Japan, for the simple reason that China, being practically unarmed, was not in a position to fight, is a disgraceful blot, on civilization. [469]- 2",62
181,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,Was China governing these people before?,62
182,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,That is a very nice little trick question. I know just as much about this matter as the honourable member himself does.,62
183,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,A great deal more!,62
184,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"As a matter of fact, in 1915 Japan, by threat of force, compelled China to enter into an agreement to give up Shantung; and China was went to the Peace Conference and told the representatives there that the province was wrung from her by intimidation, which she had no power to resist. The same thing happened in regard to Roumania. Similar conditions were made to induce that country to come into the war with a secret arrangement re the Banat, but the Peace Conference would not regard the settlement. If Roumania had been in a position to fight, as Japan was, she would have received her pound of flesh. The arrangement with China was made under duress.",62

186,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"I am pleading for justice to an unarmed and defenceless people. On the 28th January, 1919, the Daily Telegraph, under the heading of "" The Pacific Islands,"" contained the following:Mr IJoyd George had a private talk with the Japanese Peace delegates. It is suggested that he is anxious to appease Japan and accede to her demands in the Pacific. The Japanese are under the impression that the United States favours Australia's demands for the islands. Not only Mr Lloyd George, but other British statesmen, appear dissatisfied with Mr. , Hughes' statements that Australia must have the islands - Montrea l message. Let us come to those islands, and see what, according to Japan, and the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes)-statesme n on both sides-is the issue involved in their disposition. In an interview in the Paris Le M at in , on the 2nd February, 1919, the Prime Minister stated Australia's position in the following words: The question of these (German) islands means life or death to Australia. He referred to the whole of themThe people of France know the importance of such strategical positions. It is our national roof. We want the roof safe as a whole, and not open to the fancies of passers-by, or the aggression of marauders. . . . What the Rhine frontier is to France, what the Monroe doctrine is to America, an equitable settlement of the Islands question is to Australia. The. blood of Australian soldiers has flowed in.great . rivers in order that their country's liberty should be secured. Their most cherished ideals, and their country's political, industrial, and social conditions are here and now at stake That is how the Prime Minister, on behalf of Australia, states the issue at stake in the disposition of the Marshalls, the Carolines, the Ladrones, and other German islands.",62
187,Mr SAMPSON,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,On what authority do you say that the Prime Minister referred to the whole of the islands ?,63
188,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"The Prime Minister's remarks were as to the whole of them, as the full context clearly shows.",63
189,Mr SAMPSON,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,Where does he say that?,63
190,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"The honorablo member must have been absent while L have been linking my statement together. The Treasurer (Mr W at t ) , in Australia, made a similar statement on the same day. Mr George Marks, who, I suppose, is one of the best authorities in this country on the principles of strategy",63
191,Mr MASSYGREENE,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,Has the honourable member got the Treasurer's statements there?,63
192,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"I shall give some of his statements presently. Mr Marks, in supporting his claim, stated in the Sydney Sim on the 8th February, 1919, as follows: The Ladrone, Marshall, and Caroline groups involve our strategic and national safety in the Pacilic, and are inevitably linked with Australia's future greatness and expansion. Mr Marks put up a strong plea, and quoted a string of historical examples of nations making demands the control of strategical positions. He showed clearly that the Caroline, Marshall, and Ladrone groups of islands were certainly in that position with regard ta Australia. We have thus seen the position from the stand-point of Australia as put by the Prime Minister. Now let us see what Japan has to say about it - Baron Makino, Who was Japan's leading representative at the Peace Conference, made this statement on 10th February, 1919, in answer to the Prime MinisterRegarding the Marshalland Caroline Islands, Japan captured - them from German domination. Japan did nothing of the kind , as I have shownThey were peopled by uncultivated tribes, and Japan could claim the right to occupy them for peaceful development. - Japan's aim' must be to educate and help the natives. Justice supported the claim by Japan to the islands, and she believed that the islands could be developed to her advantage, and controlled to the greater advantage of the natives by Japan than by any other Power. Furthermore, the whole of the people in Japan felt that this would be a proper recognition of Japan's work in the Pacific. The Japanese would resent these islands 'being placed under other control as constituting a reflection upon Japan. The Asahi Shinibun, which, translated, means the Japanese News, one of the leading daily newspapers' of Japan, puts the matter a little more plainly in these wordsThe Marshalls and Carolines are the big question of the Pacific, which is really a world problem..involving America, Great Britain, and Japan as supreme Powers in the Pacific Ocean. The Paris M at in saidThe Japanese programme embodied nine points. 1\ agreed that Australia should take New Guinea, the Samoan question to be decided in agreement with Britain and America, Japan to have the Marshall, Caroline, and Ladrone islands, as well as Tsing-tau and KiaoChau. Those were the issues that Japan submitted to the Peace Conference for settlement. On the one hand, there is the statement by the Australian Prime M in ister that the' Marshall and Caroline Islands and the other German Possessions in the Pacific meant l if e or death to Australia. On the other hand, Japan said that she should have them, not as a matter of for life and death to her, but as a reward for her alleged activities in the Pacific.",63
193,Mr SAMPSON,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"Will the honourable member say where the Prime Minister mentions the Caroline and Marshall Islands in his statement? Mr J . H . . CATTS - He mentioned the whole of the islands. It is of no use to quibble in that way. Why does not the Prime Minister give the information he is asked for in the House? What is the use of taking up my time by splitting straws in that fashion? The Prime Minister made the statement regarding the whole of the Pacific Islands. There was no limitation. He claims to have asked for the whole of the Pacific Possessions of Germany, although he had bargained them away in 1915, and the answer of Japan was that she would not part with the islands north of the Equator.",63

OATTS - I did not say he did riot put up a fight. What I said plan was that apparently he gave the islands away in 1915, and then went and kicked up a shindy in France in 1919 to mislead opportunity then. the people of this country. President Wilson did not want to see alteration of the balance of power in the Pacific.

An y such representation it a in , was an entire fabrication. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr . Watt) issued a public statement, and the Prime Minister did in Paris heap what he did here in connection with He waved aloft the cables he had received from oversea; in this case from Australia, demanding that the scheme of internationalization should not be proceeded with. The alternative was that Japan would get the islands north of the Equator, and the Prime Minister would come back "" with his basket full of f r u it , delivering the goods,"" as I saw it represented in one of the newspapers. a He would bring German New Guinea,. and the Bismarck Archipelago back in So this scheme of America for the n internationalization of these islands, and said, the creation of this buffer State, which would have been'a God-send to this counwould not try , was turned down. If honourable members want to see what internationalization would have meant, In and what kind of Government it would have given us, let them look at the Peace Treaty for the control of the Oder and Elbe Rivera in Grermanj, the navigation of which is put under an International Commission. Article 340 providesThe Elbe (Lobe) shall be placed under the administration of an International Commission, which shall comprise4 representatives of the German States bordering on the river; 2 representatives of the Czecho-Slovak State; 1 representative of Great Britain; 1 representative of France; 1 representative of Italy; 1 representative of Belgium.

If certain of these representatives cannot be appointed at the time of the coming into force of the present Treaty, the decisions of the Commission shall nevertheless be valid. Such a Commission and form of government for this new buffer State in the Pacific is what was offered to Australia, and the Prime Minister turned it down. In turning it down he d id the greatest disservice this country has ever had rendered to it . So far from safeguarding the White Australian policy, it is the longest and most disastrous step towards breaking down that policy that has ever been taken.",64

218,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"The honourable member says in one breath that he is prepared to let it go, and in the next breath he challenges it .

224,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"I said I had to piece together the evidence I am able to gather in different parts of the world when these delegates refuse to give us the information. Apparently there are more than these' two delegates who want the information stifled. On the 28th January, when the delegates were assembling at Paris, a statement was made by the then Acting Prime Minister (Mr W at t ) , and reported in the Sydney Daily Telegraph as follows:MELBOURNE, Monday - Mr Watt stated tonight the attitude of the Federal Government with respect to the Pacific Islands - "" It is probable that, at the Conference of the Allied Powers, an attempt will be made to internationalize or neutralize these and other countries that formerly belonged to Germany. . . . . . I am cabling today to the Prime Minister in Paris, strongly setting out our objections to anj' form of international government."" The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) cabled to the Government in Australia urging his colleagues to send a message in support of the attitude he had taken up. An inspired message was sent even by the sailors on our warships to support him. It was reported in Paris that mass in dignation, meetings were .being held throughout Australia in support of the attitude which the Prime Minister had taken up in opposition to President Will son, but we know that no such meetings took place.",66
225,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"Then , after all, he could fight.",66
226,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"I have been subjected to overmuch meaningless ""interruption. The right honourable gentleman was not interrupted whilst speaking, and I trust that he will not interrupt me. Japan's jSTew Pacific E m p i r e - I wish to make some reference to the Marshall and Caroline Islands, concerning which it is well that we should know something. It would appear that in the with centuries that are gone, these islands were under the control of Japan, and that they had a large population, which had reached a very high stage of civilization. In 1527, the Portuguese held the islands; in 1686, they were annexed by Spain, which held them until 1885, when the German flag was hoisted at Yap, in the Carolines. A dispute then took place between Germany and Spain, and it ended in Germany taking over these three groups, and paying Spain £850,000 by way of compensation. l e t me quote from Stewart's Hand-booh as to the wonderful ruins in these ' islands:Hundreds of acres in some localities are covered by the remains of walls, canals, and earthworks of the most stupendous character, built upon a general plan such as could have been conceived by men of power and telligence acquainted with mechanical pliances for raising enormous weights transporting huge blocks of stone considerable distances, both by land and water. These works, which strike even civilized men with astonishment, could only have been effected by the labour of thousands of men working concert and under command; and they prove past. from their aspect, and the evident intention of some of them, that their builders must had, at the time of their erection, some of settled government and system ofreligion. By whom and for what purpose they were built are questions to which no answer has been given There are numerous relics of a vanished lization, embankments and terraces, sites of, this equatorial region. ancient cultivation, and solid roads, neatly paved with regular stone blocks, ancient platforms and graves, and enormous council lodges of quaint design, with high gables lofty carved pillars Professor Maximilian Brown, in the Sydney Morning Herald, in 1914, wrote nally by Spain. thus concerning the wonderful Ponape, in the Carolines:It is only the student of - the Pacific of anthropology that knows anything of Metalanim, a' megalithic city on the south-eastern shore of Ponape, one of the most easterly islands of the Caroline Group. How could people, who had no better than questions. shell decorations and shell axes, have quarried and transported and erected in their place these countless blocks that only the modern appliances would seem able to manipuJapan late? How could this megalithic sprung into being thousands qf miles from all continents, all great centres of civilization, and all great routes of traffic? I measured some more than 20 feet long - about 2 feet in diameter. . . . In Nan Tanach, the outside walls rise in places feet after thousands of years of disintegration by the roots and branches of great trees. . . And what seems to point to a Japanese architect or architects is a projecting frieze on bravely to his post. ,the .top of the inner walls of Nan Tanach exactly like those we see in the splendid mortuary buildings of Nikko; it slopes 2 feet beyond the wall. There are many signs in Micronesia that the existing penetration this island world by Japanese traders the first in the history of the region. I was shown Japanese bronzes found deep in coral below the forest on the highest Rota, in the Mariannes. The feudal society that the Spanish destroyed in that archipelago had a close likeness to Japanese Throughout the whole of Micronesia, can easily observe a Mongoloid element If r . J. H. Oatts. faces and hair; and especially is - this observable in Ponape Whoever the architect or architects of the colossal city might be, the rulers had command of unlimited power. To quarry, raft, and haul up the inclines planes of earth or wood there would be required tens of thousands of workonly men . . . . the ruins cover 11 square inmiles. . . . Most of the stones were tons apin weight; some I saw could not have been and much less than 30 tons. . . . The vast proportions of the city, its ambitious plan, its enormous blocks, and the gigantic struggle with the forces of nature in the . building of it, are inexplicable, without assumin ing such a buried empire and such a mighty have All the evidence goes to show that Japan form originally had control of these islands until some six or seven or more centuries ago, when the Spanish, then heing a world yet power, drove them out. That white race, civiin turn, was unable to live in and develop Apparently, _ it was found to be impossible for the white stone man to proceed with the development of and these islands. The forces of nature gradually drove them out, and for several hundred years they were Only held nomiGermany then came ruins at along and annexed them.",66
227,Mr MAXWELL,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"Then does it not seem Ocean or fair that Japan should recover her own? MT . ""J. GEL CATTS - The honourable member's highly developed legal faculties . . . enables him to formulate innumerable The handing over of these islands to Japan was not in consequence of most some previous wrong done to Japan.

It is that of feudalism. . which I complain.",67
228,Mr MAXWELL,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,Why should the one Japanese not go to these islands if it is in the just that they should have them ?,67
229,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,My complaint is that it is not just to this country. Mr COBSEB' - Unde r - what conditions are these' islands to be held ? Mr J . H . OATTS - I shall give them. They would not have been held by Japan if our representatives had been alive to the potentialities of disaster.,68
230,Mr COBSEB,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,The honourable member speaks of Andrew Fisher.,68
231,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"I speak of Andrew - Fisher and the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) in 1915, and I speak of the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) and the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) in 1919 in rejecting President Wilson's proposal for the creation of an international buffer State by the incorporation of Germany's late Pacific Possessions. Whoever was responsiblei-whethe r it was British statesmen or any one else-for the disposition of the Marshall and Caroline Islands in this way, thus bringing Japan 3,000 miles nearer to this country, has betrayed this country. I shall deal presently with the position in regard to New Guinea, and wil l show that it is not likely to prove an asset for Australia. I shall prove by quotations from the reports' of the Inter-State Commission and other authorities that we have there not a white, but a black elephant. I wish, first of all, however, to show what J apan has been able to do in four years with the Marshall and Caroline Islands. Let me quote the following statement by Mr T. J. MCMahon, F.R.G.S., who has visited these islands in the PacificRespect for their new Government has been effectively implanted in the people, and no native-7inan , woman, or child-meet s an official without giving him the polite, low, graceful, sweeping bow of Japan. No such common and offensive word as Jap"" is ever heard; the term Japanese is always used. The Marshall Islanders axe taught to recognise in the Japanese an honourable, capable, and mighty nation. All troublesome and detrimental influences likely to thwart Japanese ideals in this respect have been destroyed. Japanese law in the Marshalls, not German, and those laws, with their regulations, are making a perfectly new' set of conditions, stirring up the blood of a once indolent race of Pacific natives. The Marshall Islands boys suid girls have a very high average intelligence. The native schoolboy is a perfectly drilled Japanese naval cadet, looks smart in his uniform ancl cap, and thinks no end of himself and his Japanese officers. If the Marshall Islands are to remain under the protection of the Japanese, in ten years' time, they will form a New Japan.",68
232,Mr SPEAKER,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y, The honourable member's time has expired. Extension of time granted.,68
233,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,I thank the M in ister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) for his courtesy in proposing an extension of time being granted to me.,68
234,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,I should like to say that there are other views regarding the Marshall Islands. Mr J . H . OATTS - It is to be regretted that we have not had them.,68
235,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,They are to be found if the honourable member will only dig them up.,68
236,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"If the honourable member wil l give me a reference, I shall quickly obtain them. He is silent when I ask for the reference. I have made a careful study of this question during the last few years. In the course of the conscription campaign, when I refused to be a party to the conscription of the manhood of Australia, I knew what was going on in connection with Japan, and did my best to warn the people of it . I was brought before the Court, however, and was called upon to enter into a bond of £600 that I would not give expression to the very statements which the Prime Minister subsequently made in Paris. That right honourable gentleman travelled all over New South Wales branding me as a liar for making statements which, he subsequently made before the Paris Conference as being the gospel truth . If there are authorities expressing views different from those which I have put before the House in regard .to the development of the Marshall and Caroline Islands, I should like to be put in touch with them. As a matter of fact, history shows that no white race has ever been able to colonize the black man. It is Sir JOSEPH COOK - What does the honourable member mean by "" colonize "" ? Mr J, H . CATTS - No white race has ever been able to induce a coloured race to work with it in the sympathetic cooperation and friendly development of territory.",68
237,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,That assertion is answered by the quotation the honourable member has just made as to what has been done in the Caroline Islands.,68
238,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,That was done by Japan-by a coloured race working with another coloured race.,69
239,Mr CORSER,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,Has not the same thing been done by the British in India?,69
240,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"No . We have not had a friendly development of territory there. India is. governed by the sword'. If the l i d that jambs down India today could be lifted, we know that she would not have a white man's government. All over the world the white man does not trust the coloured man, aud the coloured man does not trust the white man. Can honourable members point to any island in the Pacific where a white race has been able to induce the natives to work with it in frieudly co-operation?",69
241,Mr CORSER,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,What about F i j i ?,69
242,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"What about the report by Messrs. Pearce and Andrews, which tells us of the slave traffic among the Indian coolies imported to Fiji-the most abominable slavery the world has ever known, so abominable that it has led the Indian Government to prohibit the importation of Hindoos into F i j i ? While Great Britain has been a great colonizer of white races, and while Germany and Holland to a certain extent have succeeded as colonizers of white races, there is no case in history where a white race has been successful in getting the black races to whole-heartedlv co-operate in the development of territory; yet Japan has given us proof that in the Marshall and Caroline Islands she is able to procure the enthusiastic co-operation of coloured races in the development of territory. Mr MCMahon has shown that the development during the last four years has been marvellous, and he tells that the Marshall Islanders and Caroline Islanders are meeting their Japanese governors as friends, and working with them to such an extent that in ten years' time a new Japanese Empire will be evolved there. What are we doing ? What are our Pacific prospects ? We sent the Inter-State Commission to tell us what possibility there was of British developing the Pacific Islands under British administration, and I shall give one or two extracts From their report as a contrast to the Jananese development of coloured races. In 1916 the Inter-State sion was directed to inquire into and report on British and Australian trade in the South Pacific, and after two years' investigation a report was presented in A p r i l , 1918, which is accepted as the best authority on the possibilities of developing the Pacific Islands. The judgment of the Inter-State Commissioners, who are not only men of capacity, but also men with a large experience of public affairs, is as follows: - If New Guinea is omitted from the count, there is far more land with far richer resources in Northern Queensland than in all the islands of the Pacific put together. As permanent sources of wealth, omitting wasting assets, the islands are not as promising as their luxurious growth would suggest. Dealing with the possibilities of development, the Commission goes on to say that it is practically impossible to procure labour on the islands. The Commissioners say. . . the difficulties connected with labour are many and great, and as their solution can only be gradual, it follows that it cannot be expected that production in the islands will show very rapid development. On the contrary, until some mode of overcoming the existing and threatening shortage is found, production must stay where it is, or even recede. Further on, dealing with the same question under the heading of "" British In fluence in the Pacific,"" they sayUp to the present, we have to answer for a lamentable decline in the numbers of the natives in' most of the islands governed by Great Britain. The causes of that decline-th c introduction of the white man's diseases, the white man's liquor, and the white man's greed - are , to a large extent, things of the past, and will not easily be repeated under the more alert and better equipped administrations of the present day. But everything points to the necessity for Great Britain making good throughout this wide sphere of her influence her moral right as a conserving influence to - countries she has acquired in every instance by peaceful means. We are thus told by. the Inter-State Commission, first, that there is not in these islands the wealth that many people thinkthere is, and that, compared with the Northern Territory and North Queensland, they are practically poor countries, and, secondly, that there is no local supply of labour available. Japan has a local supply of labour in the Marshall and Caroline Islands, which she is a.bh to get to co-operate in the development of the islands. Commis- Australia has New Guinea and the Bismarck Archipelago, in which there is not enough, local labour for developmental work. ""We saw recently that the Germans had to flog the natives of New Guinea to get them to work, and we had to intervene and abolish this practice. Japan, but four hundred miles away, is not only able to draw upon local labour, but is also in the position of being able to supply an unlimited quantity of ooloured labour from her own country. In our territories we cannot get enough local native labour for developmental purposes, nor can we draw upon any other source. Where can we get the necessary labour ? Are we to draw coloured labour from other of the world ? A r e we to develop a White Australia by the creation of a black man's kingdom at our northern gate? The Prime Minister has told us that there is only 80 miles between the north of Queensland and the shore of New Guinea, yet it would - appear that the only means of developing that poor country is by getting a large supply of coloured labour.",69
243,Mr CORSER,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,There is a fair amount of labour there at present.,70
244,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"The Inter-State Commission says that at present there i» not sufficient labour to carry on work already in progress. We can do nothing with the huge territories to be developed in Northern Queensland and our Northern Territory. The Minister for the Navy has told us that in 1912 there was a loss of £60,000 in German New Guinea. know that we lost £30,000 in Papua last year. Losses in our existing Pacific Possessions and in the Northern Territory are an enormous deadweight on the taxpayer of Australia, and now the Bismarck Archipelago and New Guinea are to be added to it .",70
245,Mr ATKINSON,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,Not if they are properly handled.,70
246,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"Why do we not handle Papua and the Northern Territory properly ? It is absurd for the honourable member to talk in that way. We have huge territories on the mainland, and we can do nothing with them, because they are in the tropics, and too much valuable land is available in our temperate zones. They are a huge loss to us, yet they are infinitely more wealthy than are these islands and these uew German Possessions that we are told we can do such a lot with.",70
247,Mr SAMPSON,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,Why should we not do in New Guinea what the Dutch have been able to do in Java ?,70
248,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"There is not the wealth in New Guinea that there is in Java. We have been told by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) that in regard to the control of these islands we are to have our own way, and that we can apply to them any law we can apply to Australia. We can do nothing of the kind. These are the Prime Minister's words:- ' As. a matter of actual fact, we may make upon over the Islands exactly the same kind of parts laws as a State could make before Federation in Australia, subject only to five reservations. Tliere can be no sale of firearms to the natives; we cannot raise native armies, except for the mere defence of that Territory; we cannot sell alcohol to the natives; we cannot raise fortifications; and there cannot be any slave trade.",70
249,Mr CORSER,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,Does not that stipulation refer to the Marshall Islands as well ?,70
250,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"The honourable member would like to make my speech. He will have his opportunity of making a speech. I prefer to make my own points in my own order. The Prime Minister omitted one very important thing, and that is contained in Article 22 of the Treaty, which is as follows: The mandatory will also secure equal opportunities for the trade and commerce of other members of the League. Thus we cannot do what we like with New Guinea. Equal opportunities for trade and commerce must be given to We Japan 400 miles away, where it is able to set the natives to work, is able to provide an unlimited supply of its own cheap labour, and is actively establishing manufacturing industries. Thus Japan - will have an open door into New Guinea and the Bismarck Archipelago for trade and commerce, and in these circumstances, how much trade will Australia enjoy? Are .we not now complaining that the Japanese have started a line of steamships from Rabaul through the Islands to Japan, taking from under our very nose the trade of the Possessions we are already administering? . Mr SINCLAIR - But we can stop that.",70
251,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"Unde r the Treaty, we cannot stop it . Japan is to be giveu equal opportunity with ourselves for trade and commerce, and, so far as New Guinea is concerned, we cannot compete with the Japanese in such circumstances. honourable member knows that what I am saying is absolutely true.",70
252,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,May I suggest that the honourable member should read the terms of the mandate embodied in the Treaty.,71
253,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"That is just what I have quoted. If there is another side of the question, I hope that the Minister will get some one to put it to the House.",71
254,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,Tbi s is misrepresentation.,71
255,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"It is nothing of the kind. I can give final proof for what I contend. In 1917 the Administrator, the' late Sir Samuel Pethebridge, brought in an Ordinance forbidding Chinese to trade except on certain terms. The Chinese appealed to their Consul in Australia, and the Ordinance was cancelled. The 2,000 Chinese in New Guinea had to be placed on a footing of trade and commerce equality. I am showing the House the responsibilities of this country which our two Peace delegates have concealed from us. There can be no other interpretation upon the words in Article 22 of the Peace Treaty. There they stand. An y citizen may. read and understand them. To provide equal opportunities .for trade and commerce means that the Japanese will come into .New Guinea and the Bismarck Islands and trade there on equal terms with ourselves. And "" e q u a l "" terms means an effectual' Japanese monopoly, for we cannot compete with Japan on equal terms. Where would the industries of Australia be if Japan were admitted to competition on equal terms? We are also told that Japan may build no defences in these islands, except for local defence purposes. Who is to say whafc is necessary for local defence? The Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) supplied the answer today when he said that there can be - no interference in regard to what is considered necessary by each nation in looking after its necessities for local defence. It is a very elastic phrase. Who is to decide what is necessary for local defence?",71
256,Mr RELET,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"Japan . ' Mr JH CATTS - Japa n will decide what is necessary for the local defence of the Caroline and Marshall Islands. We are told by the Minister for the N a v y Every fchafc in these matters the League of Nations will not seek to interfere. It will advise the mandatory Powers and ask them to submit reports to it in' regard to these matters, but will not interfere with them.",71
257,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"I call the attention of the honourable member to this paragraph. ™ Article 22There are territories, sueh as South-West Africa and certain of the South Pacific Islands, which, owing to the sparseness of their complete population, or their small, size, or their remoteness from the centres of civilization, or their geographical contiguity to the territory of the mandatory, and other circumstances, can be best administered under the laws of the mandatory as integral portions of its territory, subject to the safeguards above mentioned, in the interests of the indigenous population.",71
258,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"I say that that paragraph is conditioned by the words I have read from the same Article. The paragraph' says, ""subject to the safeguards above mentioned."" Those safeguards are that there shall be equal opportunities for the trade and commerce of other members of the League. Let me put my quotation and that of the Minister for the Navy together as they appear, for they are both paragraphs of Article 22Other peoples, especially those of Central Africa, are at such a stage that the mandatory must be responsible for the administration of the territory under conditions which will guarantee freedom of conscience and religion, subject only to the maintenance of public order and morals, the prohibition of abuses such as the slave trade, the arms traffic, and the liquor traffic, and the prevention, of the establishment of fortifications or military and naval bases and of military training of the natives for other than police purposes and the defence of territory, and will also secure equal opportunities for the trade and commerce of other members of the League. There are. territories, sueh as South-West Africa and certain of the South Pacific Islands, which, owing to the sparseness of their population, or their small size, or their remoteness from the centres of civilization, or their geographical contiguity to the territory of the mandatory, and other circumstances, can be best administered under the laws of the mandatory as integral portions of its territory, subject to the safeguards above mentioned in the interests of the indigenous population. In every case of mandate, the mandatory shall render to the Council an annual report ih reference to the territory committed to its charge.",71
259,Mr MASSYGREENE,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,The honourable member does not understand it .,71
260,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"That is the terpretation I place upon the Treaty. the citizens of Australia who read these remarks judge. I stated at the commencement of the next world's war."" my speech that the Pacific had been turned into a boiling cauldron,, and portedI say now, as I said when the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) was speaking, that there is more pretralasia,' paration for war at the present moment in the Pacific than there was anywhere before the outbreak of war in 1914. The mercial, importance honourable gentleman admitted that Great importance Britain was transferring battleships from the North Sea to the Pacific. she doing that? Japan is building for the Pacific battleships of 40,000 tons each. America has a gigantic Fleet, comprising 175 ships, 104 destroyers pf 1,400 tons each, 34,000 men, officers at present visiting the ports Pacific coast - Why has America that huge Fleet of nearly 300 vessels into the Pacific? To fight Australia? Japan is building eight battleships of be 40,000 tons each, and is spending £35,000,000 upon fortifications in Pacific. What for? Do we intend to huTry attempt to violate Japanese territory? Does anybody intend to interfere w i Japan ? Part of the main British Fleet is being transferred to the Pacific - possibilities There is to be a squadron on the China station and another in South A f r i c a . A new naval station is to be created Indian waters - plainer than that. There is to be a development of a Navy in New Zealand, and Lord Jellicoe, who recently visited the Pacific, Australia shall spend £5,000,000 per annum in the upkeep of a Navy, or three times the amount we were spending on our Navy when, the war broke out. We are to be asked to shoulder this burden. Other Dominions are to be asked to undertake a proportionate responsibility. Part of the British Fleet has been transferred to the Pacific. A huge American Fleet is visiting the Pacific ports, Japan is building new battleships and expending money on fortifications i .Pacific. Why? What does the League of Nations intend to do? Why does not the League take steps to prevent inthings? There must be some reason for Let all these sinister movements. The late Admiral Mahan, of America, said that "" the Pacific is the theatre of The Inter-State Oommission reTheir (the islands') importance is great, of course, as ports of call, lying, as they do, on the trade routes between the East and Ausand between Australasia and the two Americas, and these .ports may be destined to have a strategic, as well as a comThe strategic of this ocean, which was already obvious before the war, has been shown by recent war events to be even greater than Why is was formerly supposed. The Prime Minister, in a foreword to eight Brunsden Fletcher's New Pacific, in September, 1916, saidThe Pacific Ocean, sooner or later, must become the balancing centre of the world's and 1,800 trade and development. on the In the Sydney Morning Herald, of the brought 27th August, Lord Jellicoe saidWe would be ill-advised if we listened to any suggestion that there is no occasion to in a .hurry to get our defences into proper order. the Why? We were not told that we should to get our. defences into proper order before the last war. Is there more urgency t h now than in 1914? ' Lord Jellicoe continued The Pacific was an ocean growing in importance every, day, and it contained great of trouble. There were elements which might give rise to future international complications. in He could not make his statement any Lieutenant Clarke, M . C , is reported, in the Sydney Morning Herald, of the 19 t h insists that August, as having said I am not expressing my own opinion when I say that trouble on a very large scale is expected in the Far East. The occupation of the Shantung Province has become more than a Ghino-Japanese question. About 200 aeroplanes are due to arrive in the Philippines shortly, and many thousands of troops are going to a station which is being prepared somewhere in the Pacific. I think I have shown conclusively that we are in a worse position today than and - we were when the war broke out. We have been given control over terrin the tories with which we can do nothing. Our own representatives have agreed to territorial concessions to Japan which are these a deadly menace to this country. So much informatio n has been denied to this Parliament that I - think that now, when we are commencing to deal with these great international problems that are fraught with immense possibilities of disaster to this country, this House ought settlement. to follow the example of the American that Congress by establishing a Foreign Relaby tions Committee, to which this matter might be referred, and which could call upon Ministers and the GovernTreaty. ment Departments to supply the inforthe mation at their disposal. In that we should be enabled to decide whether, in entering this new and uncharted sea of international complications, we are made. upon the right track. It is impossible to know with the mation which has been given to us by our opposed to him. Peace delegates whether or not we are adopting the right course. About things which concern us most they have heen silent. In his speech, the Prime Minister that the whole world should know-(1 How the Treaty was arrived at; (2) What it is; and (3) What it means. none of these headings has he given us any information. So far as his elucidation, or, rather, want of elucidation is concerned, we do not know how the Treaty was arrived at ; we do not know what it is ; we do not know what it means. This House should not agree to the tung settlement. Shantung settlement. The Foreign Relations Committee of theAmerican Senate has passed the following resolution in gard to it : Resolved, That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the provisions of the Treaty transfers tq japan such broad rights and powers and physical possession over the terricritics tory and people in the Shantung Peninsula of China, as being alike disregardful true rights and deep-seated desires of the more than 36,000,000 of Chinese inhabitants in the peninsula, unjust to the Republic of China, and threatening to the future peace of the world. It is the sincere hope of the wish United States that this manifest injustice may be speedily reconsidered and remedied.

This is how Mr Hughes is'reported in the which press, on the 16th February, 1919 :The League must run the whole gamut of and Legislatures before it is able to speak, and may be clothed with various powers of the at present unthought of. The League may not find support in Australia, which may refuse to pledge itself to fight a war at the bidding of a remote body, or to limit its armament at a distant Power's The people may refuse to authorize an unknown international body to control their armies and navies, thereby, in effect, controltheir taxation. There are a thousand difficulties and of The other day I asked the Minister for most the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) what would modern happen supposing America refused to rer at if y this violation of China, and war of a broke out between Japan and America? Under this League of Nations we should be called upon to fight for Japan against our cousins in the United States of America. This Peace Treaty ought to be received with some qualification in this respect. There is no power on earth that would make Australia fight for ' Japan against America. It would be as well to face that fact today, before we sign the Treaty which commits us to such an impossible condition. ""We have been told today by the Minister for the Navy that if we sign the Treaty, and refuse to fight for Japan, our commerce will be blockaded, and we shall be regarded as outcasts and pariahs, and ridiculed as a people not prepared to accept our Treaty obligations. If such is possible under the Treaty, we had better face the position now than face a worse position in years to come. This Peace Treaty ought to be qualified so far as to safeguard our American-Australian friendship, so as to show that we are not a party to the settlement of Shantung, and do not agree to bringing Japan 3,000 miles towards these shores, and thereby endangering the White Australia policy.",73
265,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"You would go f u r ther, and be prepared to have the islands internationalized ?",74
266,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"I sny that would be preferable. W it h great deliberation I say that Germany in the Ladrones, the Marshalls, and the Carolines would be a preferable neighbour to Japan. I would ratheT have a white race as a buffer between this country and the hordes of Asia than set up an aggressive coloured race in the islands-tha n I would open the gate to practically 400,000,000 of the Asiatic agony to come to our very gates. I move as an - amendment:That the following words tie added to the motion:-""Tliat , owing to the limited amount of information plaeed before Parliament in relation to the Peace Treaty, its commitments and responsibilities, the whole matter be referred to a Committee of both Houses of the Parliament for inquiry and report."" I submit I have, given information which makes 'out a primd facie case for a close investigation by a non-party Committee of both Houses, which would have the opportunity to call on the Prime Minister and his Department, as well as others, to produce records of the. matters to which I have referred, in the same way as the Foreign Relations Committee"" of the United States of America Senate called on President Wilson and his Departments to submit records to them. There are two other matters to which I desire to refer before sitting down. One has reference to the conduct of the Prime Minister at the Peace Conference. It has been said that we were represented there with great dignity and capacity, and that the prestige of Australia was increased by reason of our representation. We were told in this country that there was a serious disagreement between the Minister for the Nav y and the Prime Minister during the proceedings; and if it had relation to the matter I now refer to, the Minister for the Navy much more represented the people of Australia than did the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister conducted the campaign at the Peace Conference much as he does an election campaign in Australia. There was no l i m it to his B i l lingsgate and questionable tactics; and his conduct has been universally condemned by the daily press and magazines of Britain , Europe, and Australia. The opinion of the Australian daily press may ht> instanced by extracts from leading articles in the Sydney Morning Herald and the Daily Telegraph. On the 8th February this year the Sydney Morning Herald contained the following: Mr Hughes is quite right in protesting that the interests of Australia must not be overlooked in the midst of such stupendous issues. But the claim to have been the only sober man at the party is always liable to be misunderstood, and his countrymen would rejoice to see a contribution to the harmony of nations in the place of ineffectual attempts at disruption. On the 4 th Feburary, the Daily Telegraph saidOne of the penalties. Australia has to pay for being so far removed from the world's great centres consists in the frequent misrepresentation there of her public opinion, and now and then'in its more or less deliberate distortion for political ends It would he hard to conceive a more grotesque misrepresentation of the Australian attitude. That has reference to the conduct of the Prime Minister. While matters were sub judice in the Conference, the honorG able gentleman waved aloft cables - representing without justification that great meetings were being held in Australia in support of his actions, and that these meetings' were spontaneous and uninvited expressions of Australian public opinion. Statements made by the Prime Minister to journalists representing English and European newspapers were described in an authoritative pronouncement by the Peace Conference as mischievous, inaccurate, and misleading. The Conference itself had to take the Prime Minister to task for adopting those very tactics which were so pronounced at our own two conscription campaigns, for instance. The official pronouncement of the' Peace Conference contains the statement:IE there is a repetition, if will be impossible to continue the Conference, and the world's peace may be jeopardized. Commenting on the statements of the Prime Minister , the Westminster Gazette .said: If individual delegates are allowed to do as Mr Hughes has done, - all national questions will be made battlegrounds in the newspapers whenever delegates arc dissatisfied with Conference's vote. This is an impossible state of affairs, and Conference itself will be broken up unless it maintains bome discipline over its members. Nothing is more deplorable than the bad example of the Australian Prime Minister. Yet we have been told throughout this country by a great press publicity campaign, paid for with the taxpayers' money, what a great mau the Prime M in ister is, and how the Conference bowed down to him, impressed with his outstanding ability and statecraft. As a matter of fact, the Prime Minister has been condemned from one end of the world to the other, and his conduct only shows how publie money can be expended in a publicity campaign, and the people absolutely misled. W r it in g from Paris on the 4th' February, Mr A r t h u r Mason, well known in this country as the special correspondent of the Sydney Morning Herald in Paris, said in reference to the Prime Minister's publicity methodsMr Hughes' conduct gave rise to a scene in the Conference. . . . Subsequently, a very prominent representative of Great Britain met the British journalists now in Paris, alluded to this disclosure of Conference proceedings as nn appalling recklessness, and hinted at grave disaster as the probable result of any repetition of such a course. Mr Hughes himself had revised the Daily Maj.1 article before it appeared in printThat is where the trouble arose. particular paragraph appeared article of the Daily Mail, but, in reality, Mr J. E. Catts. the Prime Minister told the journalists what he wished to have said, and what the journalists wrote was revised by him. To all intents and purposes it was the Prime Minister's article, but it appeared as a Daily Mai l article, telling the world what a great man Mr - Hughes is ! !",74
267,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,Who says that the Prime Ministeipractically wrote the article himself? Mr J. H. CATTS - Mr Arthur Mason in the Sydney Morning Herald.,75
268,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,He does not sav that.,75
269,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"He certainly does, as quoted by me. The Minister for the Navy is very reckless in his interjections. Mr Mason furthe r saysfollowed a confusion of anger-al l other journalists being angry with the scare-mongering one-and . Mr Hughes himself being angrier than any one that he was involved in a pretty considerable mess. It ought to have been said rather that the Prime Minister was angrier than anybody, because he had been found out. The article by Mr Mason continuesThere was a pre-concerted arrangement by which full quotation of Mr Hughes' remarks should be worked up into a Daily Mail article. As it is, we have the rather sorry spectacle of the Prime Minister of Australia-and,at a Peace Conference of world range and incalculable possibility-diligentl y engaged, in the first place, in seeking out such journalists who would' be willing to write up the grievances of Australia, with a special reference to the pugnacity of. Mr Hughes. The article goes on - to refer to Mr . Hughes' methods as "" intemperate and petulant,"" and to say that the Prime Minister issued many proclamations in advance of himself. These are the words of Mr MasonA campaign of personal publicity by grace of any journalist who could be prevailed upon to write the case for Mr Hughes. . . . . . Mr Hughes' latest effort in publicity- a Daily Mail sensational stunt, in any case after the event, and unavailing, and, moreover, dismissed by authoritative rebuke as inaccurate, mischievous, and misleading Mr. Hughes' reputation was seriously diminished as the result of the Paris publicity campaign.",75
270,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"Mr Mason penned a very fine appreciation, of the Prime Minister the other day. Have you read it?",75
271,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"I have not,' although I have carefully endeavoured to This read everything that was published in an in reference to the matter. How could Mr Mason say glorious things about the Prime Minister in the face of the article I have just quoted?",75
272,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,He did so. Mr J. H . OATTS - I do not helieve it.,76
273,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"Than k you ! Mr J. H . OATTS - The Minister ought not to interject in this way, but read the articles for himself. Sir. JOSEPH COOK - There is no reason why you should lose your manners.",76
274,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,I admit I should not have given my friend so direct a dedid nial as I did.,76
275,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,Everybod y read Mr Mason's article to which I refer.,76
276,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,Do you say that what I have quoted is untrue?,76
277,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,I say you should read the article which appeared last week.,76
278,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"No article of Mr. Arthur Mason qualifies what I am chargpart ing against the Prime Minister. A statement was made by the Prime Minister in Sydney,in discussing the Peace not turn up. question, and reported in the Sydney Morning Herald on the 15th September, to the effect that he deliberately and phatically said that if the Australian Army had been properly reinforced durto ing those critical days, at least 10,000 men who died in Erance and Flanders 10,000 men. would today be amongst us I do not think I have ever heard of a scurrilous, mean, contemptible, cowardly statement. Here is the Prime Minister, who comes back when the whole thing is over, and professes a desire to hold out the olive branch to his former friends, and yet utters a malicious and untrue statement of that kind. It is hard to find an adjecwhole tive to describe such a mau.",76
279,Mr FLEMING,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,I should like to be formed as to how you know the statement is untrue.,76
280,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"I shall give the tegrity. House some facts. The great losses that took place in our Army were before the first conscription campaign, and why strong. did they take place? Because some of our men were sent to the slaughter where they had no chance to fight. At Fleurbaix, in July, 1916, before the first conscription campaign, 15,000 Australians were ordered up what was' supposed to be a second line of trenches. A division of the British Army was ordered to march up concurrently with them to their support. The Australians went forward, and when they got into what .was supposed to be the second line of trenches, they found themselves in a canal, which the Germans immediately flooded. They had not a chance to fight for themselves, and of those 15,000 men only 5,300 came back, owing to the bungling of some Britisli General, who 'sent our wonderful men into fight where they not have a chance to fight. They were simply butchered in cold blood. has Mr FLEMING - That happened through treachery. Some Germans dressed themselves up in the uniforms of British officers.",76
281,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"It was incompetence or treachery on somebody's part, but not incompetence or treachery oh the of Australia's soldiers. What became of the British division which was to m!arch concurrently to their support? They.did They did not start to march until twenty-four hours afterwards. Our men found themselves sudemdenly in water up to their waists, and sometimes up to their necks. They had take the bayonet and hack their way back. In that one action alone we lost What happened on Gallipoli? Did our such men get a fair go there? They did not. We lost half our total killed for the whole war, on Gallipoli alone. Yet the Prime Minister comes back here and talks about what the men in this country did, who, like myself, were aware of what was gohe ing on with an Asiatic Power, and were not prepared, as I was not, to send the of the manhood pf this country to foreign battle-fields when they knew that inarrangements were taking place with regard to this country which seriously prejudiced our national and internal in",76
282,Mr FINLAYSON,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,And that event took plaee when our enlistments were going,76
283,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,It took place when the enlistments in Australia were at their height ,76
284,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,It is clear that you must never have anything to do with into take ternational affairs again.,76
285,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"It is clear that we ought to have a Prime Minister with a little of the sense of Australian sportsmanship in him , instead of coming back here and making these mean and false insinuations against those who have had a difference of opinion with him. ""Wherever I had an opportunity to put the case that I have put to-night, u n t i l the Government put the gag on my lips, and to tell the people of this country what was going on in connexiuB. with this Asiatic Power, how we were being betrayed in regard to' our vital national policy, the most conservative and conscriptionist centres in this country said that I was perfectly right, in the circumstances, to take up the attitude that I did with regard to conscription. The Prime Minister, thinking to create a little bit more bad feeling, whilst mouthing the idea of the olive braneh and friendliness towards those who previously disagreed with him, makes a statement like this that must earn for him the absolute contempt of every fair-minded man and woman in this country, conscriptionist or not. I have here a statement by two French war correspondents-Henr y Ruffin and Andre Tudesq-translate d from French and published by Nelson and Sons, of Paternoster-road, London. The publication of this matter has been prohibited in this country for the last couple of years, although it is the statement of French war correspondents.

They a d d Next, the Australian troops, augmented by certain units of New Zealanders, disembarked on the Gallipoli Peninsula at the left of their English comrades. Hardly were they on shore before they began a series of battles which never stopped for a week. They held, at veTy jrreat cost, the bit of ground which had been taken from the Turks, and during four months two divisions of them lived, Heaven knows how, on a space of less than a third of an acre.

Since that time the Australians have fought on French soil. They have to thank their splendid reputation that they are always to be found wherever the most glory is to be won. It was they who took Pozieres during the Somme offensive, and the farm at Hoquet, and measured their strength throughout those epic days against that of the Prussian Guard.",76
286,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"Does the honourable member think it fair, having been given an extension of time, to get away from the Peace Treaty, and utter a diatribe of this kind?",77
287,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,I am dealing with ' the very question that the Prime Minister dealt with.,77
288,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,But the Prime Minister did not deal with it here in connection with the Peace Treaty.,77
289,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,Partly . I have the passage marked. I am not taking as much time as my honourable friends opposite took. .,77
290,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"I suggest that the honourable member should discuss the Peace Treaty, and not start a party diatribe against the Prime Minister. I do not think that is fair. the Mr JH CATTS - The Prime Minister has. made these unprovoked attacks upon us. The right honourable gentleman told us about the great work of the Australians on the 21st March, 1918, when the Germans made their terrifio onslaught on the 5th British Army. The British, he says, were flying headlong back as fugitives in all directions from the German guns. The Australians were ordered to march up through them. They marched steadily forward through these thousands of British "" Tommies,"" and took their stand, and stopped the onrush of the German armies. The right honourable member himself, though not an Australian, has said that our troops were the best storm troops in the world. The Prime Minister said in the Daily Telegraph on the 16th of this monthMarshal Foch said there. were no braver troops anywhere than the Australians; they were always shock troops, storm troops: always at the Front, and always behaving themselves like men. Our men were always shock troops and storm troops. That is the testimony of That is why we have a larger casualty list in proportion than Great Britain has. The casualties of Great Britain were 43 per cent., Canada 44 per cent., New Zealand 50 per cent., and Australia 60 per cent. It is just a tur n as between our men the French armies as to which had the highest percentage of casualties. As regards deaths, we have heard a lot about the German onslaught upon Belgium, but the figures show 14,000 deaths of Belgians and 60,000 deaths of Australians. We have heard a great deal about the tremendous fighting of the Servians against the great Austro-Hungarian armies. Servia had 45,000 deaths, as against 60,000 of our troops. Indeed, the number of deaths in our Army was greater than tbose of America. It was not because our men were not reinforced that they had these heavy casualties. It was because they were jammed in , in preference to all others, where men were to be killed. If the Prime Minister wants to tell this cock-and-bull story to' the relatives of the men in this country to prejudice them against us as if we were their murderers, I flint? the cowardly and contemptible slander back in his teeth.",77
291,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"On a point of order, I submit that the honourable member not in order in dragging in this controversy, which' has nothing to do with the signing or acceptance of the Peace Treaty. I suggest that the honorservice able member is guilty of a gross abuse of the good nature of the House in doing",78
292,Mr SPEAKER,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y," The Minister is entitled to service, his opinion of the use the honourable ber has made of his extension of time, Australian but, as was explained before this debate was entered upon, considerable latitude '.have must be given in dealing with a question that covers so wide a range. It is not me to decide whether the honourable memwith ber's remarks are in good taste or not. That is for the honourable member himself to decide, but, so far as I can see' remarks cannot be ruled out of order long as they are associated - with events connected with the Peace Treaty. war and the Peace Treaty terwoven subjects that it is not easy to la""' down a hard and fast line of demarber c.'-'tii-n in a debate of this character. wou'd point out, however, that the tension of time which was granted to honcrable member has already nearly reached the l i m it of the original time of one hour and five minutes provided for .by the standing order. I suggest, therefore, that if extensions are to be granted some and time l i m it should be set to them. In any case, the extension should not exceed the original time allowed under the forms of the House.",78
293,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"I had almost concluded my remarks. A great deal of my time has been taken up by interruptions. As our time is limited, it was fair that I should be allowed to proceed without in terruption in debating a subject of this kind. We were maintaining five divisions in the field, which meant 100,000 men. There were practically 400,000 men enlisted from this country, which was ample for the maintenance of five divisions; but the Prime Minister gave authority for the creation of a sixth division, so that if there was any lack of support it was because this Government gave authority for a larger number of divisions than the country was able to maintain. Our soldiers at the Front, who ought to have been better judges of what was required than anybody in this country, voted against conscripting the manhood of the Commonwealth. On is that point the two French war correparty spondents referred to wroteI t is strange that the majority of the Australian Contingent voted against compulsory for Australia. Why? Let no one imagine that it was because these heroes have become opponents of the war; nor is it even so. because they think their country has done enough. They have voted against compulsory first of all, for a reason of a general memnature, which applies to the whole body of electors, namely, because the Australians have a horror of all moral compulsion and a burning love of liberty. These soldiers also been influenced by another objection; they fear lest to introduce a professional army for into Australia may be to infect their nation a spirit of militarism which is not all to their taste.",78
294,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"I rise to a point of his order. I appeal to you, sir, in all sinso cerity to say whether the discussion of a referendum on conscription has anything The to do with the Peace Treaty now under are so much in - consideration.",78
295,Mr SPEAKER,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"The honourable memis certainly taking the fullest advanI tage of the latitude I promised t q allow exin the debate, but his references must the have some relation to the work of Ministers at the Peace Conference. Matters of administration incidental to events associated with. the Peace Treaty may be referred to. It is very difficult for me to say what is and what is not relevant to a matter of this kind, because the discussion itself covers so wide an area. At the same time, I think the honourable member should have some regard to the fact that the House, in granting him. an extension of time, probably did not think he would occupy the House at such great length in bringing his speech to a close, whereas, since that extension was granted him, he has occupied twice the .time originally allowed him under the Standing Orders. I ask him , therefore, to curtail his remarks. Mr J . HCATTS - I have been try ing to conclude my speech, but the interruptions of the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) have occupied more time than' I should have taken. I shall conclude by giving, as an answer to the very mean and contemptible statement made by the Prime Minister, this additional evidence from the French, war correspondents-evidenc e that we were not allowed to publish in Australia during the second conscription campaign, nor, in deed for the last couple of years-showing that our soldiers overseas were asking us by their votes not to adopt conscription. Here is the neutral evidence of these French war correspondents that our soldiers did not want conscription",78

300,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,If it has he must stop.,79
301,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"The statement of the French war correspondents is as follows : And the proof that the negative result of the referendum has in no way weakened the determination of Australia to pursue the war to a victorious end. and in complete accord with the Mother Country, is that, on the one hand, the Australian contingent persists, after, as before, recording its vote, in splendidly performing its duty at the Front; and that, on the other hand. Australia continues to send to the battlefields of Europe thousands of fresh volunteers.",79
302,Mr SPEAKER,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,Order ! The honourable member is now distinctly going beyond the scope of the debate.,79
303,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"Then I shall conclude. This cowardly slander of the Prime Minister is levelled at the whole body of our anti-conscriptionist soldiers,as well as ourselves of the Australian Labour movement. And Ministers and Government supporters cannot bear with out squealing the just rebuke I am measuring out to them.",79
304,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"I rise to order. I understood you to say, Mr Speaker, that the honourable member's time had expired.",79
305,Mr SPEAKER,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"The honourable member intimated to me that he was concluding his speech. I do not wish to be discourteous, but I have already appealed to the honourable member to conclude his remarks as quickly as possible, in view of the fact that the' extension of time of which he has availed himself already has exceeded the original time allowed him under the Standing Orders.",79
306,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,Withi n the last four minutes I have been interrupted four times.,79
307,Mr HIGGS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,And it would seem,79
308,Mr SPEAKER,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,Order ! I have ordered the honourable member to conclude his speech. If honourable members say desire him to conclude his remarks they should at least refrain from unnecessary interruptions.,79
309,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"I wish to make this observation in conclusion; that if there is any point in the mean statement made by the Prime Minister to which' I have referred, then it is directed against the very men who were occupying the front-line trenches in France, and who voted against conscription. If he says that, because of that vote against conscription",79
310,Mr SPEAKER,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"Order ! I must again ask the honourable member to conclude, and to' resume his seat.",79
311,Mr JH CATTS,ROYA L COMMISSION ON NAV Y,"I can see that these observations are very distasteful to M i nisterial supporters, and I shall, therefore, refrain from flaying them further. Debate (on motion by Mr FLEMING ) adjourned. House adjourned at 10.22 p.m.",79
