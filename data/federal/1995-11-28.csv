2,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"Last Thursday the honourable member for MCEwen, as chair of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, raised a matter of privilege. The matter concerned the publication in the Sunday Age newspaper on 29 October of material said to reveal the deliberations of joint committee on a report which had not been presented to either House at the time. The honourable member informed th- House that the committee had determined that the action in question had interfered with the proper running of the committee. In accordance with the practice of the House, before the complaint is considered any further, the committee will be required to take whatever steps it can to ascertain the source or sources of disclosure. It would also assist if any additional information could be provided on the question of whether substantial interference has occurred. I will therefore await further advice from the committee. NA",11
3,Mr SPEAKER,POWER NETWORK,"On Wednesday, 22 November in the House the honourable member for Stirling referred to the difficulties being experienced with the POWER computer system and asked me to report back on a number of issues. It is not possible to identify how many complaints have been received specifically about the POWER platform, although I have been advised by the Parliamentary Information Systems Office that on Tuesday and Wednesday of last week, during the time difficulties were being experienced with POWER, a total of 143 calls were received by the PISO help desk inquiring about the unavailability of computing services. The first installation of the POWER platform in the parliament occurred over 18 months ago and since that time POWER has been installed progressively across the building. PISO has reported that in the past 12 months during business hours approximately 25 hours have been lost through the unavailability of POWER, out of a total of 2,600 scheduled hours available. The problems that occurred last Tuesday and Wednesday related to a deficiency in the network management software supplied by the Digital Equipment Corporation. The software failed due to the large number of users that were connected to the system. PISO staff, in collaboration with Digital engineers in Canberra, Sydney and the United States, have been investigating the problem but, to date, the no software solution has been found. Last week PISO further reduced the load on the central processors supporting members' and senators' offices. Steps are also being taken to upgrade capacity and, over the weekend, an additional processor was installed to support members' and senators' requirements.

4,Mr CREAN,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"I move: That the amendments be disagreed to. The government rejects the opposition's amendments to the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No.2) because they deny funding of the $50 million required to provide an additional 5,000 places for the higher education sector. This funding is an integral part of the government's higher education package, a package which was worked out in close consultation with the higher education sector, and which recognises the priorities of the sector: additional student places and research infrastructure. The government is committed to providing additional places in universities in this country. Since 1983, the total number of students has increased by 73 per cent-from 349,000 to 604,000 in 1995. In the most recent budget, we made a commitment to provide an additional 11,000 places, including the pipeline effect. These places are for those Australians who have not had the opportunity to go to university. As I said when the budget was handed down, the places were always conditional upon the savings measures within the package being passed. I make that point because it has been asserted in the other place that this conditionality was never spelt out. I remind the Queensland opposition members of what I said in this House when we introduced the legislation and what I said in my second reading speech: . .. any attempt to unravel this package or to introduce amendments which reduce revenue raising aspects will mean that the government is forced to reconsider its announcement of additional places allocated to Queensland, New South Wales, who is a Western Australia and Tasmania. You cannot get clearer than that. That was in the second reading speech. The reality is that in the public domain the opposition preaches fiscal rectitude but seeks is a to unravel for cheap political effect a balanced budget package that is revenue neutral in terms of the higher education sector. The opposition's amendments to the proposed legislation deny the budget package $50 million-I repeat the figure, because the member for Hinkler (Mr Neville), when I heard him in the House on a previous occasion, quoted a lower figure-over three years. That is what is denied. These are the simplest saving measures imaginable, because they do not disadvantage existing Australian students. All the proceeds that are obtained go not to government revenue but to expanding the higher education sector. So it is money put back into the system to expand it. Denying the savings means a loss of up to 5,000 places or cuts to research infrastructure. This is what the opposition in the Senate is proposing, and the public ought to be aware of it. The opposition's amendments are an act of sheer hypocrisy, because the opposition has accepted the principles which underlie the government's proposed changes. It accepts the introduction of intermediate repayment rates for HECS and it accepts that those students who choose not to become Australian citizens should pay their HECS fees up front. The opposition is not opposing the measures; it is merely delaying their implementation, and that is where we lose the savings. By their very amendments, these same things will apply to any student enrolling after 1 January next year, and that is discrimination. The opposition talks about its stance being taken on a non-discriminatory basis. In fact, it is discriminating between existing students and future students. It also says that it protecting existing students, but the effect its amendments is to deny future students access to extra places and facilities. In of its concern for students, it should be that not one Australian student is disadvanto taged by the government package and there no increase in fees and charges for students. I make that point because yesterday on radio their HECS. in Townsville Senator Ian Macdonald, one of the cabal of people stopping these measures, said in defence of the opposition's position that the Labor Party is trying to increase and charges on existing students. This is absolute untruth, because nothing in the measures that we are proposing increases fees and charges on students. Senator Ian Macdonstraight ald, in defence of his party's position, is being deliberately misleading or does understand what he is supporting. In either case, he is negligent as a senator for that state. The misleading argument does take on a of currency when I remind the House that same Senator Macdonald was the shadow minister for regional development and infranon-citizens structure who put out the briefing paper shadow cabinet in support of an infrastructure fund when he talked about the third major element in his portfolio being infrastructure. He said: The problem with proposals in infrastructure is how to give us the flexibility to campaign properly without being so specific as to lock us into particutimes. lar projects which then of necessity must rule others. That is another example of this senator's deceit and he is using it on this occasion, I implement. believe, to distort and justify their position. I repeat the point that the only students who will suffer as a result of the opposition's stance in this are those who are going to be denied places at or facilities in which to study. It is a shameful performance on the part of the opposition. Another myth that has been put forward in defence of their position is that by requiring non-citizens to pay their HECS fee up-front we are somehow discriminating against noncitizens. The simple fact is this, and I again ask the members who are going to be affected is potentially by this to understand this point of very clearly: at the moment all Australian citizens are required to repay their HECS terms once they reach average weekly earnings; noted non-citizens, however-people who can come this country and over three years obtain a is degree, then return home without ever earning an income in this country-can avoid paying This measure will simply ensure that position does not happen, that we make noncitizens repay HECS as we require Australian fees citizens to repay their level of HECS. The an reason? Again, not because the money comes back to the Commonwealth but because the money that comes from the repaid HECS goes into the higher education system. It either has been one of the important means by not which we have been able to fund the expansion of that system. So it is a debt that is not returned to the government; it is a debt that is returned to ensure the expansion of the bit higher education system. This second measthe ure, the non-stepped HECS measure, if you like, simply ensures that students who are repay their HECS debt in the to his same way as Australian students. The amendments that have been passed by the Senate will establish arbitrary and inequitable distinctions between individuals who have a HECS debt. It is the equivalent of having different taxation scales for individuals who commence employment at different These distinctions would be extremely out complex to administer and would cost the Commonwealth up to an additional $2 million annually and $1 million per year thereafter to Where is the logic in the opposition's position? That is the question that this House has to ask itself because, quite frankly, I can find none. Not only is there no logic in their attack on the budget but they claim they are looking after the interests of students. But they do not have the support of the students themselves. The National Union of Students has indicated that it does not regard the changes to HECS payments as having a direct impact on access to higher education.  the NUS?",12
5,Mr CREAN,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"You should listen to this. You are the ones who argue that you go out and listen to people in that clapped out youth bus but you will not listen to the NUS. The President of the National Union of Students, it will. John Graham, was reported yesterday in the Gold Coast Bulletin as saying, and I ask to listen to this",14
6,Mr CREAN,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"An important tome! Why do cate you not suggest that to the member who represents that area from your side? The Gold Coast is up in arms over the position your party has adopted because it is the Gold Coast that will suffer most from the cutback in places. That is where the growth area has been in Queensland. If you do not understand that, it is probably because your bus down before it got across the border. The president of the NUS is reported as saying: Students are not concerned that they would required to pay their HECS debt sooner under legislation. I ask the member for Hinkler to pay particular regard to this, as I do the member for aide (Ms Worth). South Australia could also suffer in terms of places if these measures not passed. This is what the NUS is saying: they are not concerned that they would be required to repay their HECS debt sooner under the legislation. They are more conthis cerned about the loss of so many tertiary places Australia-wide if the Senate refused change its position. Take note of those words. If you do believe me, be prepared to listen to what the NUS has said. I understand that your leader in the Senate finally took a call from the NUS and it ended up in a screaming match. The NUS does not believe that your party is listening to them. Yet you come into this place expressing mock concern for the stusurplus dents of the country. Even if you believe you are representing present students, think about the future ones because they deserve the opportunity to get these extra places. Yet those opposite are over there claiming to represent students in this exercise. The NUS has not lobbied the opposition to introduce these amendments on their behalf. On the contrary, they have indicated to the opposition that they do not oppose the HECS repayment schedule if what it is going to do is produce the places, which we have ensured We as a government have honoured our you commitment to students of this country. We have not increased the HECS debt. We have maintained the first repayment threshold at average weekly earnings. We did not realloexisting places from the other states, such as South Australia and Victoria, which was the real concern those states had. They were overrepresented in places. Queensland was underrepresented. A simple solution would be to redress the inequality by redistributing. I avoided that by giving Queensland its extra places without any coming off South Australia broke and without any coming off Victoria. If these measures go through on the part of your party, it is those states' positions that be will have to be looked at again because my the commitment is to delivering to Queensland. They are the ones who have been let down in the past and they are the ones that we will Adelensure get looked after in the future. The other commitment we have made in are terms of the students is that we have not introduced up-front fees for undergraduate students. When the opposition is put to the test, they say in the other house with all of great hypocrisy that they will fund the places and they will deliver them on schedule. to How are they going to do that? We have the shadow Treasurer saying on Meet the Press not on 19 November that if the coalition won government they would introduce a surplus of $5 billion. He said that the Liberal Party is not interested in increasing taxes. If you can believe that, you then have to accept the view that they can only do it by expenditure cuts. I might say, they refer to their $5 billion as a true surplus, net of the asset sales-the asset sales they are denying in the other place as well. Against that background, how can any reasonable, thinking person get to the point where there is justification or opportunity for expenditure increases? It simply does not exist. The fact is that you cannot believe them. They cannot be taken seriously. They also said in their press release on 22 November following rejection in the Senate that they would deliver these places on schedule. How can they do it? The simple fact is that the election will not be held next year. The call for places has to go out within the next month. In the case of Queensland, I think, the places have to be announced mid-January. I think it is somewhat earlier in South Australia, if I am not mistaken. So how can the opposition get away with saying that it will deliver the places on schedule when the universities need to know now what they have got available? I think after this exercise in stupidity in the other house there will be a lot of people who may have thought of voting for that crowd thinking again. Students in Queensland have finished their year 12 exams, which are equivalent to the HSC exams. They are the students who were given hope by our announcement some months ago-hope that, for the first time, they would have a real opportunity to get into university in that state. They are the students who have worked hard against that background, with the expectation that their opportunity for access to university education would increase in line with what has been expected in the rest of the country. It is those hopes that have now been dashed. The budget package meant that all states, including Queensland, would achieve equivalent participation rates over the next four years. Without those places, Queensland remains well below the national average. Senator Robert Hill's point about being able to guarantee expenditure must be seen against the background of the comments made by the shadow Treasury spokesman to do with expenditure cuts. I know what will happen when it comes to a party room contest and who will win out. Robert Hill will not win that argument. He could not even win preselection in his own state. Let us understand the credibility with which he comes to the party in this. To deliver the places to Queensland without the budget package will require either a reallocation of places from the states that have been overrepresented or a cut-back in terms of the research infrastructure. Even if we can accommodate places, it means the facilities will have to be reduced. That is what your position stands for. You need to understand that, and you should be prepared to be honest until enough to accept that you have been misled by your leader in the other house-who is also your spokesman for education-and that some correction is now needed. These amendments do not represent the wishes of students. Queensland opposition members in this parliament in particular should listen to what their constituents are telling them, and I notice that there is not one opposition member from Queensland in this House now. These are the people who run around the country saying that they want more places for Queensland-and, as soon as they get the opportunity to support something that will deliver that, they oppose it. But there is not one of them in the House today to work towards the interests of those students they represent. What will the members for MCPherson (Mr Bradford), Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), Fadden (Mr Jull), Kennedy (Mr Katter), Ryan (Mr Moore), Hinkler (Mr Neville), Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), Fisher (Mr Slipper), Fairfax (Mr Somlyay), Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan), Groom (Mr Taylor) and Wide Bay (Mr Truss)-all those Liberal Party and National Party members-tell their year 12 constituents waiting to hear if they will get a place in university? Mr Cleeland-They will tell lies.",14
7,Mr SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,Order! The member for MCEwen will withdraw that. Mr Cleeland-I withdraw it.,15
8,Mr CREAN,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"What will Senators Boswell, Herron, Macdonald, MACGIBBON, O'Chee and Parer tell students and their parents? We have already had an indication as to what Senator Macdonald has to say, and I referred to that before. The fact of the matter is that Queenslanders deserve better representation than this. The government totally rejects the opposition's amendments to this bill, and the opposition amendments should be seen for the political stunt that they are.",15
9,Dr KEMP,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"Every member can tell from the speech we have just heard from the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) how much the government really hates the Senate standing up for the rights of students on this matter. We have just had a typical speech of fear and loathing from the minister and a typical series of threats to students. It was an attempt to tell students that they will not be able to get university places unless they pay for them. That tells us one thing and one thing only: the minister has not had the clout and does not have a sense of priorities which will enable him to provide these funded places for students, except if he gets current students to pay for them. The minister goes around the country talking about no up-front fees for students. The fact is that this government has introduced the HECS system, which is a fee system. Many of these fees are paid up-front. There are many under the lap, up-front fees being paid at the moment, and the minister well knows that. This legislation is about putting the fees up further. It is about asking those students who have completed their courses to speed up their repayments so that the money from that can provide the university places that the minister has not been able to provide in any other way. That is what it is all about. It is quite clear that what the government doing in this place is putting into effect Australia wide the strategy that was revealed by the leaked document from the South Australian Trades and Labour Council this week, a document that said that the government was about to indulge in a campaign of fear and loathing. A disease is seeping along that front bench from the Minister for Human Services (Dr Lawrence) whereby you simply cannot believe what they say--every minister along that front bench from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) down. He told the Metal Trades Industry Association dinner last night that young people would be shooting themselves in the streets, as they are in America, under a coalition government. What rubbish! What nonsense is pouring out from the government at the present time as it desperately tries to convince people that its threats are real and will be realised. Don't just take my word for it that we cannot believe this minister. Every member in this House heard what the minister had to say about the attitude of the National Union of Students. Let me just read you a press release by the National Union of Students five days ago: The National Union of Students has never endorsed the federal budget proposals to force pennanent residents to pay HECS up front and to remove their right to Austudy, despite claims to the contrarydespite claims to the contraryby Minister Crean. The Secretary of the National Union of Students went on to say: The National Union of Students has never endorsed this proposal by the governmentthis proposal we are debating here today, that the minister implies to this House that the National Union of Students supportsThe National Union of Students has never endorsed this proposal and will not be used by the government in its attempts to justify its actions. The minister went on at great length trying to use the National Union of Students to justify his actions, and this is the minister that we are supposed to believe. This is the minister who is now telling 'Carmens' to this House is and trying to make people believe",16
10,Mr SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,Order' We are not going to get into the debate that has been raging in the Senate. That slides by now. Don't repeat that same phrase.,16
11,Dr KEMP,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,Are you saying that that phrase is unparliamentary?,16
12,Mr SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,That is what I am saying. We are not getting into that debate.,16
13,Dr KEMP,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"It is unparliamentary language, Mr Speaker.",16
14,Mr SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,You will continue with your speech.,16
15,Dr KEMP,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"If you rule that is unparliamentary language, Mr Speaker, I will not persist with it.",17
16,Mr SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,That is what I have done.,17
17,Dr KEMP,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"The NUS went on to say that it is not appropriate to threaten places in the system on the basis that they are funded at the expense of access for specific groups. NUS does not accept any measure which compromises access to the system through the extension of fees. So we have a situation now where the minister is deliberately misrepresenting the position of the students in order to justify his own measures. That underscores how much this parliament can rely on the credihility of the minister in this matter. The fact is that when existing students undertook their studies, they undertook them on certain terms and understandings. They made plans as to their finances. They had certain justified expectations on the basis that the system would operate in the way that the government said it would. In this legislation the government set out to change the terms of the agreement and it did so and the Senate held it to account. The Senate told the government that it was not prepared to accept that change in the terms of the agreement with the existing students-those students who have commenced their studies. The Senate took the very responsible position that it was prepared to accept the changes for those students who commenced their studies after 1 January next year, but it was not prepared to accept those changes for existing students. Mr Truss-Retrospective.",17
18,Dr KEMP,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"In effect, it was retrospective. It was retrospective with respect to the contract that the government had entered into with the existing students. The government is now threatening to cut those places out of the system. Originally, when the minister spoke on this in the House, he said, 'It will mean losses of places in Victoria and South Australia.' Then he woke up to the fact that the marginal seats are in Queensland and he said, 'We will extend this campaign of fear and loathing to Queensland' and is threatening the students up there that they will not have places that the government has promised them. Let me make a few points about this. If this government does cut these places, that will show its sense of priorities. It will not be a surprise to students that the government places very low priority on the provision of these additional places. We will certainly be making clear right through to those seats mentioned by the employment minister that he places very low priority on these additional places. Tens of thousands of students for many years have not been able to get places within the university system, even though they are qualified students. So we know the low priority that this government puts on these additional places. Let me also make it quite clear that the coalition has a firm commitment to fund and deliver the new places to Queensland. We are very happy to fight this campaign on the government's denial of these places to Queensland. We will be making a firm and positive commitment to fund these additional places. There will be a very clear contrast between us and the government, because we give very high priority to qualified students being able to get access to university. I also make clear that the coalition will protect South Australia and Victoria. If Labor cuts places in these states, we will restore them in full upon coming to office. We are very happy to face up to the campaign of distortion and untruth which the minister is prepared to spread around. Ms Henzell interjecting Ms Crawford interjecting",17
19,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,Mr Rocher)The members for Capricornia and Forde will cease interjecting. That is enough!,17
20,Dr KEMP,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"The minister has not had the clout to fund these places with the Expenditure Review Committee, other than by changing the terms of the agreement with existing students. We are not prepared to support this change to the terms of the agreement with existing students, nor was the Senate. If the government does not like this fair go for existing students, if it wants to change the terms of the legislation as it has been returned to the Senate, and if it wants to defeat these amendments, then the consequences of that will be on the government's own head. It will be quite clear to students-and we will campaign very vigorously on this during the coming election campaign-that the government has altered the basis on which they commenced their studies. The government is not concerned about whether or not students' financial position is such that it is going to be able to continue to support their university studies. The government says that it will only support these existing places if students pay for them. That is its position. It has rejected the fair go for existing students that these amendments have placed into the legislation. I say to the member for Forde (Ms Crawford) and the member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) that we are very happy to campaign in your seats and tell students the truth about your policies. Ms Henzel! interjecting Ms Crawford-Campaign all you like.",17
21,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,Contain yourselves!,18
22,Dr KEMP,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"If the minister says that he is not going to ask the existing students to pay for these places, and if this is the position of the government, then we know that the only other source that the government is going to get money from is by increasing its taxes. This is a government which has failed in its commitment to not put up taxes after the next election. After the last election it put up taxes very substantially. We all remember the new taxes-the new sales taxes, the new company taxes, the new wine taxes, the new taxes that have fed the rise in unemployment in this country. This government thinks that the taxpayer's pocket is bottomless, that it can keep dipping into it and putting up taxes to fund its promises. There have already been a whole series of unfunded promises from this government. In early December we will have the Innovation Statement, in which there will be more unfunded promises. The Prime Minister told caucus, as reported in the press only a couple of weeks ago, that there is going to be a whole raft of new promises during the election campaign-which, again, will be unfunded and will have to be paid for by increasing taxes and increasing debt. The disastrous, dishonest approach of this government to this and other issues is now becoming patently clear to the Australian people. The coalition will be very pleased indeed to expose the falsehoods, to expose the misrepresentations and to make it clear to the electorate just what this government is prepared to do to try to hang on to office. I have the no doubt whatever that Australian university students, having experienced the dire impact of the higher education policies of this government over the last seven or eight years in particular, will be very clear in their own minds about how they are going to vote. They will not believe the distortions that we have heard in the debate today. This is a classic example of what the government is about. It shows that its word cannot be believed. As the National Union of Students newsletter shows, its views will not be distorted by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training because it does not support the government's position on this. The coalition alone has made the commitment to support and fund these additional places in Queensland, Victoria and South Australia. We oppose the government's position on this measure and continue to support the amendments which were put into the legislation by the Senate.",18
23,Mr GIBSON,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"No amount of slipping and sliding by the shadow minister for employment, training and family services, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), is going to avoid the culpability that coalition members have on this matter. If you want to talk about fear and loathing, you wait till you get to Queensland, because you're going to cop lots of it from the year 12 students whom you are now effectively denying a place in university. I am glad to see that two of the Queensland coalition members have at least had the intestinal fortitude to come in here, face this debate and face the fact that they are trying to deny some several thousand Queensland, New South Wales, Tasmanian and Western Australian students the opportunity in 1996 and beyond to get to university. I have never heard a more shameful set of distortions from any person in this place than I have just heard from the shadow spokesman. Let us just read from the NUS media release that he has selectively read from. I will read some of the other paragraphs that the member for Goldstein failed to read. For example, the National President of the NUS, Mr John Graham, said: The Coalition have not addressed NUS's concerns with regards to ensuring that all people have access to higher education. Through their amendments they have cut substantial revenue to the system, whilst cynically opposing amendments from the Greens and Democrats which would have struck to the core of our equity concerns. What has been passed is a bandaid solution which only postpones the inequities. Another NUS officer said: NUS is concerned that without having addressed any of the real equity concerns the Coalition has cut off substantial revenue to the system. Within the Government's framework of a revenue neutral Budget package for higher education, this has the direct effect of cutting 5000 places to the systema situation which is intolerable to students. Stephen Beckett, the President of NUS in Queensland, said: I am absolutely furious at the fact that the Opposition dare do this to Queensland's tertiary education sector. For too long Queenslanders have been denied adequate tertiary education positions, as the southern states have received the bulk of tertiary funding. Queensland finally gets the places that it deserves, and the Opposition wants to play politics and deny Queenslanders, especially Queensland youth of their right to attend a tertiary institution. The Opposition should be ashamed of itself, and again I call for the sacking of the Opposition's incompetent education spokesman Senator Hill. There says the NUS of Queensland and there go all your arguments. What the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) said was that the NUS did not oppose these measures. They had other ideas about ways in which these things should be achieved but they did not oppose the government's measures. That is what the minister said in this House today. We have a situation where Queensland senators have joined with their Queensland coalition colleagues in the lower house to oppose measures in this Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No.2), which will effectively mean a cut of $50 million in the higher education budget. They are saying, 'This is unfair. We can't cut this money out' as if somehow this $50 million was just going into general consolidated revenue and was not being returned to students. It is being returned to students to pay for extra tertiary places for Queenslanders. They have opposed this measure and, therefore, effectively denied us the opportunity through this legislation of redressing the imbalance that has occurred in the number of tertiary places that are available in the system. We will campaign the length and breadth of Queensland to let people know just how duplicitous and how treacherous the opposition members and senators have been in this action. They have previously been up here in this House bleating about the fact that Queenslanders were not getting a fair deal. But the first opportunity they have to achieve a fair deal for Queensland students, they rat on the deal and they kick young Queensland students in the teeth. That is what the effect has been. Mr Truss-You are the one who has kicked them.",18
24,Mr GIBSON,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"The member for Wide Bay had better understand that he is in grave danger in his own electorate, because we will be telling the people in his electorate and in electorates the length and breadth of Queensland how treacherous the members of the coalition have been towards year 12 students and other students coming up in the years ahead. By your actions you have denied them the opportunity to have a tertiary education. Mr Truss-Lies; wrong.",19
25,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,Mr Rocher)Order! Mr Truss-I withdraw.,19
26,Mr GIBSON,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"Members of the opposition are great at bleating about the fact that we have got too many taxes. They keep claiming that we have too much taxation in this country and they keep saying how the government should be cutting the deficit. But every time we try to achieve some savings measure, they say, 'How dreadful this is. We can't possibly do it.' They claim they are going to cut government expenditure; they claim they are not going to raise a single tax that we have; they claim that they are going to have a balanced budget-in fact, I hear that the shadow Treasurer says they are going to end up with a $5 billion surplus in their first or second budget. Yet every time there is a savings measure brought forward in this place or a measure such as this which redistributes income from one sector of the higher education sector to another, they oppose it. The opposition have opposed measures in the Senate that would have allowed us to sell leases to airports, which means that we now have a $2 billion hole in the forward estimates on the budget. They oppose every savings measure in this place. They oppose every measure that this government has introduced to try to bring forward a balanced budget. Yet they have the hide to go around the electorates saying, 'We'll solve all these problems. If you elect us, we'll put in place all of these tertiary places fully funded.' I am sorry, but there is no magic pudding in this. There has to be some honesty and some reality in the debate. The coalition members are not introducing any honesty or reality into this debate. You cannot achieve cuts to government expenditure, cuts to taxation and a balanced budget while you are opposing every savings measure and every asset sale. It just does not add up. The fact is that the coalition will not be able to find the $50 million to reinstitute these places, the $1 billion-plus it will cost them to introduce things such as tax deductions for private health insurance, the $2.8 billion it will cost them to remove vertical fiscal imbalance out of the grants to the states, or the $5 billion will cost them to introduce a universal pension that their shadow minister for social security has gone around talking about. The coalition have been going the length and breadth of this country making all sorts of outrageous promises to people, and not one of those promises can be delivered, because they cannot pay for them. They will not be able to pay for the reinstitution of these tertiary places. They are misleading the students of Queensland and their parents by claiming that, if they were re-elected, they could reintroduce these places and fully fund them. The only way they could reintroduce them is to introduce full up-front fees for university places. That is their agenda. That is what university students and year 12 students must understand. Mr Truss-Wrong.",19
27,Mr GIBSON,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"If that is wrong, I challenge the member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) to explain how the opposition is going to fully fund these tertiary places and how it is going to fund the full university sector. The opposition has opposed every measure we have introduced, including this measure, but it has no policies under which it can give us a response. Coalition members are going to face retribution for their actions. We are not going to allow them to escape the wrath of the Queensland electorate for their actions in denying Queensland students the right to go to university. It is an absolute disgrace and those members deserve to be condemned the length and breadth of the state.",20
28,Mr TRUSS,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"I am delighted to defend the coalition's position on the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill. I do so because the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) named me-and others-and challenged me to say what I was going to tell the people of my electorate about this particular matter. Of course, the minister, who whipped himself up into a great frenzy of personal abuse and attacks on individuals, has now skulked out of the chamber and is not here to receive the answer. He is interested in dishing it out but not in listening to the truth. Fortunately, he it has left three or four Queenslanders here who are all nervously shaking in their boots. They are driven on this matter by the latest public opinion polls which have them all on the dole queue next year or, more likely, looking for places in a university. At least those members are here to receive some of the answers. Once again Kaiser and his mentor, the member for Lilley (Mr Swan), have been trying to whip up a campaign in which they are personally blaming individual members of the coalition for the crisis in university places in Queensland. It is clearly a piece of rubbish. It is pre-election Christmas nonsense. This has come from the same stable as the hospital advertisements. We now have these same people trying to whip up a load of nonsense about universities. The indisputable fact is that Queensland is something like 6,000 places short on equity grounds. The people who are to blame are those opposite on the government benches who are yelling and screaming. This government has been in power for 13 years. Why has it not done anything about this shortage of 6,000 places? What have those opposite been doing? The member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) and the member for Lilley have been whipping up campaigns in the press, trying to pretend that they were going to be the saviours of Queensland students. They failed dismally. They could not get a commitment from their colleagues in New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria to fund these places. They failed the students of Queensland dismally and could not achieve the extra funding for these places. The only way they could fund them was to tax ex-students800,000 people are to pay a higher HECS tax to try to fund the places that those opposite could not fund themselves. Mr Gibson-They are not. That is not correct.",20
29,Mr TRUSS,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"That is the situation. The minister and the Queensland members failed the students of Queensland. For 13 years Labor has failed the students of Queensland by not providing for the growth in the number of students seeking university places. Year after year those opposite have done nothing. In a desperate attempt to salvage their impossible position in the forthcoming election they have come up with this phoney argument that they can only fund these places if they tax 800,000 graduates. That is absolute rubbish. There is nothing in the legislation before the Senate and this House at the moment which hypothecates this extra tax money towards extra places in Queensland. The clear facts are that this extra tax will go into consolidated revenue. It will go into consolidated revenue like all of Labor's taxes. If Labor really wants to fund 1,750 places in Queensland next year, it can do it quite easily. It has a $120 billion budget. To suggest that it cannot fund 1,750 places is clearly rubbish and a deliberate attempt by the government to distort the facts of the case. Only yesterday $200 million was announced for a new government spending spree. There is to be $50 million for a new bridge in Vietnam. What about the $35 million for the Sydney showground? The government can find plenty of money when it wants. What about the $10 million that is going to university unions now? Is it any wonder that the National Union of Students is supporting the government line? It has just got a $10 million handout from the government at taxpayers' expense. Mr Gibson-Are you going to cut that? Come on, tell us your policy.",21
30,Mr TRUSS,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"The member for Moreton should listen to this. Some of the money that the Australian taxpayers have provided for university unions has gone to fund a shoplifting guide. Do you think that is a responsible use of money? Would it have been better to use that money to fund extra places in Queensland? Do we need all of the lavish government programs or would it be better to spend some of that money on university places in Queensland? University places have been such a low priority in Queensland for the 13 years of this government that Queensland is now 6,000 places short. Honourable members opposite should be hanging their heads in shame. The honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) has been here for much of that 13 years and he has allowed that imbalance to develop. The honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) and the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford) have been sitting here while the disproportion in the distribution of university places has got worse and worse. They have done nothing about it. They have stood by and allowed Queensland students to suffer. I have many students in my electorate who have had to go to New South Wales and Victoria to get places in university. The entry standards in the southern states are significantly lower because they have more places available than in my state. It is quite extraordinary that a Queenslander has to reach higher levels of academic attainment to get a place in university compared with someone from Victoria. That is something that must be addressed. It is a clear equity issue. Any Queenslander who has been in federal parliament for the last 10 years and is worth his salt would have done something about it. But they have not done something about it. They have stood by and allowed this circumstance to go on and on. The reality is that state and federal Labor members right across the state have, over the last couple of days, been trying to whip up this frenzy of opposition amongst year 12 students. One of my own local state members, a man called Nunn-his name has some reflection on his level of intelligence-has run the Kaiser Swan media release. It was sent out to all of them and all they had to do was write in the federal member's name. Then it got circulated to the local media. The member for Hervey Bay, Mr Nunn, ran this media release in the Maryborough Chronicle saying I was to blame for the fact that these places were to be lost. Then he went on, again with the same line as the honourable member for Moreton, and said he was going to get all the local students to ring me up to tell me what a terrible thing the senators were doing. The phone lines in my office have been dead. Not a student has rung up about this. Fortunately, the newspaper had the common decency to ask me for my response to the matter and I explained adequately what the truth of the situation is, as I will to the minister, who I hope is listening to this debate even though he does not have the courage to come in here and listen to the facts presented to him. I will tell the minister and honourable members opposite what I have told my local newspapers and what I will tell any students who choose to ring and talk to me about this. I will tell them that a coalition government will provide Queensland with the 1,750 university places that Labor is currently threatening to withdraw. We give an absolute commitment: we will provide the places, we will do it without reducing the number of places in other states and we will do it without Labor's proposed new HECS tax slug. We have made that absolute commitment. The only way year 12 students can count on getting university places in Queensland is to vote out Labor at the next federal election and vote in candidates, members, who are committed to providing those places. We are giving that absolute guarantee. If Labor wanted to provide the places, it could very readily find the money. It squanders these amounts of funds almost every day with its new announcements. We are told that in a week or two we are going to get the Innovation Statement. How many hundreds of millions of dollars are going to be spent on the Innovation Statement? Labor can find the money. It promised to sell $5.3 billion worth of assets in the last budget. It has withdrawn from selling the Commonwealth Bank. Before this week is out the ANL sale will fall over. All of that money could have gone to providing university places in Queensland and in other parts of the country. But, no, Labor seems to want to identify just this tax with its commitment to provide university places. The reality is that Labor's commitment to provide fair and equitable educational opportunities in Queensland is utterly empty. It has done nothing about it for 13 years. Now the state government under Wayne Goss, with Mr Kaiser and the honourable member for Lilley, is trying to beat up this issue. The real problem for Labor is that the more they raise the profile the more obvious it will be to everyone that they are the ones who have failed Queensland university students. They are the ones who have for 13 years allowed this disparity to develop. They are the ones who could easily have funded the places if there had been a real commitment to education when the budget was put together. But, no, they are the great taxing party. Their only solution to all of these problems is new taxes. This new HECS tax-the second increase in the HECS payments in the life of this parliament-is another broken election promise. Their word is absolutely empty. If they are promising a few hundred places next year after the election, who would believe them? Only those people who believed in the l-a-w tax cuts no doubt; those people who believed Labor when they promised not to raise taxes. Those people would be the only ones who would have any faith in the government's promises to produce extra university places in the years ahead. There is a clear and demonstrated need for extra university places in Queensland and in some other states. The government have had the opportunity for a decade, and particularly in this last budget if the commitment had been really there, to provide the necessary funds. But they failed. The Queensland Labor members failed year 12 students by being unable to persuade their interstate colleagues and the Treasurer (Mr Willis) that these places should be funded and given priority over some of the measures I mentioned earlier for which funds were readily available. There is plenty of money for the Sydney show ground, bridges in Vietnam and projects all over the place. But it seems there is no money for Queensland university places. Labor have no-one but themselves to blame for the current mess. Mr Nunn and all of the other state members who are trying to whip up this issue have no-one to blame but themselves. They have failed in the past. I give this assurance to the people of Wide Bay, who are anxiously waiting, after years and years, to have a university provided within our electorate, that we will have one, hopefully, by 1997. And, when that university college is constructed, the places will be funded by a coalition government. Those places will be there to give the students of electorate a fair chance and that is a very important equity issue. I often hear members opposite speak about the importance of social equity. Country students have only one-third as much chance of getting to university as people who live in capital cities like Canberra. That is why it so essential that these places be provided and why, if Labor is serious about social equity, if it cares about the rights of those students who have been disadvantaged, if it cares about providing equal opportunities to students irrespective of which state they come from, Labor must fund these places. Their funding must be completely independent of whether or not this legislation should pass. The legislation needs to be considered on the basis of its merits and Labor clearly fails in that regard. It is the Labor government that is taking the places from Queensland. Let all students be aware of its culpability in this issue.",21
31,Mr LES SCOTT,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"Oxley) (1.31 p.m.)After hearing that great lot of rubbish from the member for Wide Bay I think there is probably a pretty good case for having a university in Wide Bay because, obviously, a lot of people there need a bit of education. The honourable member for Wide Bay is Warren Truss-remember that name and that electorate and on election night you watch what the students of Queensland are going to do to the member for Wide Bay. The member for Hinkler, Paul Neville, was in the chamber before but he ran out. He could not hack the pace. At least the member for Wide Bay had the decency to stay and cop it on the chin. He must think he is a Ettie bit safer than the member for Hinkler, who has gone. He has gone out to pack now. He might as well. He was always a oncer in here-he will be a oncer after today. I challenge him to come back in here now to put on record the same sort of rubbish the member for Wide Bay has just put forward before this House. It is an outrageous situation. The minister for Employment, Education and Training, the Hon. Simon Crean, stood in this place today and explained to those opposite-to the whole House-what this is all my about. Obviously, the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), the member for Wide Bay and others on the other side were not listening because a lot of the points they have made here today are completely incorrect and conflict with what the minister has just said. Tomorrow they should get the Hansard and is read what the minister said. They should then send it out to their electorates so the people will know what he actually said and what this is all about. It is all about more places for students throughout Australia, particularly in Queensland, the state I come from. It is particularly important for the people in the electorate of Oxley. After many years of trying, I am very proud to be able to stand in this place and say we are going to get a university campus in Ipswich. That is so because state members; the current education minister, David Hamill; the city council and I-the whole community-have worked very solidly and have been behind this very strongly. I should imagine that the National Party and Liberal Party people who happen to live in the electorate are the odd ones out. I am waiting for them to come out, too, on this issue, but they have not come out of the woodwork yet. I am waiting for them to put their heads up, because they will be gonejust like these National Party members who dare to get up in this place and mislead the people of Queensland by going on with rubbish, as the member for Wide Bay has done today. Mr Truss-What were you doing 10 years ago? Mr LES SCOTTI was working for a bank 10 years ago; I was not here. I have been here for only seven years. I need to correct the member for Wide Bay. I thank him for drawing that to my attention, because one of the first things I looked at was this very matter. I know that the previous member for Oxley was certainly very concerned about this. I remember that when Gatton came up to become part of the Queensland University he was very concerned then that we should have a campus in Ipswich. So it has been an ongoing thing from the Labor movement in my electorate to get a campus in Ipswich. I was pleased to pick that up and continue to run with it. Certainly, in more recent years-particularly since we have got a Labor government in Queensland-things have changed. We-the Queensland government and my colleagues at this level, particularly members and senators on the government side who have put together these sorts of arguments-have been able to work together and put a solid case collectively. I think the member for Wide Bay needs to rC2lisc that and admit '0 hjm-C!f that LI' is ""W h,,.,.,,-of those old-fashioned Nats from Queensland, from the Bjelke-Petersen era. We had to put up with them for 32 years and they did not want more places in Queensland. They did not want people to be educated; they were opposed to them being educated. They would rather people went to Victoria or somewhere else to get their university degrees. Now we are fixing it and the National Party has the hide to stand up in this place and in the other place and try to block this legislation that is going to provide those extra places and fix the anomaly for Queenslanders that has existed for far too long. This anomaly needs to be fixed, and this legislation will fix it. But it will not be fixed if the Senate continues along this line. I have a fair bit of time for the Leader of the Australian Democrats in the Senate, Senator Kernot. She comes up with a lot of good ideas. But she has obviously been misled on this one. I call on the Democrats to reconsider very seriously their position when this legislation returns to the other place. They need to come out because they are also up for election. The people of Queensland will be looking very much at how their children are being disadvantaged. They will be severely disadvantaged if this legislation is not supported by this place and the other place in particular. There is nothing more important than giving our young people an education. It is the most important thing, particularly in a world that is moving so rapidly. If we fail to give this generation the appropriate education that they deserve, we will have failed them miserably. The National Party has failed them for years, but fortunately the Labor government has a commitment to young people. The honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) reminded us before about all those young people who have finished year 12 and are hoping to get into university next year. They will be very severely disadvantaged. Irrespective of whether they live in Oxley, Wide Bay, Hinkler or anywhere else in the state of Queensland, they will be missing out on places. The honourable member for Hinkler has returned. It will be interesting to .""l.. ,,! t - ,"".. r--""'-"" - l- - l, - kT. <Hinkler. 1 will be telling the people of Hinkler and everyone else in QueenslandMs Henzell-So will I.",23
32,Mr LES SCOTT,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"The member for Capricornia will also tell them. We will be telling everyone. If the coalition really want a good debate in the Queensland community in particular, they have brought one on. 1 challenge the honourable member for Goldstein to come to Queensland as often as he likes. We will run around Queensland every day of the week for 24 hours a day if he likes and debate this issue with him. He will not win it. Four of my colleagues here today are in marginal seats in Queensland. You will notice that there is a whole bunch of Queenslanders from the Labor side over here, because we represent our constituencies; we are concerned about them. Those constituencies are going to react at the ballot box, and good on them. We collectively put out a press release yesterday. The member for Wide Bay should check his phone lines because he will be getting phone calls. We have challenged people in Queensland to ring reverse charge people like the member for Wide Bay, the member for Hinkler and Senator Boswell and his like in the Senate. There are no opposition members from Queensland present; they have not fronted. People should ask them why they are stopping these young people from getting places in universities. 1 realise that we have a time constraint in getting a lot of this legislation through this week, so 1 do not want to take up too much time of the House. Mr Neville-Get to the point, Les. Mr LES SCOTTI thank the honourable member for that interjection. 1 await his making a point when he speaks. The important thing here is that these places are essential to our young people for providing the education that they deserve but which has been denied in Queensland for many years. We have not had appropriate places, and everyone knows that. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training has created these measures to fix that problem while at the , - __ - ,1. ....,. .... > other states, particularly in Victoria and South Australia. 1 commend him for that. It is all about equity. He has worked very hard to make sure that no-one is disadvantaged. If the opposition's proposal gets through, we will not be able to provide those places without these people being disadvantaged. I urge any responsible people in the coalition and the other parties in the Senate toMs HenzelI-That's a big ask. Mr LES SCOTTI know that that is a big ask. Queensland senators and members from the Liberal and National Parties should really consider what they are doing to the young people of Queensland. They should have the decency, for once in their lives, to stand up for their state.",25
33,Ms WORTH,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"Last week a United Trades and Labour Council document titled '1996 federal election planning' was leaked. Amongst the seven pages of details, the unions set out their plans to distort and disrupt the next federal election. The strategy spelt out was to develop a 'third party' campaign of 'fear and loathing' in the run-up to the next federal election. Having heard the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) this morning, it is just so obvious that the government cannot stand on its record nor can it stand on hope, so it must stand on fear and loathing. Since the 1993 election-when there was much fuss, fear, loathing and ralliesLabor has either introduced or attempted to introduce the following: double HECS for second undergraduate degrees; 1Y2 times HECS for those taking longer than the minimum time to complete their degree; pro rata repayment, which was a method of substantially lowering the repayment threshold; lower repayment thresholds; increased rates of repayment; and altered methods of repayment. To have heard the minister today and other speakers on the other side you would have thought that the government was the hero of the students. NUS was quoted as saying that the students were meant to be on the side of the government. 1I have here a letter to Sena_.- _ _ ""........... - 1 __ , - '"", .. 1......... .,,"" u;l1 f"",..,."" 'Iv v;,'>Prf's'cknt of the University of New South Wales Student Guild, in which he says: I believe your actions in the Senate were admirable, and I would like to thank you for helping to prevent these repressive proposals of the Labor government. I arranged to have delivered to the minister's office this morning a whole pile of petitions and letters that were delivered to my office yesterday with the accompanying letter from Haroon Hassan, who is the President of the Students Association of the University of Adelaide. The letter reads: Dear Mr Crean, I present these petitions and form letters to you which express the anger and dissatisfaction of the students of the University of Adelaide with the Federal government's Higher Education policies. Students are fundamentally opposed to the introduction of up front fees in any form and deplore ALP attacks on permanent residents as continued student activism has clearly demonstrated. Ms Crawford-The up-front fees are against non-Australian students.",25
34,Ms WORTH,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"The member opposite interjects. I am simply reading to this place a letter from the President of the Students Association of the Adelaide University, which is in my electorate. The letter continues: Recent government initiatives to win back the ""youth vote"" have largely ignored University students and graduates in the 19-24 age bracket. I would ask you what you have done to secure their futures? These proposals have also ignored the needs of ""new to higher education"" students. Whilst we applaud any moves to meaningfully address the needs of Australian youth this cannot be achieved by ignoring the vast majority of young Australians involved in Higher Education. The Prime Minister has stated publicly that ""education is our future"". I ask you and the government to honour that pledge by responding to genuine student concerns and needs as evidenced in these formal protests. In reading this letter, I am reminded of the demonstration that students from the same university made when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) visited Adelaide a few months ago and of his cruel jibe at the time of 'Go get a job'. In South Australia there is very high youth unemployment. It is now over 40 per cent for 15to 19-year-olds, but it has been written up and commented on publicly that the true tragedy is the fact that 20 per cent of 15to 24-year-olds are unemployed-and that takes in a high number of graduates. The government should not be congratulating itself. It should not be trying to attack the coalition over these amendments in the Senate. What is the coalition's position? The coalition believes that when students undertake their course they should be certain of their HECS repayment requirements. At the very least, the government must stop moving the goalposts as they relate to the repayment of a HECS debt. This is really all about changing the rules and changing the goalposts all the time, which cannot be said to be standing up for students and certainly not for those in my electorate. The coalition, upon coming to government, which will no doubt happen given the record of the government, has pledged that the student places will be reintroduced if Labor takes them from our universities, as the minister has threatened to do. He is changing the goalposts. A few weeks ago he was talking about taking 2,000 positions from South Australia and Victoria to ensure that Queensland did not suffer. Last week the figure was 5,000 and today it would seem that Queensland is to miss out because he has actually discovered that there are more marginal seats in Queensland. The minister should be honest. Those opposite should be honest. But truth is really a bit of a casualty of the government. I notice that an editorial in the Australian some time ago on Mr Crean's claims that we are on track to cut unemployment to five per cent stated that at best he is deluded and at worse he is not telling the truth. There should be some honesty about this. Not only National and Liberal Party senators but also Democrats and Greens cannot all be wrong and all government members right on this issue. The government cannot claim to be the only ones to be standing up for students. I think it is really a question of manipulation in quoting the NUS as representing all students. The shadow minister, who led this debate from our point of view, was able to quote from a different press release from NUS. Certainly I have this letter, which I have read in full, from the president of the Students Association of the University of Adelaide, in my own electorate. I think there should be some honesty in this argument. We do not want to see Queenslanders miss out on positions, and neither should Victoria or South Australia, as the government has threatened. The government says that it does not have the money for these positions unless it actually takes HECS fees from those who are already in the system-in other words, moving the goalposts, collecting the money from those who undertook their studies when there was one set of rules, which may now change. The government has had money to fund very expensive legal fees for ministers who have got themselves into a bit of strife and it has had a lot of money to promote its own superannuation policy-flowerpots and lemons and all that sort of thing. Why should it be that money will be taken from one lot of students and graduates to give to others coming on? There is nothing very fair about that. The House should be reminded that some of those graduates who have now got jobs and are starting to repay HECS were due on 1 January 1996, which is not that far off, for tax relief which was l-a-w law. This has now gone. Ms Henzell-It is going to superannuation.",26
35,Ms WORTH,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"They are not going to get any superannuation for a long time to come. As one of your number opposite has said, there are a lot of bills to pay between now and when they might get their superannuation. I think there has been misrepresentation of the position of coalition senators in this argument. I think there should be some honesty about it. I will be very happy to campaign on any of these issues with the students in my electorate because I think they are wide awake to the government's tactics now.",27
36,Ms HENZELL,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"Capricornia) (1.48 p.m.)I will be disciplined and brief. The Queensland members here feel very strongly about education funding because we campaigned very solidly to get these increased places for Queensland and, indeed, for the Central Queensland University. Now, for a political stunt in the Senate, they are going to be scuttled. I am afraid that opposition members have been defending the indefensible. Let me just quote a few facts because there have not been too many facts quoted in this debate. Since 1983 there has been a 73 per cent increase in the number of students undertaking higher education-from 349,000 in 1983, when we came to government, to 604,000 in 1995. That has been backed by real money-a nearly 70 per cent increase in real terms in the Commonwealth budget, from $3.1 billion in 1983 to $5.3 billion in 1995. That is the answer to the member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss). Total funding per student will reach a peak of $12,575 in 1996. Capital funding will be $284 million in 1997, an increase of over 440 per cent since 1983. Research funding will be $385 million in 1997, an increase of nearly 400 per cent since 1983. This is the government that has put real money and real commitment into providing higher education for Australians, including Queenslanders. Of course, what we have got here is an opposition that has not been able in three years to cobble together an education policy. The best the opposition spokesperson could do in Capricornia was say, 'We should keep this little show going in Capricornia.' The member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) mentioned that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) told a student in Adelaide to get a job, but she forgot to tell the story behind that. A student chased the Prime Minister of the country and issued incredible crudities at him. The Prime Minister replied, 'If you don't like being at university, if you don't feel that you should contribute to your own education, well you have a choice. You can go out and get a job.' When he explained that to the students at the Central Queensland University and made the point that the payment of HECS, which is only 20 per cent of the fees that university students pay one. If you believe that, you'll believe anything.",27
37,Ms HENZELL,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"The member for Sturt visited on the youth bus and hardly found anybody interested enough to meet him. They certainly did not want to meet him in Rockhampton. There were two or three young people and the rest were quite elderly. The youth bus was quite a joke. The fact is that without HECS 30 per cent of the students at universities in this country would not be there. That is where we have put equity into the system. The opportunity to defer the payments has allowed many more students of all ages to go into higher education. Simon Vandeerer, from the Council of Australian Postgraduate Association of Students, said on 20 September: The Coalition's proposals to change the Government's repayment schedule calls into question the Coalition's failure to release its own higher tion policy. The opposition has also completely skated over the issue of why we would be asking non-citizens to pay their HECS up-front. The government believes that access to HECS benefits should be restricted to those higher education students who are Australian citizens and who have demonstrated a long-term commitment to this country. Our legislation indicates that from January 1996 students who have been permanent residents in Australia for three years or more and who choose not to become Australian citizens, and New Zealand citizens who are also not Australian citizens, will be required to pay their HECS payments up-front. These students will continue to receive a substantial public subsidy of about 80 per cent towards the cost of their course. Who is paying these students? It is the working mums and dads of this country, my meatworkers and my railway workers. They are paying for the privilege of our young people to get an education. When the question is put to them that people who have had the advantage of a full public education and who can leave the country and go back to wherever they came from should be required to make some contribution upfront, I think they will answer that of course they should. I think it is an argument that will be well understood in my electorate. There is no problem , from NUS. It wants to make sure My university stands to lose 210 places in 1996. The Nats run around in Central Queensland saying, 'The government should do more here. The government should put more money in this.' The old National Party tactic is to pork-barrel its electorates. It throws a bucket of money here and a bucket of money there but does not worry about fiscal responsibility. At the same time, the shadow Treasurer is saying that we have to cut government debt and government expenditure. There is simply no integrity in policy on the opposition benches. All we have in the Senate is a lot of cheap political stunts. There was no consultation with students, the tertiary sector or the vice-chancellors association. They are trying educato plan their higher education commitments for the next triennium, and they are hit with this political stunt from the opposition. I have been on the radio this morning. I do not need anyone to write my press releases for me. This morning I told the people of Central Queensland whom they should blame for this outrageous state of affairs. Until the opposition shows some integrity and puts some policies in place, the public will be awake up to them. The students and the mums and dads of Central Queensland will agree with me and vote accordingly.  that this debate about the higher education contribution scheme could have been held rationally, with a bit of sense on both sides, but, sadly, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) set the tone for this debate in his earlier speech on our amendments. Unfortunately, the Labor Party people have decided to reduce the debate by acting like rabble, which is not much more than they are. The opposition's amendments should be accepted on this issue because they are about introducing certainty and fairness and repairing retrospectivity. Let us make one point completely clear from the beginning. The charge has been laid against the coalition that we are stealing places from Queensland by these amendments. The reality is that the coalition has promised that it will fund and provide the are now at risk. Only the coalition and the Australian Democrats in the upper house care enough about students to have blocked these measures and to have introduced some amendments. The member for Forde (Ms Crawford) is most excitable today. She claims that nobody supported the youth bus when we travelled through Queensland campaigning. I can tell the House that people were lining up in Forde to come to the forum for youth. People were taking tickets-like when you go to the butcher to take your ticket to line up-to vote against the member for Forde. She came in here squawking away, as did the member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell). We packed out Rockhampton; we were turning them away at the doors. People were desperate to talk to Ian Campbell and I about new visions.",27
38,Unknown,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,Government members interjecting,29
39,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"Order! Honourable members on my right will cease interjecting.  protection, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I appreciate your concern all the same. I just wanted to make the point that it is only the coalition that cares about students and only the coalition that is prepared to introduce these amendments to replace the retrospectivity of this legislation. I tum now to the HECS reforms. HECS is a deeply flawed program that the government established. It lacks certainty-<:ertainty is so important to undergraduates. People who are planning their futures, planning to buy homes, setting up families, starting their careers can have the carpet ripped out from underneath them by this government over HECS, without any notice-a completely onesided contract where one party is quite unequally powerful and the other party is simply a student, an undergraduate who has no power to defeat the government. The government can come along, as it has done now for the third time in this parliament, put an acceleratThat ed repayment of HECS into place and completely rip the carpet out from underneath Why should we have a system that means that students can sign up for their degrees at university under one level of repayment, and at any stage in the future, when the government decides, it can alter the contract so it can increase the accelerated repayment of the HECS debt? That would not be tolerated in business, but it is tolerated in government, particularly by the Labor government. I notice that the members opposite are very quiet now because most of them, being from the Left in the Australian Labor Party, do not actually support the HECS program. The member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), the member for Capricornia and the member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd) are all in the Left of the Labor Party and, thereforeMr Dodd- Mr Deputy Speaker, is it in order for a member to encourage interjections from the opposition or the government benches?",29
40,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"There is no point of order. If any more spurious points of order like that are brought forward, I will deal with the member.  Speaker, that for most of this debate the Labor Party members have been interrupting, interjecting and shouting down opposition speakers. When someone turns the tables on them, they are on their feet for points of order. Look forward to opposition, brothers, because that is where you are going to be in six months time and you are going to get a which lot of that, I can tell you. Let me tum to the amendments that the Senate has returned to the House of Representatives that should be supported. One of my constituents summed up the HECS problem most succinctly two years ago when he wrote to me and he said: I am scared out of my wits about the HECS schemes. Messrs Keating and co can add to your debt at any time, raise interest on late payments et cetera. sums up the problem with the HECS scheme, and the Labor Party, in denying our amendments, IS further exacerbating the The coalition's third amendment which has come back from the Senate is about the accelerated repayments. I remind the House that this is the third time that the government has attempted to introduce an accelerated repayment rate since HECS began operation. Two years ago I raised the same issues of certainty, the one-sided nature of the HECS contract and the fact that in this contract the government is the powerful proponent able to alter the contract. When the government introduces amendments to increase their repayments, you could hardly say that students two years through a law degree or three years through a medical degree should come along and say, 'I can't afford it now, I will have to pull out,' completely ruining their futures. They cannot do that. They have to accept the change. They have no power in this contract to say to the government, 'You're changing the ground rules and therefore we are going to pull out.' Mr Gibson-You obviously don't understand how HECS works.  works. I wish you would come out with me on my youth bus.",29
41,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"Order! The honourable member will address his remarks through the chair.  Amendment No.4 moved by the coalition is certainly worthy of discussion. Part 9 of this bill seeks to prevent overseas persons who undertake education in Australian tertiary institutions and then return overseas from leaving unpaid any HECS debts they may have incurred. DEET figures show that 26,000 permanent residents are currently studying in Australian universities. It is estimated that around half these meet the residency requirements that allow them to defer their HECS and that most of the remainder will take out citizenship by the 1996 academic year, leaving around only 2,200 liable for up-front fees. This measure creates a number of concerns. At best, the amendment can only partially prevent rorting of the system. The amendment relates only to persons who have met the citizenship requirement of two years permanent residency, making it possible for students from overseas to complete a degree as a permanent resident before becoming eligible for citizenship. So what is the point? Under this bill, overseas students from countries which permit dual citizenship-for example, Hong Kongwould have little difficulty in taking out Australian citizenship, returning to their country of origin and leaving their HECS debt unpaid. At the same time, the bill creates hardship for students from those countriesfor example, Malaysia-which do not allow dual citizenship who may need to retain the citizenship of their original country for a variety of reasons. So we are creating two classes of overseas students in Australia: those who will be able to avoid the government's proposals and those who will have to make a choice and possibly suffer deleterious effects by doing so. The minister has claimed that the amendment will save $1.8 million in this fiscal year and $3.8 million in 1997-98. It appears to me to be a particularly cumbersome method of saving what are relatively small amounts. When the potential for rorting the system still exists, it is considered that it may well be proved that even this much is unable to be matched. A report that was recently tabled by the Australian National Audit Office stated that the Department of Social Security could save $86 million by changing some of the systems that it has adopted. The government is happy to punish students and make their lives almost impossible and is happy to have legislation which is still full of loopholes and which students will be able to get around-all for a of measly $3.8 million and $1.8 million-when it would not even make those changes that would make DSS $86 million better off. The government takes students for granted. It has always done so. It relies on their support at election time, but between elections it kicks them in the guts. It is no surprise to us that it would oppose the amendments for that reason. Its policies in HECS and education have always advantaged those who can pay up-front fees. It has always advantaged the people at the top end of town. The Labor Party claims to be the party of the battler, the party of the worker, yet its policies in this area only advantage the top end of town. It does not do anything for those students who are struggling to get to university and who cannot afford to pay up-front, which I find appalling from the Labor Party which claims to represent battlers and workers. You should hang your heads in shame that you advantage the privileged and the rich in our society. The minister criticised me in his speech earlier for getting around and listening to young people's concerns. A lot of those young people were students, a lot of them complaining about HECS and Austudy and all the other things that concern students. I would put it to him that it would not be a bad idea if he popped out on a bus and travelled around Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria hearing the concerns of young people in forums. We met over 1,200 young people and travelled over 4,000 kilometres. It might be different from when I was in Queensland on my bus and Minister Crean was flying into Cairns on his VIP jet and flying out after having a stage-managed production with a few young people, who were probably members of the Labor Party in any event. The member for Moreton, the member for Forde, the member for Capricornia and the member for Leichhardt are kidding themselves if they believe the rhetoric that has been put out by the Labor Party about the youth bus of the coalition, because people were bursting at the seams at our forums. They wanted to talk to us. If you think otherwise, you are sadly mistaken. Mr Gibson-Excuse me. We watched, we saw, we were there-we saw you.  have been pleased to see you there. You might have learnt something, like I did, about what young people think. Sadly, you weren't there. The minister in his speech claimed the endorsement of the NUS organisation. I believe the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) has comprehensively rebutted that assertion by the minister in reading from a press release five days old which says that the NUS has never endorsed these proposals of the Labor Party. It must be starting to worry them slightly that the NUS, which has always so avidly and loyally supported them at election time, has not endorsed this proposal. I imagine they will be scurrying back to the NUS with some new plan to try to rewin its support. NUS usually parrots the government's line, let's face it, but in this situation even NUS, which is one of the paths to the Labor Party, is so disgusted with the role that the government have played that it has decided to come out against them. When. the NUS is coming out against you, you are really in trouble, because that would be one of the last groups that would have left you. These amendments introduce a certainty. They repair retrospectivity, which the coalition has traditionally opposed and will continue to oppose, and they return some semblance of fairness to current students. Therefore, they should be supported.",30
42,Mr DODD,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"The coalition cannot escape one fact: because it has created a $50 million hole in revenue by rejecting this legislation, which would have provided money hypothecated under sections 59 and 60 of the Higher Education Funding Act 1988, we are now not going to have the additional 7,600 places over three years for Queensland. That is it; that is the reality. That is what the coalition continues to ignore and tries to skirt around. That is what the South Australian brigade that has come into the parliament today has tried to skirt around. That is the reality and that is what it cannot escape. In my electorate of Leichhardt in Far North Queensland, the Labor Party's record includes $15 million expended to build the James Cook University campus, plus $6 million from the state Labor government. It has been built, it is operational now and it will be officially opened next month. The Labor Party has also promised, under this legislation, 600 places for James Cook over the next two years-that is, James Cook at Cairns and Townsville. That is the Labor Party's record. What is the coalition's record? Nothing at all; zero; no commitment. In fact, rejecting this legislation will take away those extra places. That means a lot to families in Far North Queensland. For years they have had to send their children to Townsville, Brisbane and even, dare I say, to Adelaide to get their tertiary education. Now, with the new James Cook campus and the additional places, school leavers are able to go to the James Cook University campus in Cairns. But this is being jeopardised by the coalition. Make no mistake about it, the additional places are not just numbers; they mean extra courses at James Cook. That means that there are more opportunities for people to get a local education in Far North Queensland and they do not have to travel down south. That is very important to the people in Cairns. I hope that the coalition spokespersons will come up to Cairns and try to sell this to the people of Cairns. I hope they do, because it is unsaleable. The people of Cairns know how important it is for Cairns families to have those additional 600 places. It is vital. The coalition is putting it in jeopardy. It is just sheer nonsense to suggest that this is legislamy tion that does not hypothecate an amount. The previous speaker, the member the Sturt  certainly does not if he does not understand that this legislation, coupled with the Higher Education Funding Act 1988, provides a hypothecated amount to go to these extra places. I think it is very significant today when you come into the chamber to look at who is here. There are people from Adelaide in here. When you look at the statistics, you find that the participation rate for South Australia in tertiary education is higher than the national average. When you look at those statistics for Queensland as a whole, you find that they are lower than the national average. This legislation will provide places over four years to get Queensland up to the national average, but that has been jeopardised by the coalition. Again, we have the National Party members representing regional seats in Queensland who have been sold out by the Liberal Party. It is very clear that members the Liberal Party, which is dominated by the Melbourne and Sydney establishments, have said that this legislation jeopardises the older universities in Melbourne and Adelaide. That is why we have had a range of Adelaide members in here defending this legislation. It is good to see so many members from Queensland in here today supporting this legislation and supporting Queensland families. Mr Les Scott-From the government side.",31
43,Mr DODD,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"From the government side. It is so important to people in Queensland that their children get an education and that they get access to a tertiary education. It is so unfair, especially in areas like the one that I represent in Far North Queensland where the participation is rate is much lower than the national average, that that has not occurred. This legislation changes that, yet we have the coalition and opposing it both in this House and in the other place. It is simply a disgrace. Members of the coalition, especially the National Party, are put very much on notice that I will be going the length and breadth of electorate of Leichhardt in Far North Queensland and telling my electors that the coalition has stopped additional places being allocated to James Cook and to other Queensland universities. That is what I will be telling them very clearly. All the obfuscation and all the contributions from the other side that we have heard today do not in any way allow them to escape from that truth. They will be stopping people in Far North Queensland from getting additional places and they will be stopping new courses starting at James Cook, which would widen the range of courses available to people in that university. That is very clear. That is why I am totally in support of the government and its position on this legislation. We have heard that various student bodies support the government. I have got their media releases. There is no doubt about it when you read them. It is just ridiculous to suggest otherwise. I can tell you that when the average student in Far North Queensland of hears about it they will certainly oppose the coalition as well.",32
44,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,I call the honourable member for Hinkler. Mr Gibson-Stand up for Queensland.,33
45,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,Order! I afforded honourable members on my right the protection of the chair and I will give the same protection to the member for Hinkler.,33
46,Mr NEVILLE,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"I thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for your indulgence and for your offer of support, but I do not need any in this debate, I can assure you, because come one, come all if anyone wants to debate me on this in the election. If anyone would like to come to Hinkler, come one, come all. I say to my opponent, the state Labor members, the member f'Or Capricornia (Ms Henzell) or anyone who would like a go-please come and join me. I have got some credentials on the board about university education, not sitting over there just parroting the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) with a political agenda in his way. No, I have actually done the hard work. I can tell you some interesting stories about the attitude of Labor members when we were trying to get the regional campuses. Does the member for Capricornia remember that? No, I don't think so.",33
47,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,Order! The honourable member shall address his remarks through the chair.,33
48,Mr NEVILLE,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"In the days when it was not very popular to try to get university campuses away from places like Armidale, Brisbane and TownsvilleMr Dodd-Under the National Party.",33
49,Mr NEVILLE,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"We will come back to that. When it was not popular to have the idea of provincial campuses, we formed committees in various parts of Queensland, and I sat on one in Bundaberg. We started working towards this university some eight or nine years ago. Neither the state nor the federal Labor members ever offered their support or ever sat on that committee at any stage. I can remember very clearly when we decided that we would press ahead with this and Mr Dawkins, who was then the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, came to town. The vision of our federal Labor member at the time was, 'We can put them in a wing of T AFE.' That was his vision of regional campuses. And it has not improved. As for the member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) asking what has the National Party ever done for education in Queensland, have you forgotten about Griffith University? Have you forgotten about the Darling Downs Institute, which is now the University of Southern Queensland? Have you forgotten about the Capricornia Institute, which is now the University of Central Queensland? Have you forgotten about James Cook University? If we had left it to you, not only would we have not had the places but we would not have had the universities to put them in. You ought to be ashamed of yourselves. To come in here with thisMr Gibson-It's your policy that starved Queensland.",33

52,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,The honourable member for Oxley will cease interjecting.,33
53,Mr NEVILLE,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,We are talking about two measures out of nine. Is your whole legislation so fragile that when the coalition amends two of your nine clauses you become upset and the whole thing falls into disarray? I am only interested in two aspects. Ms Henzell-And you are wrong. You have no policy.,33
54,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"Order! It is not even broadcast day, so there is no point in your interjections. I will not allow them. The member will be heard in silence.",33
55,Mr NEVILLE,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"I am interested in the social equity of this matter and the injustice of retrospectivity. My colleague the member  quite clearly and I will not repeat his remarks. As the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) said, this is part of a campaign to create an atmosphere of fear and loathing up and down the coast. The editor of one newspaper in my electorate did not really get on to it quite quickly enough, but we had two almost identical stories from two Labor members of the state parliament. This campaign has been orchestrated at both the federal and the state level. As the member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) said, a letter has gone out saying, 'Please put your name in here and the name of your electorate there. That is how you do it. We will try to build up as much fear, loathing and concern amongst university students as we can.' The simple fact is that after 13 years of Labor government the situation of university places-whether from this scheme or some other scheme-is parlous. We were promised 4,200 places. If we analyse where these places are going, we find that 950 have not been allocated; they are going to be kept until the 1998 allocation. We do not know where those places will go. Indeed, we do not know whether Labor will honour its promise to allocate them at all. Of the 2,500-odd places that are left, we take out those allocated for the university at Sippy Downs. We have extra places allocated for Griffith University and for the longneglected Ipswich campus of the University of Queensland. It is becoming increasingly embarrassing for the state government that the Sunshine Coast has no university. What is left for rural and provincial Queensland is not very flash. Mr Dodd-You come and tell us 10 Queensland that it is isn't very flash.",33
56,Mr NEVILLE,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,From Toowoomba to Cairns there are 900 places spread over nine campuses.,34
57,Unknown,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,Government members interjecting,34
58,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,I am reluctant to celebrate what could be my last day in the chair by naming a person. Would honourable members please allow the honourable member to be heard in silence.,34
59,Mr NEVILLE,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I must say that I am more flattered than I have been at any time since I have been here. No party could conscionably go forward and say that this was a great package for Queensland. From Toowoomba to Cairns-900 miserable places spread over nine campuses and spread over two years. Mr Dodd interjecting",34
60,Mr NEVILLE,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"My word, you should. In fact, I will provide you with the piece of paper that came from your own minister's office. For the minister to then tum around and claim in his second reading speech-on the pretext that you cannot find the funds anywhere else, that this whole thing was contingent upon the minister getting the package that he put before the parliament-that the whole of the Australian university places, certainly those in Victoria, South Australia and Queensland-are going to be put in jeopardy, I say do it. I dare you to do it. I dare you on the eve of the federal election to come out and do it. I will have a debate with any one of you on that issue-come one, come all. The minister gave me a nice little touch up because of my interpretation of the figures. I might have been a little awry in the way I presented them but, whichever way you look at it, whether you look at $11 million, $18 million or $19 million, whether you take them cumulatively or individually, I am not particularly interested. We will even take the minister's figure of $50 million. We are talking about $50 million in a budget of $4.4 billion. You guys really have some vision! To have to bring in six of you to heckle me and try to stop me speaking shows how littleMr Les Scott-You didn't even have to come in here.",34
61,Mr NEVILLE,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"Occasionally I go out and get a few notes; I like to be well informed. Let us look at these things. Let us compare this $50 million with a few of your recent outrages: $400 million on waterfront reformgee, that was a big success: you ought to read some of the reports on it-$400 million on the State Bank of South Australia; $90 million on the forestry adjustment package; $14.5 million on the superannuation ad that has money growing on trees. This is heavy stuff. But we cannot find $50 million. If we cannot find the $50 million, if we cannot penalise the 800,000 former students who will be affected, if we cannot get the money out of them the way we want to get it, we will take it out on the students who are yet to go to university. We are going to take it out on them. What we are going to say is, 'We are going to cut all your places out. We will cut those places out until we make up our $50 million.' That is an interesting concept because, in terms of pure equity, it should not be the former students of today who are paying for the university students of tomorrow. It should be the public purse. Has that point been lost on you completely or have you separated and sectionalised the Australian community to such an extent? I have just a couple of other points. When you look back over this HECS regime, you can understand the parents of Australia, students of Australia and the young people who have finished university being a little cynical. When you came to power in 1983 you were the 'no fees' party. You said there would be no fees. Then in 1988 you became the 'no up-front fees party'. Then you decided that you might start charging for some graduates, so you then became the 'no up-front fees for undergraduates party'. Now you are becoming the 'no up-front fees for undergraduates party, but we are going to speed it up a bit, boys'. Isn't that lovely? Mr Dodd-What's your policy?",34
62,Mr NEVILLE,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,Can you go back into the rainforest with the parrots? I am sure they will look after you well.,35
63,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"The honourable member for Leichhardt will cease interjecting, and I would suggest to the honourable member speaking that he not reply to interjections which tend to inflame members opposite.",35
64,Mr NEVILLE,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. No doubt they are inflamed, but I do not think it is by my rhetoric. I think they inflamed because they have been caught out on this one. They wanted to make this a forerunner for the federal election campaign and this is a lame horse. This is one that will not get out of the stalls. As I said to you before, come one, come all. There has been a little bit of talk today about the youth bus that went up the New South Wales and Queensland coast. I do not particularly know what happened in the various towns; I can only talk about the experience in my town. Surprisingly, 30 or 40 of the welfare agencies of Bundaberg and a good number of students turned up to that meeting. It was a very mature meeting and some very interesting things were said. Ms Henzell-And how old were they?",35
65,Mr NEVILLE,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"This may not interest the member for Capricornia, but it interested these very focused young students and the welfare agencies that were concerned about them. They were interested in the lack of youth accommodation in Bundaberg and the Central Queensland area; the increasing incidence of sexual abuse among teenagers; the lack of counselling and resources for rural youth; the lack of part-time employment in provincial areas for casual and part-time students; the level of Austudy payments, including the need for greater assistance in accommodation-the member for Capricornia has heard about that one through Central Queensland-and the overall level of youth unemployment in Bundaberg and in Central Queensland which, as the honourable member for Capricornia knows, is an outrage. Forty per cent of the young people over 18 years of age cannot get a job in that area. Ms Henzell-What's your policy in response to that? What's your policy to help those young people?",35
66,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,The honourable member is not helping the chair.,35
67,Mr NEVILLE,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"I will come to that. I like challenges, Mr Deputy Speaker. I never duck an argument. There has also been the axing of the JPET program-another scandal in Central Queensland. Where was the member are for Capricomia when that was axed in Rockhampton and Bundaberg? I got out on the front foot on that because those defenceless young kids were left on the streets without an iota of support. It would have been the same in Rockhampton too had it not been for your own community having the guts to stand up to your government. You should be ashamed of yourself that young people, including university students, suffer. Come one, come all on this. I dare you to do it; I dare you to cut out places in the provincial universities of Queensland, or, for that matter, anywhere else. Go to the election with that, and just see what price you pay.",35
68,Mr SWAN,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"I rise to reject the opposition's amendments to the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No.2). I will go through a bit of history to point out the monumental hypocrisy that comes from those opposite. Last year, the voices of ordinary Queenslanders demanded that the federal government give justice to tertiary students and young people in Queensland. For a generation injustice has been perpetrated in Queensland. For over 20 years the chances of young Queenslanders getting into tertiary education have been significantly less than they have been in any other part of the country. The perpetrator of that injustice was the former Premier of Queensland, Sir Johannes BjelkePetersen. He was the perpetrator of that injustice and it has taken this government some time to rectify that injustice. When we finally bring in a package that gives justice to tertiary students in Queensland, what do we find? We find that the Liberal and National parties in this House and in the Senate will not stand up for Queensland. They are prepared to play petty politics with the lives of 4,200 young Queenslanders and deny them their rightful place in tertiary education. It is an undeniable fact that this discrimination has taken place. It is an undeniable fact that the government has brought into this House bills that can rectify that injustice. So where are the Liberal and National parties when it really counts? The position that they have in this House is that they stand for what they think people will fall for. But people will not fall for this ploy, this petty politicking, on this very important issue. If another Bjelke-Petersen in this House is going to be so important to the future of politics, let us see him-let us see the BjelkePetersens of this world and the National Party members in this House-stand up to the Liberal Party on this issue. Stand up for Queensland. No, you are not game to do that because once again you have been swamped in the coalition. The position that dominates here is the position of Adelaide and Melbourne against the interests of Queensland, western Sydney and Western Australia. That is what has occurred on the coalition side. It is the Adelaide Club and the Melbourne Club that dominate. It is the likes of the member for Mayo (Mr Downer)-who, by the way, has a nickname. He is called Archaeologist. Why do they call him Archaeologist? Because his career lies in ruins. He is the architect of this. He and a number of the members from Victoria have no concept of where people live in this country or of the consequence of the shift of power north and west. That is what has occurred in the coalition. We have a position driven by the Adelaide and Melbourne establishment at the expense of western Sydney, Queensland, north Queensland and Perth. It is as simple and as brutal as that. It is a foretaste of what the people of Australia could expect if we were unfortunate enough to have a Liberal dominated government with an acquiescent National Party. Here we are seeing the internal dynamics of the conservative parties of Australia. The sorts of politics that they get in Melbourne and Victoria via Jeff Kennett are now being played out in the coalition in this House. The National Party is absolutely impotent. No wonder there are rumblings in the National Party about the quality of leadership and no wonder the press gallery is abuzz and agog with talk that the position of the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) is under threat. Here is one small example of what Australia and Queensland could expect under a Liberal-National party coalition government. Mr Lindsay-What did Ian Sinclair say?",36
69,Mr SWAN,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"We all know what Ian Sinclair said. The situation in this policy, as it is in so many other policies, is as I said at the outset that you in the Liberal Party stand for what you think people will fall for. So you hedge on industrial relations and spending cuts. You have been trying to fudge this issue, but you cannot. You have knocked off the places; they can't be funded. You have knocked off $50 million worth of funding-and you cannot go to young Queenslanders and claim that you are not responsible, that this is some petty game from the government. We have put it into legislation. You have put your marker down and you will wear this as an act of shame every day through to the federal election. We will enjoy campaigning in Hinkler and in LeichhardtMr Neville-Come one, come all.",36
70,Mr SWAN,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"We will be coming and so will the young people of Queensland because their parents, their relatives, their teachersfees. everyone who is influenced by this decisionrealise just how important it is. When we took the decision, when members from Queensland in particular formed the fair share task force last year, when we had the resolve and determination to give Queensland a fair share, when we went out, lobbied the minister, changed the decision in the caucus and got the money allocated, we thought we had won the battle for Queenslanders. We listened to the voices of ordinary Queenslanders. We took their message to Canberra. We achieved a policy change only to see it taken away at the last minute by gutless, petty politics from the Liberal and National parties which are too pathetic to stand up to the Melbourne-Adelaide dominance of the coalition. You will wear this decision because there is only one party in this House that stands for a fair share for Queensland and for youth, only one party that supports labour market programs and an expansion of tertiary education and vocational education: the Labor Party. Shame on you all.",37
71,Mr TUCKEY,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"I just thought I should get up to defend the truth. It was Hitler's Goebbels who once said that, if you told a lie often enough, it would eventually become the truth. The simple fact of life is that we are debating a piece of legislation, the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No.2), which has one and only one purpose: to accelerate the rate of payment of existing HECS students. There is nothing in that legislation that specifically grants university places to anybody. I challenge you to show me in the legislation where it directs funding to be taken from students for that purpose. In fact, the legislation is about imposing a form of taxation on some 800,000 students, I believe, of whom no doubt 100,000-plus come from Queensland. I would be very interested to publish the words of all these Labor members who are crying crocodile tears in here about imposing a tax on 800,000 students, about breaking a solemn contract. Each and every Labor member has at some time done a deal with the government about paying up-front fees or not paying up-front These students will be taxed over time to a given schedule. They will have to repay the fees that you have placed upon them. Of course you have said over the years that you would never do that. The reality is that if and when you get that revenue you may not choose to spend it on creating university places. They are the facts. You will put the money you take off HECS students into consolidated revenue. I do not remember a time in the history of the parliament when money was raised for a specific purpose of this nature. It is raised as a tax. You can make promises about spending it, but the simple fact is that you have not included it in this legislation. The reality, of course, is that Premier Goss was running around with those statements. When I was in Queensland last week, I rang the ABC. He went to ground. He did not come back and take it. Mr Swan-He went away from you, did he?",37
72,Mr TUCKEY,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"He did not want to say any more. But you had him linked into the Goebbels principle. The member for Lilley does not like the facts to get in the way of a good argument; he never has. He lowered himself to the point of changing an application form for certificates of appreciation to our veterans to put some grotty little political remarks on the back. Exploiting the veterans of Australia is about as low as you can get. Mr Swan- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order.",37
73,Mr TUCKEY,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"It had better be a proper one. Mr Swan-The speaker is not being relevant to the bill. Is it little wonder that they call him 'Drip', because you can never turn him off.",38
74,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,There is no point of order. I find it most unbecoming that such terminology is used in this House. I have allowed a high degree of latitude during this debate. That generosity on my part has ceased. The House will conduct itself in a proper manner. The honourable member for O'Connor.,38
75,Mr TUCKEY,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. If the member for Lilley would like to drop around to my office and repeat the remark, I will accommodate him.",38
76,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,The member for O'Connor should not be provocative.,38

86,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,There is no betting allowed in this House.,38
87,Mr TUCKEY,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"The reality of the issue is simple. All these Queenslanders are arguing that the coalition is attempting to prevent additional places being created. Create legislation that has proposals for making additional university places and see how you go. I have watched people giggle themselves out of an embarrassment like this time and again. I have been around a long time. The simple fact is that the government is about taxing students. It somehow wants to turn that into an argument that the only issue involved here is the creation of more university places. That is not the case, and it will not be the case. Nothing we are dealing with today will change that situation. You can do it at any time. I think I heard a previous speaker mention that the cost might be $50 million. You spent $12 million on an advertising campaign. You are not necessarily short of money when it comes to looking after a few students. You do not have to tax another group of students to get the money. Just pay a bit of attention to some of the more outrageous aspects of your own activities. You spent $12 million on advertising that involved pushing a party political line. You have let education expenditure fall dramatically behind other levels of expenditure. We have watched your health outlays double your education outlays when 10 years ago they were roughly equal. There is the measure. Check the budget papers. That is how far you have let education slip in relative terms. You can quote the numbers but they are all there in your own budget. The trouble with most of you is that you have never read your budget and you would not know what is in it. Just go to budget outlays by function from the beginning of 1980 to today and see how education outlays stand up against some other significant outlays. They have gone down by about 50 per cent. That is what you have done. You have been running around throwing money where you thought it might win you a few votes and you have left the students behind. They know it and they are fed up with you. You have imposed charges on them, and even with that revenue you have not managed to keep education funding relevant to other areas of outlays such as health, et cetera. That is a simple fact. There is no need because those kids do deserve it. They are the ones who will pay off your $100,000-million debt. It is a pretty simple issue. We have the amendments here that have come down from the other house. Where is it said that we are cutting out 4,000 places in Queensland or that we, through the Senate's amendments, are reducing student places anywhere? There is no reference whatsoever. It is just the Goebbels principle: if you repeat something often enough you could even get the Premier of Queensland running the same line. I do not think he is doing it any more. I think he has some modicum of integrity. Notwithstanding that, I see the Financial Review reported yesterday that the students are leaving the state of Queensland now under Goss as quickly as they are moving into it. They are the simple facts. I do not think this House and its members should be subject to Goebbelistic techniques. We should be looking clearly at these amendments, which do not in any way refer to the reduction of student numbers or, for that matter, to the increase in student numbers. It has nothing to do with it. It is simply about making sure that you do not break a contract with 800,000 students here in Australia.",38
88,Mr LINDSAY,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"Herbert-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology) (2.42 p.m.)-The opposition amendments have cut back $50 million from what should have been allocated for more student places. Some 5,000 student places have been sacrificed on the altar of expediency by the coalition, and over 400 such places were from James Cook University. In today's Townsville Bulletin, the Queensland Teachers Union President, Ian Mackee, said: Coalition senators were effectively holding sands of Queensland students to ransom by refusing to support the government's plan. The article went on to say: Mr Mackee said Queensland had fought for years for a more equitable distribution of university places. The newspaper went on to quote him: What we are seeing is petty party politics getting in the way of the future of Queenslanders who have every right to be able to go to university. There has been a consistent plea over a number of years that university places in North Queensland are below the national participation rate. We have tried very hard over a long period to increase the number of students at Queensland universities. With no disrespect to my colleagues from Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia, we say that Queensland has been disadvantaged when compared with the participation rates in other states. Unless this bill is passed by the Senate, Queensland will be the loser despite the valiant efforts of virtually most Queensland members on both sides of the House to improve this situation. The coalition has betrayed Queensland and its own representatives on this very important issue, as Mr Mackee says, for party political purposes. Queensland ALP members have for a long time lobbied for increased university places in Queensland. Indeed, over a long period we have had a committee formed to lobby the minister and to lobby the universities to increase the number of places we have at Queensland universities. But let us look at the legislation itself. As the minister himself claimed on radio 4TO in Townsville this morning, there is not one Australian student disadvantaged by our proposal, there are no increases in the HECS charges and the students themselves are not arguing that these should be held if it is going to cost places. He went on to say that a foreign student can actually come here, go back home without earning any income in this place and not have to repay their HECS. All the HECS moneys go back to university places. Why should non-Australian citizens be able to avoid payment of HECS when Australian thou- students cannot? That is the question. If this pernicious action on the part of the coalition is to be proceeded with, it means that the government will have to take it off infrastructure money, from other places in other states. This is an issue that goes beyond what is happening right around this country on this very important issue. (Quorum formed) The whole of the academic community and the whole of the student community, the National Union of Students, has received with acclamation this package of legislation put forward by the government. We have a situation where we have a spoiling opposition that is trying to score a political point. It is well summed up in an article in the Sydney Morning Herald of the last week of September: When the Green senators, the Democrats and the Federal Opposition stand together, the public can expect an attack on the responsible use of taxpayers' funds. It went on further to say: The Federal Opposition is (cynically?) wooing the student unions with its stance on this matter. This opportunism means that it dismisses the real issue-which is the equitable and responsible distribution of funds for tertiary education. Requiring Australian citizens to pay a slightly higher level of repayment in the initial year of their Hollis, C. HECS repayments is hardly unfair. The repayments are not being increased and the amount required goes nowhere near meeting the actual costs of a university education. The second leg of the proposed HECS changes is not unfair, either. There is a rort going on which it is intended to stop. Non-citizen residents have been able to get their university education in Australia and then leave the country without making any direct contribution to the cost of that education by way of a HECS fee. The change, which gives these residents the option of taking up citizenship by the end of their third year or paying their HECS fees up-front, should help to reduce this abuse. There is no better summary than what is contained in that Sydney Morning Herald article. The fact of the matter is that spokespersons from the opposition have got it dead wrong. Either they have been given the wrong information or they have been deceitfully peddling false information in the electorates. They will do and say anything for political advantage, and you cannot trust them. Question put: That the amendments be disagreed to. The House divided. (Mr SPEAKER - Hon.

89,Mr CREAN,NOES,"On behalf of the committee appointed to draw up reasons for the House disagreeing to the amendments of the Senate, I present the reasons, which have been circulated to honourable members. The reasons read as followsThe House of Representatives does not agree to amendments Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the Senate for the following reasons: the amendments deny the government's higher education Budget package of $50 million over three years, $11.7 million in 1996, $18.7 million in 1997; and $19.4 million in 1998; the budget package sought to meet the two key priorities of the higher education sectoradditional places for those Australians who had not previously had the opportunity to attend university and the provision of much needed funds for research infrastructure and research programs; the loss of $50 million to the budget package means the loss of 5,000 university places for Australian students or cuts to funds allocated research infrastructure; the Budget neutral package was developed after extensive consultation with and in response to NOES the identified needs of the higher education sector, the Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee, the National Tertiary Education Union, the Council of Australian Postgraduate Associations and the National Union of Students; and the Senate amendments would establish arbitrary and inequitable distinctions between individuals who have a Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS) debt and would cost the commonwealth up to an additional $2 million initially and $1 million thereafter to administer.

91,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. Yesterday you rejected a challenge to rule out introducing new taxes or raising existing taxes, claiming such a commitment to the Australian people would be 'economic and fiscal stupidity'. Your representative in the Senate, Senator Cook, last Tuesday gave the Senate just such a commitment when he said: I have made it quite clear what the government's position is. We do not intend to introduce new taxes in the forthcoming election, and in winning government subsequent to that. Is Senator Cook economically and fiscally stupid, or is it the case that you have not yet let him into your secret tax plan?",41
92,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The position of the government on this issue is quite plain,41
93,Mr REID,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: private meetings are being held in the chamber at the moment. Courtesy should be given to the chair.",41
94,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Members know the standing orders. Resume your seats when you come into the chamber. The Treasurer has the call.,41
95,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I was saying, the position of the government is quite clear on this for matter. The Prime Minister talked about this yesterday, and the answer that he gave there is certainly pertinent to the question asked again today. The government has made it clear by its record what its position on taxation is: that is, we have not increased the level of taxation as a proportion of GOP in the period that we have been in office. The level today is about the same as it was back in 1982-83. Bear in mind that the ratio of tax to GOP varies according to the state of the economy. With exactly the same tax regime, you will get a different percentage to GOP depending on whether you have a growth economy or an economy going through the floor. In 1982-83 we had an economy going through the floor; we had a recession economy. The tax to GOP ratio was 24.0 per cent. In 1995-96 the estimated figure with an economy that is growing quite wellwe will see figures tomorrow which I expect will bear that out-is 24.2 per cent. So in a growth economy we have virtually the same percentage of tax to GOP as we had back in 1982-83 with a recession economy . You can see, therefore, that this government has not increased the tax burden. Quite obviously, if we had a recession at the moment the tax take would be less; company profits would be less, so company profit receipts would be less; there would be fewer people in employment, so PAYE tax receipts would be fewer; and sales would be fewer, so sales tax would be less, et cetera. But we do not have a recession economy, We have an economy that is growing well. Therefore, it is quite clear from those numbers that there has been no increase in the tax burden.",41
96,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Mitchell will resume his seat.,42
97,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Nor does the government have any intention of increasing that general percentage. We have shown after 12 years in government what our position on tax is. We are obviously not a high taxing government. We are the second lowest taxed country in the OECD. How could it possibly be said that this is a high taxing government? We have had no increase on the percentage from a recession year back in 1982-83. If anything, clearly the tax burden is less now than it was when we came into office. It is just a nonsense for the opposition to try to run a line about there being some tax agenda by this government. There is no secret tax agenda. We have, however, said that we do not want to commit ourselves to saying that there will be no change to any tax, because that is just tying yourself up with complete inflexibility. It is an absurdity for a government to say that in terms of one half of its policy arm it will never make any changes at all to that side; it will only look at the other side. That is what the opposition are saying. But at the same time as they are saying that, we find that not everyone on that side thinks that way. In fact, some people on the front bench of the opposition are sitting there cogitating, and cogitating publicly, about some tax increases. For instance, the Deputy Leader of the National Party was quoted in an article in the Stock Journal of 19 October this year. I must say that is not part of my normal reading, but it certainly makes very interesting reading. It is an article about an interview with Mr Anderson and various quotes from him. It says: While not yet committing his party to the idea, Anderson is leaning towards the suggestion of CSIRO's Dr Wayne Mayer, who earlier this year called for a national levy on domestic food sales to provide funds for helping sustain agriculture. Dr Mayer, who is assistant chief of the CSIRO's Division of Water Resources ... proposed a levy of 0.5 per cent, which on annual sales of $40 billion would raise $200 million to help fund land and water programs. What we have in the mind of the Deputy Leader of the National Party, as told to the Stock Journal, is that he is sitting around there actively thinking about taxing food. When they took Fightback to the last election, at least they had the decency at the end to suggest that they would not put the GST on food. But now the Deputy Leader of the National Party is saying that is part of his thinking, and that is where he is inclined to go. How many other people are sitting there with ideas about where they are inclined to go on additional taxes? Whilst the tax spokesmen say, 'Oh, there'll be no new taxes and no increases in any tax,' they are actively saying to the press, 'Ah, we are thinking of introducing a tax on food.' If there are any secret tax secret agendas around here, we know where they are. They are not on this side. Expenditure",42
98,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Treasurer. Has the Treasurer seen reports of a range of commitments to increase government spending and provide relief from taxes? Are these commitments consistent with making significant public savings?,43
99,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Lilley for his question. It is a very good question. I have seen lots of specific commitments for increased spending coming from the opposition. They certainly are not consistent with making significant public savings. I have seen all those in a document which came to us the other day entitled 'Speakers notes: Liberal'. This is the document. This document has some 51 pages of one-page summaries of positions of the Liberal Party on all sorts of subjects. For each one it has a background, a supposed summation of Labor's track record, the coalition alternative and then some key attack points. From this document we can find lots of interesting things. Time prevents me from going through all of them, but let me venture a couple of key points. One particularly important point that I noticed related to industrial relations policy. This comes under the heading 'Regional development' and it says: The coalition alternative is we will remove impediments like inflexible labour conditions and awards to growth in the regions. So much for this softly, softly industrial relations policy where we will not be doing anything to take away the award structure, people will be able to decide whether they are in awards or not in awards. Here they are specifically saying that the coalition alternative is to take away impediments to growth in the regions like inflexible labour conditions and awards. That is one exceedingly interesting point. That is pretty important in itself but more important, perhaps, in the overall economic sense is the fact that this document has some 44 specific expenditure or tax cut proposals. Some of them are particularly substantial. There is the one that we knew about before, about the fixed share of revenue for the states which costs $2.8 billion. I might say that there are no costings on any of these promises in the document, but that is what the continuance of the fixed share would cost. There is the promise to provide a tax concession for savings. That was costed in Fightback at the last election at $500 million. The promise to make private health insurance more attractive was also a Fightback promise at $850 million in the first year. Apart from these 44 promises of expenditure increases and tax cuts, there are also some implicit promises. Let me just give one fairly substantial example of that in relation to defence. Under defence it says: Labor's track record Labor has reduced defence spending as a proportion of GDP from 2.6 per cent in 1982-83 to 2.1 per cent. Under key attack points-this is obviously something we are really to be hammered onit says: If Labor had met its target of funding defence at 2.6 per cent of GDP, the defence would be much better off. What it is implying there is that we have been guilty of heinous behaviour in cutting defence. It follows therefore-presumably, if they are going to attack us on that-that it is their policy to increase defence expenditure and to increase it back to 2.6 per cent of GDP. Mr Downer-Oh, stupid!",43
100,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Why attack us on it if you are not going to do it when you get into government? Mr Downer-Because you said you would do it.,43
101,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Mayo.,43
102,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If they want to attack us for not maintaining their percentage of GDP for defence expenditure, presumably that is their policy. To go back to 2.6 per cent of GDP would cost another $2.6 billion per annum. That is on top of the 44 specific promises. What we see here in this document is the real exposure of the shabbiness of this opposition-the absolute shabby performance in which you go around talking about the need for making savings. Do you remember the headland speech when the Leader of the Opposition said, 'No.1 issue on fiscal policy, we will make significant public savings'? they never talk about any such savings. All they ever talk about is the opposite, that increasing expenditure and cutting taxes which, of course, blows the budget out. If they are going to make substantial public savings, they would have to cover all of those before you made any net savings. Obviously, they are in for billions and billions of dollars of expenditure increases and tax cuts. make the significant public savings would require horrendous cuts in public expenditure. Let us look at what this opposition are actually doing at the present time. At the same time as they are saying, 'We need to having more severe corrective measures on aryfiscal policy and making significant public savings,' they are out there every day attackLeader ing our budget in the Senate and lopping question. pieces off it. Just in the last few days, we have seen them change the FBT bill for the cost of compliance at a cost of an additional $40 million over the forward estimates period; block the airports sales program $2 billion; change the HECS saving measure at a cost of $60 million; and last nightyou, isn't it? admittedly, a very small one-change the aviation fuel policy at a cost What we will doubtless see through the course of this week are other steps in this direction. We have an opposition saying, 'We need make significant public savings and policy should be tighter,' but what we see from them is the exact opposite. We see from them promises to make all these additional expendinot tures and to cut taxes. We have seen them take action in the Senate to reduce the tightticularly ness of the budget and to reduce the budget surplus. This is an opposition that either has government? no idea what it is doing or it is deliberately going to go about at the next election with a secret plan of horrendous expenditure cuts. If you want to see what the opposition would be like, I guess the best thing we do-if they won't tell us about them-is go back to Fightback because that is when they had the guts to spell out their expenditure cuts. If you are going to cover all these promises and make significant public that is the kind of expenditure cut program But that would have to be put into place. What this document does is expose this opposition's is, duplicitous behaviour in trying to pretend to the Australian people that all is sweetness and light and that they would not do anything nasty. They are saying, 'We will do lots of nice things. We will make significant public savings. But it will be just in running costs, so you don't have to worry about it.' But the To reality is totally and starkly different. Taxation",43

The percentage of tax to GOP now in a growth economy is almost exactly the sa-e as it was in a recession economy back tn 1982-83 when the now Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer of this country. So don't talk to us about high taxing activities. Mr Costello-Tell us about '93.",45
113,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition!,45
114,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is not a high tax government. The tax level, adjus-ed for the level of activity in the economy, IS less it was under the previous government when the now Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer. We can go back to 1992-93. Remember we were just getting out of the recession. It was certainly not a growth economy. We were looking at a post-recession level of activity in the economy. Since then we have had substantial growth in the economy. We have had growth of 15 per cent in the economy over the last four years. We have a growth economy this year as compared with an economy just coming out of a recession at that time. The economic conditions are totally different. It is absurd to go back and look at a level at a time of recession, be it 1982-83 or 1992-93. Of course, 1982-83 was worse. It was the worse recession in 60 years. It was the worse recession we have had since the 1930s. The recession in the early 1980s was the worse recession ever both in terms of depth and length. It is absurd to go back to those times and make an exact comparison with the levels now. The fact is that you have to have regard to the level of economic activity. By any standards this is not a high taxing government. The levels of tax are not high by any standards-the standards of the past or the standards of the Leader of the Opposition. It is less than the standard of the Leader of the Opposition if you adjust the level The level of tax is not high in companson with the standards of other Western developed countries because we are the second lowest taxed country in the OECD. It is absurd to suggest that this is a high taxing government, or that it would become one. Wheat",45
115,Mr SIMMONS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Assistant Treasurer. Can the minister inform the House whether Australia's wheat marketing arrangements will be subject to scrutiny as a result of the Prime --nister - nd the premiers signing the competItIOn polIcy agreement at COAG in April of this year? Is the minister aware of proposals that may not meet the obligations of this agreement?,45
116,Mr GEAR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Calare for his question. Indeed, it is true that the signing of the competition principles ag-ee­ than ment requires all governments to reVIew legislation that restricts competition to ensure that it serves the public interest. The Australian Wheat Board's single desk export selling arrangements clearly fall into this category and the wheat industry fully understands that. I pointed out to the House last week that the Leader of the National Party really does not have a clue about this very fundamental point, even though he says it is a key issue for his party. Last Tuesday, the Leader of the National Party said this: The Australian Wheat Board's retention of single desk export powers was funda-ental to en.suring stability and confidence for Investment In the industry as it restructures for the 21 st century. That was his view last Tuesday. What the Leader of the National Party is saying when he says that is that he does not want this arrangement reviewed; he wants those powers to exist forever. You might recall that he talked about wanting to ringbark the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, even though it had no role in this whatsoever. Mr Tim Fischer-Read it in full.",45
117,Mr GEAR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is what you said in your press release. However, on the very same day as the Leader of the National Party was saying this, the Leader of the Opposition was of acti-ity. saying down at the NFF",45
118,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What did Gary Gray say to the NFF?,45
119,Mr GEAR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You got this one right. I thought you would be happy with this one. You said: In relation to the wheat industry, I specifically reaffirm coalition policy to retain the single desk export powers of the Australian Wheat Board while they continue to serve the best interests of both growers and the broad Australian community.",45
120,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That is it-lO out of lO.,46
121,Mr GEAR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is right. In actual fact it is another 'me too' policy. He is following the government. Whoever wrote your speech to the NFF must have been reading government speeches because you are dead right. But that is not what the Leader of the National Party said. You were saying that you were talking of coalition policy, but the Leader of the National Party said something completely different. If that is not confusing enough, the Deputy Leader of the National Party, who is the spokesman on primary industries and who should know what the coalition's policy is, has another three positions. Mr Anderson's starting position on this was to retain the single desk for 10 years. When he was questioned on this it fell to five years, and later on he said he thought it might be all right as long as Treasury and the department of primary industries said it was all right. We are back to the good old days of the public servants running the country. There were three different positions from the deputy leader, a different position from the Leader of the National Party and the correct position from the Leader of the Opposition. So there have been five different positions on this one very fundamental point about the Australian Wheat Board-obviously one for the city and four for the bush. This is yet another example of where there is a serious split between the National Party and the Liberal Party on a very fundamental reform. I pointed out to the House last week that they could not agree, that Senator Boswell was running around with this MCEwen view of the world and, when the Leader of the Opposition had a chance on the Sunday program to stamp his authority on micro-economic reform, he wimped it. He gave one of those long, rambling answers that has become part of his stock in trade. But the one thing he did not do was say that he dismissed all of those views from the National Party, whether they are from the member for Maranoa, who is trying to scare local councils in Queensland, from Senator Boswell, who wants to stop the clock in the 1950s, or from the Leader of the National Party, who takes a very fundamental difference in view on the Australian Wheat Board than he does. He did not stamp his authority and therefore you can see what would happen in government. Let me just reiterate that on national competition policy, on microeconomic reform, there is only one party that will deliver the goods and that is the Labor Party. Ministerial Standards",46
122,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister. Are the standards of this government about being expelled for saying what you think but being retained for lying about what you have done?,46
123,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I invite the honourable member for Flinders to rephrase the last part of his question. I suggest 'untruthful' might be helpful.,46
124,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Are the standards of this government about being expelled for saying what you think but being retained for failing to tell the truth about what you have done?,46
125,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The two best supporters from Western Australia of the Leader of the Opposition are sitting up there. That is where they are sitting; they are Independents. The two best supporters of the Leader of the Opposition are sitting up there. That is the first point I make about that. We have now just had circulated around the parliament and presented by the Treasurer a document which suggests that on every single area of policy as far as you are concerned you want to prevaricate. Then we have the Leader of the Opposition slip-sliding around the issues. His version of the truth is to slip-slide around and, when it is revealed that he has made an absolutely terrible performance in which he has misled the public on what the direction of Liberal Party policy is, he rings up and says, 'I was at my 18-year-old's birthday party and I could not be expected to perform better.' He let the Financial Review know that. With that sort of background to those smart alec questions, you can get the same sort of answer. Superannuation",46
126,Ms HENZELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Treasurer. Has he seen reports concerning the application of the government's arrangements for superannuation? intention of the government to amend those arrangements as a result of these reports?,47
127,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have seen some suggeschat tions about superannuation policy from the document that I referred to previously in question time. I must say that the claims made in that document-some of them at Given least-are certainly extraordinary. Under heading of 'Retirement'Mr Abbott-I raise a point of order, Mr orders is. Speaker. Under standing order 142, questions need to be about government policy. Either the question was out of order or the answer is irrelevant. You cannot have it both ways. I refer you again to the ruling of that great has the call. and honourable Labor Speaker Jim Cope who said that it was not in order for ministers to talk about other people's policies. I ask that you rule that way.",47
128,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am sure that Jim will be very pleased to hear your comments about him. But the question that was asked of the Treasurer is entirely relevant, and so is the Treasurer. There is no point of order.",47
129,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The issue involves the union misrepresentation of the government's polibut cies. In this document, talking about superanindependent nuation, under the heading of 'Retirement' and under 'key attack points' it says: The real beneficiaries of Labor's new proposals are the unions. Union coffers will receive a generous proportion of going the tenfold increase in superannuation savings. That is an outright lie.",47
130,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! No, no. The for Treasurer will withdraw that and substitute appropriate language.",47
131,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is absolutely and completely incorrect, and the opposition must have known it was so. Mr Ruddock-Put 'Carmen' in.",47
132,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,No. We are not going down there either. I have had a chat with the President of the Senate. The Treasurer has the call. Mr MCGauran-A Carmen.,47
133,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Those on my left! Is it the The Treasurer has the call. Mr Reith-I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. You have said that you have had a with the President about standing orders coming and their application.",47
134,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I didn't say that. Mr Reith-You just said it, Mr Speaker. that you just said it, you might like to the inform other members of the House exactly what your interpretation of those standing",47
135,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You have been subjected to one of them, as has the Treasurer just now, in withdrawing unparliamentary language. That is how I will interpret it. The Treasurer",47
136,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I was saying, this must have been known to have been incorrect because it is just such a fundamental issue in terms of the superannuation industry in this country. What we have are industry funds, which are a growing proportion of the industry. But these industry funds are not union funds. They have on their boards of trustees equal representation of employees-usually representatives; by no means always, often they are-and employers, and an chairperson. So there are no union dominated funds. They are funds which have equal representation of employers and employees. Of course, there is no money-not a centinto union coffers. The money is going into industry funds which have 50 per cent representation each of both parties and the money is invested on behalf of the members the benefit of the members. It does not go into union coffers. That was an outrageous statement made in this Liberal Party speakers notes document which reads: The real beneficiaries of Labor's new proposals are the unions. Union coffers will receive a generous proportion of the expected tenfold increase in superannuation savings. As though it is all being funnelled into union bank accounts! That is completely and utterly outrageous. All the decisions of a board of trustees to be made by a two-thirds majority, so it is not a matter of getting the chairperson on side and overriding the other group. There has to be a two-thirds majority. So these funds operate on a consensus basis. Of course, they have representation by employers and it has not been a problem to get employers on them. Many employer groups, like the Chamber of Manufactures of New South Wales, the Employers Federation of New South Wales, the MTIA and other industry organisations, are represented on these industry fund boards of trustees. It is just an absurd and outrageous statement to suggest otherwise. It also says in this document that employees who are not covered by awards and the self-funded retirees receive no benefit from the budget's superannuation proposals. It is not true to say that employees who are not covered by awards do not benefit from the arrangements that I announced on budget night because the co-contribution does apply to non-award employees. If they are making contributions, they attract the co-contribution from the government, whether or not they are under awards. That is fundamental. It has been spelt out from the start. It is in the documents that we published at budget time. To suggest otherwise is just outrageous misrepresentation. In both these respects we see the opposition putting forward lines for their members and candidates to put around the country which are completely and utterly wrong-total misrepresentation of the government's policy. They must know it to be so. They cannot be so stupid-maybe they can, on second thoughts, but I suspect that they are not that stupid and that it is a deliberate misrepresentation. What we are seeing on superannuation is an opposition which are realising that there are some political pluses in superannuation. On the superannuation guarantee, which they opposed vehemently, they now profess support. Let me just remind the House what they said about it when it was being introduced. The Leader of the Opposition said that introducing this super guarantee which requires employers to make contributions for employhave ees would be nothing short of parliamentary confiscation of the assets of employers. The shadow finance minister said that the superannuation levy is nothing but a new tax on employment. Senator Alston, who was the shadow minister for superannuation-I think he is now the shadow minister for communications-said this was vicious anti-jobs legislation. The member for Flinders said that this scheme has as its twin pillars of justification the facts that it will save the government money on the budget and it will increase national savings. Neither of these arguments holds any water. He also said that the super levy is a tax on employment and that it should never be implemented. Senator Alston also said it is an ill-considered and untimely job destroyer. Mr Speaker, you can see that the whole thrust from the opposition was complete and utter opposition to the super guarantee charge. But now, being a poll driven opposition, they have seized upon it and have said, 'Hang on, this thing is reasonably popular so we had better get behind it because we do not want to be seen as opposing anything that is popular.' Despite all the vehement and vicious opposition, we find that they now support the super guarantee charge. They are an opposition without any principle or any real belief. They are just an opposition prepared to be totally poll driven, to get behind any position they think might be popular and, as we have seen with respect to expenditure cuts, not having the guts to propose any real expenditure cuts although their whole position requires massive cuts in that area. Minister for Human Services and Health",47
137,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. Does he agree that a number of Labor members of parliament, known as the Burke squad, have conspired to undermine the Minister for Human Services and Health?

I am not going to go into an analysis of the motives of anybody who appeared before that commission. I am instead going to say that none of them should have been there. The simple fact of the matter is that the only reason why they were there was that",49
142,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,49
143,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I remind you again of standing order 55.,49
144,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It was an utterly unprincipled act in which you and a former deputy leader of the Liberal Party connived to overthrow every tradition which you previously in government upheld. You were a member of the Fraser government which turned down exactly the same invitation that was presented to it by Attorney-General Ellicott with regard to the Sankey conspiracy activities that were being pursued against the previous Labor Prime Minister. When there was an issue as to whether there ought to be access to the documents of previous governments, you were a member of that government that turned it down on principle. The principle was that the documents, particularly the cabinet concerns of previous governments, were not to be subject to inspection by their successors. That principle was front and centre overthrown by the creation of this royal commission. Compounding that error, this royal commission then had presented to it a set of terms of reference which the royal commissioner himself described as inadequate. The royal commissioner then decided that, as far as he was concerned, it would be impossible for him to arrive at firm conclusions because, given the political nature of the creation of that royal commission, any reasonable person could leave them open to challenge. That was the attitude of the commissioner then. The commissioner has subsequently, despite all those doubts, come to a set of conclusions based on propositions that nobody reasonably seeing what was presented could conceivably have come to a conclusion about in the emphatic way that he did. It was a politically tainted royal commission. It was a royal commission that attacked the very basis of cabinet confidentiality and the responsibility of individual members of parliament to their constituents and the presentation of petitions. Its findings were utterly ignorant in those areas. Nevertheless, they no doubt conformed to the intentions of the grubby little conspiracy that was the motivation for its initial creation. You have been personally responsible for it. You have been personally called into doubt as a result of it, as have a whole set of processes in government and the decent treatment of previous governments by their successors. As far as the rest of us are concerned, you are grubby and defiled by that process and you stand condemned for it.",49
145,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What about Keith Wilson?,49
146,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Resume your seat.,49
147,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Come back to the dispatch box and answer the question. You come back here.,49
148,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. He knows better than that. Telecommunications,49
149,Mr SNOW,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I ask the Minister for Communications and the Arts whether he is aware of proposals to sell Australia's telecommunications company Telstra. Can the minister advise the House of the implications of such proposals.,49
150,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Eden-Monaro for his question. I reaffirm that the government remains committed to the full public ownership of Telstra. It is quite interesting that the Leader of the Opposition comes in here day after day launching attacks against people standing behind me but he is not prepared to probe the government or to try to encourage debate about some of the important policy issues that the people in the galleries and the people of Australia will be deciding on at the next election. Those issues include whether Telstra should be privatised. The Leader of the Opposition tries to tell that drip by drip and spurt by spurt we will learn about the policies that he will put forward at the next election. The policy details are leaking out. It is not because is some deliberate plan on the part of the member for Bennelong; it is the result of behind-the-scenes feuding amongst various shadow ministers who have responsibility for some of these important policy issues. I will give the House a good example. Last Tuesday the man who has his back turned to us at the moment, the Leader of the Opposition, gave an important speech at the National Farmers Federation. Last Tuesday he said that he would direct Telstra to carry out certain capital works by 1997.  speeches; they don't listen to yours.",50
151,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will tell you who did not listen to his speech. It is interesting that within a few days of the Leader of the Opposition giving his speech at the National Farmers Federation, where he said he would direct Telstra to do something, the member for Mackellar tried to snatch back the agenda for Telstra and its privatisation. The member for Mackellar has made it clear up hill and down dale that she is the one responsible for the privatisation of Telstra. Richard Alston is not allowed to talk about it, the Leader of the Opposition is not allowed to talk about it, but she is the person who is responsible for the policy detail on the privatisation of Telstra. We know that the member for Mackellar has strong views on privatisation. The honourable member for Mackellar still remains a fervent believer in the Thatcherite view that it is wrong for the government to own anything. The honourable member for Mackellar believes that it is wrong for ministers to run these organisations and that it is wrong for ministers to own the corporations, using her unique way of describing this issue. She thinks ministers should not be directing Telstra or anyone else to do anything because they should not own them. Meanwhile, the Leader of the Opposition is out there saying he will direct Telstra to carry out certain capital investments; he will direct us Telstra which capital investments will have to be delayed so he can get the things that he wants done. Also we get the Leader of the Opposition saying that he will say how there sophisticated the switches will be in the various exchanges around the country and that he will decide where they get installed. The Leader of the Opposition has adopted the Alston-Brezhnev centrally planned model. Last Tuesday the Leader of the Opposition had a map of Australia rolled out on his desk and he was saying which exchanges would have money spent on them and when and what sort of money would be spent on them. But on the weekend the member for Mackellar went into his office, snatched the maps off him and told him she was responsible for Telstra, not him. There is a crucial issue of difference between the two, and it is not just on whether or not you can direct Telstra. It goes to the question of how much money the opposition would get if it privati sed Telstra. Within a day of the member for Mackellar's hitting the front page of the Saturday Age, the Leader of the Opposition backgrounded Glen Milne of the Australian, who then expressed the opposition leader's displeasure that Mrs Bishop had been trumpeting her policy achievements on Telstra. We can understand why he was displeased. The member for Mackellar was saying some pretty strange things. She was saying she thought she would get $20 billion for the sale of Telstra. It is no wonder that generated a few queries from the financial sector. The Herald-Sun said yesterday 'Libs sell Telstra short'. There are queries about why the opposition is asking for only $20 billion for Telstra when Senator Alston is on the record as saying a few months ago that he thinks it is worth 'at least $30 billion'. The reason they have these differences is that in the article in the Saturday Age the member for Mackellar made clear her view that foreign telephone companies, the big overseas operators, would be declared off limits and not allowed to invest in Telstra. That is what you said; is that correct? Mrs Bishop--Yes.",50
152,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Is that something you support? Is that something the Leader of the opposition supports? Mr Downer-You don't ask questions.,51
153,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The minister will answer questions, not ask them.",51
154,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is the crucial point because the Leader of the Opposition does not agree with that. The Leader of the Opposition is quite prepared to have foreign telephone companies investing in Telstra. That is why he backgrounded Mr Milne and that is why he tried to undermine the member for Mackellar's position on this. There is a very different position again from Warwick Smith, the person who the Leader of the Opposition says is really writing the opposition's communications policy. Warwick Smith is on the record as saying that he thinks there should not be rigid foreign investment rules, that the foreign telephone companies should be allowed to invest in Telstra. All the people who are sitting in parliament representing rural and provincial Australia know what is going to happen if Telstra is privatised. For the life of me, I do not understand why the Leader of the National Party has agreed to the Liberal Party's proposal to privatise Telstra. The member for Warringah is the only one honest enough to say that he wants Telstra broken up. Those of us on this side know that once you do privatise Telstra there is no way you can guarantee that the new owner will not sell off the profitable bits-the mobile telephony, the international business-and leave behind a shell that only has the rural areas, a shell that will force people in the bush to pay the real costs of their telephone calls. It will force people who live in Cairns to pay $1,000 a year for their telephones in the electorate of Leichhardt. It will force people who live in Charleville, in the electorate of the member for Maranoa, to pay $3,300 for their average costs. It will force the people in Capricornia to pay $1,000 and the people in Grey, in Ceduna, to pay $6,800 for their lines. Is it any wonder that those on us on this side of the House, who are concerned about people in the bush and rural and provincial Australia, want to know how you can guarantee that the new owner of Telstra will not jack up the prices for people who live in the bush? Last Tuesday this man said that he will be there directing the investment plans for Telstra to give people high-speed links on their computers. I would like to know whether the people who live in the bush are more concerned about their high-speed computer connections or the cost of their basic telephone bills. Your policy is to ensure that a future owner of a privati sed Telstra will send their bills through the roof. Minister for Human Services and Health",51

166,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,52
167,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,52
168,Mr CHYNOWETH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,This is a real question. It refers to the role of the Health Insurance Commission. What action is the government taking to improve the HIC's performance and to enhance access for rural Australians?,52
169,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is very obvious that you can only get a policy debate on this side of the House, so we have to have it within our own party rooms and within our own organisations because we cannot have it across the chamber. The Health Insurance Commission conducts an annual survey-and I am sure many honourable members are aware of this; certainly the Leader of the Opposition is with his 'me too' Medicare policy. It assesses the level of business performance, and it also measures client satisfaction against its service delivery standards. The Health Insurance Commission is responsible both for Medicare and Medibank Private. On the Medicare side, we have seen dramatic improvements over the last decade. In 1983 support for Medicare was 44 per cent, so it was sort of safe for the opposition to be attacking it. But now it is at 88 per cent. The latest survey shows that 88 per cent of Australians support Medicare in all its components. Bulkbilling is also on the increase, with 77 per cent of GPs overall bulkbilling. That compares with 45 per cent in 1984-85, the first full year of operation. That is a very successful tribute to Labor's health policy. I remind the House that when the current Leader of the Opposition was formerly leader he said: The second thing we will do is we will get rid of the bulk billing system, it is an absolute rart. He said it was a monster and a nightmare. That view is still around within the Liberal Party. Earlier this year Dr Brendan Nelson, who I think will be the spokesman on health after the next election, said about bulkbilling: 'I realise it's popular but it's totally unsustainable. You have to do what's right.' That is the view of the AMA as well. It is certainly something that has been supported by other members on the front bench. I am pleased to announce today a couple of innovations that will improve further public acceptance of Medicare. One of them is formless cash claiming. That has been trialled in August and September around the country. It is a new system that will be launched nationally for all users on 1 December. It basically means that, if you have paid your bill, you do not need to fill in a form. You just hand it over the counter and you will then get the refund. It means better service and shorter waiting periods for everybody. The other element is the trial of a telephone claiming service. It is a three-month national trial. It will be in all rural and remote areas of Australia, all of Northern Territory and Tasmania-which means that some 13 per cent of the population will be covered. It will be a 24-hour a day service, seven days a week. And it will mean a much quicker turnaround for country people. The point of all this is that we are not resting on our laurels. We do have a clear and explicit policy. We are continuing to innovate and improve our performance, and it builds on very significant achievements. But what have we seen from the opposition? We have seen a 'me too' document in health, but it is full of holes. For instance, it makes The Things That Matter document, which was touted around before, actually look intellectually appealing. Your document had depth in comparison with this. One of the things that this document claims is that the private health system has passed some sort of crisis point. I draw the Leader of the Opposition's attention to the fact that there is a record level of admissions and procedures in the private health sector-bed days, occupancy, whatever you look at. It has been growing faster than the public sector. So get your facts right. Opposition members-Oh! Ha, hal",52

It is no good attacking the Labor Party's record on Medicare because it is a strong one. Lining up behind Medicare looks okay, but the questions that you have to answer over the next few months are very clear. These are the questions that you are required to answer. Firstly, on hospitals, are you going to hand over responsibility to the states for funding hospitals, as you have tried to do before? Is that something you will hand back to the states? Will you maintain the same level of funding by the Commonwealth?",53
172,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What are you carrying on about? You are bucketing everyone.,53
173,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for O'Connor!,53
174,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Will you guarantee universal access to hospitals and rule out means testing public patients, something you have been supportive of before? Will you introduce co-payments for hospital admissions, something you have been supportive of before? Will you ensure that coalition state governments maintain a viable public health system? They are the questions that you have to answer in your policy. In terms of medical benefits, it is okay to say that you support Medicare, but in what form will bulkbilling stay? What rebate level and what scope of services will there be? Will you means test it in any way? What co-payment level will there be for Medicare benefits? What level of rebate will there be for private hospitals? That is the sort of detail you have to get down to if you say you support Medicare. You cannot simply say that you do; you have to demonstrate it. I think it is most important that people around the country now ask you those questions and that they get an answer-not the sort of air that is contained in this document, the so-called speakers notes. Pity them if they stood up in the public session and read from that nonsense! Telecommunications",53
175,Mr MACK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Communications and the Arts. Minister, are you aware of the widespread community opposition to the environmental degradation of Sydney resulting from government policies in relation to aircraft noise, tax subsidised private tollways and overhead pay TV cabling, particularly where underground facilities exist in parallel? Will you impose the access regime of the Competition Policy Reform Act on the telecommunications companies or take other steps to enable underground facilities to be shared? Or will you allow overhead cabling to proceed as highly visible advertising for the coalition at the election?",53
176,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank my friend, the member for North Sydney, for that question. Obviously, I do not have responsibility for aircraft, but I certainly do have responsibility for Telstra cables.",54
177,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You don't want responsibility for Laurie, do you?",54
178,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I tell you what, a lot of people who live east and west of Sydney think your concern about losing your seat and your party winning the election is something that is outrageous on your part.",54
179,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Gee, that's cutting.",54
180,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We know that is your biggest nightmare-that you will win the election, but you will lose your seat.",54
181,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,54
182,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister has the call.,54
183,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member for North Sydney's question was about the environmental impact of telecommunications infrastructure. I think people should be reminded every now and again that both parties have voted in the Senate to exempt the telephone carriers and Vodafone, the two fixed wire carriersMr Ruddock-Oh, me too. Me too! I will be in this.",54
184,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That's right, your party too. Mr Ruddock-Me too!",54
185,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Berowra might not interject.,54
186,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Berowra may like to discuss this with the member for Warringah who runs around the country trying to suggest that it is an outrage that certain telephone companies are exempted from the state planning and the local government procedures. It is because your party, along with our party, have voted to grant them that exemption. That is the truth. ",54
187,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You people voted for it in the Senate, unless you have forgotten. The reason that both parties voted to grant that exemption",54
188,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,This is the new Keating. You had better go back to Laurie.,54
189,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,54
190,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You are no good without a script, are you, Michael?",54
191,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The minister will resume his seat. In the proceedings of this place, the Leader of the Opposition is given some latitude. He will not continue to interject when the minister is responding.",54
192,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I was saying, there is often a conflict between trying to ensure that communications infrastructure is installed and rolled out as quickly as possible and ensuring that there is also protection for the environment and that proper planning processes are followed. The telecommunications national code tries to strike that balance between making sure that outrageous towers are not put in sensitive environmental locations-in national parks and other places-and also making sure that we do not hold back investment and new communications infrastructure. Liberal members opposite are yelling out that that is rubbish. You should speak to a few of your National Party colleagues who bombard my office with letters demanding that the telephone companies spend more money more quickly on rolling out communications infrastructure. Half the people sitting on that side of the House attack the government for not doing what the Leader of the Opposition says he would like to do and that is direct Telstra to put up more towers, to put in more cable and do the sorts of things that people like the member for Warringah complain about. On mobile telephone towers in particular, last year the government, at my suggestion, tightened the rules for the telecommunications national code. We gave local councils the ability to call in CEPA as an umpire for mobile telephone towers, and that is a power that many local councils have not yet used. I do not know whether it is because councillors have not been properly briefed by the council staff, but councils certainly have at least 30 working days, if they are properly informed, to call in CEPA if they are unhappy with particular proposals. Mr Abbott-This is ridiculous. He is misleading the place.",54
193,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Warringah!,55
194,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The second issue, which is about whether Optus Vision should be allowed to install cable overhead, is very controversial. My friend the member for Warringah runs around the country saying that it is a terrible thing that Optus Vision is allowed to attach telephone cable to poles. Mr Grace-Your friend? Some friend!",55
195,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He is certainly a good friend of Mr Santamaria, our old friend from the fifties. The point to make about this is that Telstra has lots of communications cable attached to telephone poles around the country. In my own street in downtown Noraville, Sydney Electricity installed the electricity cables on the poles, Telstra installed telephone cable on the telegraph poles, and I think it will be five or six years before Optus Vision gets to my part of the world. But, if it does, it will that a second telephone cable, attached to the pole, will be carrying pay TV and telephony, no doubt very close to the telephone cables that now carry only telephony. Telstra has decided to put as much cable as possible underground, which means that it is spending more money in doing that. I get a significant number of complaints from people who say that that also causes damage. It is a matter of trying to make sure which is the best way to roll out the infrastructure to generate competition. What I do not want to do in Australia is go down the track of Britain, New Zealand and some states of the United States where companies are given exclusive rights, regional monopolies, over cable in parts of our country. That would be locking up Australia's telecommunications infrastructure for many years. It would be giving Telstra or Optus Vision monopoly rights. It would mean that consumers would pay more, and that is something which I do not think is in Australia's interests in the long term. In the Telecommunications National Code we tried to strike that balance between encouraging people to invest in communications infrastructure and also allowing proper environmental processes to take place. I have asked Austel to carry out a review of the Telecommunications National Code. I would invite the honourable member for North Sydney, if he or his constituents have concerns about whether we have struck the right balance, to lodge his views with Austel. It will be issuing a discussion paper in the next few weeks on these issues. That will give many members of the community a chance to express their views on this very important issue. Defence Training",55
196,Mr HORNE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel. Is the minister aware of reports concerning the level of training being received by defence personnel? What is the government's response to those reports?  member for Paterson for his question and mean acknowledge his very active interest and concern for all members of the defence forces. Yes, I am aware of a recent breathtakingly sweeping statement that suggests that under the Labor government the defence forces have had their training expended, to the benefit of the equipment vote. That statement was, of course, in the Liberal Party's confidential speakers notes-which is a lovely piece of prose, a bit of fiction, very well read on our side of the House, and I am sure that it will be quoted back increasingly more often in the next couple of months. It has got a couple of problems with it. First of all, it is not true and, secondly, it is in the context of the Leader of the Opposition's wonderful headland statement about defence a few weeks ago, which was deprived of any mention whatsoever of dollars, percentages of GDP or any other financial considerations.",55
197,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, quite right.  Leader of the Opposition-a small matter of credibility. Let us just have a look, for the record, in answering this criticism and suggestion, at Labor's record on defence training. First of all, one of the most obvious indicators by which we could look at this question is the number of exercises that defence personnel are involved in. It is of interest to know that in 1980-81 under those opposite-the successes of 1980-81-there were only 41 joint and combined exercises. This year, under Labor, there are 172 exercises. That means a fourfold increase. So much for some suggestion that our people are suffering on the training front. Secondly, we go to the question of quality and sophistication, something the opposition would know little about. Our training methodology is now using, both on a widespread basis and increasingly, the most up-todate simulation technologies-new information technologies, distance learning techniques, multimedia interactive devices: all comprehensive training coming under a Labor government. If that is not good enough for opposition members to debunk this little fairy tale, let's ask ourselves why they raise this when the government is about to release the most widespread changes to defence personnel conditions in the ADF's history to stop the cyclical movement of people out of the armed forces whenever the aviation industry and others decide they want to go poaching. If our people are so poorly trained, as our opponents suggest, don't tell the private sector because they obviously haven't got that message. The private sector provide evidence that you are wrong on this as well. We might mention in this context the fact that we have embarked on a comprehensive program of civil accreditation in our defence training and education programs. By the end of this year, nearly 500 courses in the defence forces will have received civil accreditation. If that is not good enough, let us look at how many others flock from overseas to have their military training done in this country. There are almost 20 nations from this part of the world alone, from our region alone. We also have training arrangements with the United States, New Zealand, the UK, Germany, Canada, Japan, Kuwait, the Arab Emirates and Brunei. And the list goes on. Our training is so highly regarded around the world that it is now a factor in our defence industry's ability to sell equipment overseas. If that is not enough, I invite the opposition, once more for the record, to lay down on the dispatch box how much it will spend on defence and repudiate its 1993 document A Strong Australia which allows for a $500 million cut to defence over three years. Minister for Human Services and Health",55
198,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Human Services and Health. Is Pam Beggs right when she said your office was responsible for malicious and vicious attacks on the person who was the catalyst for the royal commission, Keith Wilson? When Pam Beggs says that she was not motivated by vengeance but she was motivated by the truth, and so were her colleagues, isn't she right? And isn't it a fact that the enormous gulf between what you and your former friends and colleagues are saying comes back to one simple reality-they told the truth and you didn't?",56
199,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I underline again that the opposition have run out of questions in returning to this issue time and time again. They indicate very clearly that they cannot understand that the people of Australia want to know what their policy is in detail on superannuation, on health and on aged care. It is notable that the member who asked this question is one of those who sought to make particular capital out of this. He has been most unpleasant in characterising a number of players in this regard, myself included, and members of my staff. I repudiate all of the sleaze that has been directed at my staff and at others around me by the member for Chisholm, who has been very careless with his tongue inside and outside this place. I simply say that members opposite do not understand the clarity with which most Australians see this issue and it is a clarity that they do not read properly. The Leader of the Opposition would want to make himself a saint on these questions. He would want to say that he is beyond criticism. But every day that you refuse to tell the people of Australia what you stand for and what you are going to do, every day that you fling mud at me or somebody elseMrs Bishop-Every day you lie.",56

221,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The lack of credibility in government human services and health policy. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",58
222,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This matter of public importance is about the lack of credibility in the human services and health portfolio because of the lack of credibility of the person who occupies the position of minister. We saw that today in question time. The Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) had the opportunity to repudiate and to put straight Pam Beggs's comment about the vicious and malicious campaign against Keith Wilson. She got to this dispatch box, she could have addressed the issues but she chose to slip and slide away from it. She might not like to hear it, but I am going to put it on the record. I am going to repeat it again and again. You are a health minister that professes concern for mental health but when you were under pressure you tried to discredit Keith Wilson by sending your staff member around the gallery to spread rumours about his son's mental illness. Nothing could be lower. It is her:e in the Sydney Morning Herald by Paul MCGeogh, and I am going to read it out to you word for word. It states: Dr Lawrence's staff is excusing Mr Wilson on the grounds that he was under pressure in 1992because of his son's mental illness and because he was threatening to resign from Parliament. And the Federal Government's National Media Liaison Office is distributing material on Mr Wilson's long standing opposition to aspects of sex education apparently as proof that he has an axe to grind the Minister for Health. I dare you to get up here and say that is not true, because the people in that press gallery know it is true. They had Brenda Conroy go around and say to them, 'Keith Wilson wasn't thinking properly. His son had a mental illness. You know, really, we can't rely on what he was saying in 1992.' Then you have the hypocrisy and the cant to profess concern for mental illness when you were prepared to use a person's mental illness in their family to try to discredit them. Nothing could be lower. It is part of the credibility problem. Credibility means that when you stand up here at the dispatch box you have to be taken at your word. One has to be prepared to believe that a minister of the crown is telling the truth. This is just one in a long line of events that shows that when you have a choice between telling the truth and telling a lie, the first thing that pops into your mind is a lie. I will build the case on that. Yesterday we had an extraordinary situation in the House where the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) got up and called seven Labor ministers and three staffers 'the Burke squad'. You should have expected the response that received. It came today from Pam Beggs. It is very telling. She said: I was motivated by one thing and one thing only, and that was to protect someone who was telling the truth from the malicious and vicious series of statements that were being put around. I voted for the royal commission in Cabinet. I think in those days in the Labor Party there was a lot of anxiety and some of it may have been directed at Carmen, (but) I don't see myself as an enemy of Carmen Lawrence. My motivation was nothing to do with the WA Inc. royal commission. Mrs Beggs also denied that several Labor members displayed anger towards Dr Lawrence. She asked: Was Jim MCGinty motivated by an act of vengeance? He supported everything that I said prior to the royal commission, in the royal commission, and so did several other ministers who were present at that Cabinet meeting on November the second. You see, you have gone too far here. One of the reasons why you are in so much trouble now is that rumour campaign that was circuwith lated about Keith Wilson. That is what prompted Pam Beggs to come out. That is what started the thing rolling. The events of yesterday were just the culmination of the Easton royal commission. The Easton royal commission found four things about you: that you were briefed by Zoltan Kovacs and Ed Russell after they had been briefed by Halden; that you were briefed by Halden yourself in the week before the tabling; that what Keith Wilson and Pam Beggs said happened on 2 November did happen; and that you raised the matter later that day yourself with Marcelle Anderson. Marcelle Anderson is the person of Notre Dame fame. I will come to that in a moment. Those people were not motivated by anything other than the wish to tell the truth. Remember the faces on your former staff when they had to come and give evidence against you? Remember the poor, tortured little face of Zoltan Kovacs? Remember the pain he was going through? He actually admired you, but he could not support you because that would have involved not telling the truth. That is what everyone of those ministers did. I have heard the defence that you have given several times, and to pre-empt it I am going to go through the sequence of events that happened back in 1992. What they relate to was your imprest account. The fact is that you had $5,000 of public money in your cheque account. I could be charitable. Perhaps you did not notice it. I do not know how many of my colleagues on this side of the House would not notice $5,000 in their cheque accounts. Julian might not, but I believe everyone else would notice $5,000. What happened was very simple. You were caught out. Brian Burke went to gaol for it. The police had an inquiry and they said, 'We had better look at all the other MP's imprest accounts'. Lo and behold, what did they find? For 18 months, earning interest, sitting in Carmen's cheque account, was $5,000 of public money. Mr Downer-For how long?",58
223,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"For 18 months. You can guess what her response was: 'I am sorry, I forgot'. Let us be charitable. Normally when one makes a mistake one cops it and is prepared to say, 'I am sorry, I made a mistake.' What happened on this occasion was that, in an attempt to deflect attention from yourself, you worked out a hit on Richard Court. You got this petition and it was tabled on the same day that the police were releasing publicly their information that you had public money in your cheque account. You went around and had your office brief the press gallery in Perth: 'Don't worry about what Carmen has done; there is something better happening about Richard Court'. Then when it was tabled the press gallery in that place was full to the brim. The next day, when the headline on the front page of the West Australian newspaper should have been 'Premier has Public Money in a Bank Account', the headline was 'Both Leaders under a Cloud'. It was a deliberate strategy to deflect attention from yourself and do it by smearing an opponent. What your staff also did-I do not mind saying it here because people in the gallery know it is true-was go around behind the scenes and brief journalists that the Leader of the Opposition in Western Australia was also involved in some sort of sexual impropriety. So the next day Richard Court had an inquiry into him. It took two weeks before he was cleared. You would probably have got away with it-a dirty, grubby little smear, a briefing of the press gallery about something tantalising. They did not print it, just like your briefing of the press gallery on something tantalising about Keith Wilson. You would have got away with it if it were not for the fact that four days later one of the people in that petition committed suicide. What happened subsequently is telling because you would have had the opportunity to come into the House and say, 'We all do things in politics that we regret. I made a mistake and I am sorry.' If that had happened, you would probably be Deputy Prime Minister of Australia today, but it did not happen. You chose the cover-up route. You chose to try to deflect attention. You went into the House and said, 'I learnt of the detail of the petition and its general thrust upon its tabling.' I have heard you say time and time again, 'People's recollections differ after four years.' Mr Downer-But four days?",60
224,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"But four days? That is absolutely right. We are not asking about your memory three to four years ago; we are asking about your memory four days later. You cannot wriggle out of that. Of course, as people would say in the trade, this is not an isolated event. This minister actually has form. Mr Downer-Western Women.",60
225,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This minister has a series of events: Western Women; the imprest account; Notre Dame; Keith Wilson. What I have to say would be the best example of postgraduate television interviewing I have ever seen-Paul Lyneham getting you to admit that you had not told the truth about Gary Gray. Again, they are pertinent to this because if the minister does not have credibility the government does not have credibility on the health portfolio. Look at Western Women in 1992. Carmen Lawrence got up in the Westem Australian parliament on 9 April and said, 'I have never met'",60
226,Mr BEAZLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: this is a fairly desultory recitation of their grievances against the minister, Mr Speaker, but this is not a debate on a motion about the minister's position in relation to the affairs of that royal commission. The matter of public importance says this: The lack of credibility in government human services and health policy. We have not had anything on that since. It is all a canvassing of the issues of the royal commission.",61
227,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Jenkins)Order! The Deputy Prime Minister will resume his seat. Matters of public importance have adopted a fairly wide ranging debate by past precedent. I am in a difficult position because, as the proposer of the matter of public importance, the honourable member for Chisholm should know the intent. I would ask that he refer his remarks to his matter of public importance.",61
228,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I can understand the Deputy Prime Minister being upset. He is one of the Burke squad. I actually took advice from the clerks on this and, thank you, I am keeping within the advice I was given. Again, the credibility of a portfolio goes to the credibilirefer ty of a person. With Western Women in 1992 it was quite simple: you denied point blank ever knowing Robyn Greenburg.",61
229,Mr BEAZLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. What do the affairs of a failed bank, the Western Women operation, have to do with the credibility of human services and health policy?",61
230,Mr TUCKEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,He is wasting time.,61
231,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Order! On the point of order, the member for Chisholm will come to the matter of public importance which states 'The lack of credibility in government human services and health policy'.",61
232,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I can understand why they don't like it. You held this line until October, until a letter dated 23 july 1990 came out addressed to 'Dear Robyn'. You had to change your tune then. We remember Marcelle Anderson because she was the person on your staff who testified against you at the royal commission. She said that she had discussed Western Women with you.",61
233,Mr BEAZLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. This is not a censure debate, nor is it an MPI on the issue of the royal commission in Western Australia and the minister. It is an MPI on the lack of credibility in government human services and health policy. It is a very specific MPI and there has been no mention of these. things yet. Mr Downer-You are undermining her, Kim.",61
234,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! Those on my left! The Deputy Speaker did remind the honourable member for Chisholm a moment ago about the fact that the specifics of this matter go to human services and health policy. I also invite him to come to that specific matter.,61
235,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I come to it, because the credibility of the health policy goes to the credibility of the minister. If the people cannot believe the minister every time she opens her mouth, there is no credibility in the broad portfolio area. As those opposite have managed to waste four minutes of my time, I will skip to a recent event which is very telling of the psychology of this minister. I to a 7.30 Report interview on 14 September 1995 between the minister and Paul Lyneham. Paul Lyneham took the statement she had made previously when she had said, 'Oh no, Gary Gray didn't ask me to stand down'. In a series of questions he in fact got the minister to admit that there had been discussion about it: PAUL LYNEHAM: But it wasn't really all the truth, was it? CARMEN LAWRENCE: Yes, it was. PAUL LYNEHAM: It wasn't the full, to quote a well-known phrase: The full thrust of the eventswas it?",61
236,Mr BEAZLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. These are again failed tactics on their part. There are easier ways to devise an MPI to get at what they really want to be talking about, but this is not about that. This is about health policy and we have not heard a word yet about that in these remarks. Mr Costello-This is not a point of order.",61
237,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Order! Again, I simply say to the member for Chisholm that he might show where health policy is related.",62
238,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We all get questions we don't like. Well, you can be evasive and you can downright refuse to answer it. But on this occasion you did the first into your mind and that was to tell a lie. (Time expired)",62
239,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The member for Chisholm will withdraw the last statement.,62
240,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,She said something that was untrue. I withdraw that.,62
241,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! I call the Minister for Human Services and Health.,62
242,Mr BEAZLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The same as a Tuckey or a Moore. Or is it a Downer? Mr Moore-What do you mean?,62
243,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The House will come to order. The Minister for Human Services and Health has the call and will be heard. Mr Moore-He is telling lies.,62
244,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Order! The member for Ryan, are you taking any notice of me? Mr Moore-He is telling lies.",62
245,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! You will withdraw that comment and accusation. Mr Downer-He is telling Carmens.,62
246,Mr BEAZLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Or is he telling Tuckeys and Moores. Mr Downer-She is the most discredited minister ever in the chamber.,62
247,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! There is no provision for you to stand there and talk across the chamber.,62
248,Dr LAWRENCE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Fremantle-Minister for Human Services and Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women) (4.29 p.m.)-The fact that the opposition were not prepared in their MPI to say clearly what their intention was is an indication of just how badly they feel about this. They are not quite sure whether they should be dealing with it in the way that they are. Normally, if you wanted to attack a minister personally on policy or on a royal commission's findings, that is what your matter of public importance would say. But, rather than that, this is about the government's credibility in policy-the government, not the minister. I am one of several ministers since 1983 to have been in this office. What I intend to do today is to speak to the matter thing that came of public importance. Mr Reith-You would not want to do any other, would you?",62
249,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! There will be no interjections.,62
250,Dr LAWRENCE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I will deal with that at the end of my speech. In the coming months the community will be faced with a very stark choice: the choice between a system that has been worked out and approved by the community-Medicare, a universal health system, built on the bedrock of Medibank-or a return to the confusion, chaos and inequity of the coalition's policies. What we have seen over the last 15 years is precisely that: they have never had a health policy and they are not about to acquire one under this shadow minister because he spends all his time working with the Court dirt squad digging up what he thinks are telling criticisms of the minister. I ask him: what about your policy, what are you going to do for the people of Australia in the area of health care? What are you going to do about disability services and aged care? Where is your policy? Just recently this shadow minister turned up in Melbourne at a rally about dementia specific services for the aged. It is an important issue and one that deserves decent attention. When the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) addressed ACOSS in his speech on 30 October, he talked explicitly about dementia specific facilities. He claimed they were insufficiently funded and committed the opposition 'to appropriate funding for dementia care'. He made it very clear to everyone there that he intended to increase the funding available for that purpose. His audience knew what he was promising.",62
251,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I didn't say that.,62
252,Dr LAWRENCE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"No, the Leader of the Opposition did. Have you just promoted yourself? The shadow minister, at the rally in Melbourne on Sunday, however, showed up his leader's words for what they were and, indeed, his character for what it is-a piece of opportunism without any substance. His speech was clearly intended to tell the audience what they wanted to hear. He openly claimed that the coalition in government would add no further funding. He said, 'It will not cost a cent more.' He said they would reform the system of dementia care without an extra cent of expenditure when his leader had said, just a few weeks before, that they would increase and improve dementia specific facilities. So that is the current performance of this shadow minister-and what you could expect. The coalition legacy should be held up for scrutiny as we move to this election. In March 1983 when we formed government it was quite clear that the health system in this country was in a shambles-and everybody knew it. It was part of the election campaign and it was taken for granted by the media and the people in this country. It is important to recognise that it is a shambles we could easily return to under a coalition government, if they were ever to be elected. In the Fraser years, with Howard as Treasurer for part of it, the conservatives lurched through five different Medibank revisions. What happened during that time was a gradual reduction in the level of service. People were paying more and getting less; and there were more inequalities in the system. Fraser hoped he could keep the name Medibank and get away with honouring his so-called commitment at the 1975 election. But what he created was a two-tiered health system: one for the wealthy and one for the less well off. It was absolutely chaotic. They wanted to go back to the 1950s, the time when Earl Page was minister for health. At every election since then that is basically what they have done. Everyone was forced to take out private health insurance if they were able, otherwise they had to rely on a charity health system. Some two million people had no health cover at all. This was the so-called golden era of private health care. Every sharp operator in the private health sector could make a profit under Fraser and Howard-and the conservatives spent billions and took us nowhere. They pumped bed day subsidies into private hospitals, they made contributions for the reinsurance pool for private insurers, they made people pay a very high cost for their private insurance, and they provided tax incentives. So they were helping one section of the community while there were two million people without any insurance at all. They neglected the interests of ordinary Australians. There were over 400,000 people on middle incomes who were struggling to make ends meet and did not have any private health insurance. They were not eligible for Medibank and they did not live in Queensland. Free access to public hospitals was restricted to the disadvantaged. What happened was that the government of the day increasingly forced state governments to charge more. In fact, under Labor there had been special purpose grants to the states for hospital services. The conservatives gave it all back to the statessomething I believe they intend to do again. The states were no longer required to spend those funds on health, and in some cases they did not. They were allowed to introduce copayments. Indeed, they were forced to in some cases and were told that, if they didn't, their funding would be reduced proportionately. That is part of what we have seen in the past. Mercifully, Labor's election in 1983 put an end to all that. The Fraser-Howard health debacle was finally finished. The dismantling of Medibank was reversed and we had the Medicare system that I talked about and which the opposition now say they want to support. It is worth recalling, and he is not the only member to have said it, that Billy Snedden summarised the views of the conservative parties then, now and, I believe, into the future. He said, 'If this health scheme goes through, this generation will be passing on a vast failure and those who vote for it will regret it. It will bedevil the future and reduce the standard of living for generations to come.' That argument has been stated not just by Mr Snedden-who was a leader a long time ago-but by every successive Leader of the Opposition and every successive shadow health spokesman since. It is not a view that the opposition have ever eschewed: they have always held the view that Medicare was a mistake, that there should be more private health insurance, that private hospitals should be given special support and that the public hospital system should essentially be a charity system. Today all sections of the community have access to medical and hospital services, and pharmaceuticals on the basis of their need for the service, not their wealth or insurance status. We need to be able to use our public hospitals free of charge. We need the training of the next generation of doctors and nurses to go on there. So if you privatise and contract out to some state government, you lose that and you lose the science base, something that I am sure would happen under a conservative government. Medicare rebates vary substantially the costs of people's medical expenses and we are able to get low cost medicines through the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Medicare by all accounts is an indisputable success. So is the credibility of the government's health care policy in human services and health. It has been measured time and time again. Its credibility is underlined by the fact that the opposition now want to say, 'Me, too. We want to do the Medicare line,' although they have objected to it whenever there has been any reform. They now say, 'We want to get on board.' They know that Medicare has produced one of the most effective and efficient health services in the world. At the same time, we have maintained a reasonable level of expenditure. Ours is not an expensive system in comparison with that of our OECD partners. It has been maintained at pretty much the same level. One of the untruths contained in that speakers' document of the Liberal Party is that we have increased the proportion of our wealth going to health care costs. It is simply not true. It has been static in the last few years and is now declining. It is now around 8Y2 per cent of GDP. Compared with OECD countries we do stunningly well--especially compared with the United States where health eats up 14 per cent of GDP and 40 per cent of people do not have private health insurance. That is the model that this lot have favoured in the past and, I believe, would return to given half a chance. They might retain the name Medicare but all the elements underneath it would change. That was clearly indicated in Fightback and has been indicated until recently by the opposition. Mr Lindsay-They are being deceitful about it.",62
253,Dr LAWRENCE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Exactly. They do not want anyone to know about it. They have come in here and accused me of all sorts of heinous crimes but when it comes to a policy that affects every Australian--every newborn child and every person as they are dyingthey are not prepared to talk about how they will manage Medicare. It is a simple, fair and high quality system that Australians have come to know and love. We have concentrated on improving health outcomes through prevention as well as treatment. There are a whole lot of policies that we have not heard about from the opposition. It that is not just how you finance health but what you are going to do about programs to combat heart disease, cancer, injuries and mental illness. What are you going to do about medical research? We have doubled funding for it. What about screening programs for breast cancer and cervical cancer? Are you going to continue to fund those? Are you going to continue the national effort in dealing with childhood illnesses like whooping cough, meningitis, measles, mumps, and tetanus? What about the HIV-AIDS strategy which is recognised internationally as one of the best? The only policy we have heard from the opposition, speaking of immunisation programs, was in part of the first headland speech by the then newly elected Leader of the Opposition. They announced a policy that we had begun to implement two years earlier. It is quite a disgrace that the only program they could put forward was already being implemented by government. What can we expect from the coalition? While we have been rebuilding health policy from the mess they made of it last time in government, what have they been doing? Have they been building up a new set of policies and programs? Have they been developing new ideas to improve health in Australia? Not a bit of it. What they have been daing is working out detailed plans for dismantling Medicare. At three of the four previous elections they said they would dismantle Medicare, lock stock and barrel, with no apologies. In fact, in 1990 they did not have any policies at all: they simply went to the election and said, 'It is all too hard.' Over and over again they have argued for the abolition of bulk-billing, limiting access to public hospitals to the disadvantaged, increasing the Medicare levy substantially, introducing compulsory fees, introducing unaffordable tax breaks for private health insurance, opting out of Medicare in favour of private health insurance, reducing the Medicare rebate, providing subsidies for health insurance in private hospitals and allowing unfettered gap insurance. These have all been elements of their policies over the last three or four elections. For the whole of his political career, the Leader of the Opposition has been an opponent of Medicare and of universal health care generally. Are we to believe that he has suddenly changed his mind, his basic philosophy and his attitude towards it after all that time? He is someone who has been around in Australian politics for a long time and he has spoken about health care on many occasions. He voted against Medibank in the joint sitting of parliament when he was first elected to this parliament. He opposed it again in the late 1980s as an opposition leader and in 1993 with Fightback. Not surprisingly, with their noses bloodied by that experience, the maxim now is to say less and prosper. They will not tell anyone what they are actually going to do. They just hold up a few lines like 'We support Medicare' and 'We support bulkbilling'. But at what level and for what services? For how long is the most important question. Are we to believe that John Howard has changed his mind altogether and that he has suddenly embraced Medicare, which he found so philosophically repugnant? It is very clear to me that the opposition has never supported the basic philosophy of Medicare, which is that it is a universal entitlement. It is not something you give to people when they are down and out. It is not just there for people who cannot manage the private sector. It is for everybody. Private insurance is a choice above and beyond that. It is not something you force people into. The coalition's support of Medicare-is no more than cosmetic. It is a tactic that they think will help them win the election. Do you really believe, with the Leader of the Opposition's record and the expressed views of people like the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Anderson) and the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), who are very adamantly opposed to Medicare, that they will leave Medicare alone? What will they do on these questions that I raised earlier? What will they do about bulkbilling? The Leader of the Opposition has said that he has not ruled out changes to Medicare. He did not think, in answer to some questions the other day, that the changes Fraser made amounted to massive changes to Medicare. I do not know where he was at the time. I think he was the only person in Australia who would have reached that conclusion. Maybe that is the sort of change he has not ruled out for Medicare. We got to the point where only 30 per cent of the cost of a bill was rebated. Is that the sort of change to Medicare that he is not ruling out? The Leader of the Opposition says that bulk-billing will stay, but in what form will it stay? Will he introduce compUlsory fees for doctors visits and force out bulk-billing by the back door by dropping the level of rebate? If you drop it too low, doctors will not accept it. Certainly you are retaining Medicare in some form, but that will destroy it. Will the coalition means test bulk-billing, as they have threatened to in the past, so that it will be just for pensioners and low income earners? Again, that destroys the universality of Medicare. Will they dismantle the foundation of Medicare, for instance, by selling Medibank Private? I am pretty confident that that is on their agenda. It will increase the costs of Medicare and make it very difficult for people to have access to their rebates. Will private insurers be contracted out to run the Medibank system? Again, that is likely in the Medicare system. Will they force people out of Medicare through a combination of tax incentives and penalties? They are all the things we need to hear about from the opposition if we are to have any confidence that they have a policy. It is not enough to say that we will copy the government's policy and that we want to see Medicare retained but that we reserve the right to change it. Is it the same sort of right that Fraser retained for himself so that by the time Labor returned to ° government the chaos and shambles took another 1 years to repair? Australians do not deserve a health system of that kind. They do not deserve the opposition and the sort of treatment that we have seen by this shadow spokesman on key issues. Today the member came in here and sought to accuse me of smear tactics, which is something he has been doing himself. He came in here and accused me and members of my staff. I repudiate that entirely. I have never sought to blacken the names of those people who disagree with me, unlike the member who made the accusation. (Time expired)",64
254,Mr CAMERON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Stirling) (4.44 p.m.)Australia certainly does not deserve the opposition; that is why the opposition will be the government after the next election. Any Australian concerned about the issue of health in this country must be in despair at the total paralysis of this government. The Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) is without credibility. She spends all of her time defending the indefensible. There is little wonder that she has no time left to work on her area of responsibility. I intend to list a few historical events which will prove to any thinking person that the priority of the minister for health is self; it always has been that and it always will be. Let us look at some of the more recent events in her history as health minister. She authorised, and her department paid for, the publication of the Cleo sex guide, which included a section on the joys of anal sex. Sources from the Cleo magazine itself at their headquarters in Adelaide tell us that 80,000 14to 17-year-old girls would have been exposed to the joys of safe, pregnancy-free lesbian sex involving anus licking, using a latex square, fisting and using friends' sex toys. Her department subsidised the drug user's guide Piss, powders and pleasure. After a bit of pressure, they withdrew that one. By way of trying to explain that drug user's guide, they said that it was aimed at the Melbourne gay community. When will we see the guide 'How to steal cars safely' for young juveniles? How utterly ridiculous! What a ridiculous argument. She supported workshops at the United Nations Womens Forum on the role of inflatable life-sized plastic dolls and dildos in improving health and 'lesbian flirtation techniques'. This is marvellous for the battling women of Australia. In 1990, the minister publicly announced that she would prorogue parliament in Western Australia specifically to end two official inquiries into the Western Australian Labor government's conduct of state affairs. She did the same in 1992 to end the Legislative Council's committee investigation into her role in the government support for the now gaoled Robyn Greenburg's Western Women. The committee tabled a letter proving that Dr Lawrence had glowingly praised Western Women. The committee reported that she had misled parliament over the matter. The very people she was supposed to protect were lied to and robbed of their life savings; should could not remember the letter. This is the woman who was advising the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on women's issues. She has let women down comprehensively. Did she want to compensate all those women who lost their life savings through Western Women? She clearly and absolutely did not. She is a disgrace to women. In 1992, the proroguing also ended the inquiry into her role in secret deals over the loan and grants to Notre Dame University. The committee officially reported that she had lied and repeatedly misled parliament about the details. Where is the credibility of the health portfolio when the minister herself has no credibility? Then came the Easton petition. Dr Lawrence was aware of its tabling and that the allegations were untrue. She forgot about $5,000 sitting in her imprest account for two years. Oh to be in the glorious situation where you could forget about $5,000 sitting in your imprest account for two years. I wrote to her on 11 November 1994 asking for a response to a constituent inquiry of 25 March 1994. As any member on this side of the House would know, writing to the minister for health is like whistling Dixie. You will not get a response because she is too preoccupied with herself. She was the minister for education in Western Australia when more than 10,000 teachers marched on Parliament House to protest the abysmal mess that Labor had made of education. When are people going to learn that this woman is hopeless? She fought tooth and nail to stave off the WA Inc. royal commission. She only agreed when the and press outrage forced her. Look at the result. She sat silent while many of the WA Inc. deals were being done. She was in it to her neck. She was part of the Burke government and yet of course did not recall a thing. She voted with the Western Australian government for the motion that the government support Rothwells with a $150 million guarantee. She voted for the motion to port the government taking equity and an investment on behalf of the Kwinana petroMidland chemical project. She voted against the motion to accept the MCCusker report. An amendment stipulated an urgent need for a stated WA Inc. inquiry. She opposed opposition calls for a special investigation of Rothwells. She could not remember cabinet being asked to approve the government's involvement. opposed a motion for an independent commiscostings. sion of audit to examine government business dealings. Let us look at some comments that other people have had to say about the minister. Mary Lawrence, the minister's mother, said in the Australian on 19 June 1993: . . . young Carmen had a fight at the dinner table and threw a fork which landed under her sister's eye. Carmen has always hated to be proved wrong and she would go to great lengths to tell why she did it ... In her eyes she wasn't actually wrong. She had a motive for doing it. Mary Lawrence continues: She was a tricky little person to understand. Nothing has changed. I am not saying that this person is a fattist or anything like thatfar be it for me to suggest that someone could be overweight-but she is a somewhat larger person to understand these days, I can tell you. She is a somewhat tricky, larger person to understand. Mrs Lawrence said she never knew if little Carmen did something wrong because she could always talk her way out of anything. This time she is not going to talk her way out of it. If the Prime Minister insists on sticking by her at the next election the people in the electorate of Fremantle can pass their judgpublic ment, and I am sure they will. When she appeared before the WA Inc. royal commission, her most prolific comments up were: 'I cannot recall', 'I have no recollection', and 'I have no direct knowledge.' How can she expect us to believe a word she says when she comes in here and tries to lay down the law to people on this side of the House? All we want is some truth. She was a member of a 1986 Labor domisupnated parliamentary committee of inquiry which found no fault with the sale of the Abattoirs for $450,000 to an ALP funds donor. The evidence presented was then destroyed, conveniently. She has publicly that the parliament is 'a waste of time'. On 28 January 1994 in the West Australian she claimed her Treasury had conducted a cost analysis of coalition policies. The TreasShe ury chiefs said they had done no such On 20 March 1993 the West Australian reported she had turned down an offer to run for federal parliament because she believed it would be 'morally wrong', and here she is being morally wrong. That is one thing we would agree on.",66
255,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Jenkins)Order' Earlier I made rulings on the question of relevance to the honourable member for Chisholm's contribution. I indicated that MPIs are wide ranging debates but in practice an MPI is not a motion and therefore things that should be raised by way of substantive motion cannot be proposed as MPIs and should not be entered into in the debate. It is stated in House of Representatives Practice that: ... words critical of the character or conduct of a person, whose actions can only be challenged means of a substantive motion, may not be includSadly, ed in the matter proposed. Therefore, I invite the honourable Stirling to go to the wording of the matter of public importance: the lack of credibility government human services and health policy.",68
256,Mr CAMERON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"As I remarked earlier, how can we talk about the credibility of the health policy when there is no credibility for the health minister? I am glad that I have cally. managed to get a lot of the background out. I have not managed to get out all of it of mentary? course because the list goes on and on; it is a real list of horrors. All of this is happening while hospital waiting lists are lengthening, while the state of health of our Aboriginal people is a national disgrace. What is she going to do about that? It is happening while our senior citizens are suffering in their thousands as they wait for life enhancing operations like hip replacements, et cetera, and in some cases having to wait up to two years. For an elderly person, the pain and misery they go through could kill them in the intervening waiting period. Any person with a skerrick of decency would have been crushed by all of these things I have mentioned. All of this relates the actions of a federal minister and is reflection of all of us in this place, which pretty sad indeed. What an example to be set by people in high office. The Prime Minister yesterday referred to the Burke squad-that is, those friends of Brian Burke who have it in for the minister for health. One name missing from the squad is that of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley). Who does he think it was who convinced the Reverend Keith Wilson to speak out thus triggering the Marks royal commission? It was the Deputy Prime Minister. So let us add the name Beazley to the line-up of the Burke squad. It is interesting to watch the body language of the minister for health as she sits there alongside the Deputy Prime Minister knowing full well that he was the one who pulled the rug from under her before she could park her backside in his seat. At best, this minister has been recklessly by careless with the truth and her portfolio. I and most Australians agree with the Marks royal commission-she lied and she member for must resign immediately.",68
257,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The in honourable member will withdraw the remark.,68
258,Mr CAMERON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,She told a Carmen.,68
259,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The honourable member will withdraw unequivo,68

264,Mr CAMERON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I consider the word 'Carmen' unparliamentary, but I withdraw.",68
265,Mr GIBSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Moreton) (4.54 p.m.)Nothing proves the coalition's total lack of fitness for office than the 15 minutes of diatribe we have heard from the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) and the 10 minutes from the member for Stirling (Mr to Cameron). We have here for discussion the a lack of credibility in government human is services and health policy. We have not heard one word from either of the coalition speakers on policy. It is clear that those opposite have no policy to debate and nothing to offer to the people of Australia. That is why they have stooped to this disgraceful personal attack for Burke the last 25 minutes in this House. There is no sight more pitiful in politics than a man who knows he is about to lose his position desperately struggling to keep his position by engaging in vicious personal attacks on somebody else. That is what the member for Chisholm has been engaging in in the last few minutes in this House. As everybody in this chamber knows, the member for Chisholm is not going to be the minister for health, and in fact will not even be the shadow minister for health when the coalition comes back into opposition after the next election. There is nothing more certain in politics today than the fact that the member for Chisholm is on the skids. This has been a pitiful attempt by him today to cling to office by engaging in one of the most vicious personal attacks I have ever witnessed in 24 years in politics. He should be absolutely ashamed of himself for this disgraceful attack, and other coalition members should not have disgraced themselves by being here and supporting that personal attack. The member for Chisholm will never be the minister for health or the shadow minister for health in any future opposition or coalition government, because the AMA does not want him. His own leader does not want him. The health industry does not want him. He has been an abject failure. He continues to prove what an abject failure he is by the fact that three or four months before we are about to go to an election he has an opportunity in House to talk about policies in the health and human services area and he utters not one word of policy. All he did was engage in a vicious personal attack on the minister because he has nothing to say about policy. He has nothing to offer the people of Australia far as what he would do to help on the very issues that are important to the people of Australia in the areas of human services and health. That just demonstrates his total incapacity for any sort of position of authority on either the opposition benches or, if they were ever elected to power, the government benches. Brendan Nelson has been lined up to be the opposition spokesperson on health. The candidate for Bradfield is going to be the minister if the coalition wins government, and the member for Chisholm knows it. That is the problem he has. So in his desperate bid in the last couple of days of this parliamentary sitting, which may well be the last sitting of this parliament this term, the member for Chisholm slinks in here and engages in the most vicious, vile and dirty attack on an individual and does not even have the honesty and the credibility to notify us of the actual terms of his intentions. He engaged in the most vicious deception. He wrote an official letter to the Speaker saying that he wished to put up as a matter of public importance 'the lack of credibility in government human services and health policy'. When we saw that we thought we were going to have a debate on human services and health policy. It is about time. We are interested to find out what the coalition has to offer. We have been asking for 13 years what the coalition would actually do. But did we actually find this out today? It is two or three days before the end of this parliamentary session and we have had no debate at all. We do have some information about where the coalition might go. We have this little document of speakers notes from the Liberal Party, which is about what they would do. It lists a lot of platitudes, a lot of promises about all these wonderful things the coalition this might do. There is no explanation about how they will do it, where the money will come from, how they will structure it, how they will increase taxes to pay for some of the promises or, if they are not going to increases taxes, what other government services they are as going to eliminate to implement some of these things. For example, in the health policy area it says that they will improve the funding of health care by making private health insurance more attractive and affordable to consumers. That is very interesting but what does it mean? Does it mean tax incentives? Tax incentives for whom? Is it just going to be for low income earners or for everybody? If it is tax incentives for low income earners that will cost around $500 million. If it is tax incentives for everybody to take out private health insurance, that is close to $3 billion. So where are the specifics? What are they going to say? Where does this $500 million come from? Are they going to increase the health budget so that they can pay for that $500 million, or is it their tion to slash $500 million or up to $3 billion from the public hospital area? Where are the specifics? That is what I thought we were going to engage in today-a debate about human services and health policy. But of course we cannot because the opposition have no detail. They have a lot of platitudes and a lot of promises. They go around the countryside telling all sorts of distortions and making all sorts of offers to every group they can, but they never tell how they will do it. We heard from the Treasurer (Mr Willis) in question time today that there are 44 unfunded promises in this statement. By the time we have gone through it, I think we will find that those 44 unfunded promises are going to come in at somewhere around $12 billion to $14 billion. I might be wrong; we will find out when we get the chance to do a detailed analysis. I know some of the things they have been promising around the countryside and those alone go over $10 billion. I have not looked at some of the primary industries and other things they are going to talk ahout. So it is at least $10 billion-maybe up to even $15 billion-worth of expenditure. Yet there is not one word of how they will fund it or what they will do. When they have got 25 minutes in the House on Tuesday, with about two days left of sittings, they engage in this attack on the health minister-a vicious, vile, personal attack. They cannot talk about policy. All they can do is try to destroy someone's credibility and use the floor of parliament to introduce outrageous allegations that cannot be substantiated. The fact is that we cannot believe anything the Liberal Party has to say because we have seen their past performance-the difference between what they say they will do before they get into office and what they actually do when they get into office. I was around and know what happened during the Malcolm Fraser years. I was there when Malcolm Fraser stood before the people of Australia and said, 'We will retain Medibank.' He did not say, 'What we will do is retain the sign ""Medibank"", the term ""Medibank"".' He did not actually retain what intenMedibank was about, which was universal health insurance. With five changes over the next seven years he totally destroyed Medibank. He kept the name 'Medibank'-he stuck it on offices everywhere-and he made it a private health insurance fund. We know what the opposition is likely to do. They go around today saying that they support Medicare-that they will retain Medicare and that they will retain bulk-billing. But just wait. If they get into office, within the first few months they will be saying, 'Well, we have looked at things and, no, we can't afford it now. It is clear that we can't. What we thought was a good system we have analysed and have found that it is full of holes, so we are going to have to make this change and that change. We are going to have to cut back on bulk-billing.' They will do all the same things they have done every other time they have been in office. People might say, 'That is a bit unfair. You are going back 13 years. You can't talk about that. That is in the ancient past.' Let us just look at what Liberal and National party state governments of today are doing. They lied to the people in those states by saying, 'We won't do this. We will not do that.' But as soon as people like Jeff Kennett and Richard Court get into office, what do they do? They immediately go back on what they said they would do and they start slashing expenditure to hospitals and they start cutting expenditure in the whole human services and community services area. That is the performance of coalition governments across this country. That is what the people of Australia can expect from a Liberal-National party federal government. The people of Australia are awake up to the coalition. They know they have no policies. They know that they will not honour their promises and they will not give them the reins of human services and health to destroy them. (Time expired).",68
266,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Rocher)Order! The discussion is concluded. NA The following bill was returned from the Senate without amendment or requests: Customs Tariff Bill 1995 NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.3) 1995 Main Committee Report Bill returned from Main Committee without amendment; certified copy presented. Ordered that the bill be taken into consideration forthwith. Bill agreed to. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mrs Crosio)-by leave-read a third time. NA Certain Family Law Issues Committee,71
267,Mr MARTYN EVANS,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues, I present the committee's report entitled Funding and administration of the Family Court of Australta. Ordered that the report be printed.",71
268,Mr MARTYN EVANS,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues has completed its inquiry into the funding and administration of the Family Court of Australia. During 1988-89, the government agreed that the funding of federal courts should be changed and that separate administration be introduced. Separate administration of the Family Court commenced on 1 January 1990. Over a period of time there was a gradual process of devolution of functions from the Attorney-General's Department to the court. The Family Court has been operating in a running costs environment since 1989-90. In the last financial year, the net cost of services of the Family Court was $97.3 million, with the running cost budget in 1995-96 being approximately $67 million. The nominal Family Court running cost allocations from SENATE 1989-90 to 1994-95 have increased some 50.7 per cent, with the annual average increase being 8.5 per cent. The real percentage increase over the same period was 36.8 per cent, with an average annual real increase of 6.5 per cent. In these circumstances, the joint committee is of the view that the Family Court is adequately funded and that any changes in circumstances which may affect its workload and which may require additional funding should be negotiated with the Department of Finance. The joint committee is aware of the substantial and complex task the Family Court carries out but, like other budget funded agencies, it must manage the best way it can with the resources it has available. It is in that context that the committee was very concerned about the processes of the Family Court in running a deficit and in borrowing against future years for their present day costs. It was also concerned at the way in which unfunded proposals were approved by Report the court without adequate committed funds being available. The committee believes that such a funding arrangement cannot be condoned and, indeed, must not continue. The committee has therefore recommended that the Auditor-General conduct an efficiency audit of the Family Court and that the court set in place appropriate cost benefit analysis strategies to ensure that this situation does not occur in the future. The committee also examined the judicial structure of the court. It felt constrained to reject the proposal of the Family Court to appoint magistrates as a new judicial level and therefore completely change the basis of the Family Court's judicial structure, but it does support a process of extending the role of judicial registrars and ensuring that they be able to continue to perform the good work which they now do. The committee also examined the management structure of the Family Court and recommends a number of changes in that area. In particular, it recommends that the regional structure should be abandoned and that individual registries should have responsitions bility for the operation of their own registry in the context of a national structure. The committee was particularly concerned to ensure that better use is made of existing state local court resources and that training programs be introduced for appropriate state magistrates to ensure that the family law jurisdiction is available in the suburbs and in the provincial areas of Australia. We were also very keen to support alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, such as mediation, but thought these should be done on a community basis outside of the Family Court, although we recognise that some level of direct access to counselling must always remain within the Family Court itself. There are a wide range of matters that can be considered here, but in view of the time constraints I think they would be better canvassed in the Main Committee where further discussion can take place. On that basis, I will curtail my remarks.",71
269,Mr ANDREWS,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues-as the member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans), the chairman of the committee, has pointed out-is the final of three reports put out by the committee. The committee has been examining family law, the operation of the Family Law Act and the procedures and processes of the Family Court in Australia. That examination has taken place over the life not only of this parliament but of the previous parliament as well. Much of the report deals with the resourcing and administrative structure of the court. In short, the committee concluded that the court was sufficiently resourced but could be more efficiently conducted than it has been to date. The committee also proposed a reordering of the management structure. That reordering of the management structure would involve some far-reaching changes to the way in which the court is conducted. That proposal deserves considerable consideration by members in this place. The report follows a previous committee report into the operation of the Family Court in Australia in 1980. One of the recommendaof this committee-whose work has now come to a conclusion-is that, in the future, there should be ongoing reviews of the operation of the Family Court. Like the chairman of the committee, I recognise that time to address this report is short. I have some more substantial remarks that I wish to make in relation to some aspects of the report, particularly in relation to counselling and alternative dispute resolution structures. I will seek to do that in the Main Committee when this matter is sent there. I should say-and, undoubtedly, this is on behalf of the chairman-that all the members of the committee who have agreed to this unanimous report thank the officials of the committee, particularly the secretary and the legal and research officers who have contributed to this report along with the previous reports in this parliament and the previous parliament.",72
270,Mr MARTYN EVANS,COMMITTEES,by leave-I move: That the House take note of the report. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted.,72
271,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"Mr Rocher)The resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. APPROPRIATION BILL (No.3) 1995-96 Cognate bills: APPROPRIATION BILL (No.4) 1995-96 APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (No.2) 1995-96 Second Reading Debate resumed from 27 November, on motion by Mr Lindsay: That the bill be now read a second time.",72
272,Ms CRAWFORD,COMMITTEES,"Forde-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing and Regional Development) (5.13 p.m.)-I rise to speak on these appropriation bills. I think it is important for all of us to recognise that, while these bills outline the financial considerations of parliamentary departments and the government in general, they are also important in terms of defining the role of government. All of us-and particularly those on this side of the House-have a very strong view as to what the role of the government should and must be within our communities. We believe in a very strong education sector. We also believe that people have an entitlement to health services. Indeed, recently in my own electorate and in other parts of Australia we have seen the government give $1 billion on drought relief to families in recognition of the hardship which they tend to face. Coming very hard upon the heels of this drought-although some relief of the drought has been manifested in the Boonah shire and the Beaudesert shire recently, as they both received eight to 10 inches of rain-has been the terrible catastrophe which has inflicted the citizens of Beaudesert. Last Saturday evening, a fire estimated to cost $11 million destroyed seven shops and devastated the central part of the town. As well as that, it has meant that 35 people are now without work. The impact on the community has been enormous. The role which was played by the police and the fire brigade was absolutely exemplary. Emergency service workers as well moved to ensure that safety was the first major consideration. As well as that, the council has ensured that where premises are available and suitable, there is some role for them to play. Indeed, Edwards the Retravision people in whitegoods have moved to the local show grounds to continue their trading before Christmas. For other businesses, a butcher, a cafe, a discount store and some other shops, life is still bit more difficult. We too have had our role to play in that the Department of Social Security has been very responsive in seeking to support those people who found themselves out of a job on the Monday morning due to this catastrophe. As well, the Secretary of the Department of Employment, Education and Training, Mr Derek Volker, rang some of the employers inquiring whether anything could be done to meet the needs of this town. All of us recognise that there is a role for local, state and federal governments to work cooperatively to meet the needs caused by devastation in this particular community. Of course, people here would realise that in a community of somewhere between 10,000 to 12,000 people, this kind of catastrophe is overwhelming. For the individuals involved, it is personally terribly tragic. All of us can only stand by and offer whatever assistance we can. The only blessing in all of this, importantly, is the fact that nobody was injured. However, we may be in for more sorrow. Police are conducting close investigations and are concerned that this fire was started by a person or persons unknown. For a very small and close community, it is catastrophic to realise that perhaps someone is living in their midst who has brought this harm upon the whole community. The role of government here has been clearly sought by the community who, as I said, have turned to all three levels of government in an attempt to pursue support for themselves-and not just private support through the whole community sector but also through the government sectors and those arms of government whose need for involvement has been terribly important. So I do not believe it is inappropriate to speak today on this terrible catastrophe and the concerns of the people in the Shire of Beaudesert, because appropriation bills are about the role of government, the kinds of things we do and do well, the kinds of things which we as a government see as important. I know that we will continue, and I certainly as the local federal member will continue, to a little monitor just what is happening. The state government has played its role, as will the local council. But it is incumbent upon all of us to work together for this community to ensure that we are not overwhelmed by the tragedy and devastation that such a fire has caused. Of course, it will take a very long time for those business people to regain their retail trading and so on. Approaching Christmas, with the end of the drought, before the fire their economic outlook was considerably rosier and they were looking forward to a bright 1996. So it is incumbent upon all of us within government and within the community to work together to ensure that this tragedy does not overwhelm the community.",72
273,Mr FILING,COMMITTEES,"I rise this evening to talk about the City of Wanneroo and, in particular, the sequence of events that surround what is now known as Wanneroo Inc. The circumstances of Wanneroo Inc. arose led by a group of people dominated by the former mayor, Dr Wayne Bradshaw, now convicted of official corruption in August and currently serving a prison sentence of three years. Dr Bradshaw had an almost svengali-like influence over not only his accomplice, Dave King, but Wayde Smith, now member for Wanneroo, but also others like former member and serving councillor, Rita Waters. Dave King was also sentenced to prison for the same offences as Dr Bradshaw and has completed his term of imprisonment, or had completed his term of imprisonment before returning to give evidence in the case of Dr Bradshaw. It has been alleged that this particular case is a one-off case-in other words, nothing else ever happened. But I would like to point out that it was part of a systematic corrupt operation that had two objects: the pursuit of power and profit. As someone who has observed and participated in the milieu of these events, I can only marvel at how easily this state of affairs has come to pass, how the Western Australian Liberal Party has allowed its affairs in its north metropolitan organisation to be dominated by people who had contributed towards what is an organised criminal operation. The definition of organised crime varies from place to place. The German police have defined organised crime as follows: ... the planned commission of criminal offences, determined by the pursuit of profit and power, which, individually or as a whole, are of considerable importance, whenever more than two persons collaborate for a prolonged or indefinite period of time, each with their own appointed tasks: by using commercial or business-like structures; by using violence or other means suitable for intimidation; or by inserting influence on politics, the media, public administration, judicial authorities or the economy. At present two other outstanding matters are being investigated in relation to Wanneroo Inc - two others that we know of. One is in relation to the Belridge Medical Centre where $250,000 was received by Dr Bradshaw, at least part of which was paid over to Wayde Smith, the current serving member for Wanneroo. The other matter is the extortion of $50,000 from the Hooker Corporation to ensure approval for the Woodvale Shopping Centre by the City of Wanneroo. Let us look at the modus operandi which is very similar to the modus operandi used in the case for which Dr Bradshaw and Mr King were convicted. Let us look at it quite realistically. After all, money could not be reasonably demanded for council approval of such developments without the extorting person being reasonably confident of effecting whatever approval or otherwise was required in the council. In other words, nobody in their right mind would hand over money for some sort of planning approval unless they were reasonably confident that either the thing would come to pass or, if they did not pay the money, their approval might get knocked on the head. In other words, councillors would have had to have been sufficiently under the control of whomsoever was proposing this corrupt decision to make sure it passed through council. Let us look at the elements of the definition of organised crime: one, the planned commission of criminal offences. Look at the skating rink, the Pavlinovich matter. The Woodvale Shopping Centre and Belridge Medical Centre each involved the commission of criminal offences. Each involved the preliminary seeking of corrupt payments to ensure council approval of development projects. In other words, the modus operandi in each case was almost identical. The second element is the pursuit of power and profit. Both elements were present in each case where political influence-in other words, the ability to control the numbers in a city council-was an integral ingredient. In each case, this ability is paramount as without it none of the extortion attempts would have been in any way credible. Another factor in this definition is individuand ally or as a whole. In the case for which Bradshaw and King were imprisoned a concert of activity was planned, including the use of a real estate company account to launder the corrupt payments. This included Bradshaw and King and others in the direct handling of the transactions, or would have-and, of course, those who were providing political support to ensure full council support to enable the commission of the offences. The other is political intimidation. Mr Deputy Speaker, I can tell you that that is still going on-and, essentially, in the case of the Liberal Party's organisation, the same old gang are running the show in the north metropolitan region. The Moore and Cowan divisions of the Liberal Party are dominated by fellow travellers and supporters of the gaoled ex-mayor. This gives them extensive power and influence sufficient to protect others and to give Wayne Bradshaw the confidence to carry on as though nothing had happened. This is the modus operandi of his former partner, Wayde Smith, the member for Wanneroo, as well. It also helps to preserve the influence of this group over fundraising activities in the party. Let us look at some examples of intimidation. Arnold Dammers is now the mayor of the city of Wanneroo, a man for whom I have the greatest of respect. He was involved in the white feather incident where he was presented with a white feather at council to try to intimidate him in a physical way at a meeting. Also Wayde Smith, at the time a serving police officer, obtained information from the records section to try to smear Arnold Dammers so that his influence would be reduced in council affairs. In my preselection in 1991 I was accused of somehow conniving with the Labor Party supporters in the area because I sought and had the help of people like Norma Rundle and Bill Marwick-both sitting councillors for whom I still have the greatest respect for being good community operators-who had supported my campaign to get elected in 1990 as the member for Moore, to win the seat from the Labor Party. In my preselection in 1991 questions were asked by Rita Waters Julie and Arnold-now Liberals who are fairly influential-to try to accuse me, to smear me, because of my friendship and involvement with these two people, of somehow being a fellow traveller of the Labor Party. While I was the member for Moore, Ian Maclean wrote to Dr Hewson on 25 October 1990 accusing me, because I was critical of Wayne Bradshaw for failing to invite me to council functions, of helping the Labor Party. He wrote: Dear Dr Hewson, I wish to draw your attention to the actions of one  is assisting the Labour Party in one of their long term aims to retain power in Western Australia. It is my hope that you will be able to dissuade Mr Filing from further public comment that may hinder the re-election of Dr Bradshaw, as any continued outburst would be damaging to both. This man is now a legislative councillor for the Liberal Party in the Legislative Council in Western Australia. He wrote this letter because I had the temerity to complain that Dr Bradshaw, who at the time was a branch president of the Liberal Party, and a mayor of the city of Wanneroo, had excluded me from citizenship ceremonies. I wrote to him informing him that I intended to bring the matter up in the House of Representatives. This fellow, who is now a legislative councillor, is accusing me-by my complaining about the behaviour of Dr Wayne Bradshaw--of somehow helping the Labor Party. Most recently, one of my employees ran for one of the wards of the council. An attempt was made to intimidate him by another councillor candidate, who is now a councillor-Councillor Arthur Taylor. In a statutory declaration, Peter Ramshaw, the fellow who was the candidate, met with Mr Taylor at Mr Taylor's request. He said: Mr Taylor then stated that any failure on my partthat is Mr Ramshaw's partto be seen to be actively supporting the Liberal allied candidatesbearing in mind that there were no preselected candidates of the Liberal Party at all, as would have been the casewould be seen as a black mark on Mr Filing's position. He went on to say: Mr Taylor then claimed that my campaignthat is Mr Ramshaw's campaignwas being orchestrated by Mr Brian Cooperanother person who has come under criticism from Wayne Bradshawand ""bank-rolled"" by a member When I asked him why he thought that, he said that they had heaps of money to splash around the area. This fellow is an absolute madman. His help has been sought by the Liberal Party's powerbrokers in that area. His pamphlet was authorised by Tess Maclean, the wife of Ian Maclean-the person I mentioned earlierand David Northcott, a director of the Ministry of Justice. That is a strange set of circumstances. I refer to the next factor: influence on politics, the media, public administration, judicial authorities and the economy. The modus operandi of Mr Bradshaw on council elections was to run a stable of candidates. He would raise all the money and then dole it out bit by bit. There was the anomalous situation where he offered to raise money for one particular candidate and kept promising that he would provide how-to-vote cards. She insisted, 'I do not want to have a fellow called Mick Brazier' - serving a six-year term, I think, for heroin trafficking now, who was then a Liberal Party personality in the area'to be up in my preferences. He has got to be down the bottom.' What happened on polling day? Along came the how-to-vote cards. She was No.1; Mick Brazier was No.2. That is very strange-the modus operandi of this little group to get political influence to be able to exert political power to achieve their ends towards these objects of profit and power. Look at the way they created new branches in the Liberal Party: the Woodvale branch, created wholly and solely by Dr Bradshaw to be able to get another branch in a preselection area; the Ocean Reef branch, created by Wayde Smith and Rita Waters and others to do the same thing; the North Shore branch, created by the Rob Johnson family; the Joondalup branch, another one to try to help Bradshaw's group out; the Edgewater branch, led by Des Wood, an old mate of Bradshaw's from years ago; and the Padbury branch. The latter two were organised by a young Liberal group in the Western Australian Liberal Party who are basically nothing better than a bunch of the Bond family. of neo-Nazis. In the case of taking over branches, the Quinns Rocks branch was taken over by Wendy Bartlett and Co. Wendy Bartlett, a very close supporter of Senator CrichtonBrowne, coalesced with Wayne Bradshaw and the others to ensure that they got their grip on the area. Mark Mansfield did the South Whitfords branch. He is a self-confessed supporter and admirer of the League of Rights. He thinks it is a wonderful Christian organisation with only the best interests of the country at heart. The Wanneroo branch involved a group of people that included none other than David Cassella-at the time under a charge for deprivation of liberty and assault occasioning bodily harm. Who was he signed up by? None other than Wayde Smith, then the cm duty sergeant in the Western Australian Police Force. What an unusual set of circumstances. In the end Mr Cassella was convicted and sent to prison of those offences. The Connolly branch involved Mrs Debnam, now the selection committee chairman for the Western Australian Liberal Party. She dropped off a load of membership applications at midnight at the house of Brian Cooper-including David Cassella, who could not get into the Wanneroo branch, so they tried to slip him into the Connolly branch and they succeeded. Included in that was the secretary, Rob Johnson, now a state member in the state parliament. A second attempt to take over the Connolly branch late last year included false addresses. An amusing incident occurred on Channel 7 news. A reporter for Channel 7 news tried to hunt one of the addresses down. We saw him standing in the narrow view, and he said, 'We could not find the address, but we estimate that if it really did exist it would be right here.' He put his arms out, the camera panned back and we saw that it was in the middle of an oval. This was the address for one of a group of people who had been trying to shove into the Connolly branch and then found their way into the Edgewater branch as a consequence, including the one who lived on Woodvale oval. The Carine Glades branch was taken over-illegally, unconstitutionally-by Mrs Debnam, a fellow called Bill Stewart, who cooperated with them andsurprise, surprise-my rival for preselection, Paul Stevenage. It was quite an amusing little incident. In the city council, Dr Bradshaw's close supporters-Rita Waters and people like Arthur Taylor-are still there. They are now trying to undermine the councils and are effectively administering the council now. That includes the mayor, Councillor Arnold Dammers, and people like Brian Cooper and others who are trying to do the right thing by the city of Wanneroo residents. Influence in the state government was via Wayde Smith, Rob Johnson, Ian Maclean and Cheryl Edwardes-all of whom, at one stage or another, had close contacts with Dr Bradshaw. I might conclude by recounting one particular incident which ties it all together almost like using a golden thread. In 1990 I was visited by a fellow called Greg Sharpe-at the time he was a partner in North Whitfords Estates-who mentioned in the Kyle report, the original one, the Belridge Medical Centre, which-surprise, surprise-was where Dr Bradshaw supposedly received $250,000. This gentleman came to see me, along with another, to try to persuade me, in the case of state seats of Whitfords and Wanneroo, that I ought not support the people-and I was not a preselection delegate but I was friends of them-who had been the candidates and narrowly lost in 1989 (that was Brian Cooper and Peter Harrop) but that I should support Wayde Smith and Rob Johnson, wonderful candidates who were going to provide great service to the state, and also Barrie MCKinnon, the then leader, and his deputy, Minson, were doing a hopeless job and they should be replaced by Richard Court and Cheryl Edwardes. This was about the time when there was a coalescing of the Bradshaw, Edwardes and Smith group with the Crichton-Browne people in the party. It was interesting that that particular visit came along and I was asked to give my support to what I thought was the wrong thing. I told them so and I said that I would not have a bar of it. From that point onwards, the rug was pulled from under me. In fact, this gentleman, Mr Sharpe, principal of North Whitfords Estates, then participated-and he still was right the way through to the death knock before the preselection to try to get rid of me. After this, we saw the leadership changeover. Unfortunately for Mrs Edwardes, she could not quite get there. She lost. There was a toss of a coin, because there were equal votes between her and the now deputy leader. Smith and Johnson were elected to the state parliament. As I mentioned earlier, Mr Sharpe worked overtime to get rid of me. No wonder the Premier does not want a full judicial inquiry into Wanneroo Inc. You would have to be completely surprised if he did. Wanneroo Inc. players helped him to get where he is. They are amongst his closest supporters. No wonder the Premier did not get rid of Wayde Smith, who was basically confessing left, right and centre after being sprung to telling the most blatant lies about his business relationship with Dr Bradshaw. In fact, amusingly enough, right at this very moment Dr Bradshaw is saying that he did not really have an actual business relationship-they just made it up-so that Smith would seem to have a business relationship in the area that would give him a local flavour for his candidature of the council. I conclude by saying that this episode in the Liberal Party's history in Western Australia is one of the darkest and most unsavoury ones. I must say that the Liberal Party is a great institution. It is a great party. It has a great history. Unfortunately, in the case of Western Australia, its affairs have been dominated and taken over by a bunch of people who should be nowhere near public office. They are a disgrace and the sooner a proper, open judicial inquiry identifies and sets in train the prosecution of those responsible for Wanneroo Inc. the better. That will mean that the decent, honest people who provided good service to the city of Wanneroo over the years-the decent councillors who have worked for nothing, the officers of the city of Wanneroo, those people who have provided services and assistance to the city of Wanneroo-will see the disappearance of that dark cloud that hangs over the city because those responsible for what has gone on will have been identified. In the final analysis, political life must be protected from people who see this as an opportunity to enrich themselves at the expense of others. I would say that there can't be anybody-Labor Party members, Liberals, National Party members, Democrats or whoever-who would disagree with the proposition that the Wanneroo Inc. episode is a dark period for the state of Western Australia and the sooner it is rooted out as a source of corrupt behaviour the better.",74
274,Mr DUNCAN,COMMITTEES,"In the few moments available to me today, I wish to return to an issue which I have shown some interest in in the past-that is, the rights and interests of people who are pet owners in our nation, particularly in our state and in my electorate. ",78
275,Mr DUNCAN,COMMITTEES,"It is a very important issue to a lot of people. It is not simply an issue which is merely the province of local government or state government because, in many ways, the pet owners of this nation are impacted by the decisions of this parliament, as I will describe in a few moments, in relation to the wholesale sales tax on pet food and in various other ways. We as a parliament have an impact on the owners of pets and the lives of those pets. It is interesting to reflect on the sheer number of dollars that are spent in Australia. It is estimated that each year $140 million is spent on caring for dogs. People, particularly in the metropolitan area, spend a lot of money on pets-dogs in particular but cats and other pets as well-and in many instances they do so for therapeutic reasons. Domestic pet animals provide a level of companionship which has been well recognised by the medical profession and others as of critical importance to many people in our modern society who are lonely. I have run across many of my constituents who say that they would prefer to go without food themselves rather than be put in the position of seeing their animals going without. We have to recognise the importance of domestic pets in our society. I believe that that recognition ought not simply be by way of pious platitudes but that we should recognise the importance of domestic animals in a more tangible way. At present large amounts of money, as I have said, are spent on looking after animals. I will refer to statistics from my home state. It is estimated that $2.2 billion is spent nationally, with 60 per cent of that being spent on dogs. So you can see the size of the pet industry in this country. Just over half of the expense was for food, followed by 21 per cent for veterinary bills, 12 per cent for pet care products and eight per cent for other services such as grooming, training and boarding. These are very large amounts of money and, as such, they indicate that Australian consumers have given a very high priority to domestic pets, particularly domestic dogs, from which they gain so much pleasure. I particularly want to grieve today about the fact that pet food which is specifically sold as pet food carries a 22 per cent wholesale sales tax. That means that cans and bags of dried pet food are subject to a 22 per cent tax on top of the cost of production. What galls many pet owners, particularly dog owners, is that red meat sold as pet food which is processed through an abattoir that does not deal with food for human consumption carries a 22 per cent wholesale sales tax. It is subject to the 22 per cent wholesale sales tax. Red meat, including roo meat purchased from a kangaroo shooter, which is sold as pet food to the retailer, is subject still to the 22 per cent wholesale sales tax. However, if the meat is for human consumption and is processed in an abattoir for human consumption, that meat does not carry any wholesale sales tax. So, if you go to the local butcher and you buy scraps of meat, bones or offcuts for your dog or pet, you don't pay the 22 per cent sales tax. This is, in my view, a complete anomaly that should not apply throughout the sales tax laws of this nation. As I said earlier, when one takes into account the enormous amount of companionship and the value that is received by so many people, particularly older people in our community, who have pet dogs and cats, one can see that the way this tax is applied is only anomalous but also quite pernicious in that it does apply to pet food. I think that our humane society, one that recognises the value that our pets are to individual human beings, the therapeutic value of them and the way that they provide companionship to millions of people across our nation who would otherwise be living a much less enriched life, it would be a small concession to abolish the wholesale sales tax on pet food so that the anomaly could be got rid of and so that these people, many of whom are pensioners, would be able to better afford the food for their pets which for them are particularly vital parts of their life. My grievance is we should look at abolishing this sales tax on pet food and that, in doing so, we should recognise the value that pets provide to so many millions of people across this nation by way of companionship.",78
276,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,COMMITTEES,"I am pleased to take part in the debate in the House on Appropriation Bill (No.3) and Appropriation Bill (No.4). I wish to speak about the Better Cities program, which has been a significant charge on budget outlays for a number of years. To date, $1.1 billion has been spent or allocated for this program, including $149 million in the current 1995-96 budget. As members well know, I have expressed significant concern about the administration by the Minister for Housing and Regional Development (Mr Howe) of Better Cities funding. I think it is important that the basis for those concerns is placed on the parliamentary record. It is a cause for great concern-and shame on the minister-that the program has as a whole never been the subject of external review or performance audit since it commenced. I am pleased that the Australian National Audit Office has decided to initiate a performance audit of this program, because $816 million of public money has been spent on this Better Cities mark 1 program. It has brought benefits to many areas of Australia, but when you are spending public money of that magnitude, because this is a specifically targeted program, it should be subject to not performance audit. Although the audit office is looking at the program at present, I wonder in whether we will see the results of that audit prior to the next federal election. I guess it depends when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) calls that election as to whether the audit office will have sufficient time to complete its investigation into the manner in which those funds have been used. The first Better Cities program, commonly referred to as Better Cities mark 1, commenced in 1991. The stated objective of the program was to allow for cooperative planning by the Commonwealth, states and territories and local government for integrated that urban development. However, it has become increasingly clear that the government has used the program to fund a pork-barrelling exercise on a massive scale. Eighty-four per cent of federal electorates to receive Better Cities mark I funding were in electorates held by the ALP. Another II per cent of electorates to receive Better Cities funding were marginal coalition seats. Only two coalition electorates that were considered safe received Better Cities funding. Not one Better Cities project in New South Wales or South Australia was located in a coalition electorate.",79
277,Mr KERR,COMMITTEES,You don't have any seats in New South Wales.,79
278,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,COMMITTEES,"The Minister for Justice interjects across the table here. The coalition has in fact 16 seats in New South Wales. So he is obviously not even in touch with the electoral system. The point is that, if you were a Labor mate, you would have received Better Cities funding. Of the electorates to receive Better Cities funding, 84 per cent were Labor electorates. When it comes to using public money and benefiting Labor electorates, the Minister for Housing and Regional Development has done it very well. He makes the former Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Ros Kelly, look like an amateur. In defending his record on this issue, the minister likes to point out that the program operated as a partnership between the three levels of government: federal, state and local. The original guidelines clearly said that was the intention of this program. But let me read to the House what local government has said about this program. In a letter to the minister's department earlier this year, the Australian Local Government Association delivered a scathing assessment of the Better Cities mark I program. According to the Australian Local Government Association, which represents local government in Australia at a federal level, 'political considerations were the major determinants of funding allocations' under the Better Cities program. Let me repeat this so it does sink in. I hope the Minister for Justice, at the table, is listening. The Australian Local Government Association said that 'political considerations were the major determinants of funding allocations' under the Better Cities program. The association also said that the Better Cities mark 1 guidelines were used to exclude certain projects. This is the crux of the whole issue. The Better Cities guidelines are so broad that they can fund just about anything. If the minister wants a project for a mate, the project will qualify.  it before.",79
279,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,COMMITTEES,"They are experts at it on the other side of the House. As my parliamentary colleague interjects, they do it all the time. Unfortunately, the great sadness is that they are using taxpayers' money. ",80
280,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,COMMITTEES,"That is so often the case. But, if the project is in a safe coalition seat, it will be lucky to get to first base. Railway stations, roads, public housing, health centres, rail lines, waterworks, kerbs and footpaths-whatever you like-under the minister's guidance Better Cities would fund it, provided that you were fortunate enough to live in an ALP electorate. The comments I have quoted from local government were a summary of comments received from state local government associations around the country. They are comments which must be viewed and considered by this House with alarm. Now that one of the partners of governments in this country has blown the whistle on the rorting of this program, the minister certainly owes the federal parliament an explanation. Local government's views cannot be dismissed as those of an uninformed bystander. According to the minister in a media release on 17 October 1995: Better Cities is operated in a disciplined manner in a partnership with State and Local governments. The minister surely now cannot deny that local government does not have evidence for its claims.",80
281,Mr KERR,COMMITTEES,"I do, absolutely. I absolutely deny it.",80
282,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Mr Rocher)The Minister for Justice will remain quiet.,80
283,Mr KERR,COMMITTEES,I was invited to comment,80
284,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"If the minister once again interjects, I will deal with him. That is a serious and firm warning.",80
285,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,COMMITTEES,"I have written to the Commonwealth Auditor-General asking that the Better Cities performance audit examine the manner in which program funds have been allocated. In terms of the amounts of money involved and the extent of bias, this program dwarfs anything which occurred in the sports rorts affair. Let me repeat to the House that $816 million was allocated for the Better Cities mark 1 program. Time and time again this government has been caught out using public expenditure programs for perceived electoral gain, and Better Cities is just another example. In response to a question at Senate estimates earlier this year, an official from the minister's department advised, 'We'-that is the Commonwealth-'negotiate at official level to see which areas we are interested in doing work in and which area the states or territories are interested in doing work in.' The opposition has asked the minister's department in the estimates process exactly how the minister decides which projects he has an interest in. I would suggest that a well thumbed copy of Malcolm MACKerras's electoral pendulum is an indispensable part of that process. On 25 September the opposition asked the minister on notice for information about all successful and unsuccessful applications for the Commonwealth Better Cities funding program, but we still await his reply. Quite clearly, we in the opposition would like more information about this critical matter. We on this side of the House are wondering what the minister has to hide. We are genuine in our concerns about the manner in which the funds for the Better Cities program have been allocated. We agree that many good projects have been funded by this program, but it is a fact that of the electorates that have received Better Cities funding, 84 per cent of them are Labor electorates. Parliament can judge for itself what has been going on. Whilst we have seen some very worthwhile projects funded under this scheme, it is time that the minister gave us the information. I trust that we will not have to wait much longer for the response from the minister. The real question should be whether the $1.1 billion that has been allocated under this program has been spent as fairly and efficiently as possible. The opposition awaits the Auditor-General's report with great interest.",80
286,Mr ANDREW,COMMITTEES,"Wakefield) (5.57 p.m.)Recognising the restraints that have been placed on opposition members by the length of the speaker's list and the request of the whips to be brief, I do not intend to take advantage of my 20 minutes. However, I intend to address some comments made to the House during the adjournment debate last Wednesday by the member for Lilley (Mr Swan) when he was reflecting on the CRA dispute at Weipa and outlining some of the things that he felt most strongly about in that dispute. I wonder if I might take a paragraph or two from the member for Lilley's speech and then make observations from my perspective as a former and current-in a much smaller way--employer. The member for Lilley said these words: The sad thing is that it is not just CRA that wants to abolish the award system, it is also the intent of the Liberal and National parties in this House. They are content to work hand in hand with rogue companies like CRA to destroy the basis of our industrial relations system. That is precisely what Richard Court has been doing in Western Australia, what Jeff Kennett has been doing in Victoria and what the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) would do nationally if he were elected to power. They are absolutely and completely hostile to the award system and genuine enterprise bargaining based on negotiation and the collective involvement of unions. They want to rip away from ordinary workers safety and security in terms of living standards. I want to take the opportunity in this debate to utterly refute those remarks made by the member for Lilley. He has totally misrepresented all that the opposition stands for on industrial relations. He has picked up the popular line, the easily sold line in the CRA dispute, of equal work for equal pay. He has implied that any effort by the coalition to free up the award system in Australia is in some way crudely exploitive. Having been an employer-and still in a small way employing people-I am conscious of the fact that I know what I want, and one of the things I do not want is to be in any way exploitive. In common with most employers in Australia, I do not expect people to work for as little as possible. The reality is that I am more than happy to pay above the award, particularly when a job is being done not only as I wish it to be done but by an employee who shows some initiative. What I want from my employees-and I am not unique in this regard-is a higher living standard. I am very happy to pay more than the award to achieve precisely that standard. Contrary to what the member for Lilley has attested, the Liberal and National parties are not intent on destroying or abolishing the award system nor do they seek in any way, to pick up his words 'to break down genuine enterprise bargaining based on negotiation and the collective involvement of unions'. I understand how appealing it is to run the line of equal pay for equal work and I believe that people ought to be more than adequately remunerated for what they do. But if you take an industry with which I am familiar-the fruit industry-the large majority of horticultural crops in Australia are now harvested on a contract basis. If I applied the argument of equal pay for equal work in those harvesting conditions, I would have a situation where I would say that a contractor ought not to be paid more for picking more. The simple reality is that what I would do by introducing an equal pay for equal work provision for contract fruit picking would be to deny the most productive, the most progressive, and the most contented of fruit pickers the opportunity to do what they want to do. As I indicated, most horticultural crops picked on a contract basis and the pickers are remunerated on the basis of what they pick. They are the people who choose-I emphasise that-that technique for harvesting the crop because clearly their salary reflects their greater productivity. In an electorate like yours, Mr Deputy Speaker, you would know that exactly the same analogy could be used in the wool industry where shearers deliberately choose to shear sheep on a contract basis. Of course it is harder work, but they choose to do it because they will be remunerated more for the work that they are doing. As a result, they feel that they have had a productive day, that they have made a contribution, and that they have been an effective member of the nation in making that contribution to the nation's total revenue base. More than that, they have not been disadvantaged in any way nor have those working alongside them been disadvantaged. My party, in common with its partner the National Party, believes that people who belong to trade unions ought not to be disadvantaged and believes that freedom of association should be a characteristic of the way in which we go about structuring our industrial relations system. We believe that people should be free to belong to unions or not to belong to them as they choose. That is not implied at all in the comments made by the member for Lilley. The fact is that people in the coalition recognise the role that unions play and are happy to see their employees, if they so choose, being part of the trade union movement in Australia. There is something quite ironic about the plea by members opposite in relation to the CRA dispute. The irony is that, while they have been indignant that people who went into individual bargaining would receive more remuneration, some of those same members opposite in the last decade have been guilty of promoting arrangements where unionists were to be advantaged over non-unionists, where there was to be a no ticket, no start system, and where some of the benefits won for their members were, in their words, to be denied to non-union members. I see that as exploitive. I see that as an affront. I claim that the coalition's total involvement in industrial are relations reform has been to create a less exploitive Australia. Coalition members and government members share a lot of things in common. We all believe in a better Australia. The majority of us are parents and therefore have children in the work force. The majority of us, therefore, have a vested interest in a work force which has in place safety rails which mean that people cannot be exploited. We share in common a detestation of exploitation. Because we have children in the work force, we want to ensure that the employers treat their employees sensibly because those employees may well be our children. I have children in the work force. I am not extraordinary in that regard. Clearly, I am most indignant if I think my children are being exploited in any way by an employer. With student children working in the hospitality industry, I am conscious of how easily that exploitation can occur. I see it as an affront to not only me and my party but also all coalition members for the government to suggest that we are in some way pleased to see exploitative arrangements in place and are prepared to tear down existing award structures and, as it were, send children up chimneys in a pre-Shaftesbury approach to industrial relations. The simple reality is that I am committed to ensuring that employers in Australia treat their employees well. I have no monopoly on that. That sentiment is shared by all members of the House of Representatives. That was not the only statement made by the member for Lilley in that adjournment debate. He also went on to make these comments about the eRA Weipa dispute: Behind this dispute is the central question of the right of ordinary Australians working in their jobs to collectively organise together to protect and advance their wages and conditions so they can maintain their living standards. The choice, it starkly, is between a take it or leave it 'sign here or no job' ... Frankly, the coalition believes that Australians have the right to collectively organise together to protect and advance their wages and conditions and that they also have the right outside of collective bargaining to organise under an enterprise bargaining system or an individual bargaining system an arrangement that best suits them, an arrangement that allows them to be flexible in their working conditions and find working conditions that suit their lifestyle or their demands and needs at a particular time. That is why in the horticultural industry contract arrangements exist-so that fruit pickers can choose to start early in the morning, to knock off in the heat of the day, to leave at a particular time to collect children from school, to have their spouse join them or leave them as suits them and be rewarded on the basis of precisely what they have done. In our industrial relations package there is no intention to deny Australians any of the advantages they currently enjoy. Those things that have been negotiated under awards stand in place under the coalition industrial relations policy. What the coalition stands for is the opportunity for Australians to enter into the sorts of employment arrangements and the sorts of working arrangements that best suit their circumstances and to do so without being treated as if they have been deliberately exploited. In a nation which faces unprecedented levels of unemployment, we as a parliament face the challenge of finding arrangements that best suit both employers and employees, arrangements that no longer dissuade employers from engaging people. Just prior to coming into the chamber I was involved in a telephone conversation with an employer in my area who was frustrated because he had jobs to do and he was unable to find people to do those jobs because of the sorts of constraints that were being placed on him by the existing award system. All that we have called for as a coalition in our industrial relations policy is the sort of flexibility that allows employers to take on employees without those employees being exploited and to put with those employees being given every worldopportunity to be as productive as possible and to be appropriately rewarded for that level of production.",81
287,Mr THOMSON,COMMITTEES,"Wentworth) (6.09 p.m)I rise to take part in the debate on these appropriation bills with some dismay because, to put it bluntly, what the government is doing today is coming to the taxpayers via the House of Representatives and asking for more money. It is coming and saying, 'We had a budget that the House approved but we have blown it. We have gone over and we want some more.' Just an hour ago the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General, the honourable member for Makin (Mr Duncan), chose to speak about pets when speaking on these bills. That reminds me of a cat I have at home that behaves very much like the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley), whose name is on the second reading speech of these bills. When I feed my cat it often comes back five minutes later with a resentful look on its face and asks for more. This is precisely the demeanour of the Deputy Prime Minister in coming to the House of Representatives with the appropriation bills asking for some hundreds of millions more when we have already granted approval for a budget this year. He says there is extra and he says it with a resentful look on his face much like my cat when it comes asking for more Whiskas. Mr Andrew-It is a well fed cat. Mr THOMSONIt is a well fed cat. In fact, you might say it is drawing a long bow to put the adjective 'feline' on the Deputy Prime Minister. One of the advantages of sitting on the back bench is that you have the opportunity to observe members on the government front bench. You observe their demeanour and their physical appearance and there is a wide variety in that. You go from the birdlike appearance of the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee), up one end of the front bench, to the happy demeanour of the self-styled Minister Assisting the Treasurer for Superannuation (Mr Sciacca) and his loud neckties, to the svelte sartorial appearance of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). But, when my gaze rests on the Deputy Prime Minister, I am more inclined to use the adjective 'bovine'. In fact, it is rarely the animal kingdom that occurs to me. I think more of sports. Perhaps sumo wrestling is a more appropriate arena in which to describe him. I am sure that is sailing a little close to the wind in parliamentary terms, but I will leave my remarks there. In Appropriation Bill (No.4) we have a total of $32 million proposed in connection with the proposed development of the Fox studios at the New South Wales showground. That site, the Sydney showground as it is better known, sits on the border of my electorate of Wentworth just on the edge of Centennial Park. Despite the fact that I do not represent the residents who live immediately beside the showground, sufficient concern, grave concern indeed, about the propriety of this proposed development has arisen among the residents who I represent in this House. Therefore, I feel obliged to say a few things on their behalf. I understand that the opposition has in mind some amendments to the appropriation bill, and I will perhaps reserve some of my more detailed remarks for the consideration in detail stage. Suffice to say that a member of the state parliament of New South Wales has referred the process of this deal to the Independent Commission Against Corruption, ICAe. She has asked the commission to investigate the due process aspect of this whole deal. I believe, and I say quite bluntly on behalf of my electors who share my concern about the propriety of this deal, that the words 'due process' should include an examination of what other sites there are in eastern Sydney that were examined by the company before they arrived by prime ministerial fiat, I dare to suggest, at the show ground as their preferred site. In examining whether due process was followed, I believe we deserve an explanation of why they rejected those other sites in favour of the showground. There are sites such as the naval stores depot at Zetland, not two par five holes away from the showground. There is the rifle range at Maroubra or Malabar, which is always a hot potato and I understand is proposed for another use, although the sporting shooters of the eastern region will violently object to that. There are of course the Randwick barracks, which are just below the boundary of my electorate to the south. There seem to be various places in this region where the making of cinematic films could take place without any particular disturbance, but I am told by people in the company that ambient noise is a problem in some of those sites, at Zetland in particular. As part of the due process I would like this to be explained in a public fashion. I would also like to ask that, when due process is examined, it should include an inquiry into whether the company disclosed to the state government of New South Wales and to the federal government the scale of the entertainment element of its proposal and whether, by not disclosing it to those governments, those governments were perhaps wrongly influenced in their decision to remove the project from the normal planning processes. That is the chief concern of the electors of Wentworth. The other ones relate to the possible environmental aspects and the chances for the disruption of lives in that area. I believe they should come out in some form in the planning process, in whatever form it takes. The whole deal of the show grounds is symptomatic of the Prime Minister's contempt for the views of the average citizen. I see that he is prone to dealing with only very powerful people, with the big folk, and to giving companies and semi-government authorities unfettered and unrestricted powers. This has struck me very particularly in the case of the telecommunications characters-Telstra and Optus. When I picked up the Sydney Morning Herald this morning, I saw a copy of an edited speech given by John Pilger, who is an Australian, a journalist of very left-wing hue, a master of the conspiracy theory and someone with whom I could barely imagine myself having occasion to agree. But in this speech he said a few things which I believe are worthy of repetition in the House and with which I find myself in agreement. He said that a story in the Financial Review in September gave us an answer to the question: what will the information age bring us? He quoted the Financial Review as saying: The information revolution, far from delivering media ownership diversity, is shoring up concentrathat tion of ownership. The article went on to cite the mergers of the Disney empire with the American ABC by network and that of Times Warner with different mettle. Turner Broadcasting-the purveyor of the CNN broadcast that puts so many of us to sleep with its narcotic repetition of very ordinary news. The article noted a few days after that was published in the Financial Review that Mr Murdoch gained control of pay TV in Australia. It may be a little premature  cause Optus Vision has not yet reached sufficient households in Australia to provide proper competition and to determine whether or not the so-called joint venture between Foxtel and the taxpayers' company, Telstra,  out that in this joint venture Telstra proposes to spend $3Y2 billion of public money on a cable network for its private sector partner. He said: In other words, Australians are paying 10 per cent more on their telephone bills in order to build pay TV network for the exclusive use of Murdoch. There you have it. There is a demonstration of the deleterious consequences of the Prime Minister's tendency to deal only with the most powerful folk and to not listen to the opinions of the ordinary citizens. This often results in a sense of alienation among ordinary people. They feel alienated from government generally, from big business, from banks, certainly from trade unions, and from various government funded lobby groups. It is quite weird that a Labor government can stand validly accused in this House of favouring banks, media moguls and big business generally, while members of the Liberal Party like me have to stand here and flay their skin for doing that. We are supposed to be the party of the plutocrats and the rich. Quite clearly we are not. The truth is that a political philosophy that debases the rights of individuals to exercise freedom of choice inevitably leads to this form of elitist government. The Prime Minister gives every sign of agreeing with very anti-democratic and elitist proposition put forward by Bismarck, who said that universal suffrage is government of a house its nursery. Well, the opposition is of a That said, and with perhaps an opportunity in the adjournment debate this evening or tomorrow to say a little bit more about the frightful consequences of overspending--of piece dissaving, as the government's citrus flavoured superannuation guru Mr FitzGerald described the budget deficit-I will yield to on my good friend Mr Neville.",83
288,Mr NEVILLE,COMMITTEES,"I do not easily sacrifice my right to speak on a number of areas of policy and finance such as this debate on the appropriation bills invites. But there are matters of high principle that demand the attention of all members. One such principle is the delivery of justice to all Australians. There is a case in Queensland which gives rise to the proposition that access to justice may exist in theory but does not exist in practice. In September 1989 state public servant the Peter Coyne, then manager of the John Oxley Mr Correctional Centre, became the subject of charges in respect of his conduct and management of the centre. The charges were laid by members of staff and the union industrial officer, Ms Janine Walker, who had carriage of the charges. Coyne was given a brief outline of these charges, but was continually denied access to the specific written charges. This was the first denial of justice in that he as an accused was not given the specific details of the charges against him. The Cooper government initiated an inquiry under retired magistrate Noel Heiner. One the terms of reference was to inquire into report back on the specific written complaints made against Coyne. Even at that stage Coyne had not received a copy of the written charges-again questionable and in breach of the Queensland Public Service Management and Employment Act, regulation 65. Before the inquiry had delivered its findings, the Goss government took office December 1989. The inquiry, though constituted, did not give the participants immunity from prosecution. The Goss government closed the inquiry before it could be finalised. Heiner delivered documents, his notes, tapes and copies of statements in a sealed box to the government. Coyne initiated legal proceedings to obtain access to the documents. On 8 February 1990 served notice that they sought access under regulation 65. The government was given seven days to respond. On 14-15 February, because no response had been received, Coyne instructed his solicitor to serve notice that he intended to commence court proceedmands. ings for access. On 16 February the Crown informed Coyne's solicitors that it was still considering the request of the 8th and that advice to that date was 'interim'. In the meantime, and to gain cabinet privishred lege, the documents were delivered to On the 16th, cabinet was advised by the crown solicitor that the documents would not attract cabinet privilege and that access could not be denied. The cabinet, which included the Attorney-General and two trained solicigeneral tors, undoubtedly knew that it was dealing with material that constituted potential and foreseeable evidence. While still leaving Coyne, through his solicitors, in the that the documents were secure and that the Crown was still considering his request, cabinet proceeded to the secret destruction the documents. This was achieved by advising the state archivist on 23 February that the documents were no longer pertinent or required for the public record. Cabinet sought the archivist's 'urgent' approval on the same day. I ask: if they were not required, why the urgency to destroy them? Justice again, I ask? It has subsequently been revealed that of cabinet was advised that the documents could and be the subject of litigation-something already known by Minister Warner, the responsible minister for that department. The documents were secretly destroyed on 23 March",85
289,Mr KERR,COMMITTEES,"I do not want to interrupt, but I seek the member's assurance that these matters are no longer the subject of litigation.",86
290,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,HOD. N.B. in Reid}-I think the minister is raising the legally question of the sub judice rule.,86
291,Mr NEVILLE,COMMITTEES,"As I understand it, the matters are not the subject of litigation. They have been the subject of a CJC inquiry and two Senate inquiries, but to my knowledge they are not currently before a court.",86
292,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Thank you for his solicitors your assurance.,86
293,Mr NEVILLE,COMMITTEES,"The documents were secretly destroyed on 23 March 1990, despite the fact that two weeks earlier the directorgeneral, in writing, advised Coyne that the Crown was still considering the legal deAgain, an extraordinary situation. Mr Linderberg, who was representing Mr Coyne as his union delegate, during a phone conversation with the minister's private secretary inadvertently learned of the plan to the documents. He challenged her, and cabinet. the phone call ended abruptly. The minister insisted that Mr Linderberg's union, the Public Officers Association, remove Mr Linderberg from the case. The then secretary, Don Martindale, removed him and took carriage of the case himself. He took no action to prevent the shredding, and six weeks later dismissed Linderberg, princibelief pally for his handling of the case. Time does not permit an examination of all the interim steps, but the CJC was involved of inconclusively on two occasions. The matter was also referred to the Cooke inquiry into union activities in May 1991 but it, too, was closed down by the Goss government before the shredding could be investigated. Then followed the 1994 Senate public interest whistleblowing inquiry. That inquiry called unanimously for the Goss government to review the Linderberg case. But, not surprisingly, it refused to do so. Then, at the behest of Senator Parer, the Senate established the Senate select committee into unresolved whistleblower cases. Not surprisingly, the Heiner inquiry became its main term of reference. The Senate committee found that the documents should have been retained and that the Crown should have heeded its role as a model litigant. It described the shredding as an exercise in poor judgment. In the course of the second Senate inquiry, eminent Australian jurist Ian Callinan QC argued that the CJC's narrow interpretation of judicial proceedings was too significant to ignore and that there were clear and compelling reasons for the case to be investigated. On Friday, 17 November my colleague the state member for Gladstone, Liz Cunningham, tabled a petition in the Queensland state parliament on behalf of Mr Kevin Linderberg. I seek leave of the House to have the contents of this document included in the record. Leave not granted.",86
294,Mr NEVILLE,COMMITTEES,"I find that extraordinary, especially with the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) at the table and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) and the Chief Government Whip (Mr Leo MCLeay) on the front bench. We were lectured in this parliament not more than a week or so ago about the responsibilities for and the importance of petitions. We were told the story of the Halden petition on behalf of Easton to the Western Australian upper house. We were told that that duty was sacrosanct and could not be avoided. What I seek in this House is purely to mirror what has happened in the Queensland parliament in one of the most extraordinary cases in our judicial history--one that has not really ever come to court because of a number of pre-emptive moves by government and inquiries. It is extraordinary. I do not pontificate on the right or wrong of this man's particular role, but he had every right to have his day in court-something that has been denied him for six years. Do not talk to us and lecture us about the sanctity of the Halden petition. There were unforeseen consequences there which we on both sides of the House might concede. However, this is a case where there was ample evidence presented to two Senate inquiries, two investigations by the CJC, the Heiner inquiry and the Cooke inquiry. All these leave the matter inconclusive. The man then took the last step in the process by presenting this to his state parliament. I seek as a federal member to mirror in this House the actions of one of my state members and place this very important document, this petition, on the record. In conclusion, not only do I find this process extraordinary but I think it will be interesting to see whether the Queensland parliament, when this matter comes before them, will treat Kevin Linderberg's petition with the same sanctity as they claim was required of Halden in presenting the Easton petition. Let it be on their heads. I will watch that with great care. I will not let this matter rest until Mr Linderberg has his day in court.",87
295,Mr BEAZLEY,COMMITTEES,"The second reading processes on all three bills which have been debated cognately here will be concluded when I conclude my remarks. While it is possible to move second reading amendments and the like it will not be possible to speak to them again. It is our intention then to go to the consideration in detail stage, where required, on the various bills. There will be an opportunity for some further discussion when that course of action is pursued. I thank all members who participated in this debate but do not agree with the sentiments of all. There has been an opportunity for members to do a round robin of their electorates. That is the sort of opportunity an appropriation bill does provide. I have no quarrel with that. There have been a couple of points of substantive disagreement with what has been proposed in these appropriations. It is with some of those that I intend to quarrel whilst giving notice of the intentions of the government on some of the amendments that have been suggested for the consideration phase. The most controversial area has been the decision by the government to follow the normal tradition of ensuring that persons in a ministerial situation who, by virtue of that situation, are challenged by a royal commission process receive the assistance to which they are entitled. That, of course, includes all forms of assistance, including a right to challenge whether or not that royal commission ought to be sitting at all and whether or not all the matters that it is supposed to deliberate upon ought to be properly deliberated upon by it. We have had a royal commission in Western Australia which, by virtue of the fact that it has got away with it, has overthrown several centuries worth of Westminster tradition on cabinet confidentiality and multiple centuries worth of Westminster tradition on a member's relationship with constituents and the relationship of that in a petition. This has proceeded entirely as a result of expediency. The effect of that will now appear in the green books that we see on the table as a set of precedents which will reverberate long and loud down the corridors of power in this country and make a substantial mockery, particularly in the area of cabinet confidentiality, of our Westminster form of government. Cabinets do not usually amount to much in presidential systems. That is certainly the experience in the United States, where ministers operated effectively in a one to one relationship with the President and with such ice to skate on as various congress committees give them. In the Westminster system that cabinet confidentiality is everything. The capacity to provide a coherent government out of the parliamentary system is absolutely central. We have a set of derisory opinions from Mr Marks. He has made an absolute mockery of this area in the propositions he put forward in which he massively expanded what was previously a very narrow and well defined legal area, an area which made it absolutely clear that cabinet confidentiality should be breached only when serious criminal matters are under consideration by a court in this country. That was expanded, in the opinion of Mr Marks, to incorporate just feeling like knowing about something. At the end of the day, that type of applied sentiment will make life very difficult. The opposition has moved an amendment which cuts out part of the propositions that the government has put forward-that is, the amount of the fees charged by the lawyers for Dr Lawrence in their appearances before the High Court. It is an amount, from recollection, of some $243,000. The opposition has left the rest unchallenged in its amendment. Without accepting in principle its right to move that, the government nevertheless is going to accept that amendment when Mr Prosser moves it. We will move a series of consequential amendments because, whilst Mr Prosser's amendment is clear in a schedule to the bill, to simply move that and not move the other amendments would make a mess of the rest of the bill. They all mean the same thing but there are a fairly substantial number of items that would have to be amended to incorporate the consequences of the opposition amendment. We will accept the amendment whilst not conceding the principle that has been amply used in a challenge before a superior court. Robin Gray, at a period of time when he stood in better stead with the Liberal Party in Tasmania than he now apparently does, availed himself of this principle. He received assistance to tackle before the state Supreme Court the royal commission which was the bane of his life. Former Premier Nick Greiner received assistance to similarly attack ICAC, a permanent, ongoing royal commission, in effect, in New South Wales. He went to the Supreme Court there. There was no difficulty with the various Liberal governments at the time accepting those things as something that ought to be publicly funded, on the argument that substantial issues were at stake that, in those instances-in their view-went to what were matters of substance in the processes of Westminster government. Accordingly, they have supported them. We have to recollect that we are dealing with this item now, and after we conclude these items later tonight they will go to the Senate on Wednesday and Thursday. The Senate quite clearly is having difficulty coping with the amount of legislation before it. We discover in the Senate about four different views about what approach ought to be taken in this area. The Greens' position is not determined. The Australian Democrats believe that, while all areas of the activity ought to be assisted, that ought to be done under a certain set of principles-they are very hard to quantify. The position of the  in this debate. In order to facilitate, if possible, the passage of the appropriations through the Senate by the conclusion of business probably some time on Friday this week, it is clearly important that, where we have a whole set of different views in the Senate on this matter, these views are going to have to be qualified one way or another. The propensity of the Senate is to take an infinite amount of time over such matters and to find it very difficult to arrive at a conclusion without consulting us again. We are getting to a time of the year where that is not seriously possible. Therefore, it is the government's intention  will mean that the government will not be able to provide public assistance to Dr Lawrence in the provision of the fees outlined in the course of the legislation. A substantial precedent will be set by that process. It is a precedent that we accept only on the basis of contemporary expediency-not principle. It is a view that the government would, in the normal course of events, challenge but cannot do so in any sensible way in the time available. Another second reading amendment has been circulated on the same bill. We will not  It goes to a desire to set aside the amounts of money that are going to the showground, as well as again addressing the question I have just referred to. I cannot for the life of me see why the amounts of money going to the showground, irrespective of the deliberations of ICAC, ought to be held up. The funds are simply going to the reconstruction or repair of an area which, irrespective of whether or not people are cheerful about the tender processes, will have to be done anyway. They do not relate to the tender itself. They are not resources going to the successful tenderer. Those resources will still remain in the public domain. We will not be supporting the second reading amendment on Appropriation Bill (No.4). We will not oppose the amendment moved in relation to the assistance to the Minister for Human Services and Health but will move subsequent consequential amendments upon that. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Beazley) read a third time. APPROPRIA TION BILL (No.4) 1995-96 Second Reading Consideration resumed from 26 October, on motion by Mr O'Keefe: That the bill be now read a second time.  That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House: (1) welcomes and supports the appropriation in respect of the upgrading of the New South Wales Showground facilities but notes that certain matters in respect of the tender process for the use of the Showgrounds site have been referred to the Independent Commission Against Corruption (lCAC) and in these circumstances is of the opinion that the Government should not disburse these moneys until such time as ICAC has publicly confirmed that due process was obselVed; and (2) condemns the use of public moneys proposed in the Bill to fund the legal challenge to the Marks Royal Commission by the Minister for Human SelVices and Health"".

I am pleased to see that the government is accepting the amendment to schedule 2 of will Appropriation Bill (No.4) 1995-96. As the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) mentioned earlier, it has been the wish of the coalition that the payments by the government for Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) to try to shut down the royal commission not be supported. All other $45 payments will be.

296,Mr WAKELIN,COMMITTEES,"As the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) said, Appropriation Bill (No.4) provides one with an opportunity to visit one's electorate. Before I do that, I will touch on what I believe is the nub of it. We are preparing to go to the people again as the dose of the 37th Parliament draws near. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating), when he became Prime Minister in late 1991, promised the Australian people that he would deal with them honestly, that he would tell the truth and that he would not gild the lily. The government, successfully as it turned out, in 1993 ran a campaign where it promised increased employment and no increase in taxation. That was the nub of the government's successful re-election on 13 March 1993. We have had nearly three years experience ""556 of this Keating government to make our assessment. It is entirely appropriate for an opposition to look at part of the score card. I start with taxation revenue in the reign of Paul Keating as Prime Minister. In 1992-93, $89 billion worth of taxation revenue was collected. In 1995-96, it will be $119 billion. the That is a nominal percentage growth in taxation revenue over that period of 33.3 per cent. Net Commonwealth debt in 1992 was billion. In 1995, it came to $97 billion. the Nominal percentage growth in Commonwealth not be debt from 1992-95 was 130 per cent. Total capital outlays by the Commonwealth government have gone down from a positive of nearly $4 billion in 1992-93 to a negative of $3.5 billion in 1995-96. So there were nominal percentage changes in capital outlays minus 233 per cent. From 1987-88 to 1995-96, we have sold $8.6 billion worth of national assets. To summarise, we have had a 33 per cent in revenue, a 130 per cent increase in net Commonwealth debt and a 233 per cent drop in capital outlays. At the same time we have sold $8.6 billion worth of assets based on that famous claim, the l-a-w tax cut, which is due 1 January 1996 and which we know never happen. The tax revenue increases of the excise have impacted particularly in 37th parliament, and they impact on an electorate like mine in a most unjust way. The wholesale sales tax, the company tax, the increased tax on cars, the Medicare levy and the proposed tax on homes, which was defeated, thankfully, are all part of that revenue. Essentially, the credible polls are telling us that there is currently a 12 per cent gap between the parties, though no-one believes that that will stay quite where it is. When the last figures were taken there was an eight per cent gap--we were eight per cent ahead while we were four per cent behind at the same time in the cycle the last time the figures were taken. The government will try anything to denigrate our credibility and to improve its own. I listened to the Lawrence debate today with total dismay. I do not have anything constructive to add but I just cannot believe that the standard of government can sink to this level. The government has made many promises to regional Australia, but none more damaging, I believe, than its lack of delivery on youth unemployment. (Extension of time granted) On the matter of regional youth unemployment, we have got to a stage where the government has actually banned the publication of local figures. It is said that are too volatile. It is little wonder that those figures are not allowed to be published. If you look at my own electorate-after all, it is 90 per cent of the state of South Australia-the regional unemployment rate in the northern and western division is 47.8 per cent. The government said it went to the people last time on jobs and not increased taxation. The sad reality is that Labor has no plan to create jobs for our children. Under Labor's policy, Australians face a future of greater uncertainty. I have read the balance sheet. Australians need to make their judgment, and I hope they will make it based on those facts and not on the glib one liners that we will have to get used to over the next three to four months. I will speak about my electorate just briefly. The Prime Minister made a promise on 6 December 1992 that he would put a Commonwealth dollar alongside every dollar the voluntary agencies like St Vincent de Paul and the Salvation Army collected for their Christmas appeals. This promise, of course, has not been kept. In Grey there are 6,640 families-that is, 25.2 per cent of the families living there-who earn annual incomes of less than $16,000. That is the greatest number of families anywhere in the country who earn below that amount of money. Yet, we produce 50 per cent of the exports of South Australia. It is little wonder that after 25 years they have turned to a Liberal member to represent them. I repeat: 6,640 families, the most families in the whole continent, are on the lowest incomes and yet the Prime Minister tells us that he is reaching down to help us. I was one of those families who was earning $16,000 for most of my working life. I do not want him to reach down to help me; I want him to reach out to help me perhaps with some decent policies. He might acknowledge the effect of taxation, the effect of excise, the effect of the wholesale sales tax, and the effect of small business on the absolute inability to deliver on employment and increased employment. Let us not forget the 47 per cent of youth unemployment in my electorate. Agriculture is one of our proudest industhey tries. The Prime Minister visited Eyre Peninsula only a few months ago. After nearly 10 years of high interest rates, commodity prices, withdrawal of drought funding and IEDs, et cetera, the Prime Minister visited and offered about $1.4 million per annum over three years. Big deal! One community alone on the Eyre Peninsula will pay that in income tax in the next good year. It has become virtually unpopular to talk about savings in this country, yet this government is determined to constantly erode the thrift of this nation. It is quite remarkable that we have allowed ourselves to get, and I repeat, an increase in our Commonwealth debt of 130 per cent since Paul Keating became Prime Minister. At the same time he ran up that debt, he sold off some of our most valuable assets. (Time expired)",90
297,Mr REID,COMMITTEES,"When any government is seeking additional appropriation, it is a timely reminder to look at the balance sheet of affairs. I want to look at the balance sheet of affairs in the electorate of Bendigo. On 16 February 1990 a significant event happened in the Bendigo electorate: the bridge over the Loddon River at Newbridge fell down. On the same day, the federal election was announced for 24 March 1990. At a later period, on 22 May, the Maryborough Knitting Mills had 130 workers sacked and the factory was virtually closed. On 8 February 1991, 177 jobs were lost in the Australian Defence Industries-a 100 per cent owned company of the government. On 15 April 1991 the Australian Defence Industries tendered for the work on the ANZAC frigate worth $150 million but most of that work went to overseas companies. On 14 May 1991 Jockey Australia at Maryborough and St Arnaud closed and 90 jobs were lost. On 15 May it was decided in Benalla's favour that the Australian Defence Industries ammunition plant would be located there-Bendigo was a contender but missed out. On 17 May 1991 the Victorian state bank was referred and virtually gifted to the Commonwealth. At the time, the Victorian Premier, Joan Kirner, promised there would be no staff reductions. As we all know, there have been substantial reductions from 55,000 to an unknown number-probably losses of something in excess of 20,000. On 22 May 1991, 220 jobs were lost in Sportscraft, a factory in Bendigo. On 8 June 1991, 22 workers lost their jobs in the Bendigo Motor Co. as a result of its closure. On 24 August 1991 a Mr Helper was selected as the ALP candidate and he made this statement: I think first and foremost the major issue ployment. Let's see how the balance sheet looks on employment in Bendigo. On 24 August 1991 the number of unemployed was 5,913. In October 1995 the figure was 7,278-another failure by the government. In December 1991 there were further bad unemployment figures; however, on 20 May 1992 the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) claimed that the One Nation statement would create 500 public sector jobs in Bendigo. That has not occurred and represents another failure on the balance sheet of affairs in the Bendigo electorate. On 7 February 1993 the federal election was announced for 13 March. At that time there were 7,228 people on benefits for unemployment from the Department of Social Security. At that time, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) gave a commitment on pensions and tax. It stated: Labor's commitment to removing all age and service pensions from the tax system by 1995 will benefit pensioners paid at the part rate as well as providing some assistance to retirees with incomes beyond the pension cut out point. As we know, that promise has been defaulted on as well. Labor's record in government is pretty poor. The balance sheet is looking pretty shaky at this stage. On 26 February 1993, the Prime Minister visited my electorate and promised $42 million for Goldfields regional tourism. Of course, that promise has been broken as well. There has been zilch money for Goldfields regional tourism. On 13 May 1993 I approached the government to have the Calder Highway declared a national highway. That request was turned down. When Bendigo needed help, the Labor government failed yet again. So their balance sheet is looking pretty tardy. On 26 February 1994, Bendigo lost $500,000 for a heated indoor pool complex. That was part of the sports rorts deal. We all know how that figure fell off the whiteboard back in those days. In fact, on 1 March 1994 the then minister for sport resigned. (Extension of time granted) One of the things that led to that resignation was the fact that she had directed all of the sporting organisations is emin my electorate to see Mr Helper. She said that he was the man to see. Well, Mr Helper lost $500,000 for the Bendigo electorate for a heated indoor swimming pool. Mr Ronaldson-Are you sure it wasn't 'Helpless'?",91
298,Mr REID,COMMITTEES,"Some people call him 'Helpless'. On 2 September 1994 Hilton Hosiery closed down. Another 88 jobs were lost. Also, the government decided to close the defence force recruiting office in Bendigo, resulting in a loss of 10 jobs in the Bendigo region. The balance is going down in Bendigo. Here we have the balance sheet of the affairs and the government is coming back to us, asking us for more money through the appropriation bills we are dealing with. In December 1994, 7,401 people were unemployed in the Bendigo region. On 31 March 1995, I asked the shadow minister for primary industry to come to my electorate. The shadow minister duly came. He gave a lot of support to the residents in my area were being affected by the severe drought. was of great assistance to them. But do you think we got any assistance from the federal government? Absolutely not. Not one cent. There was not one cent of drought relief people in my area. Once again, when help was needed in my electorate the federal government failed. On 14 April 1995,50 jobs Bakery. were lost at the Army Survey Regiment and there will be no army personnel at that post after 1 January 1996. On 13 May I had a bit of a problem here with the Speaker. I was given an hour's from this parliament because I objected to 15 per cent sales tax that the government were going to impose on the building indused. try, as if the building industry has not enough trouble. If you had put that on, you would have completely wrecked the building industry. I went into bat for them, and I pleased to say that the government did retract it and that building sales tax did not proceed at that time. They have it on their hidden agenda. On 20 May 1995, Minister Beazley said that the Australian Defence Industries not immediately on the government's agenda'. Dear Michael, That means that it will be at some time in the future. On 30 May 1995 there was $6 million in drought aid for Victoria-for Horsham of all places. I do not mind them getting some of assistance, but there was nothing for central Victoria. My opponent, the Labor BACKGROUND candidate, said: The announcement is a welcome boost to Victorian Agriculture. It was not much help to the people in northcentral Victoria, around the Bendigo area. In fact, it was so bad that the state Leader Opposition, John Brumby, the gentleman I beat in 1990, attacked the federal government over the lack of drought relief money for north-central Victoria. He knew that the government had done the wrong thing by farmers in the north-central area. On 29 June 1995, Australian Defence Industries again came into prominence. Minister Ray this time said that there would be no sale in the 'foreseeable future'. That means that at some time the government will who be looking at selling off Australian Defence He Industries. On 7 July 1995, a further 65 jobs were lost at Australian Defence Industries. On 24 August 1995, Australian Defence Industries lost the Bushranger bid, which was a bid for for the manufacture of 500 vehicles. They missed out on $360 million of work. On 2 September 1995, 60 jobs were lost at Raggatts The one bit of good news is that on 5 outOctober 1995 the bridge I told the House about earlier at Newbridge, which had collapsed, was rebuilt with Victorian state rest government money. Fortunately we had a the coalition government in control. They provided the funds and that bridge was reconstructDue to the federal government's neglect got of the electorate, we never got any money from the federal government. (Time expired)",92
299,Mr RONALDSON,COMMITTEES,"Ballarat) (7.07 p.m.)am Tonight I raise a matter which should be of concern to every member in this House. It is regarding whether we are indeed the clever nation. I will read quickly a letter from a constituent of mine. The company is Charles !FE Pty Ltd. Melville Charles is the managing sale 'is director. The letter states: I am writing to seek your assistance to obtain funds to fight an appeal by the Industry Research & Development Board (""Board"") against a decision the Administrative Appeal Tribunal ""(Tribunal"") northin which our company was successful. I am the managing director of the family owned company Charles I.F.E. Pty. Ltd. which is a farming venture operating at Windermere on the outskirts of Ballarat, Victoria. The main enterprise on our farm is a 12,000 head piggery. The company was established over 30 years ago and now of the employs 30 loyal and enthusiastic staff. Between 1989 and 1993 we researched and developed a waste management system at the farm to treat the waste produced by the pigs in an environmentally friendly manner. The effluent produced from the piggery is converted into an odourless nutrient rich fertiliser which we use on the farm and sell in a bagged form, and electricity which we use on our farm and sell into the Electricity Grid. I will go back to that letter later on. I will give some history of this matter. I have spoken to Minister Cook's office in relation to this matter and I thank them for the assistance they have given so far. The history given in the letter is as follows: On 10th. November, 1989 our company sought an advance ruling from the Industry Research & Development Board (""the Board"") as to whether the proposed project would be likely to meet the definition of research and development in the Income Tax Assessment Act. In March 1990 the Tax Concession Committee (""TCC"") formed the opinion that the proposed project would meet the research and development criteria. Based on this information we decided to proceed (note: we would not have proceeded if we had not received this advice). In accordance with the ruling Charles LF.E. Pty. Ltd. claimed deductions in 1989-90, 1990-91 and 1991-92 for the research and development associated with developing the system. In October 1992 the Australian Tax Office (""ATO"") sought a certificate from the Board that activities were research and development. In August 1993 the Board assessor determined that the bulk of activities were not R&D and the TCC issued a certificate to that effect. The company sought a reconsideration of the decision by the Board and in December 1993 a second Board assessor recommended that the subject activities be accepted as satisfying the requirements for R&D. The TCC, however, requested that the original assessor find supporting evidence for his assessment. The original assessor did this without any consultation with us and made several important factual errors. In February 1994 the TCC, being unaware of the errors in the original assessors explanatory report, confirmed its original decision that the bulk of activities carried out the company in the development of the waste management system were not R&D. This decision left our company in the unenviable position of having either to pay the tax or appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (""AAT""). I contacted the ATO to inquire our position and to my horror they presented documents on the 23rd February 1994 which indicated that we were to be charged interest and an additional tax culpability component of 50%. Apart from the financial burden this imposed a slur on our reputation. We sought legal advice and appealed to the Tribunal. The hearing before the Tribunal comprising three members, one of whom we understand was a chemical engineer, took place in April and May 1995 and lasted for six days. The company called nine witnesses of whom four were independent expert witnesses with experience in the industry, three of whom had PhD's. Three were highly regarded experts which the company had originally retained to develop the system. In contrast, the Board called only the original assessor who, while having academic qualifications in the area of microbiology, was not as expert in this particular area of research. On 11 the August 1995 the Tribunal unanimously found that the vast majority of the company's activities were research and development activities as defined in the Income Tax Assessment Act. After the Tribunal's decision we were very relieved and thought that after four years of having this whole business looming over us it would finally be over. We had invested an enormous amount of time and money-being both legal costs and the costs of various experts and advisers, in taking the matter to the Tribunal. However, the Board has now appealed the Tribunal's decision on the basis that the Tribunal members interpreted the law incorrectly and we now have to go to the Federal Court of Australia, therefore incurring more legal costs and the extra costs that may occur because of time delay in hearing this case. On the 31st. October 1995 a meeting was held with ATO representatives who were co-operative but believed the matter could not be resolved until after the Federal Court Appeal has been determined (which is not expected for at least 12 months). Mr Deputy Speaker, I will just give you an indication of what this company is all about. Their waste management system has received prestigious awards, including, as the letter states: 1990 Environmental Protection Authority ""Clean Technology Incentive Scheme Award"" 1992 Australian Trust for Conservation Volunteers-award for ""Care and Management of the Environment"" 1993 Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency-award for ""Assistance with National Cleaner Production"" 1993 The Department of Agriculture Victoria's Hugh MCKay Innovators Award for ""Outstanding Application of New Technology, Marketing and Value Adding Strategies"" (Extension of time granted) This company has been documented in numerous publications including, as the letter states: The United Nations Environment For Programme Cleaner Production Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency's promotional video ""The Green Line"" The proceedings of the conference ""Economic Growth with Clean Production"" which was organised by CSIRO Australia and the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation NA The ""Caddet"" renewable energy technical brochures published by the Centre for Renewable Energy in the United Kingdom More recently three Federal Government Departbe ments used our development as an example of meeting the ""Greenhouse Challenge"" and featured our company in the Financial Review and the Weekend Australian in late October. This company is well renowned, and it is absolutely outrageous that the Industry Research and Development Board has decided to take it to the Federal Court of Appeal. There is absolutely no reason for it. On behalf of an organisation that deserves to be supported, I plead that something be done to meet its legal costs or that the board be warned off what I believe to be one of the most dramatic interventions that I have ever seen of a company trying to achieve the clever country status. In the time left to me tonight I would also like to present to the House the winners of my annual essay writing competition. I am most grateful that the Speaker has again done the students of my electorate the great honour of judging my primary school competition. As the Speaker is well aware, the essays were of an exceptionally high standard, which would have made his task of choosing a winner all the more difficult. This year's theme was tolerance, in line with 1995 being the International Year for Tolerance. I have received very positive feedback from some of the teachers who had students involved in the essay competition. All of them said that the students benefited greatly from making the International Year for Tolerance relevant to them. In the senior section Mr Speaker awarded Megan MCKay from Daylesford Primary School with an honourable mention, with first prize going to Karri Golding from Kingston Primary School. In the junior section an honourable mention was given to Nathaniel Taylor from Daylesford Primary School, with the first prize going to Alexandria Oldham, also from Daylesford Primary School. I will read those essays. Karri Golding writes: Tolerance is to be patient and fair to others who have different opinions or beliefs. Everybody needs to be tolerant to be part of a family, school, community or parliament. Tolerance is a two way thing. It is hard to be tolerant towards people who are not tolerant to you. Tolerance is important because it allows people to different in culture, religion and politics. If there was not tolerance, everyone would be at each other and there would be verbal and physical abuse. Politicians need to be more tolerant. In parliament I often see politicians yelling abuse at each other across the house. Nobody else I know behaves like this. In extreme situations, intolerance can lead to war, family break down and conflict between religions and races. Political intolerance can lead to war assassinations and riots. Racial intolerance can cause wars and mass violence such as in South Africa and Los Angeles. Everyone is different in size, weight, appearance, speech, clothing and behaviour, people are often intolerant of one or more of these things. It is important to be happy about being different and be tolerant of other people's differences. It would be boring if we were all the same and nobody was different. Having an International Year of Tolerance will help people think more about their behaviour and lead to less wars, less violence and greater happiness in many countries. Alexandria Oldham wrote: When I am tolerant I do not like being mean and nasty. I like being nice and kind because when I am not nice and kind I am being intolerant. When a person is sitting next to me and they have a wrinkled face I do not say 'Yuk I don't want to sit next to that person.' I just sit and smile at them. If someone smells badly don't tell them that you really hate them just because they smell badly. 'If you can't say something nice don't say anything.' I think being tolerant is a very good thing to be. People have a right to like different things because everybody likes different things. Why is it good to be tolerant? It is good to be tolerant because we do not hurt people's feelings and we don't cause fighting throughout the world. Sometimes parents are not tolerant but I think that is because their children might deserve it. There are lots of people in the world who are not tolerant and have wars and want [0 kill each other. Sometimes my friends are tolerant to me and I really feel very good because they are being really nice. I have to be tolerant with things sometimes. I do not like being intolerant very much. Sometimes when I am painting or drawing I get intolerant if things are not working out. Then I have to take a break and think about it and then when I have thought about it I can keep on going. Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to thank Mr Speaker most sincerely for judging this competition again this year. There is no doubt that he chose wisely and I think that we can all learn from the comments of those very talented young people. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Ms Crawford)-by leave-read a third time.

300,Mr REID,ADJOURNMENT,"I want to raise an issue about the closure of the Commonwealth Bank branches in Victoria. I do so because it was pointed out to me in correspondence from the Commonwealth Bank that on 28 September in this House I made a statement which was factually incorrect. That statement was that the Commonwealth Bank has closed many hundreds of small branches throughout country and rural areas. So I wrote back to them and sought the information. I am delighted that they have provided me with the information because I want to read this into the parliamentary record. Rural Victorian branches closed were: Avoca, Chiltern, Clunes, Derrinallum, Dunkeld, Dunolly, Elmore, Garfield, Goroke, Heathcote, Inglewood, Jeparit, Lancefield, Lismore, Macarthur, Manangatang, Merino, Minyip, Murchison, Neerim South, Nyah West, Penshurst, Pyramid Hill, Rosedale, Sea Lake, Stanhope, Stratford, Toora, Violet Town, Wedderburn, Will aura, Woomelang, Wycheproof, Yackandandah, Yallourn North, Yarragon, and Yarrunga. They also sent me a list of rural Victorian branches that were merged. I guess a merger means they had to have at least two branches to have a merger and one at least-it might even have been more than one-in fact was closed. Those branches were: Ararat, Bacchus Marsh, Bairnsdale, Ballarat, Bellarine Village, Benalla, Bendigo, Camperdown, Castlemaine, Cobram, Colac, Corio Village, Echuca, Hamilton, Highton, Horsham, Kerang, Korumburra, Kyabram, Kyneton, Kangaroo Flat, Leongatha, Maryborough, Mildura Centre Plaza, Mildura, Moe, Mooroopna, Morwell, Myrtleford, Numurkah, Ocean Grove, Portland, Sale, Seymour, Shepparton, Swan Hill, Tatura, Traralgon, Warracknabeal, Warragul, Warrnambool, Wendouree, Wodonga, Wonthaggi and Yarrawonga. I am pleased to be able to put all of those places on the record so that the record is accurate. I would not want to be accused of being inaccurate. I also wrote to the bank and asked about the metropolitan branches that have been closed. They are 37 Queen Street, Melbourne; 520 Collins Street, Melbourne; Peel Street Market, Melbourne; Peter MCCallum Hospital; Spencer Street Railway Station; Ascot Vale East; Auburn; Boroondara; Burnley; Camberwell East; Dandenong; Darling; Eastland Shopping Centre; Fitzroy South; Fitzroy; Glen Iris; Glen Iris Upper; Glenroy; Hampton East; Hawksburn; Hawthorn West; Kensington; Kew North; Kings Gardens; Malvern East; MCKinnon; Moorleigh; National Science Centre; Patterson; Preston North; Regent; Ripponlea; St Kilda West; St Kilda; Stradbroke; Yarraman; and Yoralla. I think that I have corrected the record now. City Link Project",96
301,Mr OCONNOR,ADJOURNMENT,"The House will be aware of serious reservations being expressed in Victoria about the Kennett government's City Link project. These reservations are centred around two primary concerns: firstly, whether the City Link proposal represents good policy in a transport sense; and, secondly, the nature of the contractual arrangements signed by the Kennett Liberal government and the contractor, Transurban. They are reservations that many people in Geelong share as they grapple with the implications of the state government's decisions. My major concern is that the long-term funding ramifications of the deal struck between the Kennett government and Transurban will mean the imposition of tolls on the Princes Highway between Geelong and Melbourne. I simply say to the Kennett government that that is not on. Commuters from Geelong to Melbourne will not buy it. Businesses that are reliant on travel to Geelong's largest market, Melbourne, will not buy it either. Let me say from the outset that I am not opposed to a sensible solution to Melbourne's urban transport congestion. The federal government has invested over $1 billion in Melbourne as the national transport hub. For example, we have spent $600 million on the Western Ring Road, $200 million on the airport, $150 million on the standard gauge linkage and the Dynon terminal and $200 million under the Building Better Cities program for urban transport upgrades. What we want in Victoria, as a response to Melbourne's transport needs well beyond the year 2000, is a 10 out of 10 integrated transport solution, not a four out of 10 Los Angeles style solution. The reason I raised the spectre of a toll on the Princes Highway between Geelong and Melbourne is well founded. The simple fact is that the figures on City Link do not stack up. Let me refer to the case of the Sydney Harbour Tunnel, constructed at a cost of some $350 million. Motorists there are charged $1 each way for their journeys, and it is subsidised to the tune of $20 million per year for the next 20 years by the state government. Yet the Kennett government has on its books now an infrastructure project worth $1.7 billion-no subsidy from the state government and a project totally reliant on tolls to finance it as well as other concessions such as tax concessions on infrastructure bonds. So the very real concern for the Geelong community-the individuals who travel to Melbourne each day to work and the Geelong businesses which use the highway daily to transport their goods to Melbourne-is the prospect of a Kennett road toll on the Princes Highway. I am strongly opposed to the introduction of tolls on Victorian freeways, under the arrangements that the Kennett government has struck with Transurban, for several reasons. Firstly, drivers are not being given adequate choice in the closure of the roads under the deal with Transurban, which drives motorists on to the freeway and fills the Transurban coffers. Secondly, the Kennett government is putting tolls on public roads that are already paid for. Finally, the City Link proposal delivers the awful prospect for Geelong people of tolls being put on the Princes Highway between Geelong and Melbourne and, indeed, on the Nepean Highway in the longer term as well. The Kennett government must give Geelong commuters and businesses a concrete assurance now that it will not allow tolls on the Princes Highway between Geelong and Melbourne. We will see enormous growth occur beyond the year 2000, up to the year 2020, in the urban corridor between Geelong and Melbourne. We need to get our planning right. We need to get the transport infrastrucbut ture right. In that Geelong-Melboume corridor is an organisation called Habitat, which is seeking to ensure that the development which occurs in that corridor is economically sustainable over time. We want assurances from the Kennett government now that there will be no tolls imposed on the Princes Highway. Herald-Sun: Pryce-Jones, Mr David",97
302,Mr CLEARY,ADJOURNMENT,"The media's tolerance of the latest piece of antiArab sentiment, that which emanates from the pen of visiting historian David Pryce-Jones, is rather instructive given the manner in which media commentators devoured that revisionist problem child Helen Demidenko. Members would be aware that Pryce-Jones, in reference to the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin said, 'To shoot one's Prime Minister is what Arabs do, not what Jews do.' In the debate on the Racial Hatred Bill I argued that well-known ramblers such as Bruce Ruxton and media commentators such as Colin Rubenstein and Norm Lipson displayed a less than sophisticated view of Arabs in their pronouncements during the Gulf War and that segments of the media were a willing party to anti-Arab hysteria. The member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) did not agree and rushed into this place to accuse me of slandering his friend Colin Rubenstein. What I had said was that the by-line which introduced Mr Rubenstein's article-namely, 'Australia would be the hunting ground for Saddam Hussein's terrorists' - was anti-Arab and that it and other offerings by journalists offended Arabic people in Australia. The fact that Colin Rubenstein was not responsible for the by-line in no way mitigates the sensationalist tenor of the article. Five years later-or is it nearly six years later?-no such terrorists have emerged in Australia. Australian Arabic Council member Joe Wakim argued that the by-line stereotyped Arabs as blind followers of a dictator and addicted to violence. The member for Goldstein, however, told the House that the by-line was innocuous. It is interesting, isn't it, that the member for Goldstein will tell you that Saddam Hussein is the devil incarnate and a vicious dictator he cannot understand that the suggestion that the devil Hussein might find support within the Australian Arabic community would be offensive to many in that community? I ask the member for Goldstein: if the Herald-Sun ran an article under the headline 'Australia may be the target of a large force of right-wing anti-Rabin Israeli terrorists', would he be expecting the Jewish community to be outraged? So where is the member for Goldstein, or Colin Rubenstein for that matter, when David Pryce-Jones is vilifying Arabs? Let us have a look at some of the pearls of wisdom from Pryce-Jones. He said: No-one has yet managed within the Arab world to teach how to form a law-based society, in which that kind of killing gives way to a power sharing in a democratic and orderly manner. It gets worse: It is pointless to pretend that the Palestinians are a law-based society. They are not, nor are any Arabs. But the conclusion I draw from the murder of Yitzhak Rabin is that so strong is the Arab culture - nd - o .influential, that it may risk drawing Israelis Illto It III such a manner that they decide, like the Arabs, that if they wish to get rid of their leader, the way to do it is to shoot him. The article is an absolute disgrace. I cannot believe that the Herald-Sun would run it. When the holocaust apologist David Irving applied to visit Australia his application was rejected. The opposition and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) spoke as one in their opposition to and rejection of Irving's visit. So why were the same standards not applied to this anti-Arab bloke who can vilify Arabs under the protection of the exemption clause that protects academic works? How academic was this piece of rubbish? Here is a challenge for the member for Goldstein. I would like him to advise the parliament whether he thinks Pryce-Jones's article is anti-Arab. Come in and tell me whether it is anti-Arab. The honourable member claims that I was too hard on Colin Rubenstein. I wonder whether he would like to come into the House and defend PryceJones. It is no wonder the Arabic Council is taking this issue to the Race Discrimination Commissioner. Whether they get any justice-given that under the legislation works of this kind will be exempt from civil action-remains to be seen. Pryce-Jones was given three columns in the Herald-Sun. In response, Roland Jabbour, Chairman of the Australian Arabic Council, was given less than one column. This is the kind of hegemony practised by some newspapers-a kind of discriminatory policy. Roland Jabbour, of course, by not getting the same space to counteract this ridiculous article by Pryce-Jones, cannot counter it in a way that would be acceptable to the Arabic Council. It is very sad that articles such as these do appear in the Herald-Sun and it is really sad that in this parliament not one person has stood to condemn this article. There is something discriminatory about that action. It shows the limitations of the race hatred legislation. I know that a former Attorney General of New South Wales, Mr Frank Walker, is in the chamber and I am pretty sure he would agree with me on this question. East Timor: Balibo",98
303,Mr HAVILAND,ADJOURNMENT,"Macarthur) (7.35 p.m.)Mr Speaker, 16 October 1995 marked the 20th anniversary of the death of five Australian based journalists at Balibo in East Timor. They were Greg Shackleton, Tony Stewart and Gary Cunningham of HSV7 in Melbourne and Malcolm Rennie and Brian Peters, two British journalists who were working for TCN9 in Sydney. There can be no doubt that these five journalists were gunned down in cold blood by Indonesian forces who were preparing to invade East Timor. Their status as non-combatants was not respected and they were killed for the crime of having witnessed a pre-emptive strike into East Timorese territory by the Indonesian army nearly two months before the official invasion began in December 1975. The Australian Defence Signals Directorate in Darwin had picked up Indonesian communications describing the incident and the murder of the journalists by the evening of that same day and a memo of the events was in the hands of government officials in Canberra that evening. It appears that the Australian government played along with an Indonesian charade-that is, that the fate of the journalists was unknown. It could be said that Australia, therefore, was an accomplice in the invasion of East Timor which occurred on 7 December 1975. Had Australia spoken out at that time, had Australia presented its evidence of Indonesian incursions into East Timorese territory, Indonesia would in all probability have been embarrassed into backing off, because they had been repeatedly telling the world community that they had no troops in East Timor and they had no intentions of annexing the ex-Portuguese colony. Twenty years after the violent deaths of the five journalists, there has never been a decent inquiry, a decent explanation or a protest by Australia to Indonesia. There has been no expression of regret or apology to the families of the victims. Not even their remains have been returned. I have recently come into possession of a book written by James Dunn, a highly respected former diplomat, entitled East Timor: The Balibo incident in perspective. I quote from the back of that book: The killing of the journalists was undoubtedly the worse and the most wanton act of its kind in the history of Australian journalism. The concealment that took place before the journalists went to East Timor probably contributed to their deaths. And subsequent remarks that they should not have been there have tended to cast a shadow of dishonour on their motives. There can be no doubt as to their sincerity in seeking to bring to the Australian public the truth about a situation in which Australia's role was quite shameful. To expose such a situation is surely one of the noblest challenges before today's media, a role which highlights the media's central place in a functioning democracy. The Western response to the incident, especially that of Australia, removed any reluctance on the part of the Suharto regime to proceed with a military operation that inflicted enormous humanitarian costs. On 24 October 1995, I submitted a private member's motion calling for an official inquiry into the Balibo incident. For reasons best known to the Selection Committee of the House, I was not able to proceed with that motion this week. Apparently there was more urgent business. But I would like to read the motion into Hansard. The motion states: That this House: (l) notes that, 20 years after the deaths of 5 Australian-based journalists, Greg Shackleton, Tony Stewart, Gary Cunningham, Malcolm Rennie and Brian Peters, in Balibo, East Timor on 16 October 1975, there has never been a satisfactory investigation into the circumstances of the killings; (2) requests that the federal Government establish an inquiry into the circumstances of the deaths of those journalists, including the question of how they were killed, who was responsible, what happened to the bodies and the extent of the involvement of Australian and Indonesian authorities in suppressing details of the dent; (3) requests that the terms of reference of the inquiry include a full investigation of played by federal Government agencies, including the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Defence Signals Directorate and other security and intelligence services, in relation to this matter from October 1975 onwards; and (4) requests that any provisions existing in any federal legislation which would otherwise prevent full disclosure to the inquiry by officers, employees, agent or subagents of federal agencies of any information under oath relevant to the terms of reference be set aside for the purposes of the inquiry. The acclaimed Australian journalist John Pilger, who has supported my call for an inquiry, last month said: There needs to be an inquiry that will open the Defence Signals Directorate communications file for October 1975. This will undoubtedly reveal that the Australian government was aware of the truth surrounding Balibo and that successive Australian governments have sought to cover it up. If what John Pilger asserts is true, and I have little doubt that it is, Australia's role in the demise of East Timor was one of downright collusion. This is a matter of grave concern, and one that warrants an answer. That is why I have called for an inquiry. (Time expired) Banking Small Business Deregulation",99
304,Mr KATTER,ADJOURNMENT,"I seek leave of the House to table documents concerning banking and the Colin Uebergang case. I have not read the documents myself but, in an effort to bring the banks, their procedures and practices and the very harsh nature of what they are doing to the attention of the Australian community, and also in defence of the tea-tree industry, I would like to table them in the House. Leave not granted.",100
305,Mr KATTER,ADJOURNMENT,"In myoId state electorate area, we have had our third very tragic suicide of people from the grazing industry over the last two or three years and our fourth death of young men who have lost their job in that area in that same period. A lot of this inci- is due to the pressures from banks and decisions by this government to increase interest rates to 20 per cent, a whirlwind which we the role are still harvesting in the bush and will harvest for another 10 years.",100
306,Mr COBB,ADJOURNMENT,And higher.,100
307,Mr KA TIER,ADJOURNMENT,"And higher, yes. I must say that I paid 29 per cent last year on the station property that we had at the time. The Competition Policy Reform Bill-the so-called Hilmer reforms introduced into this Househas placed a grave shadow over all small business throughout Australia. The bill purports to abolish all licensing and franchising arrangements. There is no rationale behind the legislation unless that is going to take place. It always amuses me that people complain afterwards. You cannot be more specific than the Industry Commission report on the transport industry when it said that taxis would have the average fare reduced by $2 and it would cost taxi owners throughout this country some $3,000 million. So 50,000 small business men would be put to the sword for some remote possibility that we would save $2 on each taxi fare. We can only back up deregulation on what we have already deregulated in this country. We have deregulated two parts of the Australian economy. Banking is one area. I do not think anyone in this country would seriously question the absolutely disastrous nature of what followed. An amount of $16,000 million was lost in 17 firms alone. To quoting the book by Trevor Sykes, some $28,000 million was lost through people who were performing in the community and were described as the corporate cowboys of the 1980s. The oil industry was the other area of the economy that was deregulated. Very few people are aware of this. Some 2,000-odd service stations were wiped out, annihilated: they no longer exist. The price of petrol has dropped from $34 a barrel to $17 a barrel in the last 12 years. In the same period, the take by the oil companies has increased from around 7c a litre to some 22c a litre or, if you include another factor, some 12c a litre to 23c a litre. What has happened here is that the world price of petrol dropped clean in half and the price in Australia doubled in the same period. Deregulation has been a disastrous failure in both these areas of the economy. The hoteliers of Queensland are being placed in grave jeopardy by this legislation. The pharmacists of Queensland, newsagents, milk vendors, dairy farmers, sugar farmers, butchers and real estate agents are also being badly affected. The milk industry in Queensland has been partially deregulated. We simply got a note from our milk vendor saying, 'We can't afford to deliver milk any more because there's no margin for us in the outlying areas.' While it does not worry us, five of my neighbours are on the pension and it worries them greatly. There are very good reasons why we have franchise arrangements with newsagents. They give us a service which provides confectionery, stationery, a range of goods and periodicals, and numerous other services that we simply would not get if they are closed down and the newspapers are put through Coles, Woolworths and Myers. As far as the taxis go, they provide a clean, safe service; a phone service, which is very important; an air conditioned service, which is absolutely imperative in the state of Queensland; and a cadre of professional drivers. If we move to deregulation, these things will be lost and we cannot expect the level of service that we now enjoy. But, more importantly, we are constantly replacing these people who are on reasonable incomes-not even good incomes but reasonable incomes-with people who are being paid virtually nothing at all. (Time expired) Tibet",101
308,Mr JENKINS,ADJOURNMENT,"On a number of occasions in this place I have spoken upon the plight of Tibet, and the basis of my contributions has usually been on two problems in the way that the Chinese have conducted themselves in Tibet. One is the basis of the environmental degradation that the Chinese have oversighted and the second is the way in which they have taken it upon themselves to place pressure on the Tibetan culture, on Tibetan heritage and, more importantly, on the basis of the Tibetan Buddhism religion. The first item I want to briefly mention is the fact that at last the Chinese officials have acknowledged that there is nuclear waste in the Tibetan autonomous region-so-called by the Chinese officials. Last night on the adjournment, the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) took some of us on this side to task in saying that we had not done enough to highlight China's continuing nuclear tests. Can I say that, in anything I have said about the French tests, I have also included my disquiet and disgust that the Chinese government continues to indulge in nuclear testing. As the leader of the Australian parliamentary observer delegation to the AIPO conference in Singapore, I made sure that, when we put on notice our concern about testing in the region, it was the two powers that we were talking about. The importance of that was that China also had an observer delegation at that conference. The two major concerns about environmental degradation in Tibet have been the existence of this nuclear waste, and the belief that nuclear testing may have taken place within Tibet. As I said, the Chinese government has acknowledged that there is a nuclear waste dump in the Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. They claim that this is conducted in a proper manner and that, over the 30 years of operation, there had not been 'any harm to the environment'. This goes against the evidence of a number of international organisations who have reported that local doctors have seen abnormally high rates of diseases in some of the towns near this dump. This is something that the world community should ask that the Chinese government look into. As with a number of the things that are happening in Tibet, it is proper that we call upon the Chinese officials to allow independent groups to come in and to investigate what is actually happening on the ground. From time to time there has been a reluctance to allow observer groups to go and look at specific problems. The other thing I wish to mention tonight is the developing controversy about the appointment of the Panchen Lama. The Panchen Lama is the second highest ranking person within Tibetan Buddhism, below the Dalai Lama. The 10th Panchen Lama passed away in January 1989. Since then, the exhaustive processes that have a long traditional base have been undergone. In May this year, that culminated in the Dalai Lama's announcement of Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, a six-year-old boy from northern Tibet, as the 11 th Panchen Lama. Initially, the Chinese officials accepted this announcement and did not repudiate it. They have since had a change of mind. The young boy has disappeared, and the monk who was the head of the appointment body has also disappeared. There have been a number of complaints about the treatment of Tibetan monks from the monastery that deals with the education of the Panchen Lama. This is something that is a real problem. Chinese officials now are saying that they will be announcing an alternative appointment of another Panchen Lama. If this were to go ahead, it would really tear at the cultural basis of the Tibet people. It is a problem, and the greatest problem, that the Tibetans have actually confronted. There have been a number of things that they have had to put up with throughout the four decades or so since China took over. (Time expired) Unemployment",101
309,Ms WORTH,ADJOURNMENT,"Adelaide) (7.50 p.m.)Today, 29 out of every 100 young Australians want work but cannot find a job. In South Australia, the statistics for youth unemployment are even more chilling. In October, the unemployment rate amongst our 15to 19year-olds jumped to over 40 per cent; that is, four out of every 10 young South Australians cannot find work. For those of us working closely with the people in our electorates, it is impossible to ignore the despair which is the reality behind the statistics. Having been denied the opportunity to work, young people are struggling to maintain a sense of purpose and a sense of community. They feel betrayed-they have been betrayed-and the responsibility for this lies squarely at the feet of those who have managed our economy for the past 13 years, and that is the present Labor government. This government has no answers to the unemployment crisis which has developed under its administration. In the place of answers, we get constant reaffirmations from the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) that the government will meet its target of five per cent unemployment by the tum of the century. But the constancy of these re-affirmations does little to obscure their absolute absurdity. As the authors of the green paper on employment said in late 1993: For Australia to reduce its unemployment rate to 5 per cent by the year 2000, the economy would need to grow at an average annual rate of between 4.5 per cent and five per cent At present, we are growing at a rate well below four per cent and unemployment is rising steadily-from 8.2 per cent in July, to 8.3 per cent in August, then up to 8.5 per cent a month later and now 8.7 per cent. As we move further and further away from the government's target of five per cent unemployment by the year 2000 and as the minister becomes more and more strident in his insistence that this target will be reached, one can only conclude, as the editorial in the Australian on 8 September concluded, that: At best he is deluded, and at worse Mr Crean is telling the truth. The level of unemployment-and more particularly the level of youth unemployment-is the most urgent and the most critical of the political challenges facing this country. The government's Working Nation strategy has simply not risen to this challenge. The reason for this is clear. As a young job seeker in my electorate has observed in a letter to me: The problem ... is that at the end of the period when the subsidy disappears so does the job. Why does everyone ignore this fact because it is what happens. I support programs which provide training and experience to those shut out of the work force by the lack of these things, and this is what Working Nation attempts to do. But without real jobs to absorb those who complete these programs, Working Nation becomes little more than a mechanism for obscuring the true level of long-term unemployment-a mechanism for removing the long-term unemployed from the unemployment queue and returning them to it as newly unemployed. Ensuring that there are real jobs for those who want to work will be the highest priority of a Liberal-National party government. One of the ways we will do this is by getting the government off the back of the small and medium sized businesses that will be the primary source of new jobs in the years to come. I would like to again quote from the letter I received from the young job seeker in my electorate: My parents own a small business and would really like to employ more young people and take on more apprentices but the amount of red tape to do this is very thick. There are so many little costs that add up to big costs once a person is employed. I think if the pressure on small businesses was eased up maybe I would be able to find a job ... The Liberal and National parties are committed to removing these barriers that are currently preventing businesses from taking on new workers. We must not grow complacent about the current tragic levels of unemployment. The levels of unemployment that have plagued this country for more than a decade not are not inevitable. They are the consequence of failed economic management. Afghanistan",102
310,Mr HOLDING,ADJOURNMENT,"The National Museum of Australia recently held an exhibition on Afghan settlers in Australia from 1865 to 1995. It was an important exhibition which indicated the extent of the Afghan contribution to Australia. When the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, Afghanistan became a cause celebre in the minds of the Western world. With the really collapse of the Soviet Union and the withdrawal of its troops the world has forgotten, or seems to choose to ignore, the abuses of human rights which are occurring in that country on almost a daily basis. I cannot emphasise too strongly the extent of the devastation wrought upon the lives of hundreds of thousands of Afghan women and children over the last three years. Armed groups have massacred defenceless women in their homes and in their camps. Many have been brutally beaten and raped. Amnesty International has reliably documented hundreds of cases involving young women who have been forcibly abducted, then raped, and taken as wives of commandos or sold into prostitution. In recent weeks different fundamentalist groups have mobilised their forces, hundreds of women have disappeared and scores of others have been stoned to death. In recent months more than 40,000 women and children have fled their homes in terror, only to suffer further abuses in neighbouring refugee camps. The local Afghan community in Melbourne has been made aware of a case which occurred in March 1994 involving a 15-year-old girl who was repeatedly raped in her house in Kabul after armed guards entered the house and killed her father in front of her. She was allowed to go to school. Many armed groups target women from specific ethnic minorities. Many Afghan women have been abducted and detained by armed groups and commandos who have used them for sexual purposes. The world is well aware of the problem of ethnic cleansing in what was the old state of Yugoslavia. Perhaps some nations are concerned because many Yugoslavs are members of Christian faiths, but the reality of what occurring in Afghanistan at present is a matter of outrage to all of us who believe that citizens, no matter how humble, are entitled to have their basic human rights defended. The emergence of Mujaheddin forces representing various sectional groups and the outrages performed against defenceless civilians-particularly women and children-are matters which must cause great concern in Australia and in this parliament. The Afghan people need a voice which will say that this is behaviour which is of internathe tional concern. We must make it clear to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) that, in view of the long Afghan relationship in the development of this country, Australia should provide a method by which people under threat, women under threat, and children under threat, can come here. Afghan citizens who have settled in Australia should be enabled to sponsor and care for relatives and wives who, by their very existence in either Pakistan of Afghanistan, are under threat. This is a plea for the human rights of a group of people who deserve our understanding and our sympathy. If Australia is to maintain its highly credible reputation in the field of human rights it is time we focused on a nation which is within our region; a nation which has produced many citizens of Australia who have served us well. I commend this situation to the urgent attention of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs.",103

343,Mr WILLIS,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Assistant Treasurer, the Hon George Gear, MP, responded to Mr Slipper's representations on 28 September 1995. Welfare Services (Question No. 2579) Mr Wakelin asked the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 24 August 1995: (1) Has her attention been drawn to a claim report by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare that government spending on welfare services has increased by more than 40 per cent in the 5 years to 1992-93. (2) Is it a fact that government spending on welfare services has increased by more than 40 per cent in the 5 years to 1992-93; if so, does this signify that there is a growing reliance on welfare services and, if so, why is reliance on welfare services growing.",138
344,Dr LAWRENCE,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes. (2) Yes, government expenditure on what the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) defines as ""Welfare Services"" has increased by 41.2% in real terms in the five years to 1992-93; but no, this does not signify growing reliance on welfare services. ""Welfare Services"" as defined by AIHW consists of child care support, family and child welfare services, aged and disabled welfare services, and services such as supported accommodation, rent rebates, prisoners aid and English programs for migrants. It does not include social security payments, housing and community amenities or nursing homes. Approximately half of the expenditure referred to is Commonwealth expenditure. The rest is State and Local Government expenditure. Of the Commonwealth expenditure, the great majority is in the areas of Aged Care, Disability Services and Family and Children's Services, for which my Department is responsible. The increase in Commonwealth expenditure, described by the AIHW is overwhelmingly due to the combined effect of two factors: population increase, especially among the ageing; and an increased emphasis on programs which help people to lead independent lives within the community (programs which the AIHW includes under ""welfare services"") and away from residential care in nursing homes (which it does not include under ""welfare services""). Thus the figures do not reflect growing reliance among individual community members on Government programs and provision. Aged Care and Disability Services Commonwealth expenditure for the aged and people with a disability, for those areas classified as ""welfare services"" and reported in the AIHW Welfare Services Expenditure bulletin, increased in a from $552m in 1987-88 to $I,194m in 1992-93-a 78% increase in real terms. Growth in expenditure must be seen in the context of growth in the target population, in this case those people over 70 years of age and over 80 years of age. Over the period, the total Australian population increased by 6.8%, while the population aged 70 and over-the target population for most aged care services-increased by 17.2% (202,000 persons). The population aged 80 and over, who are the greatest users of these services, increased by 24.2% (although four out of five people over the age of 70 do not use any aged care services). The growth in expenditure must also be seen in the context of a deliberate change in the balance of care and targeting of services. There has been a shift in the balance of care away from the provision of expensive and intensive nursing care to hostels and Home and Community Care (HACC). Hostel expenditure has increased over this period from $93m to $275m, a rise of approximately 134% in real terms. HACC expenditure increased from $168m to $342m, an increase of approximately 62% in real terms. In contrast nursing home benefits grew from $I,166m to $I,681m, a growth of only 14.7% in real terms. This shift has not only enabled nursing home growth to be contained but has also responded to people's wishes for more care options and especially for care at home. Child Care Commonwealth expenditure on family and child welfare services, as reported in the AIHW Welfare Services Expenditure bulletin, increased from $203m in 1987-88 to $557m in 1992-93, a 126% increase in real terms. This increase reflects the large growth in child care places funded by the Commonwealth over this period. The primary objective of this Program is to assist families with dependent children to participate in the workforce-which in tum reduces the likelihood of them being dependent on Government for their subsistence. The Child Care Program is an important labour support program to assist families with parents in the labour force. The Program also assists families with a parent at home to access affordable developmental opportunities for their children. Elonpark Pty Ltd (Question No. 2735) Mr Moore asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 26 October 1995: Did the Minister's Department or its agencies make payments to Elonpark Pty Ltd in any year between 1984-85 and 1994-95; if so, (a) what sum was paid in each year and (b) for what purposes was it paid.",138
