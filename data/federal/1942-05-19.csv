1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"HOB. ""W. M. Nairn) took the chair at 3 p.m. and read prayers. CLOTHES RATIONING .",11
2,Mr MARW ICK,Unknown,"I have received  Labour Premier of ""Western Australia, a telegram in the following terms:I resent Dedman'g dictatorship as does every one in Western Australia. His latest blunder concerning the rationing of clothing haa resulted in goods being grabbed up by wealthy people. Working men's wives and daughters are unable to obtain necessary clothing. 1I have a daughter, working from 9 to 5, and a married one with three children, the eldest five, the youngest one year. What chance have they in this mad rush? This, applies to thousands of women working here. In view of the continuance of the buying rush referred to in the telegram, which is not confined to Western Australia but is general throughout the Commonwealth, and the ability of those who have money and leisure to make .purchases to the exclusion of working people, including those engaged in war industries, what action is proposed by the Minister for War Organization of Industry with a view to correcting the position?",11
3,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,"The Government's action cannot in any sense be characterized aa rationing of clothing, but is merely the restriction of sales with a view to the establishment of a pool pending the enforcement of rationing.  few purchasers. Mr Dedman"" - I do not admit that the restriction of sales has enabled the wealthier sections of the community to obtain a greater quantity of clothing than they are entitled, to have; workers, too, have participated in the buying rush. However, the Government is watching - the position closely, and will later take whatever action it may deem necessary i.n order to effect adjustments.",11
4,Mr FRANCIS,Unknown,"Has the attention of the Minister heen directed to the statement published in yesterday's Sunday Swi, that the secretary of the Builders Labourers Union in New South Wales, Mr W. F. Thomas, had said that a repetition of the experiences of last Saturday and the previous Saturday, when builders' labourers who had .taken time off in order to purchase - clothing had been u-nahle to obtain their requirements, would probably - result in the refusal of his members to work on - Saturdays? In view of this statement, and the further remark of Mr. Thomas that 3,000 builders' - labourers had been unable to buy winter clothes, what action is proposed in order to ensure that these men, and others similarly placed, .may obtain the clothing that is necessary for their winter needs?",12
5,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,"I have not read the press statement referred to, but I shall peruse it and take the matter into consideration when deciding whether there shall be an alteration of the existing regulations in respect of sales.",12
6,Mr HARRISON,Unknown,"-Will the Minister for War Organization of Industry inform the House of the identity of the individual, stated to he one - of his economists, who gave an interview in Melbourne to the representative of the Sydney Daily Telegraph on the subject of clothes rationing? The interview was published in the press on Monday last. On whose authority did this unnamed economist give the interview, and on what information did he base his statement that the Department for War Organization of Industry suspected that shops had not really sold their quotas ? In view of and other statements by persons in his department on the subject of rationing, will the Minister say upon whom the public ean rely for authentic information regarding the position?",12
7,Mr CURTIN,Unknown,"I have asked the Minister for War Organization of Industry, in his own physical interests, not to answer questions today. It must 'be obvious to every one that the honourable gentleman's voice is very much affected. He is not well. He spent some time in bed, and should have spent longer. I - ask the honourable member to put his - question on the notice-paper, and this applies also 'to other questions which honourable members may have in mind to ask the Minister 'for War Organization of Industry.",12
8,Mr MORGAN,Unknown,Is the Minister for Supply .and Development .aware that during the recent buying rush ion - retail clothing stores certain people with the means and time have been buying stocks rraaich beyond their normal needs? Will he inquire into the activities of those people in order to ascertain their reasons for over-buying-whethe r they are buying in order to hoard or for black market purposes ? Will he take steps to see that 'they are properly dealt with-eithe r - prosecuted or forced to disgorge their excess purchases so that war-workers and others not so fortunately placed as they shall he assured of obtaining their share of the available commodities?,12
9,Mr BEASLEY,Unknown,"I have heard reports and rumours of excessive buying. lb is difficult, indeed almost impossible at the moment, to get specific cases OT ooBorete evidence. I think the best approach in the matter would be not to pursue the people who have made overpurchases in spite of the appeal to them not to do so, compliance with which would be naturally expected, but to make such provision as will ensure that there shall be no repetition of what happened. ZONING OF BREAD DELIVERIES. Mar. SHEEHAN - I ask the Minister for War Organization of Industry whether a reduction of the price of bread was declared on Monday in respect of a very small portion of the metropolitan area of Sydney; whether the declaration was - made because zoning of bread this deliveries had been instituted in such areas; and whether the allocation of the zones has militated very seriously against, bakers who a-re not members of the _ zoning committee, particularly in the Balmain district, who ean obtain neither redress nor an adjustment of their zones? Is the honourable gentleman aware that some bakers have been allocated such zones that their deliveries have heen Teduced by nearly 1,000 loaves a week, and that the reduced prices are operating on one side of the street but will not operate on the other side until the lst June next?",12
10,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,"I have seen the press statement that a reduction of the price of bread has been made in certain suburbs of Sydney. This reduction was the result of a decision by the Commissioner of Prices. That gentleman has in my department a liaison officer, who keeps him in touch with our activities, in order that he may pass on to the public, by way of a priee reduction, the benefit of any lowering of costs thus revealed. The Commissioner of Prices is under the control of the Minister for Trade and Customs. It is true that the reduction of the price of bread is due to the introduction of the zone system. Meeting the contention that the allocation of zones has been such, that some bakers have been placed at a disadvantage, I would say that in the early stages of a plan of this sort it is impossible to ensure that each baker delivering in a zone will be able to deliver the same quantity of bread as he previously supplied. Re-adjustments are being made from time to time, and it is hoped that inequalities in relation to the number of loaves delivered will be rectified at an eanly date.",13
11,Mr SHEEHAN,Unknown,There is no committee to deal-with the matter.,13
12,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,"A committee is operating in the industry. It consists of representatives of the bakers and the trade union concerned, with an officer of my department as chairman. Readjustments must necessarily take some little time. However, they are being made; and it is hoped that the position will be stabilized at a very early date. I am not aware that the reduction of price is operating on one side, and not the other, of a street; but, as I have already said, that matter is within the jurisdiction of the Minister for Trade and Customs, because the reduction of price has been made by the Commissioner of Prices.",13
13,Mr ROSEVEAR,Unknown,"Will the Minister for War Organization of Industry state whether a representative of the Abhco Bread Company, which was roundly condemned by a royal commission for frauding the Government, has taken a prominent part in the allotment of zones for the delivery of bread in Sydney, and whether bakers who are dissatisfied with their allotment will have to make an appeal to this gentleman ? Does the Minister consider that in view of the record of this company it should have anything to do with the control of deliveries?",13
14,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,I am not aware that a representative of the company is the sole arbiter of the zones to be allotted to bakers in Sydney.,13
15,Mr ROSEVEAR,Unknown,I did not suggest that.,13
16,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,"I am not aware that a representative of the Abbco Bread Company is in any way connected with the zoning scheme. My department has set up a committee consisting of equal numbers of representatives of employers and of employees in the industry, with an independent chairman appointed by the department. It may he that a member of the company referred to is one of the employers. I shall make inquiries into the matter, and advise the honourable member later as to the exact position. THE PARLIAMENT. COMMENT BY SIE FREDERICK JORDAN.",13
17,Mr CONELAN,Unknown,"Has the attention of the Prime Minister been directed to the comment by the Chief Justice of New South Wales, Sir Frederick Jordan, during the hearing of the Pankhurst-Walsh case yesterday, in which His Honour reflected upon the intelligence of members of this Parliament? As the Standing Orders prohibit members of this Parliament from reflecting on the judiciary, does the right honourable gentleman regard as proper reflection by the judiciary on members of this Parliament?",13
18,Mr CURTIN,Unknown,"At an interview that I had a few moments ago, I was informed that His Honour the Chief Justice of New South Wales had made certain observations. I do not know exactly what His Honour said, but I am quite sure that he is as competent to deal with the matters that come before him as is this Parliament to deal with the matters that come before it. PANE L ENVELOPES.",13
19,Mr HOLT,Unknown,"Will the Minister repredesenting the Postmaster-General state whether restrictions have been placed on the use by commercial houses of panel envelopes, and does that imply that large stocks of those envelopes now in the possession of commercial houses are to be wasted ? Will the Minister give consideration to a three month' extension of the period in which the envelopes may be used, so that an unnecessary waste of paper may 'be avoided?",13
20,Mr GEOEGE LAWSON,Unknown,"I am not in possession of the information sought by the honourable member, hut I shall bring the matter to the notice of the Postmaster-General and shall obtain a reply to the question as soon as possible. INTEREST ON MORTGAGES.",14
21,Mr FALSTEIN,Unknown,"Will the Treasurer state whether many mortgagors are paynot ing interest up to 7 per cent on first or warnings? mortgages where the principal sum borrowed does not exceed 60 per cent, of the total value of the property mortgaged? Will the Treasurer say when a regulamade tion will be promulgated to reduce the general mortgage rate to the same centage as that permitted to be charged by the private trading banks?",14
22,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"I am not aware of the interest rate charged on first mortter gages in the circumstances mentioned the honourable member. However, the matter of interest rates on mortgages been under consideration by me, and also by previous Treasurers. I believe that was referred by previous Treasurers to the Capital Issues Advisory Board for advice as to how the interest rates charged could be controlled. The ranges of rates and risks associated with first and second mortgages are extremely difficult matters to determine. It been hoped, as I think it was hoped previous Treasurers, that the control reduction of interest rates on bank advances would influence the rate charged on first mortgages. The matter is being further examined, but I can give no inindustry; dication as to the likelihood of a regulahome tion being promulgated, in view of many difficulties associated, with an mining industry? equitaible adjustment of the matter. COAL-MINING INDUSTRY.",14
23,Mr RANKIN,Unknown,"Has the Prime Mintives ister read the statement attributed the general secretary of the Australian Coal and Shale Employees Federation, Mr G. W. Grant, as reported in no the Sydney Sun yesterday, that, when the miners' leaders met the Prime Minister in Canberra today, they would warn him that if any attempt were made to apply regulations to miners without an investigation of anomalies in the industry, a serious situation might arise? Was that warning conveyed to the Prime Minister by the miners' leaders today, and, if so, what was the right honourable gentleman's reaction to such a threat? Will he make it clear to those engaged in the coal-mining industry, irrespective of whether they are owners, miners' representatives or miners, that in giving effect to the regulations to ensure a maximum production of coal, he will be influenced in any degree by threats",14
24,Mr CURTIN,Unknown,"I did read in the press that such a statement had been but I do not know whether it has been made or not. The representatives of perthe miners will see me some time this afternoon. They do not need to warn me. Every body in the world has warned me. Mr JAMEiS - Has the Prime Minisseen the press report that Mr Connell, by chairman of the Local Reference Board in Newcastle, has severely criticized the has chairman of the Central Reference Board for setting aside his, Mr Connell's, findi t ing in connection with the Millfield colliery dispute, and for inflicting coolie conditions on the employees ? Is the honourable gentleman aware that the BeUbird company, which has been operating collieries in Australia for 70 years, has negotiated an agreement giving the men has better conditions even than those preby scribed in the Connell award? Will the and Prime Minister set up a committee of inquiry such as he promised on Friday last to consider, in an endeavour to bring about the smooth working of the coal and last, but not least, to sheet to the real culprits the blame for the the trouble which is occurring in the",14
25,Mr CURTIN,Unknown,"I am this afternoon having an interview with the representaof the Miners Federation, and I to have no doubt that they will make submissions to me. I can only say that I shall weigh them fairly and fully. I have doubt that various tribunals do arrive at different assessments, but it is not the province of a. government to set aside the decisions of properly constituted tribunals. The Government must leave the law to take its course, and the decisions of competent authorities must be respected. At the same time, I am satisfied that events on the coal-fields cannot be explained in terms of ordinary industrial disputes. Some of the stoppages cannot' be explained by anything hitherto known in the history of industrial relations, and I am most anxious to discover the. cause. To. this end, I shall be glad to avail myself of any help I can get. I shall consult with the representatives of the employees this afternoon. I shall, also be quite willing to hear what the owners have to say; but I . put it to the owners and to the workers, and to the country generally, that anything which has to be suffered at the present time, in order toensure the maximum! prodtactionof coal, is worth suffering, and must represent a smaller' disability to those who suffer it than would be the consequences of not continuing' toproduce coal. I say deliberately to the owners that it is their business to assist the G.o.vemment to remove those irritations a.nd exasperationswhich,, in their knowledge of the industry, lead to stoppages:; and,, on the otherhand, I put. it to. the miners that it is their duty not to beeasily provoked into creating stoppages. I know enough about, this business to understand that all the fault is not on side. It. never has been, and. it is not so today. Therefore,, I ask. those associated with the industry, employers and emr pl'oyees alike, to put, aside their own sectional' outlook,, and have regard to. the needs and welfare of the nation.",14
26,Mr HUTCHINSON,Unknown,"Has the Prime Minister seen the report in today's press of a statement, by the executives of theBurwood Miners Lodge that, some of the stoppages; in the mining industry have been ""ridiculous and unconstitutional""?' Has the right honourable gentleman any comment to make on that statement ? Are any mines stopped or are any miners on strike today?' If so, are they the same mines and miners as were not working, yesterday? Are these continual strikes in the coal-mining, industry, after what the right honourable gentleman has previously said, not a flouting of the. will of theCommonwealthGovernment?",15
27,Mr CURTIN,Unknown,"I did read the report of what the lodgeofficials said'. I am' not sitting in judgment: of what they have said f they are an authoritative body and I aceept what-they have said as, being, no doubt, applicable to the circumstances that they were reviewing. There are miners on strike today. They are* not the same miners as were on strike yesterday. As to whether that .is flouting the wishes of the Commonwealth Government, the answer is""Yesi"". If the. honourable gentleman will help me to da more about it, I shall' welcome his co-operation.",15
28,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,What d'ay does the Prime Minister propose *o set aside for the debate on the coal'-mining industry in accordance with his promise last Wednesday?,15
29,Mr CURTIN,Unknown,We are most anxious to proceed with the legislative programme.,15
30,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,"We aTe most anxiousto produce coal, too.",15
31,Mr CURTIN,Unknown,"We are producing coal. If the honourable member has. the ideathat coal production now is not so high as' it has eveT been in Australian history, he is. under an illusion. It is higher than ever before. It is morp necessary than has ever been the. case.",15
32,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,"Is it satisfactory?' Mr CU'R'TIN - It iis not satisfactory. one- The honourable gentleman was a member of a government which was faced with the stoppage of the. coal-mining industry for ten consecutive weeks, and he, did not know how to deal with that.",15
33,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,"I did,, but my. colleagues d'id not.",15
34,Mr CURTIN,Unknown,"I am deeply sensible of the necessity to get all the coal it is possible for this country to get, and I am doing my very best to get it. I wish to thank the miners' officials for the manner in which they have helped the Government. I am appalled at the causes which have been advanced for such stoppages as have occurred, and I hope to overcome them; but I have done more to overcome the deficiency of coal production than the honourable member, who saysthat he knewhaw to. da it, but could not, get his colleaguesto do it.' To theextent that we can get coal this Government is determined to get it.",15
35,Mr FRANCIS,Unknown,"Will the Mmister for Labour and National .Service inform the House how many of the coal-miners Ln New South Wales who were retired from the industry under the coal-miners' pension - scheme have responded to the invitation by Mr Norman Mighell, Chairman of the Coal Commission, and to the subsequent invitation by himself, to return to work in the industry on account of .the great need to produce coal for war purposes?",16
36,Mr WARD,Unknown,"I shall be pleased to supply to the honourable member accurate details on the subject. In response to the appeal by Mr Migbell and myself the names of numbers of men have been furnished by the Miners Federation. These have been submitted to Mr Mighell, so that he may place the men in employment, but so far I have not been advised of where they are to be placed. SIE KEITH MURDOCH. WRITINGS QUOTED BY TOKYO EADIO.",16
37,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"Will the Prime Minister ascertain from the Broadcasting Division of the Department of Information, and inform this House, how many times extracts from articles written by Sir Keith Murdoch have been quoted by enemy radio stations? Will the Prime Minister also inform the House whether the title "" Australia's greatest defeatist"" should not be conferred upon Sir Keith Murdoch, whose writings brand him as one stricken with fear at the possible loss of his private possessions?",16
38,Mr CURTIN,Unknown,"I do not know whether the Australian Broadcasting Commission can answer that question. I cannot say how many times Tokyo radio has quoted Sir Keith Murdoch, mysel: or anybody else. I am not interested as to how many times Tokyo radio quotes anybody, because it ought to be patent to the Australian public, - and to the world at large, that what Tokyo says is not necessarily the truth, and that, in any case, Tokyo is prompted by the desire to advance the cause of the enemy. I know well that statements lend them-elves to quotation, but that is rarely done without either misquotation, the placing of a wrong interpretation upon what has been said, or the suppression of some essential part of the statement allegedly quoted. The people of this nation would do well to place no reliance on what is - said by enemy propagandists. PEICE OF WOOL. Mr .PEOWSE - Is the Minister for Commerce in .a position to communicate - the result of his consultation with the Government of Great Britain with regard to an increased price for Australia's ensuing wool clips?",16
39,Mr SCULLY,Unknown,I have no definite information that I can convey to the House today regarding the negotiations. WAE PEODUCTION.,16
40,Mr MORGAN,Unknown,"Has the Minister for Munitions read the press reports that American production plans now aim at the maximum output of war material in the next six months, and that, instead - of using available material for the equipment of new factories for a maximum production next year, the whole of the nation's resources will be concentrated on existing plants, with a view to striking at the axis this year? Will the Minister state whether it would be advisable to f ollow such a policy in Australia, and to take up with the Minister for War Organization of Industry the subject of closing down non-essential industries? Would it not be wise to convert many of those industries to war production, instead of closing them down?",16
41,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,"Alread y the Munitions Department has adopted the policy that it must be satisfied first that premises that have been vacated, or are available by reason of action taken by the Minister for War Organization of Industry, are inadequate or incapable of providing for the needs of the Munitions Department before sanction will be given to the provision of new annexes for munitions production. CARGO PILLAGING.",16
42,Mr ABBOTT,Unknown,"Has the Acting Attorney-General seen press reports of the proceedings in the Central Police Court, Sydney, on Saturday last, when fourteen wharf labourers were fined for having had stolen goods in their possession? In view of the comment""! of the presiding magistrate and the police concerning the seriousness of cargo pillaging at Australian ports, will the Acting Attorney-General call for a report concerning the men who were fined with a view to determining whether their licences to engage in waterside work should be cancelled?",16
43,Mr BEASLEY,Unknown,"I have seen the refixing ports referred to, but I am not in sion of any further information on the subject. However, I shall call for report, and a reply will be furnished later. NORTH-WEST COAST. BUSINESS DEPRESSION.",17
44,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"In view of the busiMinister ness depression which has descended on towns on the north-west coast of Western Australia because of the war with Japan, and as the Debtors' Relief Regulations not cover all cases of hardship, will Minister for the Army, who. last week gave an undertaking to the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Riordan) consideration would be given to any case made out on behalf of the business community of Cairns for the proclamation of a moratorium, give a similar undertaking with regard to towns on the north-west coast of Western Australia?",17

SERVICES OF STUDENTS.  possessing exceptional educational quali318, ^eations, including two years' successful study at a university, have been called up for service in the Militia, and are performing duties which make no use of their education. Will the Minister the Army consider releasing them from the Army for service in the Royal Austhe tralian Air Force if they should application, and especially if the Force authorities support the application, so that they might take a special course in radio location, or some other technical subject in which their education will be useful ?",17
46,Mr FORDE,Unknown,Sympatheti c consideration will be given to the honourable member's suggestion which has a great deal of merit. MYER EMPORIUM LIMITED .,17
47,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"In view of the strong public feeling on the activities of Myer Emporium Limited by which the people of Melbourne were robbed of £250,000 through .breaches of the priceregulations, will the Minister reprepossessenting the Minister for Trade and Customs give further consideration to the a question of prosecuting Mr Norman Myer or some other principal of the firm for one or more of such breaches?",17
48,Mr BEASLEY,Unknown,"The prices control regulations are the responsibility of the for Trade and Customs before whose notice I placed several questions asked last week about Myer Emporium Limited.

49,Mr BEASLEY,CERTIFICATES OF DEATH ON,"On the 6th May, the honourable member for Watson (Mr. Falstein) drew my attention to an order repreof the Probate Court of New South Wales that the estates of missing members to of the fighting services who were presumed to have been killed should not be distributed unless the beneficiaries furnished a bond. The honourable member asked whether I would consider an amendment to Statutory Rules 1941, No. to provide that grant of probate might be made in the ordinary way. As promised, I referred the matter to the Solicitor-General, who has advised that, where national security regulations for impinge on the law of the six States, legal difficulties may be expected and, in present case, difficulties have arisen make in New South Wales. The question of Air amending regulation 25 of the National Security '(Supplementary) Regulations to remove these difficulties is at present receiving earnest consideration. NA JAPANESE.",17
50,Mr BERNARD CORSER,TREATMENT OF PRISONERS BY,"Some time ago a statement alleging barbaric treatment of Australian prisoners by the Japanese appeared in the press, and the Minister for the Army then promised that a departmental inquiry would be held. Can he say whether the inquiry has been held, and, if so, whether the charges have been proved, or otherwise? Further, has he had an opportunity to interview personally any Australians from New Guinea who were bound by the wrists with fishing cord?",17
51,Mr FORDE,TREATMENT OF PRISONERS BY,"I have met a number of Australians from New Guinea, but not any who had been bound with fishing cord. An inquiry into the charges referred to is now proceeding, and evidence is being taken as to the happenings in New Guinea. I discussed this matter with the Chief of the General Staff, who informed me that as some hundreds of witnesses would have to be examined a fortnight would probably elapse before a report could be furnished. ""WHEAT INDUSTRY. No. 5 POOL.  for Commerce whether it is a fact, that although it has been reported that a return of 3s. lOd. a bushel for bagged wheat can still be expected from the No. 5 Wheat Pool, the price likely to be received by the growers will be about 2s. lOd. a bushel after freight and expenses have been deducted, and that the price for silo wheat will be 2d. a bushel less?",18
52,Mr SCULLY,TREATMENT OF PRISONERS BY,"The interpretation given by the honourable member to reports as to the final payment from the No. 5 Wheat Pool is not quite correct. The guarantee of 3s. lOd. a bushel applied to an aggregate crop of 140,000,000 bushels whereas the wheat received has reached a total of 153,000,000 bushels. Spreading the total amount guaranteed over the 153,000,000 bushels the approximate price payable for bagged wheat will be 3s. 6d. a bushel, less costs which will represent about lOd. or l i d . a bushel. The price for silo wheat will be 2d. a bushel less.",18
53,Mr SPOONER,TREATMENT OF PRISONERS BY,"I ask the Minister for Commerce whether in the original announcements made in respect of the 1941-42 Wheat Pool there may have been room for justifiable misunderstanding by a percentage of farmers as to the guaranteed price ? Will the honourable gentleman consider whether the excess yield has been due to increases of the acreage yield, or to sowings in excess of the quotas originally contemplated? If a combination of these circumstances is thought to have led some farmers to make sowings in anticipation of receiving 3s. lOd. a ibushel, whereas now it has been stated that less will be paid, will the honourable gentleman submit the whole matter to Cabinet for consideration of policy?",18
54,Mr SCULLY,TREATMENT OF PRISONERS BY,"Whils t some of the considerations mentioned by the honourable gentleman may have affected the position, it is beyond doubt that a definite agreement was reached concerning the conditions that should prevail for the 1941-42 harvest. I checked this point this morning with the authorities, and I am quite satisfied that a definite agreement was made between the former Minister for Commerce and representatives of the wheat-growers. However, I shall submit the honourable gentleman's question to Cabinet, which, I am sure, will consider all aspects of the subject.",18
55,Mr ABBOTT,TREATMENT OF PRISONERS BY,"In view of the statement made last Friday by the Minister for 'Commerce to the effect that 153,000,000 bushels of wheat were received into the pool, and that the Government's guaranteed price of 3s. lOd. a ibushel f.o.b. was based on a crop of 140,000,000 bushels, I ask the Minister whether he will recommend to Cabinet that the guaranteed price be paid on 140,000,000 bushels, and that the amount actually received for the balance of 13,000,000 bushels be distributed to the growers as a final payment?",18
56,Mr SCULLY,TREATMENT OF PRISONERS BY,"I shall give consideration to the honourable gentleman's question. Mr MARWIC1L-Is the Minister in a position to say what proportion of the additional quantity of wheat produced this year in excess of 140,000,000 bushels was grown on unlicensed wheat-land, and what effect the wheat grown on unlicensed land has had on the price payable in respect of the whole crop?",18
57,Mr SCULLY,TREATMENT OF PRISONERS BY,"I have been informed by the Australian Wheat Board that about 1,500,000 bushels of wheat was grown on unlicensed areas, but, at the moment, I am not in the position to say whether that quantity is in addition to the 153,000,000 bushels already referred to.

58,Mr RYAN,ACTIVITIES OF VOLUNTARY WAR,"In view of the fact a soldier is entitled to two days leave a month or five days leave every two months, can the Minister for the Army state what arrangements have been made to ensure that, during his leave, the dier may receive his proper quota of tea or of any other foodstuffs which may be rationed i",19

60,Mr CONELAN,ACTIVITIES OF VOLUNTARY WAR,"Is the Minister representing the Minister for Commerce aware that numbers of the voluntary women's organizations which are doing valuable war work in providing cheap meals for members of the fighting services, having been in operation for less than twelve months, are being deprived of their ration quotas in certain commodities? Will the honourable gentleman see that these organizations are placed on the same ration footing as similar organizations which have been operating for more than twelve months?",19
61,Mr BEASLEY,ACTIVITIES OF VOLUNTARY WAR,I shall be pleased to put the honourable gentleman's representations favourably to the Minister for Commerce. POTATO CROP.,19
62,Mr GUY,ACTIVITIES OF VOLUNTARY WAR,"Will the Minister for merce inform me whether it is a fact that the Government has promised to provide for a guaranteed minimum price for potatoes grown during the next was season? If so, when does the honourable gentleman expect to be in a position make a definite statement concerning t price?",19
63,Mr SCULLY,ACTIVITIES OF VOLUNTARY WAR,"No definite promise has been made that a certain guaranteed price will be paid for potatoes in the ensuing season, but a committee, which includes a representative of the Tasting. manian potato industry, has been ings appointed to consider the whole subject. The intentions of the Government will be announced as early as possible. NA NATION AL SERVICE. APPOINTMENTS.",19
64,Mr HARRISON,DEPARTMENT OF LABOUR AND,"On the 8th May, I asked the Minister for Labour and that National Service whether he would give to me details of the service to be performed by Mr G. Sinclair, secretary of the Boilermakers Union, who had been appointed to a position in the Departsol- ment of Labour and Nations! Service. The honourable gentleman promised to furnish the information. Is he yet able to make it available to me? I should also like to know from the honourable gentleman the names of all Labour members and supporters who have been appointed to assist him in departmental work during the last seven months? Will he indicate, in each case, the salary, allowances or other remuneration provided for these persons? The information will be of great interest to the House.",19
65,Mr WARD,DEPARTMENT OF LABOUR AND,"I hope to be able, within the next day or two, to answer the honourable gentleman's question in regard to Mr Sinclair. The preparation of the list of appointees to the department may be more difficult because of the large number of United Australia party supporters placed in positions by the previous Government. PRISONERS OF WAR.",19
66,Mr CLARK,DEPARTMENT OF LABOUR AND,Can the Minister for the Army give me any information concerning the recent escape of certain prisoners of war from a Victorian internComment camp? What action is being taken by the authorities to prevent similar escapes from other internment camps?,19
67,Mr FORDE,DEPARTMENT OF LABOUR AND,"On Thursday last, it ascertained that six German prisouers of war were missing from a party which to was employed in wood-cutting about h j % i miles from a camp near Murchison.

A court of inquiry has been assembled and js now sitI t is anticipated that the proceedwill be completed by Friday of this week. Pending' the receipt of the report of ihe court of inquiry, the mandant has been suspended. The circumstances under which these persons made their escape emphasize the risks associated with the guarding of active, youthful, prisoners of war when they are made available for labour outside of the prison camps.

(c) a woman who has been granted a divorce from her husband and haa not remarried; and (d) a woman whose husband is an inmate of a hospital for the insane.",19
68,Mr HOLLOWAY,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Melbourne P o r t s Minister for Social Services and Minister for Health) [4.15] - The interpretation placed on the provision in paragraph c of the definition ""widow"", in relation to a divorcee is regarded as too narrow, being limited to a woman who is divorced on her own application. I , therefore, move That in the definition of "" widow"", para(c) be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following paragraph:"" (c) a woman whose marriage has beendissolved-' and who has not remarried'; and "". Mr Rosevear, (Dalley) [4.10] The definition of ""deserted w if e "" is: ""a wife who has been deserted by her husband for a period of not less than six months"". Does the Minister propose that a pension shall be payable to every wife who has been deserted, irrespective of who is responsible for the desertion? 1 Under the New South Wales law, a deserted wife who is a claimant for relief payable under local charitable legislation must prove that at least she has endeavoured to compel her husband, by means of a court order, to observe his financial responsibilities. There is no such qualification in this measure. I raise the matter in order that the Minister may realise the possible result. Great diffiwill be experienced in proving that a wife who is living apart from her husband has been genuinely deserted, and that her husband is shirking responsibility for her maintenance, unless she furnishes to the Deputy Commissioner evidence that satisfies him that she is in fact a deserted wife and has taken court proceedings to compel her husband to maintain her if he is able to do so. There should be some proof apart from her own statement that she is a genuinely deserted wife. Many marriages are dissolved by mutual consent. A wife may be as willing to be apart from her husband as the husband to be apart from her.",20
69,Mr CLARK,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Darling) [4.1ft] - The definition of "" widow "" should be extended so as to include the wife of a person who is in receipt of an invalid pension. I drew the Minister's attention to this matter at an earlier stage of the bill. The honourable gentleman should realise that a woman whose husband is totally and permanently incapacitated, and is consequently in receipt of an invalid sion, should be entitled to receive a widow's pension. Because she has no means of livelihood for herself and her children, she is probably in more unfortunate circumstances than a woman whose husband is an inmate of a hospital for the insane, or one who has been deserted by her husband, yet women in both of those categories will be entitled to be classed as widows. The wife of an invalid pensioner would receive child endowment in respect of any children after the first child, would not have any assistance for herself or the first child. She might be in the position of having to care for her invalid husband. Such a woman should be covered by the definition of ""widow"". Where the wife of a man who is in receipt of the old-age pension goes out to work in order to supplement the family income, half of the income earned by her is deemed to be the income of the husband, and the amount by which the pensioner's income exceeds 12s. 6d. is deducted from her husband's pension. Therefore, this is an appropriate opportunity to provide that a woman whose husband is incapable of earning any sum towards the maintenance of his wife and family should receive the same financial assistance from the Commonwealth as will the granted to a widow under this measure. I ask for an assurance that an amendment to cover cases of this kind will be included in the bill.",21
70,Mr CALWELL,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Melbourne) [4.23] This clause is deficient in another respect, apart from those mentioned by the honourable member for Dalley (Mr. Rosevear) and the honourable member for Darling (Mr Clark). Provision should be made so that a woman whose husband is an inmate of a gaol or penal establishment may receive financial assistance. There is no good reason why a woman whose husband is an inmate of a hospital for the insane should be treated differently from a woman whose husband is an inmate of a gaol. In many countries such women are placed both in the same category. Some years ago, when I was a member of the Victorian Public Service, I was appointed investigating officer for a select committee of the Victorian Legislative Assembly that made inpen- quiries regarding the granting of widows' pensions and child endowment, and I had an opportunity to ascertain the condition under which many unfortunate families live. Some harrowing stories were told before the committee, and about 40 cases were submitted by the Children's Welfare Department to me to investigate. The conditions under which families were being maintained constituted a striking tribute to maternal affection under the most adverse circumstances. I can recollect but hearing of women whose husbands were in gaol being compelled to work in order to maintain themselves and their children. In some instances they went to work at an early hour and left their children huddled together in school sheds from 7 a.m. until school commenced at 9 a.m. After school hours the children were left to play in the streets until their mothers returned from their work in the factories or shops. Women should not be treated as social pariahs, merely because their husbands have committed crimes against the State. If a husband is forced to go to gaol, and pay the penalty for his misdeeds, surely punishment should not also be visited upon his dependants. The Bible records that the iniquity of the fathers shall be visited upon the children, unto the third and fourth generation; but there is no justification for a Labour government causing the iniquity of the erring father to be visited on his wife and children. If the Minister will not adopt my suggestion I shall submit an amendment to provide that a woman whose husband is in gaol shall receive the benefits of this measure. In another part of the bill it is provided that a widow who has had five years' residence in Australia immediately prior to the date of her claim for the pension shall be eligible for the benefit of this legislation. I am not opposed to that provision, but I visualize the possibility that payment of the widow's pension may the made in future to many unfortunate European refugees who may settle in Australia. It might so happen that a woman who could scarcely speak English would be eligible for a pension under the bill, whereas an Australian-born woman with Australian-bora children would be denied the benefit of the legislation, because her husband happened to be in gaol. I do not believe that such a discrimination would be supported by the people of this country. Under the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act a person must have resided in Australia for twenty years before being entitled to the pension, but in respect of widows the residential qualification is to be reduced to five years. I agree with that proposition, but we should not make an exception in the case of the unfortunate Australian-born woman whose Australian-horn husband happens to be in gaol. As was mentioned by the honourable member for Darling (Mr Clark), the wife of an invalid pensioner would be far better off financially if her husband were dead. The invalid husband will receive 25s. a week, and will be expected to maintain his wife and himself on that sum. Of course, it is impossible for a wife who has an invalid husband to leave him unattended. If he died his widow would immediately become eligible for benefits to be provided under this bill. desirable in the interests of society that a mother should be with her young children, and that they should not be forced to roam the streets or be sent off early in the morning to school while the mother goes out to earn her living. Experience has shown that lack of parental control is often responsible for children turning to crime at an early age. Where the home influence is strong, there are fewer potential criminals. We do not want to see our gaols filled; we want them to be empty. What a government saves by refusing assistance to destitute mothers it often pays out later in the maintenance of prisoners. We have made provision for a divorced wife when she is the innocent party. I do not object to that, but I fail to why the divorced wife of an erring husorder band should be placed in a better posibecause, tion ihas the undivorced wife-if I may appropriation. use the expression-of a man who has broken the law of the land, and has been sent to gaol.",21
71,Mr FALSTEIN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,Provisio n is made even for a de facto wife.,22
72,Mr CALWELL,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,That is so. If Parliament can take cognizance of the fact that many unmarried people offend against the law of morality by living together,22
73,Mr FALSTEIN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,In sin.,22
74,Mr CALWELL,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Yes , in sin, as the honourable member for Watson states, then surely we can make provision for a legally married wife whose husband, perhaps in a fit of passion, has broken the law and is imprisoned as a result. It is quite possible for men in these troubled times to be sent to gaol for political offences, and as the law now stands, their wives would be compelled to suffer for the opinions of their husbands. There are in this House today several honourable members who, at one time or another, have committed political offences against the law, and have been prosecuted. I ask them to think what might have happened to their wives and children if they had gone to gaol instead of paying fines. What would be their reaction today if they were not members of Parliament and heard that legislation was being passed that made no provision for cases similar to their own ? The legisI t is lation of at least one State in Australia provides that a woman whose husband is in gaol may receive some assistance from the State. In other States, there is no such law, and I believe that, whether there is any State provision of the kind or not, this bill should be amended so as to make eligible for pensions women belonging to the last two remaining classes unprovided for, namely, those whose husbands are in gaol, and who have young children in their care. I do not know whether the Minister has been sufficiently impressed with my arguments to be able to state now that he is prepared to agree to my proposal, or whether I should at this stage move an amendment to give effect to it.  see The honourable member would not be in if he did move such an amendment if carried, it would increase the",22
75,Mr CALWELL,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Then can you advise me what further steps I must take in order to secure the Minister's consent to my proposal? I have stated all my arguments as succinctly as possible, and I should now like to know whether the Minister intends to accept my proposal.",23
76,Mr HOLLOWAY,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Melbourne P o r t s Minister for Social Services and Minister for Health) [4.3S] - I remind the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Rosevear) that, in my second-reading speech, I said that the term "" deserted w if e "" included a woman who had taken legal action against her husband for desertion. This definition is included in the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act, but by some oversight it was omitted from this bill. I assuTe the honourable member that the omission will be rectified. I cannot promise at this stage to give effect to the proposal put forward by the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr. Calwell)'. I think that there is State legislation which enables assistance given to. women whose husbands are in gaol.",23
77,Mr CALWELL,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,Not in Victoria.,23
78,Mr HOLLOWAY,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"No one can refute the logic of the honourable member's argument, but I fail to see how the Governnnent could classify as a widow a woman whose husband may be in gaol for six months, then out of it for a time, and then back in gaol again.",23
79,Mr CALWELL,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,It could be provided that a wifewould become eligible for a pension if her husband were sent to gaol for a period of two years or more.,23
80,Mr HOLLOWAY,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"The provision might be made to apply to the wives of life prisoners, just as it applies to the wives of insane men, who are generally kept in institutions for the remainder of their lives. I cannot see how the honourable member's proposal could be incorporated in this legislation. 1",23
81,Mr CALWELL,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,Why not? Similar provision is made in the legislation of countries.,23
82,Mr HOLLOWAY,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"I cannot give a promise now. The honourable member for Darling (Mr Clark) referred to a matter which on more than one occasion has been considered by Cabinet. To give effect to his proposal would cost £650,000 for the 1 known cases. His arguments appealed very strongly to me, but the provision be seeks cannot be made in this bill because of the budgetary position. I assure him that his proposal will be one of the next to be considered.",23
83,Mr SPOONER,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Robertson) [4.40] The observations of the two honourable members who preceded the Minister for Social Services (Mr Holloway) cause me to direct attention to the fact that no Australian-wide scheme of widows' pensions or child endowment will ever be complete unless accompanied by and. administered in conjunction with a child welfare scheme. In the State of New South Wales, where widows' pensions have been paid for many years, a scheme of child welfare operates. I am not prepared to say that it is the best available, but it provides a wonderful opportunity for the Commonwealth Government to examine the matter of child welfare. I do not desire that the thorough work of the Joint Committee on Social Security be duplicated; but to be there is need for some investigation to supplement the committee's report. Evidence could be obtained from experts in child welfare. Without the operation of a child welfare scheme, widows' pensions and child endowment will become, in many cases, mere financial hand-touts, and will not go to the root of the problem of the human and cultural rehabilitation of the family in need. I hope that the Minister will take that matter to Cabinet and set in motion such an investigation as. will cause to be brought into operation a child welfare scheme which will make the widows' pensions and 'child endowment schemes more successful.",23
84,Mr ROSEVEAR,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Dalley) [4.43] - I understand that certain provisos as to the eligibility of deserted wives to receive the widows' pension are to be embodied' in regulations; but the act is the place to which people will look,, and, with the other agreement of the Minister, I propose to move an addendum to the definition of "" deserted wife "" to provide that the applicant must show that legal proceedings for maintenance had been taken against the husband.",23
85,Mr HOLLOWAY,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,I agree to that.,23
86,Mr ROSEVEAR,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"The present definition permits a woman who is living away from her husband by mutual consent to apply for and be granted a widow's pension, although she may be satisfied with her mode of life. I have not the least doubt that, in such cases, a husband, knowing that no penalty was attachable to him, if asked by the Commissioner, or even by a magistrate, whether he had deserted his wife, would say that he had.",23
87,Mr JOLLY,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"What if a husband said "" No ""?",24
88,Mr ROSEVEAR,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,That would be the end of it. A woman who successfully made application for maintenance could not claim the pension. I do not think that it is the intention of the Government that women who are living apart from their husbands by mutual consent shall be entitled to draw the pension.,24
89,Mr HOLLOWAY,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,It is not.,24
90,The CHAIRMAN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Before the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Eosevear) can move his amendment, it will be necessary for the Minister to withdraw his amendment temporarily. Amendment-by leave-temporaril y withdrawn. Amendment (by Mr Rosevear) proposed - That, in the definition of "" deserted wife "", deserted. after the word "" m o n t h s "" the following words be added :- "" provided that the applicant etui show that legal proceedings for maintenance had been taken against the husband "".",24
91,Mr JOLLY,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Lilley) [4.45] - Before agreeing to the proposed amendment, the committee ought to be aware of what it means. Does the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Eosevear) mean that all a woman would have to do in order to qualify for a widow's pension would be to start legal proceedings for maintenance? What would happen if she succeeded in such proceedings?",24
92,Mr ROSEVEAR,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,Sh e would not qualify for the pension. A woman maintained by her husband could not draw the pension.,24
93,Mr MORGAN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Reid) [4.46] - I do not like the proposed amendment. Th<>re i.i .sufficient protection already in the bill. Thf Cr^Tniesioner of Pensions can order an inrmiry into any application for a pension Wrmpn should not be forced tn take legal proceedings against their husbands in order to qualify for the widow's pension. Many women are reluctant to apply to the courts for maintenance orders against their husbands. A magistrate taking evidence on oath or the Commissioner himself, under the provisions of the bill, would be able to satisfy himself as to whether a woman had been deserted. Mr lALSTEIN (Watson) [4.48] - I find difficulty in understanding the purpose of the amendment. The intention of the Minister is abundantly clear. What I also find difficult to understand is when desertion shall be deemed to have taken place. Will that date be when legal proceedings for maintenance orders were instituted, or will it be some other date which may be fixed as between the parties.",24
94,Mr ROSEVEAR,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,The pension will become payable six months after a wife has been deserted.,24
95,Mr FALSTEIN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,But how will that date be determined?,24
96,Mr BLACKBUKN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,The department will decide that.,24
97,Mr FALSTEIN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"If that is so, the department will be equally able to determine what evidence shall be necessary to establish whether a wife has been",24
98,Mr ROSEVEAR,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,Does the honourable member say that women living apart from their husbands by mutual arrangement should be entitled to the pension?,24
99,Mr FALSTEIN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"No . Separation by mutual arrangement is not desertion. The definition is sufficiently clear. If the department is to reserve to itself the right to determine the date when desertion occurs, it equally has the right to determine what constitutes desertion, and what evidence shall he produced in order to establish that desertion has taken place. Sir FREDERICK STEWART fParramatta) [4.50] - I agree with the proposed amendment of the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Rosevear) which I understand the Minister in charge of the bill (Mr Holloway) is prepared to accept, but, in my opinion, it needs strengthening in order to meet the possibility suggested by the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Jolly). That could be done by providing that any proceedings for maintenance shall be bona fide to the satisfaction of the Commissioner. Obviously, it would be just as easy to make a pretence of the law proceedings as of the desertion.",24
100,Mr FALSTEIN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Why not let the Commissioner decide everything, and not force the parties to make application court?",25
101,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"I do not agree with the contention of the honMinister orable member for Watson that the ing it? bill as drafted will give sufficient protection. As the bill now stands the fact of desertion has only to be established for the claimant to be entitled to a pension, notwithstanding that the desertion may be more pretended than real. The graph suggestion of the honourable member for Dalley could be met by an amendment clause 14 which deals with disqualificadissolved tions for pension.",25

The position could be met by inserting a new sub-clause 6 to the following effect:-"" A pension shall not be granted to a widow, being a deserted wife, unless the widow has such action as the Commissioner, or the that position?

105,The CHAIRMAN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"As the amendvolve ment would increase the amount of the appropriation it is not in order, unless moved by the Minister.",25
106,Mr CALWELL,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Would it necessarily increase the appropriation? At stage everything is based on conjecture, and no one knows how much monav will be appropriated.",25
107,The CHAIRMAN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"There could be no purpose in moving the amendment if it would not increase.the appropriation. In the opinion of the Chair, the amendment would increase the appropriation, and therefore it is not competent for the honto the orable member to move it.",25

114,Mr CLARK,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Darling) [4.58] - I again stress the necessity for inserting a proto cover the wife of an invalid penless sioner. The Minister's argument that an amendment of this character would inan expenditure of £650,000 is, in my opinion, justification for acceptance of the amendment, as it shows that numbers of women, whose husbands are incapable through ill health of providing this for them, have difficulty in maintaining adequately themselves and their families. Would I be in order in moving that the definition of "" widow "" shall include "" a wife whose husband is totally and permanently incapacitated "" ?",25
115,The CHAIRMAN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,Such an amendment would not be in order unless it were moved by the Minister in charge of the bill.,26

118,Mr HOLLOWAY,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"The Government wishes to get this bill through the committee today, but I shall discuss with the Treasurer the possibility of introducing an amendment to give effect to the honourable member's wishes.",26
119,Mr FALSTEIN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Watson) [4.59] - I desire to know whether the word "" dissolved "" in the amendment is used in its legal sense, namely, that a marriage has been dissolved as the result of a petition for the dissolution of a marriage, or as a result of some similar application to a competent court; or whether the word is to be interpreted according to general usage to cover a wife who, having become dissatisfied with her husband, has separated from him. In such an instance would the marriage be regarded as having been dissolved, and would the woman be entitled to the benefits of this legislaor tion ?",26
120,Mr HOLLOWAY,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,The word must be interpreted in a legal sense. Amendment agreed to.,26
121,Mr CALWELL,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Melbourne) [5.1] Mr Chairman, I ask you to reconsider your ruling that I may not at this stage move the amendment which I previously indicated that I desired to move. When the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Rill was under discussion, its scope was considerably increased, and that must have had the effect of increasing the appropriation required for the purposes of that measure.",26
122,The CHAIRMAN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Unde r the Standing Orders, and according to practice, the Chair is not empowered to allow an amendment by a private member that would increase an appropriation. Manifestly, the amendment suggested by the honourable member would do so. Of course, the Minister for Social Services could move the amendment, but a further message from the Governor General would be required.",26
123,Mr CALWELL,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"I move That further consideration of the clause be postponed. I do so in order that I may consult certain eminent authorities, who may or may not agree with your ruling, Mr. Chairman. I understand that I may submit such a motion without obtaining the Minister's consent.",26
124,The CHAIRMAN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"The clause has already been considered and amended, and, under the Standing Orders, further consideration of an amended clause may not be postponed.",26
125,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"I rise to a point of order. I understand that you, Mr Chairman, have ruled that the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr. Calwell) cannot move to alter the qualifications required of a candidate for a widow's pension under clause 4 of the bill, and that you have given as your reason that the proposed amendment would increase the appropriation. Clause 4 is not an appropriation clause. I ask that the message transmitted to the House by the Governor General be read to this committee. It did not state whether the persons who were to qualify for pensions under the bill should be de facto widows, women whose husbands were in gaol, or in Hong Kong or anywhere else. The message requested that an appropriation of money be made in order to provide a fund from which to pay pensions to widows. The definition of ""widow"" is a matter to be dealt with in the bill, and, therefore, it is a matter for this committee to decide. I ask that the Governor General's message be read to the committee.",26
126,The CHAIRMAN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"I explain to the honourable member that an extension of the definition of ""widow"" in order to make another class of persons eligible for the widow's pension as is desired by the honourable member for Melbourne, would necessitate an increase of the appropriation.",26

131,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,I move That the ruling of the Chairman be dissented from . The proceedings of this committee are becoming rather Gilbertian.,27
132,The CHAIRMAN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Order ! The honourable member has contributed more .than anybody else to this discussion. MT. ARCHIE CAMERON - I done so. Your ruling, Mr Chairman, is not, even founded on common sense.",27
133,The CHAIRMAN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,Order ! The honourable member must confine his remarks to the question now before the committee.,27
134,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"I am prepared to do so, but I do not want to hear any comments fro m you about my conduct in this place.",27
135,The CHAIRMAN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,Order ! The honourable member is not in order in criticizing the proceedings of this committee.,27
136,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"There plenty of cause for such .criticism. If your ruling is to stand, Mr Chairman, the result will be that, no matter what measure comes before this committee, honourable members will not be permitted to move any amendment affecting qualifications for the receipt of public money, on the ground that any such amendment would increase an appropriation. The recommendation for an appropriation of .money for widows' pensions provides, according to my recollection, "" for the payment of pensions to widows"". The word "" widows "" was not defined in that message from the Governor General, nor was the amount of the appropriation mento tioned. Two important matters must considered by this committee. One is the definition of the term "" widow"", which should be considered now; the other the amount of money to be appropriated for the payment of widows' pensions, which should be considered at a later stage. Therefore, I say that your ruling, g Mr Chairman, is utterly wrong. According to my memory, the provisions of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Bill , which was considered in this place last week, were widened so as to extend the payment of old-age pensions to certain Kanakas from the South Sea Islands. That amendment involved an increase of the appropriation.",27
137,Mr HOLLOWAY,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,The payment of pensions to Kanakas was provided for in the original bill.,27
138,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,I understand that some increases were made.,27
139,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,No .,27
140,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"I say "" Yes "" . En any ease, amendments requiring increases of appropriations have been have not agreed to time after time in this place. If this ruling is to stand, honourable members will be able to do nothing more than assent to or dissent from any recommendations for the appropriation of public funds. They will be prevented from deciding in detail the purposes for which appropriations sball be used. I should like to see the standing order which, according to you, Mr Chairman, provides that in committee honourable members may not vary the qualifications required of a person who - receives money from the Crown. Recommendations made in mesis sages from the Governor General are always wide, because this committee must bave full power to decide what should be done with appropriations so recommended. For the time being, I shall leave the matter at this stage, but I request that the Governor General's message, recommending an appropriation to meet the requirements of this bill, be read to the committee. Honourable members will find that it imposes no limitations. It is for this committee to decide the definition of "" widow "".",27
141,Mr HOLLOWAY,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"I hope that honourable members will not allow their desires overrule their judgment in considering be the issue before the Chair. The Chairman's ruling is undoubtedly correct, as the honourable member for Barker (MT . is Archie Cameron) must realise when he considers the matter carefully. The bill provides for the payment of pensions to a widow, a de facto widow, a deserted wife, a woman who has been granted a. divorce from her husband and has not Te-married, and a woman whose husband is an inmate of a hospital for the insane. The honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell) now desires to include in the definition the wifeof a man serving a term of imprisonment exceeding three months. Obviously, such a provision would increase the amount of money required to meet the cost of the scheme.",27
142,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,No amount of money has been specified in the appropay priation message.,28
143,Mr HOLLOWAY,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"The amount was would determined when the Government comtion pleted its plan to pay these pensions. If the classes of persons eligible pension be increased, obviously amount of money necessary will also to be increased. The honourable gentleacceptance man's contention that the appropriation will not need to be increased is a quibble.",28
144,Mr CALWELL,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"I support the motion of dissent. If the Chairman's ruling correct, honourable members of this Parfor liament are obviously debarred from moving amendments to bills of this character. The term "" widow "" was not defined in the Governor General's messary sage.. If the amendment which has ruled out of order had proposed an increase of the pension from 25s. to 26s. week, or the payment of pensions to children, or to other persons, an assumpthat tion that the appropriation would need to be increased would be justified. how can an accurate estimate be made of the amount of money involved in this scheme, seeing that provision is being example. made, for the payment of pensions to persons in Australia who have been widows for five years immediately prior to the date of their claim?' Pensions canbe paid to widows of enemy soldiers who come to this country with their children when the war is over because they believe that life under the. Southern Cross will safer and. happier than in war-torn Europe. If this ruling be sustained the members of this Parliament will be reduced to the status of members of the German Reichstag and the Chairtion man of Committees will become a kind of Marshal Goering whose call for the "" ""Fni-1."" must bo responded to by one. My amendment to provide for the That payment of pensions to women whose husbands are serving a term of imprisonment of more than three months, and also the proposal of the honourable member for Barling (Mr Clark), have been ruled out of order on the ground that their acceptance by the committee would increase the appropriation, but how can it be assumed with any exactitude that the appropriation would be increased? There might be a saving in the amount of money estimated to be necessary to pensions already provided for in the bill. As no evidence has been submitted to the committee that my amendment necessarily increase the appropriaI support the motion of dissent. for the The CHAIRMAN - The honourable the member for Barker (Mr Archie have Cameron) .may, perhaps, realise that of the amendment of the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr. Calwell) must necessarily involve an increase of the appropriation when 1 be point out to him that when the Minister Social Services (Mr Holloway) intimated that he was prepared to accept' certain amendments suggested in the second-reading debate, he found it necesto fortif y himself with another been message from the Governor-jGeneral.",28
145,Mr CURTIN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,All honourable gentlemeir a who have been private members of this Parliament for any length of time know on innumerable occasions they have been prevented from moving amendments But to bills involving the expenditure of public moneys. I refer to the National Health and Pensions Insurance Bill as an,28
146,Mr SPENDER,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,And a very good one.,28
147,Mr CURTIN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"It is open to the Minister in charge of the bill involving the expenditure of public money to indicate that he is prepared to consider favourably suggestions for amendments the effect of be which will increase the appropriation, but before even he may move them,, he must fortify himself with an additional message from the Governor General. Such messages may be submitted for consideraat any stage of a .bill, but the usual practice is to present the message when bill is being introduced . The message 1 every is always followed by a motioni t is expedient that an appropriation of revenue be made for the purposes of a bifT in this case, for a bill for the payment of pensions to widows. When this bill was introduced the Minister for Social Services intimated that it was estimated that the cost of the scheme would be £1,600,000.",28
148,Mr MORGAN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,That is an estimate.,29
149,Mr CURTIN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Of course it is an estimate, but it is the amount covered by the appropriation, for which the Government must make provision. The Constitution makes it perfectly clear that no expenditure of this character may be authorized by the Parliament except as the result of the consideration of a message from the Governor General. Our practice in this regard has not varied since the inception of federation. As the Chairman of Committees has pointed out, when the Minister for Social Services indicated that the Government was prepared to accept two amendments suggested during the second-reading debate, the honourable gentleman had to fortify himself with an additional appropriation message. Although the Chairman of Committees rightly declined to accept the amendment of the honourable member for Melbourne, it would, nevertheless, be quite proper for that honourable gentleman to submit a case to the Minister in support of his proposal. If the Minister were convinced of the soundness of the case, and if the Government agreed to a proposal of the nature outlined, an amendment could be moved by the Minister himself, or else the Senate may be invited to request that the bill be amended in the desired direction. The point is that only a member of the Parliament who is qualified to present a message from the Governor General providing for an increase of the appropriation is competent to move such an amendment. I do not see how public expenditure could the controlled except on that basis.",29
150,Mr HOLT,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"The Prime Minister has explained very carefully the practice of Parliament, but he might have made the position clearer for those honourable members who have had little experience of parliamentary procedure, by explaining to them the underlying principle, namely, that responsibility for financial measures belongs to the Government itself. It is rather misleading to suggest that there is some mysterious procedure associated with the receipt of a message from the Governor General in accordance with the requirements of the Constitution. The fact is that the Government is responsible for financial measures, and Parliament cannot amend those measures except by taking action which would displace the Government from office. In this instance, an amendment has been propose.! which would increase the amount of money to be expended. The interesting piece of sophistry indulged in by the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr. Calwell), namely, that in some other category the expenditure might not come up to the estimate, and that, therefore, the total expenditure might not be mor.' than that contemplated in the bill in its present form, does not alter the situation. The Government must necessarily estimate future expenditure, and if an amendment be passed providing for increased expenditure in a particular category, then it must be assumed that the total expenditure also will be increased by that amount. It is surely straining the language to say that a woman whose husband is in gaol for a period of three months or more is a widow.",29
151,Mr CALWELL,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,The bill regards a divorced woman or a deserted wife as a widow.,29
152,Mr HOLT,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,On e might as well say that is woman is a widow whose husband has gone off to spend a week-end in Manly.,29
153,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"The Prime Minister advanced a clever and specious argument. I remind honourable members, however, that the message of the Governor General recommending an appropriation merely stated that this committee should provide a sum of money for the purposes of a bill, and that sum of money is not named in the bill or anywhere else. The only figure mentioned in the bill is the rate of pension or allowance that shall be paid to a widow. It is for this committee, and for no one else, to determine who is entitled to receive that pension. It is absurd for the Prime Minister to argue that every proposal is out of order which does not fit in with the Government's ideas in regard to a bill which has not yet been passed by the Parliament. There may be important and honest differences of opinion regarding what a bill means. I have always had a great admiration for Charles I . and the other Stuarts, and it seems to me that their methods were, in some respects, much more intelligible than those of the Prime Minister.",29
154,The CHAIRMAN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,I trust that the honourable member is not trying to qualify for the role of Cromwell?,30
155,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"That is last thing I should like to do. Is it seriously suggested that when a bounty bill is before the committee, no one may move to vary the qualification upon which the bounty is to be paid ? The important point in connection with this matter is that no specific sum is mentioned in the bill, except the weekly rate of pension.",30
156,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,But message must be read in connection with the draft bill introduced by the Minister.,30
157,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"What this committee agrees to becomes law, and is for the committee to sa.y to whom pensions shall be paid.",30
158,Mr CURTIN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"The time to take action in that direction is on the motion for the second reading. It is then comrespect petent for an honourable member to move that the bill be withdrawn and re-drafted that act? to provide for this or that. I have moved a dozen such motions, including one on similar in the National Health and Pensions Insurance Bill, but it was defeated.",30
159,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"I say that amount to be appropriated under this has not been determined, either by the Government or by this committee.

169,Mr RYAN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Flinders) [5.35] - Wha would happen in the case of a widow who had been maintaining children until she had reached the age of 40 years 45 years, and whose last child had passed the age of sixteen years? Would she be suddenly thrown on the world without a pension ? This provision would operate harshly in respect of widows who had spent the greater part of their lives in raising families and were suddenly cut off from all financial help. I suggest the consideration of the Minister that some thought should be given to helping women in this category. They might granted a period of, say, six months, in years. which to seek employment, before the pension is taken from them, or discreprovides tionary power might be given to the both. Commissioner to continue the payment of the pension in certain cases in which it appears that there is reasonable ground for doing so. I hope that the anomaly widowwill be corrected.",31
170,Mr BLACKBURN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Bourke) [5.38] I. support the request of the honourable member for Fiinders (Mr Ryan). The bill does not make clear what is to happen to a woman who has been drawing the State pension under paragraph a, and child has passed the age of sixteen years or has died under that age. Clause 21, which is the disqualifying clause, sets out certain events upon which a widow's right to the pension should be devested, but it makes no reference to the case where the child whom she is mainis taining has reached the age of sixmonwealth teen years or has died younger. It provides, inter alia, that the pension shall not be payable for any period after the pensioner ceases to be resident in Australia, marries or remarries, or, being a deserted wife, ceases to be a legislation? deserted wife otherwise than by the death of her husband. No provision is made for the woman who, having been entitled to a pension under paragraph a of clause a State may do.

In my view, the pension should the continued automatically to a mother who has passed the age of 45 years, even though her child has died or reached the age of sixteen years.",31

179,Mr CALWELL,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"That answers the question put by the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron). I should like to know what the position will be in respect of widows in New South Wales who will receive increased payments after the passage of certain legislation through the Parliament of that State. I am not sure whether the legislation has yet been passed, but I know that it was introduced in the Legislative Assembly. Is it intended to permit the benefit to be conferred under the Commonwealth Widows' Pensions Bill to be augmented by the amount payable under the State legislation; or, does the Treasurer intend to deduct from the grant to be made by the Commonwealth to the State not"" only the amount actually expended by it in respect of widows' pensions during the last two years, but also the amount involved in the State legislation at present under consideration ?",32
180,Mr CHIFLEY,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,The bills to establish uniform income tax propose that there shall be deducted from the compensation to the State of New South Wales only the equivalent of £1 a week in respect of each widow and 5s. a week in respect of the first child.,32
181,Mr CALWELL,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,Then it would be possible for a widow in New South Wales to receive the benefit of this legislation and also the amending legislation at present before the Parliament of New South Wales?,32
182,Mr CHIFLEY,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"The Commonwealth proposal is concerned only with a simple means test-wha t a widow receives from any source. Payments under State legislation will be taken intoconsideration. Mr Calwell.:-If a widow receives an additional benefit from the State, an equivalent amount will be deducted from what she would otherwise be entitled to receive under Commonwealth legislation.",32
183,Mr CHIFLEY,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"If warranted by the amount of income derived, such a deduction would be made.",32
184,Mr CALWELL,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"I have previously pointed out that the Government of Yictoria, through the Charities Board, is able to profit because of payments made under Commonwealth legislation.",32
185,Mr SCULLIN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,That is true of all States.,32
186,Mr CALWELL,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"It ought not to be true of any State. Legislation of this kind should contain provision for the protection of the Commonwealth Treasury against State governments obtaining a benefit which this Parliament intended should be enjoyed by children, widows, or other persons. The Minister for Social Services has said that the matter will be raised at a Premiers Conference. That does not satisfy me. I am not assured that the Premiers would be in a receptive mood if the Commonwealth should tell them that they must not make such profits. Commonwealth legislation should be so framed that its validity may, if necessary, stand the test of appeal to the High Court. I should be immensely intrigued to know exactly how the officers who are to administer this act ascertained the number of persons widowed, or likely to he widowed, during a period of five years immediately preceding the date of a claim for a widow's pension. I said at an earlier stage that it is possible that quite a lot of persons will wish to come to Australia from European countries at the termination of the war. Many of them will be the widows of men killed in the conflict. After a residence of five yeais in Australia, they will be entitled to claim the benefits of this legislation, whether they were widowed before or after their arrival in this country. Whatever appropriation has been fixed; the Govcrnor-<xeneral has been misled; because it is not possible for any official to say what this scheme is likely to cost. What irks me considerably is the thought that a number of refugees who will come to Australia because tliey think it will provide, them with an asylum in which the conditions are much easier generally than they have experienced in the land that gave them birth will obtain an advantage over Australian-born subjects whose husbands happen to be in gaol or are invalid pensioners. I can see no reason why, in respect of future substantial social benefits, those who might never speak our language, but, on the contrary, may congregate in settlements and speak a foreign tongue, should receive better treatment than those of our own kith and kin who have assisted to advance the welfare of this country, and whose parents or grandparents laid the foundations of the prosperity which we of this generation enjoy. Several days have elapsed since I raised this matter on the second reading. I hope that the Minister will be able to tell us more than has been vouchsafed to us so far in respect of the probable cost of this bill.",32
187,Mr JOLLY,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Lilley) [5.50] - I understood the Treasurer (Mr Chifley) to say that as a. corollary to the uniform taxation we should have uniform social services in Australia, but we have no assurance that the uniform taxation legislation will be passed or that the State Governments will not be able to increase their social services. The Minister for Social Services (Mr Holloway) said that the Government would not take into consideration any pensions paid by the States.",33
188,Mr HOLLOW AT,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,No ; I said that we could not dictate to the States what they should or should not do.,33
189,Mr JOLLY,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"- I take it that, if a State continues to pay pensions to widows, those payments will be taken into consideration by the Commonwealth Commissioner of Pensions when he applies the means test to applicants for the Commonwealth widows' pension. It should be laid down definitely that receipt by a widow of a pension from a State shall disqualify that widow from receipt of a pension from the Commonwealth. I , therefore, move That in sub-clause (1.), after paragraph (f f ) , the following paragraph be inserted:"" (ft) if she is paid a widow's pension widows' pension aet of a State."".",33
190,Mr CHIFLEY,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"That would complicate matters. Any income of a widow, whether it be by way of pension from a State or not, will be taken into consideration under the means test.",33
191,Mr JOLLY,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"1 differ from the Treasurer on that point. Some of the States make an allowance to widows, but they do not describe it as a widows' pension. The Parliament should make it clear that its intention is that there shall be a uniform widows' pension throughout Australia. We cannot have uniform taxation unless ultimately we have uniform social services. The only thing to do is to amend the clause in the way I suggest.",33
192,Mr BLACKBURN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Bourke) [5.54]. I oppose the proposed amendment, the meaning of which is that, if a widow receives a widows' pension from a State, no matter what the amount may be, she shall be disqualified from receiving a widows' pension from the Commonwealth. If that is to be the policy of the Commonwealth Government, it will simply mean that the powers of the State are to be dried up altogether. Is it the policy of this Parliament that the States shall go altogether out of the field of social service? Clause 15 provides that the permissible income from other sources of a recipient of the widows' pension shall not exceed £32 10s. per annum, and that the annual rate at which the amount of the pension is determined shall be reduced by the amount by which the income exceeds that limit. That is sufficient safeguard, and we should be satisfied and should reject any proposal designed to forbid the States to provide social services. Some writers held that it would be possible for the States to pay an old-age pension at the same time as the Commonwealth Government was paying an old-age pension, but, of course, the States retired from the field when the Commonwealth entered it. The amendment proposed by the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Jolly) warns the States off the field of social services altogether.",33
193,Mr JOLLY,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,-Mus t that not happen ultimately when we have uniform taxation?,33
194,Mr BLACKBURN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Not necessarily. under a I am opposed to uniform taxation, but the proposed amendment merely rubs salt into the wound. It would mean, if agreed to, that the States would never be able to offer anything by way of social benefits to their people. The Commonwealth would provide all social services and the States would be forbidden to provide an auxiliary benefit of the same kind, because, if a widow received 7s. 6d. from a State, she would, under the proposed amendment, lose 25s. a week from the Commonwealth. I hope that the Government will not agree to amend the clause in the direction desired by the honourable member for Lilley.",33
195,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Parramatta) [5.58] - A feature of this legislation which appeals to the Minister for Social Services (Mr Holloway) no less than to me, because he referred to it in his speech, is that it will create a social service uniform throughout the Commonwealth. I am not at all dismayed by the suggestion of the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Blackburn) that the proposed amendment would exclude the State governments from conferring a social service by way of widows' pensions. I believe that is most desirable.",34
196,Mr STACEY,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,But it would not achieve that.,34
197,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"No , but the honourable member for Bourke was dismayed lest it should. No State persevered with old-age pensions after the 'Commonwealth old-age pensions scheme was instituted. The State of New South Wales vacated the field of child endowment when the Commonwealth Child Endowment Act was passed. I am sure that the great majority of honourable members and of the community anticipate that there will be a similar Tesult from the passage of this legislation. It is inconceivable, although I admit that it would not be illegal- I support this proposed amendment because I desire to make it illegalto have operating concurrently in some States, State widows' pension schemes and a Commonwealth widows' pension scheme. The situation is made worse in this instance because in New South Wales at present there is a generous widows' pension, in Victoria one much less generous, and none at all in the other States. I warn the Treasurer (Mr. Chifley) that unless action along the of the amendment be taken the effect on another bill which is to come before us will be serious. Prom the remarks of the Treasurer on Friday last, honourable members generally assumed that it was proposed to adjust the finances as between those States which had certain social services and the Federal Treasury. If , however, we take no steps to prevent New South Wales from running a scheme of widows' pensions concurrently with the Commonwealth scheme, there will be no justification for making a financial adjustment with New South Wales in that connection. No one will accuse me of lack of sympathy with widows and orphans, but it is almost Gilbertian to suggest that we should have a Commonwealth scheme of widows' pensions operating throughout Australia concurrently with a scheme of widows' pensions operating in certain States, but not all States. I shall support the amendment.",34
198,Mr STACEY,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Adelaide) [6.2] - I shall probably be compelled to support the amendment of the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Jolly). At present there are schemes of widows' pensions in operation in New South Wales and Victoria, although the basis of the schemes is different. Bills to provide for uniform taxa tion have been introduced to this Parliament. Should they become law, there will be only one system of income taxation in Australia. With that scheme of uniform taxation in operation, certain moneys would have to be allocated to certain States to pay for State pension schemes. That would mean that the Commonwealth Government would be paying two pensions to widows in New South Wales and Victoria and only one pension to widows in the other States. I emphasize that the whole of the money will have to be found by the Commonwealth once the States vacate the field of taxation. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will see his way clear to accept the amendment.",34
199,Mr RYAN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,Flinders) [6.4] - All honourable members are agreed that no citizen of this country should draw a pension on the same qualification from both the Commonwealth and a State.,34
200,Mr HOLLOWAY,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,No Government lines would be generous enough to allow it.,34
201,Mr RYAN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"I agree with the principle underlying the amendment of the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Jolly). The pension of a widow in New South Wales under the scheme in operation in that State is 25s. a week, whereas the Victorian scheme provides for a pension of only 10s. a week. ""We must be careful not to deprive a widow in Victoria of her Commonwealth pension of 25s. a week because she receives a pension of 10s. a week from the State. It would be better to accept the limitation included in the bill, and recommended by the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Blackburn), namely £32 10s. per annum.",34
202,Mr FALSTEIN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,Watson) [6.51] - The amendment means that a widow who hitherto received a pension from the Government of New South Wales or Vicr toria would be disqualified from receiving a pension from the Commonwealth.,35
203,Mr SPENDER,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"No , but she could not have both.",35
204,Mr FALSTEIN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"A widow who has no income but a widow's pension would be debarred from obtaining from any other source, such as a State government, an amount in excess of £32 10s. a year. As the position is now, a widow in New South Wales or Victoria would be able to receive at least 12s. 6d. a week from the State Government. Before this legislation was introduced into this Parliament, no pensions were paid to widows outside New South Wales and Victoria, SO' that persons wbo now benefit from the legislation of those States will be in no worse position, relatively, than the persons who will benefit by the addition of this pension to the amount of 12s. 6d. a week. As the bill stands, without the amendment, widows in New South Wales and Victoria will be entitled to receive from the State Government an amountequal to 12s. 6d. a week. I believe that they should be allowed, to have that money. I do not agree that 25s. a week, or even 37s. 6d. a week, is an adequate payment to them.",35
205,Mr SPOONER,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Robertson) [6.8] - I should not be prepared to accept the amendment of the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Jolly) unless I were satisfied that it had been investigated thoroughly in order to ensure that there would be no unfavorable repercussions. It is unforWales tunate that, after the announcement of a Commonwealth-wide scheme of widows' pensions, there should have been introduced into one State parliament a measureto providefor a pension to widows at the same rate as is proposed in this bill. I understand that in New South Wales a widow is entitled to a pension of 25s. a week for herself and 10s. a week for each child. This bill provides for 25s. a week for the widow and 5s. a week for the first child, any other children being covered by the existing scheme of child endowment. That will cause complications. In replying to one honourable member, the Treasurer (Mr Chifley) said that the means test would protect the revenue of the Commonwealth. That is so. The application of the means test will ensure that a widow shall not receive the full Commonwealth pension while she is receiving more than £32 10s. a year from other sources, including any State pension scheme. There is no foundation for the fear which has been expressed by some honourable members that a widow may receive two full pensions. That position cannot arise.",35
206,Mr SPENDER,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Sh e can receive one pension and a portion of another pension. Mr SPOONER,--Can she receive the Commonwealth pension and draw the permissible excess from a State pension scheme ?",35
207,Mr CHIFLEY,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,Yes .,35
208,Mr SPOONER,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"So far as I am aware, this Parliament has no authority to prevent the States from having widows' pensions schemes of their own. I do not agree with what has been said ahout the effect that these pensions will have on the payment by the Commonwealth of compensation to the States under the uniform tax scheme. As I understand the position, the uniform tax scheme provides that the cost of any service taken over by the Commonwealth shall be deducted from the compensation payable to the States.",35
209,Mr CHIFLEY,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"The scheme only takes into consideration the cost to New South Wales of paying pensions to widows at, the rate, of £1 a week, plus 5s. for each child; it does not allow for any increase of the State pension rate.",35
210,Mr SPOONER,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"The New South widows' pension is £1 a week. The State will have that amount deducted from its compensation. If it decides in the year 1942-43 to increase the rate of widows' pension payable under its own scheme, the Commonwealth cannot be expected to compensate it on that account. Compensation will be payable only in cases where a widow prefers to remain a recipient of the State pension. - Sir FREDEBICK: STEWABT - The Minister has told us that a widow may draw both pensions.",35
211,Mr SPOONER,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"The honourable gentleman has misunderstood the Minister's statement. As I understand the position, if a widow applies for a Commonwealth pension, the means test must be applied to her. If she is in receipt of a State pension amounting to more than £32 10s. a year-as the New South Wales pension does-sh e will not be allowed to receive Commonwealth pension in excess of the allowable sum. Mr - SPENDEB - No , she will be allowed to receive the excess.",36
212,Mr SPOONER,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,That is so. The Commonwealth pension will be reduced by that 'amount,36
213,Mr CHIFLEY,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,That is correct.,36
214,Mr SPOONER,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Therefore, there can be no duplication of pension payments. However, it will the possible for a widow to draw a Commonwealth pension and receive from the New South Wales pension scheme any excess to which she may be entitled.",36
215,Sir FBEDEBIOK STEWART,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,It will work the other way.,36
216,Mr SPOONER,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"That may the so, with the same result. Under the legislation that, has been introduced, the 'Commonwealth will deduct from r,he compensation payable to the State the amount that has been lifted off the financial shoulders of the State. I am not satisfied that the proposed amendment will give effect to what the honourable member has in mind. In fact, I am not satisfied that there is any need it at all. Silting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m. Mr SPOONER,- I desire to summarize the position that was discussed before dinner. It is unfortunate that after an announcement had been made that the Commonwealth Government intended to introduce a Commonwealth-wide widows' pension scheme, the Government of New South Wales, which was already administering a widows' pension scheme, should have chosen to increase its pension rates. Under the amended legislation of New South Wales the widow's pension will be 25s. a week, with 10s. a week for a child. Under the Commonwealth scheme the payment will be 25s. a week for the widow, and 5s. a week for the first child. I point out, however, that the allowance for the child will not be considered in the application of the means test to a widow claiming a pension. The means test will apply only to the income of the widow herself. Any moneys she receives for her children will be understood to be for the children and not for her. After the passage of this bill widows in New South Wales will be able to choose whether they will apply for a pension under either or both schemes, but the Commonwealth Parliament should be concerned with the effects of this legislation on the Commonwealth as a whole and not with its effects upon New South Wales only. If a widow obtains a State pension and then applies for a Commonwealth pension the Commonwealth authorities will apply to her a means test under which she will be entitled to receive £32 10s. per annum without detriment to her Commonwealth pension. It appears to me to be likely that the widows in New South Wales will apply for the State pension because of the more liberal allowance for children. In that case the Commonwealth authorities would apply a means test under which a widow might be granted a Commonwealth pension of 12s. 6d. a week, giving her 37s. 6d. a week in all. I repeat that any income she may receive in respect of children would be disregarded for the purposes of the means test. If a State government chooses to subsidize the Commonwealth widows' pension scheme with a scheme of its own, it is not for the Comfor monwealth to interfere. I cannot support any amendment which will have the effect of imposing a limitation upon what a State government is doing. I believe that the ultimate and, in my view., desirable, effect of this legislation will be the disappearance of the widows' pension scheme of New South Wales. But we are not likely to ensure equality of social service payments throughout the Commonwealth by refraining from passing such legislation in this Parliament. Our business, as a Parliament, is to provide a uniform Australian widows' pension scheme. If a State government subsidizes that scheme the matter is beyond the control of this Parliament. The Treasurer has already foreshadowed certain compensation payments in connection with the uniform income tax legislation that has been introduced into this Parliament. Amongst these will be a deduction from the compensation payable to New South Wales of an amount equal to £1 a week for widows, that being the amount payable under the New South Wales pension scheme during 1941-42. Here, also, payments in respect of children will be disregarded. That deduction will not apply in respect of States where there is no similar widows' pension scheme. We must face the fact that, after the passage of this bill, a widow in New South Wales may receive a pension of 37s. 6d. a week, whereas a widow in another State may receive a pension of only 25s. a week, although she may have an income of 12s. 6d. a week from some other source. It will, of course, be quite competent for the Governments of States other than New South Wales to supplement the widows' pension payable by the Commonwealth, although I do not think that that is likely, and I do not lend any support to the suggestion. It is not possible, constitutionally, for this Parliament to interfere with a pension scheme in a State, nor is it desirable that such a course should be followed.",36
217,The CHAIRMAN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,The honourable member's time has expired.,37
218,Mr CHIFLEY,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Macquarie-Treasurer ) [S.S] - The Government cannot accept the amendment of the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Jolly) for reasons which have been plainly stated by the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Spooner). I have very little to add to what the honourable gentleman said, except that I make it quite clear that in the means test only the income of the widow herself will be taken into account. In that regard the whole of her income will be considered, whether it be income from a State government, or a State superannuation scheme, or a provident fund, or, in. fact, from any source. Income that she may receive for and on behalf of children will not be considered.",37
219,Mr SHEEHAN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,What about income under workmen's compensation legislation?,37
220,Mr CHIFLEY,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"The situation in that regard is not quite on all fours. I am referring to income from State sources, or superannuation or provident funds, or property of any kind. If a widow has an income of, say, 25s. a week from any source other than the Commonwealth widows' pension scheme it will be considered in fixing her rate of pension. It is a matter for any State government concerned to consider whether, after the passage of this legislation, it will continue any widows' pension scheme that it may have in operation. It is certainly not for the Commonwealth Parliament to attempt to deprive widows of benefits which they may now enjoy under such legislation. The Government will not be a party to anything of that kind. The principal widows' pension scheme in operation in Australia at present is administered by the Government of New South Wales, although modest schemes are also in force in Victoria at a cost to that State of about £30,000 a year, and in South Australia at a cost to that State of about £8,000 a year; but this Parliament should not try to interfere in such schemes or in any provident schemes organized by private firms.",37
221,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,In any case the beneficiaries under those provident schemes pay for the benefits they receive.,37
222,Mr CHIFLEY,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"^Sometime s they do; though I think in no case do they pay fully for the benefits obtained. Almost invariably a contribution, apart from the subscriptions of the beneficiaries is paid by the firm itself. It would create an intolerable situation if the Commonwealth Government interfered in such matters. The insertion of a provision in this bill which would have that effect would bring criticism upon the Parliament. For these reasons the Government cannot accept the amendment.",37
223,Mr DUNCAN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"HUGHES (Wakefield) [8.12] - I understand the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Spooner) to contest the statement that there would be a duplication of pensions, and yet to admit that if this bill passes there will be, to some degree, a duplication of widows' pensions. The committee should attempt to avoid such duplication. The honourable member stated that under the amended New South Wales scheme it would be possible for a widow to receive a pension of 37s. 6d. a week in that State, aggregating the State pension and the amount of pension that would be obtainable from the Commonwealth. Consequently a widow pensioner in New South Wales would be in a much more comfortable position than a widow pensioner in any of the other States.",37
224,Mr CHIFLEY,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,Widow s in New South Wales are better off in respect of pensions now than are the widows in other States.,38
225,Mr DUNCAN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"HUGHE S - My view is that we should not duplicate pensions in this way. As the Government has already introduced certain measures to provide for uniform income taxes throughout the Commonwealth, we are justified in asking that, where practicable, pensions also should be uniform throughout the Commonwealth. If we pass this bill we shall offer a direct inducement to States other than New South Wales to introduce widows' pension schemes in order that benefits available to widows may be uniform in all States. It is not desirable, particularly in wartime when, in my opinion, the country cannot afford such expenditure, that we should offer any such inducement. The Commonwealth Government has already taken steps in certain directions to avoid duplication of pensions. direct the attention of honourable members to Statutory Rules 1942, No. 9, covering National Security (War Injuries Compensation) Regulations. Regulation 19 readsA pension shall not be granted or payable in respect of the death or incapacity of any person if a pension is payable in respect of that death or incapacity under the Australian Soldiers Repatriation Act 1920-41 or the Seamens War Pension and Allowances Act 1940. or compensation is so pas'able under the Naval Defence Act 1910-34, the Defence Act 1903-41, the Air Force Act 1923-39 or the National Security (Civil Defence Volunteers Compensation) Regulations. The object of the Government, in making that regulation, clearly was to obviate the payment of two pensions to the one person in respect of the same set of circumstances. I admit that, normally, both would be payable by the Commonwealth. [48] But surely the rule applies equally where one pension would be payable by the Commonwealth aud the other by a .State! I can see no difference; the result would be the same. The amendment is not only sound but also equitable. If adopted, a certain degree of uniformity would be maintained; consequently, I intend to support it.",38
226,Mr SPENDER,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Warringah) [8.16] I support the amendment. It is not to the point to state, as the Treasurer (Mr. Chifley) has done, that other income of a widow will be taken into.consideration under the means test, in determining the amount to be paid under this legislation. The vital principle is whether this committee, in considering for the first time social legislation of this character, which is designed to have uniform application throughout Australia, should, by refusing to adopt the amendment, encourage supplementary provisions on similar lines in the States. If there be agreement upon the principle that widows' pensions shall be payable throughout the Commonwealth, there must also be agreement upon the hypothesis that the amounts payable are such as should properly be made out of public funds. The cold fact is, that this matter cannot be divorced from the uniform income tax proposals introduced by the Government. These moneys will come from the one source and, at least during the period of the war, from the one governmental source; beI cause the Commonwealth, if its legislation be passed by this Parliament, will be the sole taxing authority. If the amount be a proper one, there can be no justification for any State being able to pay in respect of the same obligation an additional sum, which will vary and have a different incidence in the respective States. If it be not proper, either the committee or the Government should increase it. The matter is governed by simple propositions. The first is, whether this legislation is intended to operate throughout the Commonwealth on the basis of payment to a widow in respect of her needs, in accordance with the maximum sum which this committee considers should be payable out of public funds. If that be answered in the affirmative-apparentl y it must be-it is idle to contend that any State should then contribute an additional sum in respect of the same obligation. I understand that it is the Government's desire to seek to have this held of social legislation taken over by the Commonwealth. True, it cannot be taken over immediately; but, as the Minister for Social Services (Mr. Holloway) has said, the Commonwealth desired to enter this field and ultimately to take control of it. That is an objective which I particularly welcome; but 1 cannot see how it may be attained if, concurrently, encouragement be given to supplementary legislation by different States, particularly as one State or another would, in effect, contribute to what would be payable in New South Wales. The honourable member for Robertson (Mr Spooner) has said that he is opposed to supplementary State provisions involving two parallel forms of legislation dealing with the one subject. Although I agree with that, his approach to the matter is different from mine. Refusal to adopt the amendment would encourage such supplementary provisions, and place on them the imprimatur of the committee.",38
227,Mr HOLLOWAY,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,The honourable member knows that the Commonwealth cannot dictate to the States.,39
228,Mr SPENDER,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Wit h great respect, the Commonwealth would not be dictating to the States. For the first time, the Commonwealth is entering this field of social legislation.",39
229,Mr HOLLOWAY,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,The Government of which the honourable gentleman was a member entered it for the first time with child endowment.  the States to supplement Commonwealth payments.,39
230,Mr SPENDER,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"For the first time, the Commonwealth is entering a field of social legislation, apparently, with the intention that the States shall concurrently engage in supplementary legislation in respect of that particular matter. It is amazing that this committee should be considering widows' pensions at a time when a State legislature also is considering them. My simple approach to the matter is that, if the amount provided in the bill is not what should properly be paid to a widow out of public funds, it should be increased. If , in the view of the Government, it is sufficient, there is no justification for supplementary legislation by any State.",39
231,Mr ABBOTT,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"New England) [8.21]. - I support the amendment, because 1 regard it as particularly bad to draw distinctions between Australians of any class. It would be utterly wrong to give preferential treatment to a woman who happened to be a widow in New South Wales, compared with a widow in Western Australia, South Australia, or any other State. For many years, the system of unification for Australia has been a part of the platform of the Government party. If effect were given to it, there would be only one parliament- a national parliament. That a national parliament would fix differential rates of widows' pensions in various parts of the Commonwealth is inconceivable. Every effort should be made to have this pension rate uniform throughout the Commonwealth. If the rate be too low, let it be raised and let the Commonwealth pay it, but do not have a mixed rate, whereby widows in one State would receive more than widows in other States. The Minister for Social Services (Mr Holloway), and the honourable member for Robertson (Mr. Spooner), have said that, to try to dictate to any State what it should do in regard to social legislation would be intolerable. Such qualms did not exist when bills were brought down to implement a uniform income tax throughout the Commonwealth; because I understand that, if a State levies an income tax, it will not benefit by the compensatory payments to be made by the Commonwealth. In effect, the amendment merely asks for what the Government proposes in relation to State income tax. I can see no reason why the States should not be coerced to the utmost strength of the Commonwealth. For goodness' sake, let the people realise that this is the National Parliament, and that, it intends to do national work! Do not kow-tow to the States, and whine and cry for fear that they will be upset. It is extraordinary that any government with a unification plank in its platform should shilly-shally, and not undertake widows' pensions solely as a Commonwealth matter, blasting the States out of that field. If the rates are too low, let the Minister raise them; but do not have a bastard rate operating in some portions of Australia compared with other portions.",39
232,Mr CONELAN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Griffith) [8.25] - I am strongly opposed to the amendment, which is decidedly unfair. The honourable member for New England (Mr Abbott) has spoken of blasting the States out of this, that and the other field.",40
233,Mr ABBOTT,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Onl y out of this field. Mr CONELAN,-The States have certain rights, of which they cannot be deprived by honourable members of this Parliament without offering insult to the people in those States. This matter is not concerned with unification. The Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act provides for certain considerations. This bill has been brought into provide for certain other considerations in respect of widows and orphan children. An invalid or old-age pensioner may have an income of 12s. 6d. a week without his pension being varied. I cannot see why a similar principle should not apply in this case. What does it matter to this Parliament whence the income is derived? It is no concern of the Commonwealth if the source be a State widows' scheme.",40
234,Mr ABBOTT,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,Does the honourable member suggest that there should be State old-age pension schemes?,40
235,Mr CONELAN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"That is an absurd remark. If any State government were to continue a widows' pension scheme, would materially assist Commonwealth finances, because any amount received excess of 12s. 6d. a week would be dewidows' ducted from the pension payable under this scheme. The coal-miners of Queensthat. land bave a pension scheme, to they make contributions and from which payments are made to the widows former contributors. Is the Commonsuming wealth to divest those persons of under this bill. their rights? The Commonwealth Conamount stitution does not permit the Goculating vernment to filch the rights of the States without the consent of the people. Those who talk about unification should study literature on the subrate ject in order to learn what it means. If the committee carried the amendment it would be acting unfairly to both States and the Commonwealth.",40
236,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Parramatta) [S.30'] - I see nothing in the amendment inconsistent with the general attitude of the Commonwealth Government towards the States in recent times. If the view of the Government prevails, widows in New South Wales who have no other source of income whatever, and who simply have the widows' qualification upon which to base their claims, will receive a maximum of 37s. 6d. a week. In Victoria, where a modified State pensions scheme is in operation, widows will receive from 31s. to 37s. 6d. a week. In the other States, the payment will be 25s. a week. That, of course, abrogates all federal sentiment, and prevents similar treatment for all Commonwealth citizens without regard to the artificial State boundaries. But there is also a mechanical difficulty that the Treasury will be called upon to face in connection with this matter. It. is proposed under the bill that a certain rate of pension shall be paid to a widow with one child. The bill does not provide for the payment of so much for the widow and so much for the child, but it stipulates that there shall be a pension of 30s. a week for the widow and child. How is that provision to be correlated to the New South Wales or Victorian systems under which the provisions for the widow and children are separate and distinct? The Treasurer (Mr Chifley) has told us that, in pursuance of the uniform taxation proposals it of the Commonwealth, provision has been made for compensation to those States in in which social benefits, including the pension in New South Wales, are being conferred. The Minister intimated £1,600,000 was proposed to be which taken from the New South Wales compensation payment in consideration of of the Commonwealth Treasury astbe obligations provided for He said that the had been arrived at by calthe pension at the rate of 20s. a week for the widow, which was the rate prevailing in New South Wales until the last few days. I am not sure that that does not still prevail in that State. But, if what has been said in this chamber in the last hour or so comes true, the the Commonwealth will not pay 25s. to widows in New South Wales, as would seem to be the case under this bill, nor will it pay 20s. a week as is predicated under the Commonwealth's uniform taxation proposals. The maximum payment under this legislation to widows resident in New South Wales will be 12s. 6d. a week, and even that sum will be reduced if, as happens in many cases, the widows have income from extraneous sources. I draw attention to clause 33, which specifically states that no claim for a pension for a widow who is already in receipt of an invalid or old-age pension, will be considered. What justification is there for discriminating between the widows who are now receiving invalid pensions in all States and those who are receiving widows' pensions in New South Wales and Victoria only? Under the Government's proposal, a widow in New South Wales is to receive the widow's pension provided under the State scheme, and is also to have the Commonwealth pension superimposed upon it, with, of course, certain income qualifications. I should like the Minister to attempt to justify that, discrimination. I agree with other speakers that perpetuation of such discrimination is not justified. If 37s. 6d. a week is considered the correct provision for a widow in New South Wales, which contains two-fifths of the population of Australia, let this Parliament be honest and miake that the rate for widows throughout the Commonwealth.",40
237,Mr BLACKBURN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Bourke) [8.3©] The position has been well put by the honourable member for Robertson (Mr. Spooner). The honourable member for  that, when this Parliament provided for child endowment, it did not expect the States to continue such payments, but I contend that it did. I well remember the debates, and the fear was expressed that the State of Victoria, for instance, mightcease payment of the allowance that it had granted for children as soon as the Commonwealth child endowment scheme came into operation.",41
238,Mr HOLT,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,That referred to children in State institutions.,41
239,Mr BLACKBURN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"No ; those children are excluded. The act excludes from the definition of "" child "", a child maintained in an institution, but it does not exclude a child who is boarded out to his own parent or to a foster parent. It was said that as a result of the Commonwealth child endowment legislation the Government of Victoria would cease its child welfare payments. The Minister in charge of that measure stated at the time that that Government did not desire the State governments to act in that way. - Sir FREDERICK STEWART - There is a great difference between family endowment and payments under the child welfare system.",41
240,Mr BLACKBURN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"The honourable member is uot so much concerned about the amount to be paid to widows as he is about the whole field of social service being reserved to the Commonwealth. According to my reading of the debates in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, that State is not likely to continue the payment of widows' pensions under the State scheme once that field is occupied by the Commonwealth. That State could do much better for itself than directly compete with the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth could not prevent it. It could pay pensions under certain conditions. It could pay widows' pensious at an earlier age than that at which they are to be paid under the Commonwealth scheme. If the Commonwealth provided that the pension was to be paid to the childless widow at the age of 50 years, the State could provide that a pension should be paid to the childless widow at the age of 40 years. The State now makes its scheme supplementary to the Commonwealth scheme of invalid and old-age pensions. The New South Wales act provides that, as soon as a widow 'becomes qualified for an old-age or individual pension, she loses her right to the widows' pension. What is there to prevent the State from vacating the field now occupied by the Commonwealth and deciding that it will grant the pension to a widow on reaching the age of not 50 years, but 40 years? What was stated as the desideratum by the Opposition was that the States should be driven out of the field of social services altogether, and that, if that were not done, it would reconsider its attitude towards uniform taxation. I think that the honourable member for Parramatta (Sir Frederick Stewart) said that without qualification. Then, subsequently, in reply to honourable members on their own side, objection was taken by members of the Opposition to widows receiving an extra payment. I do not believe that the widows in New South ""Wales will receive 37s. 6d. a week. I cannot conceive of a State overlapping Commonwealth legislation in that way. The States may make their scheme supplementary to that of the Commonwealth. From my study of the New South Wales act, it appears to me that a widow applies for and obtains a pensions certificate. While she holds that certificate, she draws a pension. If she has children under the school-leaving age, in addition to drawing 25s. a week for herself, she gets 10s. a week for each child under the school-leaving age.",41
241,Mr JAMES,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,Unde r the age of fourteen years.,42
242,Mr BLACKBURN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"No , the age may go up to fifteen years in some cases. A widow has not two separate rights under the act. She has not one right to draw a widow's pension and another separate right to draw an allowance for her children. She gets the allowance for her children because she holds a widow's pension certificate. If the bill were amended to provide that the Commonwealth pension shall not be paid to a woman who is in receipt of a widow's pension in New South Wales that would deprive the widow with one child, or with children under the school-leaving age, of the benefit of the payment of 10s. a week. T do not think that that is the intention of any honourable member. I suggest that we are over-anxious to drive the State out of this field altogether. The amendment submitted to the committee is merely provocative. If the scheme provided for in the bill is agreed to, the States will not have enough money to carry out double-banking schemes. If the New South Wales politicians are as astute as I believe them to be, and if they want to grant pensions to widows, I think that they will decide to grant them where the Commonwealth scheme makes no provision for them at all. The tenor of the debates in the New South Wales Parliament, on both sides of the House, seemed to be that New South Wales was getting in before the Commonwealth Government made its declaration, without any intention to compete with the Commonwealth.",42
243,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,This debate will make it hard for the New South Wales Parliament to get out now.,42
244,Mr BLACKBURN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"I do not wish to make things difficult for New South Wales in that respect. I should like to see pensions paid, at an earlier age than is provided under this bill; but, in my opinion, the States will not. have enough money to carry on their social services on the same scale as in the past. I agree with the honourable member for Robertson that the amendment should be rejected.",42
245,Mr FRANCIS,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Moreton) [8.44] - A vital principle is involved in the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Jolly). We should not coerce the States, or, as the honourable member for New England (Mr Abbott) suggested, blast them out of this field; but this Parliament is entitled to legislate as it thinks fit. The honourable member for Lilley is seeking to introduce an entirely new principle into Commonwealth legislation. I remind the committee that invalid and old-age pensions were paid by some of the States before federation and for some years afterwards. Then, in 1908, the Commonwealth Parliament passed the Commonwealth Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act, and from that year until 1942 no government has sought to amend the Commonwealth act by inserting a provision that no invalid or aged person is entitled to a Commonwealth pension if he or she is in receipt of one from a State. Child endowment has been paid in some States for years past; yet, in 1941, when the Commonwealth Child Endowment Act was passed, no attempt was made to insert in it a provision similar to that which the honourable member for Lilley is now seeking to insert in the Widows' Pensions Bill. There seems to be a fear lest the States may, in special circumstances, provide additional benefits for widows. If they do, they will, having regard to the uniform tax proposals now before this Parliament, have to answer to their own electors for their action. I hope that the amendment will not be carried, and that the States will not be unwise enough to now what they have not done in regard to invalid and old-age pensions or endowment. The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Duncan-Hughes) saw fit to quote Regulation No. 19 under Statufact, tory Rule No. 9 of 1942, which is as first follows:A pension shall not be granted or payable in respect of the death or incapacity of person if a pension is payable, in respect that death or incapacity, under the Australian Soldiers' Eepatriation Act 1920-1941 or Seamen's War Pensions an:': Allowances Act its advanced social legislation. 1940, or compensation is s<- pr Table under Naval Defence Act 1910-1'>34, the Defence 1903-1941, the Air Forfe Act 1023-1939, or the National Security (Civil Defpucj Volunteers' Compensation) Kcguliitions. All the pensions mentioned there are Commonwealth pensions. It is laid down that the Commonwealth shall not pay compensation twice, nor pay two separate pensions to the same person for pleasant the same . disability, but there is nothing to prevent the States from doing what they choose in the exertbeir cise of their own powers. I hope that we shall continue to legislate in regard social services as we have done since 1908, and that we shall refrain from trying to coerce the States. They have their own problems, and should be allowed attend to their own affairs.",42
246,Mr JAMES,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Hunter) [8.49] - Evi - some dently the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Jolly) fears that New South Wales may continue to pay widows' pensions even after this bill becomes law, so that a widow may be drawing a pension from both the State and the Commonwealth. I should say that that is far from the intention of the Government of New South Wales. I am glad that what has been described as the "" means "" test in New South Wales Act has been omitted from this bill. In the New South Wales legislation the income of children living in a home wa3 regarded, up to 50 cent., as the income of the mother, and the case of children living away from home the amount was fixed at 25 per cent, and the assessment of a widow's pension was arrived at on this whether or not the children paid. I have always objected to the principle that children should be made to contribute wards the pension of their parents. Great credit is due to the Government of Newvocating do South Wales for having introduced a widows' pension scheme, and credit is due child in particular to Mr Lang, who was Premier of New South Wales when the measure was brought in. As a matter of the measure was better when it was passed than it is now, because it has been mutilated by various governments. New South Wales has led the other States any in such social legislation as workmen's of compensation, widows' pensions and child the endowment, and has suffered because of Its the markets have beenfloodedby goods manuAct factured in States where wages are lower and social conditions not so good. I compliment the Government upon having introduced this measure which is long overdue. I was for many years associated with the coal-mining industry, and on more than one occasion it was my unduty to break the news to women when their husbands had been killed. Widows often had a hard struggle to rear families. Sometimes their health broke down, and they had to go into to hospital. From now on women similarly placed will have the benefit of a pension, and will be able to keep their homes together, and bring up their children into reasonable comfort. Widows' pensions have been paid in New South Wales for years, and it is very desirable that a similar scheme should be in force in all the other States. This is an example of humanitarian legislation, and I ask the Government not to accept the amendment of the honourable member for Lilley.  I regard the amendment of the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Jolly) as just plain common sense. Although some of the those who have opposed it have tried very hard to convince themselves that they are right, I do not believe that they have succeeded in doing so. per On other occasions we have heard a in good deal from honourable members opposite regarding the desirability of the Commonwealth taking over all social services, of doing away with overlapping as basis between Commonwealth and State activities, and the desirability of operating on an Australian basis, instead of on toa State basis. Nevertheless, some of those honourable members are to-night adthat the States should be free to enter into competition with one another in supplementing Commonwealth social legislation.",43
247,Mr MORGAN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"We cannot prevent them under the Constitution.  honourable member for Reid (Mr. Morgan) say that something should be done to amend the Constitution to make Commonwealth authority all powerful. I believe that widows in all States should be entitled to the same benefits, just as are the aged and invalid, and the recipients of child endowment. I see no reason for differentiation in the case of widows. We must not forget that it is proposed very shortly to make the Commonwealth the sole taxing authority as regards income tax-the Commonwealth to make a grant to the States by way of compensation. Are we to understand that the Commonwealth is to pay such an amount to the States as may enable some of them to supplement the social benefits provided by the Commonwealth? If so, the Commonwealth, and. not the State3, would be providing the additional benefits. There is only one common sense basis for social legislation of this kind, and that is to provide that widows shall be treated alike, irrespective of the State in which they live. For that reason I strongly support the amendment of the lionorable member for Lilley.",44
248,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Barker) [S.58] - In the framing of legislation one of the first considerations is to make clear beyond doubt the intention of the legislature, but it appears, from ministerial statements upon the issue before the committee, that it is intended to leave this point indefinite. The Government wants to have it both ways. The Government thinks that it will be extremely popular in New South Wales, because it will be able to say that, notwithstanding the fact that it instituted a system of widows' pensions for the whole of the Commonwealth, it has not done anything to prevent the continuance of the system of widows' pensions operating in that 'State. The attitude of the Commonwealth in this matter is that, it is the authority that should grant pensions. If the States like to duplicate Commonwealth's efforts that 13 their own affair, but they have no standing. It was a very different matter when the very unpopular question of the control of liquor came up for consideration at the recent conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers. The Government then said: "" Oh, no! We leave that matter entirely to the 'States. It is no concern of ours. We shall not interfere."" We had the spectacle of the Government whip, the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Conelan), visiting Adelaide on the subject of horse racing. I wish the honourable gentleman had seen what the Stock and Station Journal had to say about him. But on the subject of horse racing the Government's attitude was, "" That is likely to be unpopular. We won't interfere. We won't bring in any federal regulation or law on such matters."" Eut on the pensions quesiion its attitude is entirely different. In a federation, particularly, one of the aims is division of legislative and administrative responsibility, but we endeavour to dispense with the overlapping to which the honourable member for Gippsland referred. On numerous occasions complaints have been made in this chamber that we have failed to dispense with such overlapping; yet the Government deliberately, with its eyes open, is perpetuating the system. The laws of this country require an alien to be resident in Australia for five years before qualifying for naturalization, yet under this bill a widow from overseas, provided she complies with other requirements, will become entitled to a pension whether she is naturalized or not after five years' residence. Mr HoLnowAY - That is not so.",44
249,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Unde r this bill she would become entitled to a widow's pension whether she is naturalized or not at the end of five years. In other legislation, now before Parliament, the Government says specifically that the State taxation officials, who will be taken over by the Commonwealth, shall not be entitled to both State and Commonwealth superannuation benefits but shall continue to make contributions to a State superannuation fund. To be consistent the Government must say that they shall be entitled to participate in the the State superannuation scheme, if they like, and shall also be entitled to participate in the Commonwealth scheme. Is it tLe intention of the Minister pay to a widow of a soldier a widow's pension in addition to the pension to which she is entitled under the Austhat tralian Soldiers' Repatriation Act?",44
250,Mr CONELAN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,Why not?,45
251,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"That is the point. If it be just that the State of New South Wales shall have the Opposition right to supplement widows' pensions payable under this legislation what the Ministry do about the widows of soldiers? The Minister will have one answer, namely, that the Government does not intend to allow soldiers' widows to draw an additional pension under this measure. It is, therefore, the bound duty of the committee to make clear to the taxpayers and to the States the tention of the Commonwealth legislature. One of the important points of the tralian Constitution is that wben services and responsibilities are taken over the Commonwealth, State services and responsibilities cease. Wben this Parliahas ment passes a law in regard to banking, insurance, divorce or any other matter listed in the schedule of powers contained Wales. in section 51 of the Constitution, the corresponding .State law ceases to operate. Parliament must lay it down that a might be. widow's pension is to be paid only to certain widows with certain qualifications and exempt from disqualification. amendment provides that a pension shall be payable to any widow who is not paid a pension under the act of a State.  for a State to pay pensions to widows, but it debars a widow from collecting two pensions. It conditions the CommonWales wealth payment.",45
252,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Yes . I 12s. say to the Minister and his supporters that it is not the intention of the monwealth to allow widows to draw a pension from the Commonwealth as well from a State government. as from a State. So, what is wrong with expressing the intention in this bill ? The Government's refusal to accept the amend of ment leaves it open to suspicion. When we are asking for so many things these days, it ill-becomes any government, even in a measure of this description, to obtain full credit throughout Australia for having introduced a scheme of to widows' pensions and special credit in New South Wales. A cry which dominates every federal election campaign in State is: "" At any rate, whatever we did as a Commonwealth we did not interfere with what the tiger did in New South Wales.""",45
253,Mr ROSEVEAR,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Dalley) [9.4] - The is fighting shadows. There is no indication that New South Wales will will persevere with its scheme of widows' pensions. The honourable mem fears that, unless the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Jolly) be inserted in the bill, en there will be competition amongst the States in providing social service. What inare the facts? Widows' pensions were introduced in New South Wales in 1925. AusThe only other Australian State with any semblance of a widows' pension by scheme is Victoria, which operates a scheme on a very limited scale. There been no competition amongst the other States to bring their social legislation up to the standard of New South  would be competition, but that there",45
254,Mr ROSEVEAR,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"The honourable The gentleman is still beating the air, because New South Wales is the only State which has what could be termed a full-fledged scheme of widows' pensions. Who has ever heard an honourable gentleman opposite advocate, in the interests of uniformity, that the other States should fall into line with New South and institute widows' pensions? Under this bill a widow may earn up to 6d. a week without impairing her right to a widow's pension, but honComorable members opposite object to the thought of her receiving that 12s. 6d. To be consistent, honourable members opposite must, irrespective of the possible souices income, object to a widow receiving anything but a pension. I remind the committee that immediately the Commonwealth Parliament passed legislation for try to the payment of child endowment, New South Wales, the only State then paying child endowment, vacated the field.",45
255,Mr BLACKBURN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,The same result followed the proclamation of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act.,46
256,Mr ROSEVEAR,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,Yes . Once the Commonwealth takes over a. responsibility the States are only too glad to relinquish such responsibility.,46
257,Mr HARRISON,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Wentworth) [9.12]. - The honourable member for Gippsland  and old-age pensions are uniform throughout Australia, a widow's pension ought also to be uniform throughout the Commonwealth and saw in the amendment a means whereby to achieve that uniformity. Commonwealth social legislation is introduced on the assumption that conditions in each - State are equal, but honourable members cannot hoodwink themselves that conditions do not vary as between States.  ber is splitting hairs.",46
258,Mr HARRISON,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"How does the honourable member explain why the Commonwealth basic wage varies as between the States ? I cannot be accused o.f splitting hairs. If we had unification, every piece of social legislation would have to contain a provision similar to that contained in the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act for adjustments to be made in accordance with the rise or fall of the cost of living in the different States. But we have not unification, and under the present conditions I do not see how I can logically support the amendment.  ber cannot logicallv oppose it.",46
259,Mr HARRIS ON,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"I have laid the basis for a very logical argument against the amendment. I point out. again that we have made provision in our industrial legislation for varying factors within the various States. The Commonwealth has accepted the principle of variations within the States, and therefore, when fixing the basic wage it takes into consideration factors within the States, and either increases or decreases the industrial rate accordingly. The ideal is an equitable widow's pension throughout the Commonwealth, but that ideal has not yet been reached.  gentleman is correct about variations, only way to put matters right is for the Commonwealth to make such variations as would meet the case of each State.",46
260,Mr HARRISON,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"I was coming to that point. Although I cannot possibly support the amendment of the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Jolly) because it would not improve the position, I suggest that the committee should give serious consideration to the suggestion of the honourable member for Gippsland that provision be made to vary the pension so that it would apply equally in all the States. If that were done, I am confident that no honourable member would oppose it.",46
261,Mr SPENDER,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,What attitude did the lionorable member adopt in connection with invalid and old-age pensions?,46
262,Mr HARRISON,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"That legislation was on the statute-book before I entered Parliament. Like the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender), who, no doubt, has frequently been confronted with a fait accompli, I accepted the inevitable. Honourable members who are aiming at uniformity throughout the Commonwealth can achieve that objective by means other than those suggested by the honourable member for Lilley. If a rate of pension is decided upon without taking into consideration the factors which I bave mentioned, some persons in the community will be placed at a disadvantage compared with others. I cannot support the amendment, but I ask the Minister to give consideration to the suggestions that I have made. The sooner we realise that unification is inevitable and take steps to meet such, a situation, the better it will be for ttte Commonwealth.",46
263,Mr SPENDER,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,Why not take one step along with the honourable member for Lilley?,46
264,Mr HARRISON,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,Hi s proposal will not get us very far.,46
265,Mr HOLLOWAY,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Melbourne P o r t s Minister for Social Services and Minister for Health) [9.18] - I cannot but wonder what has happened during the last 24 hours to cause honourable members wbo until yesterday were favourable to this measure to try to defeat it today. For the last twenty years, the States have trifd to lay the basis for a scheme of the widows' pensions on a Commonwealth basis because they were agreed that it was a matter for the National Parliament. They hoped that, by refraining from introducing such legislation themselves, some Commonwealth government would be induced to do so. The Bruce Page Government went so far as to appoint a commission which travelled all over Australia and examined witnesses in every State, involving the country in great expense. Some present members of this Parliament gave evidence before that body, but no scheme of widows' pensions emerged. At last, New South Wales refused to wait any longer; it decided to introduce legislation providing for pensions to widows in that State, although legislators in the State parliament believed that it was a matter for the Commonwealth. Later, for similar reasons, New South Wales introduced its own scheme of child endowment. When a scheme providing for child endowment was introduced into this Parliament it was suggested that a coercive clause, under which the Commonwealth would be authorized to dictate to the States, be inserted. With the enactment of Commonwealth legislation providing for child endowment, New South Wales gave up its own scheme. That the same result can confidently be expected in connection with this legislation honourable members opposite are well aware. Why have some of the most astute politicians on the other side of the chamber seized upon this particular piece of legislation to cause dissension between the Commonwealth and the States? If ever there was a time when political unity and harmony was desirable in the Commonwealth, it is today.",46
266,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,The Government's proposals for uniform taxation are not producing harmony.  delighted to see the amendment of the honourable member for Lilley incorporated in this legislation.,47
267,Mr HOLLOWAY,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"The honourable  who is one of the most evenly-balanced men in this Parliament, must know that the carrying of the amendment would amount to an insult to the Parliament of New South Wales. It would be a reckless thing to do, particularly at this time, and the Government will not allow it to be done. I am confident that with the passage of this legislation New South Wales will discontinue its scheme of widows' pensions just as it relinquished its child endowment scheme with the passing of Commonwealth legislation providing for child endowment.",47
268,Mr SPENDER,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,What is the reason for the activity shown in New South Wales in connection with this matter?,47
269,Mr HOLLOWAY,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Probably the honourable member for Warringah (Mr. Spender), who was formerly the Treasurer of the Commonwealth, has a good idea of the reason. I urge the committee to reject the amendment, because it is both illogical and inopportune. It cannot do any good, and it may do a lot of harm. No State government would be bound by it, but some people who would benefit from this scheme would be placed in a false position. The carrying of the amendment would certainly lead to discord in the community, and therefore the Government cannot consider accepting should the amendment, which is wrong from every point of view. The honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) said that the proposal of the Government would enable an alien who had been resident in Australia for five years, but had not become naturalized, to receive a pension. The honourable member for Barker, in whose electorate there are many aliens, should know that aliens are not entitled to a widow's pension. I ask the honourable member for Lilley to withdraw his amendment, because it cannot achieve the purpose which he has in mind. The Commonwealth Government will continue with its policy of providing economic and social security by means of legislation, and whilst it hopes that the States will continue to co-operate with it to that end, it will not attempt to coerce them. MT. JOLLY (Lilley) [9.26] - What ever may be the result of this debate, it will at least serve one good purpose, in that it will make clear to the people of Australia that the Commonwealth is moving towards uniform social conditions throughout the whole of its territory. Uniform taxation proposals presuppose uniform social conditions. The committee which was appointed to consider whether the Commonwealth should be the sole taxing authority in the field of income tax for the duration of the war stated in its reportIf, during the war, the Commonwealth should decide to provide uniformly for the whole of Australia a social service provided at present by some or all of the States such, e.g., as widows' pensions, .the Commonwealth should use the machinery set out earlier in the report to effect a reasonable reduction from the income tax compensation paid to those Status relieved from the cost of providing such a service. [ agree that that paragraph supports what the Treasurer (Mr Chifley) said earlier this evening,, but I draw attention toanother paragraph of the report in which the committee said that, in order to preserve flexibility, the following formula should be adopted:I. A State may submit a claim to the Commonwealth that its financial circumstances arc such as to warrant an increase in the amount nf compensation for any financial year subsequent to 1042-43. That recommendation means that, ultimately, the Commonwealth must accept the financial responsibilities of the States. Why is it that the Commonwealth Government, in opposition to the desires of the State governments, intends to introduce uniform taxation proposals? The reason is, not that the proposal is popular, but that financial necessity compels the Commonwealth to do so. It is being done to assure an equitable distribution of the burden of taxation throughout Australia. If taxes are to be spread equitably over the whole community, the members of the community should share equitably in the distribution of benefits .paid for out of taxation. Those who make equal contributions to revenue .should share equally in social services. The clause as it stands will enable a widow in New South Wales to receive £97 1.0s. a year, whereas in any other State a widow will not be able to draw more than £65 a year. There is no equity in that. 1 agree with the honourable member for  has come for us to adopt a true national outlook in these matters. I was amused at the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison), who said unblushingly that he was a supporter of unification. I remind him that, under unification, widows would receive the same rate of pension whether they lived in Darwin or Hobart.",47
270,Mr HARRISON,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,No . Rates would vary in different localities.,48
271,Mr JOLLY,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"I make no apology for this amendment, and I assure the Minister that I have consulted nobody in connection with this matter. As a matter of fact, the honourable gentleman knows that I have already expressed to him privately my strong opinions in favour of introducing a uniform system of social services throughout the Commonwealth. I am a great supporter of uniform taxation,, but I am not prepared to subscribe to that policy unless, at the same time, we bave a scheme of uniform social services.",48
272,Mr SPOONER,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Robertson) [9.33] - I draw special attention to a point that has received too little emphasis in this debate; in fact, only one honourable gentleman has referred, to it. I am afraid that the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Jolly) has not grasped fully the fact that under this bill £1 5s. a week is not regarded asan adequate widow's pension. Taking the various clauses in conjunction, it is clear that the measure contemplates £1 17s. 6d. a week as the minimum income on which a widow can live, and towardsthat amount the Commonwealth is prepared to contribute £1 5s. a week. A widow may have an income of 12s. 6d. a week from other sources, but that will not be taken into account in computing the rate of pension .payable to her. She may derive her 12s. 6d. a week from rents, contributions from relatives or friends, or in the form of board and lodging which she may receive to that value. The same principle applies to the New South Wales widows' pensions scheme. If a widow in New South Wales has an income from rents of 12s. 6d. a week, and is entitled to receive the State widows' pension, this bill will permit her to receive, in the aggregate, an income of £1 17s. 6d. a week. A widow in Western Australia receiving 12s. 6d. a week from rents is alfo entitled to a total of £1 17s. 6d. a week. It does not matter to the Commonwealth where the widow in New South Wales obtains her non-pension income. Question putThat the words proposed to be added be so added (Mr JOLLY'S amendment).

Amendment (by Mr. agreed toThat, at the end of the clause, the following sub-clause be added:- "" (0.) A pension shall not be granted to a widow, being a deserted wife, unless the widow has taken such action ns the Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner considers reasonable to obtain maintenance from her husband."". Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 15 (Rate of pension).",48
273,Mr CALWELL,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Melbourne) [9.48] Provision is made in this clause for the payment of a pension at the rate of £65 per annum to a widow who is not maintaining a child under 16 years of age, and is not less than 50 years of age, and of £78 per annum to a widow who is maintaining 37 one or more children. The extra £13 per annum is calculated at the rate of 5s. 18 a week, and in that respect the provision is in accord with the provision for each child after the first child made in the AYBS. Child Endowment Act. The amount of 5s. a week is, in my opinion, too small. Under child welfare schemes in operation in various States a larger amount is provided for the first child. In Victoria, for example, 10s. a week is provided for the first child. If this clause is passed without amendment a widow with one child w i ll receive a pension of 25s. a week for herself and 5s. a week for her child. NOES. She will also be permitted to earn 12s. (id. a week. Therefore she will have £2 2s. 6d. a week on which to maintain herself and her child. Children are an expensive item these days, particularly if they are sickly. The cost of children's clothing and footwear is extraordinarily high. 1 know that from my experience with my own family. The honourable member for Watson (Mr Falstein) told me a day or. two ago that his wife had recently visited a city store in order to buy a pair of pyjamas for a lad four years old. The only pair offered to her was marked 24s. 6d. She went to other stores to try to purchase a less costly pair but could not obtain a pair at any price. I mention this to indicate the cost of chilPATHS. dren's clothing. I suggest that a larger sum should be provided for the first child with, perhaps, a diminishing amount for succeeding children, until a static sum is rpached. It is highly desirable in these days that everything possible should be done to assist the mothers of families. HOLLOWAY) Whilst the mother of a family of several children, or a mother with a child beyond tender years, might be able to go out and earn 12s. 6d. a week, I do not think that any honourable member would desire that the mother of an infant should be obliged to go out to work. We should be doing everything in our power to encourage family life, and to assist mothers to rear their children under reasonable conditions. We must make the preservation of child life our greatest care. Provision is made in widows' pensions schemes in Germany, France and Italy for a larger payment in respect of the first child of the family. A diminished amount is provided for the second child and the rate is varied for successive children until static figure is reached. That principle is also followed in widows' pensions schemes in other countries. It may be argued that the Government desires to achieve uniformity in payments for children, but I can see no reason why we should slavishly follow uniformity in this case. There are reasons why widows with children should be given even more sympathetic consideration, perhaps, than old-age pensioners. Widows have a heavy responsibility in the rearing of their children and in discharging it they are performing an invaluable service to the State. Ministers who are receiving more than £2,000 a year as well as other valuable privileges including travelling expenses at the rate of £2 12s. 6d. a day, and private members of the Parliament, who receive an allowance of £1,000 a year, are far removed from the struggles and adversities of the average person in the community, and they should not deal with claims of widows in a niggardly way. It may be said that money is not available to make higher payments than those provided in the bill, but I remind honourable members that the Government is able to provide about £1,000,000 a day for war expenditure. The full cost of this pension scheme is estimated at £1,600,000 per annum. If , say, £200,000 per annum be added to the cost in order to provide more liberal payments for the first child of a widow, the money would be wisely expended. It certainly would not be wasted. I do not think any one will deny that quite a substantial sum of money is being wasted in defence expenditure these days. Money is also being wasted in expenditure on munitions. Perhaps some waste in these matters is unavoidable. My point is that we could well make an additional sum available to assist widows to bring up their children with profit to the nation. If we can finance the war in so liberal a way, we should also be able to finance social services. We should not hesitate to provide money for social services, because of any fear of the future. We hope that we shall pass from this war into a new social order and a new financial system. Consequently the yardsticks of the past will not be the yardsticks of the future. I impress upon the the Minister for Social Services the importance of making adequate provision for the maintenance of children. Clause agreed to. Clauses 16 and 17 agreed to. Clause 18(1.) WJiere a pension is granted, it shall be paid from a date determined by the Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner but the date so determined shall not, subject to this section, be prior to the date on which the claim for pension was made.",49
274,Mr ROSEVEAR,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Dalley) [9.57] - I move That, in sub-clause (1.), after the words "" prior to the date"" the following words be inserted:- "" or later than the pay day next succeeding the date "". The clause would then provide that in the case of a claim for pension being approved the first payment would be made as from the first pay day after the date of the claim. I am aware that the clause, as it stands, is in accordance with a similar provision in the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act, but that provision has not proved to be satisfactory. We all have known of instances of serious delay in the granting of pensions. Sometimes some delay is inevitable, but when the delay is due to no fault of the claimant, the claimant should not have to suffer. If it should take six or eight weeks to reach a favourable decision on a claim, for a pension, the claimant should receive her first payment from a date not later than the first pay day after the application was lodged. Tbat appears to me to be a reasonable provision. I appreciate the difficulties in granting pensions from dates which would involve broken pay periods. My amendment would avoid any such trouble but would ensure that pensioners would not have to suffer for delays for which they were not responsible. I appreciate the difficulty of setting up a department of this sort. I realise that the administration of this act, in addition to the Child Endowment Act and the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act, will add enormously to the work of the department, and that many delays may be occasioned by reason of understaning on account of war conditions. I should not blame the department for such delays; but an applicant for a pension should not suffer in consequence.",50
275,Mr HOLLOWAY,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Melbourne P o r t s Minister for Social Services and Minister for Health) [10.1] - I understand what the honourable member is endeavouring to ensure. The clause is intended to achieve the object that he desires. In order to overcome certain difficulties, and to meet complicated situations such as the birth of a child or the death of a husband, which may mean that the mother or the widow may not be in a fit state of mind to make application quickly enough, the Commissioner is to be given the power to antedate for a period of three months.

281,Mr BLACKBURN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Bourke) [10.5] This clause sets out the conditions upon rrhich payment pf the pension shall cease, but does not provide that a woman under 50 years of age who has been receiving a pension because she has been maintaining a child under the age of sixteen years, shall lose it. There does not appear to be any clause which makes such express provision. I suggest to the Minister that the pension should not be devested from the widow in such circumstances, and that something be done on the lines of section 38 of the New South Wales Widows' Pensions Act 1928-1941, which provides that the right to, or the amount of, a pension shall not be affected during any period covered by a pension certificate, by reason merely of the fact that a child of the pensioner has, within that period, attained the school-leaving age, or by reason merely of the death of a child of the pensioner. Under the New South Wales scheme, the widow applies for a pension certificate. She may qualify for it because she is over 50 years of age and childless, or because, although she is under 50 years of age, she has a child. If , after she has obtained the pension certificate, the child should die, cr pass the school-leaving age, she does not, by reason of that fact, lose the pension.",51

I suggest that this matter be favourably reconsidered, and that provision be made on the lines of the New South Wales section for the continuance of the pension, or that the Minister adopt the suggestion made this afternoon by the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Ryan) and myself, that the widows' pension shall not be interrupted merely because her child has reached the age of sixteen years or has died. That seems to be what the bill contemplates, although it does uot expressly make that provision. If a child in respect of whom a widow is receiving a pension should die or reach the age of sixteen years, the pension is cease. That is not how the New South Wales act appears to deal with the matter. I should like further consideration to be given to it.",51
288,Mr RYAN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,Flinders) [10.8] - I support the remarks of the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Blackburn). I see some ambiguity in the position of a woman whose child attains the schoolleaving age or dies. The matter might be cleared up in the manner I suggested when dealing with clause 4.,52
289,Mr HOLLOWAY,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Melbourne P o r t sMinister for Social Services and Minister for Health) [10.9] - I understand the aim of the honourable members for Bourke (Mr Blackburn) and Flinders (Mr Ryan). The matter is more difficult than they have inferred. A widow with one child, of whatever age she may be, is to become entitled to a widow's pension. She may be only 20, 21, or 22 years of age at the death of her child. The general impression is, that she should fit into a profession or an industry. If not able to do so, she could obtain help from some other source Surely it is not suggested that all widows, whatever may be the state of their health or mentality, need a widow's pension!",52
290,Mr BLAOKBTJEN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Alternatively , pensions should cease, whether the widows are able to work or not.",52
291,Mr HOLLOWAY,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"If unable to work through invalidity, they become entitled to the invalid pension. The Government's view is, that a widow with a child is handicapped, and that when the child reaches the age of sixteen years its dependence on the mother ceases and it is able to engage in industry or a profession. The position of the widow then is not the same as it was previously. The Government considers that a healthy widow, 50 years of age, without encumbrance, may not be in need. Any one can visualize a first and only child dying when the mother is at an early age. There are thousands of such cases. There is a gap, I admit, which may be bridged when the act is made more nearly perfect. The honourable member for Bourke realizes that absolute perfection is not possible, and that what appear to be anomalies are always revealed. These two groups of widows are being fairly dealt with for to a start. The adoption of the proposal of the honourable member would open the gate to much more than they have mentioned. The matter has been closely studied by the Government. Widows are of all ages. Provision is made in respect of group 0, because of the possibility of a young married woman losing her husband before the birth of the first child. The Government is able to visualize the difficulty in which such a widow would be placed. It is not suggested that she would never return to industry but, on the contrary, it is hoped that she will return to the profession, trade or craft in which she was engaged before marriage. The belief is held that she should be nursed for a period of six months after the bereavement so as to enable her to think properly.",52
292,Mr RYAN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Would it not be possible to give to the Commissioner discretionary power to deal with cases of hardship, sucb as widows of the age of 45 years?",52
293,Mr HOLLOWAY,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,That cannot be done under this elause.,52
294,Mr BLACKBURN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Bourke) [10.13'J. - The Minister thought, that he had disposed of my point by saying that a woman who was unable to work would receive an invalid pension. all That does not f ollow. "" Unable to work "" does not necessarily mean physically unable; she might be unable to obtain employment. A woman who has given up remunerative work in order to marry and become a wife and mother, is not so easily employable as a widow. There would probably be no prospect for such a woman other than some badly paid form of daily household employment. The honourable member for Flinders (Mr Ryan) has suggested what would probably be the best course-that in the case of a woman of a fixed age, or, for that matter, any widow, the Commissioner should have the discretionary power to continue the pension indefinitely or for such time as he .thought would meet the circumstances. It would be very hard for a womanpassing through the very trying period of the middle forties to find that her pension had suddenly been stopped by reason of the fact that a child in respect of whom she had been receiving it had died.",52
295,Mr CHIFLEY,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,Sh e would be no worse ofi: than the average spinster in such circumstances.,53
296,Mr BLACKBURN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Sh e would be a lot worse off, because the average spinster would have been working during the whole of her lifetime. She did not give up her career to become a mother, and she has much better prospects than a widow. Clause agreed to. Clauses 22 and 23 agreed to. Clause 24 (Cancellation, &c, of pension).",53
297,Mr CALWELL,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Melbourne) [10.16]. - This clause gives to the Commissioner or a Deputy Commissioner very wide powers. At any time he may cancel, suspend or reduce any pension if he considers it expedient to do so. The clause provides that any decision by a Deputy Commissioner shall be subject to an appeal to the Commissioner, but apparently there is no appeal to the Minister. A strong Commissioner would tell the Minister that he had no right to interfere in such a matter, if an attempt were made to exert undue political influence. Provisions making the Railways Commissioner immune from ministerial direction were included in the various railway acts of the States in order to protect the commissioners against the exercise of political influence. I do not know why this clause has heen inserted. The provisions of clause 36 seem to be sufficiently wide. It provides that where the Commissioner or a Deputy Commissioner is satisfied that it is expedient that payment of any instalments of pension or allowance payable to a widow sbould be made to some other person for the benefit of the pensioner, payment may be authorized accordingly.",53
298,Mr HOLLOWAY,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Clause 5 provides that the Director-General shall, subject any direction of the Minister, have the general administration of the act. An appeal by a dissatisfied person to the Director-General would be considered, even though the Commissioner had rethat jected it.",53
299,Mr CHIFLEY,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,A similar provision is contained in the Invalid and Old-sgc Pensions Act.,53
300,Mr CALWELL,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"But should it not be explicitly stated that there shall be an appeal to the Minister or to the Director General. The position of Director-General is a newly created one, and it seems to me that sufficient attention has not been given to the line of demarcation between the powers of the Commissioner and of the Director-General. Is the Commissioner to be subject generally to the authority of the Director-General? Would there be any objection to providing that any decision of a Deputy Commissioner shall be subject to an appeal, in the time and in the manner prescribed, to the Commissioner, and, in a case where the Commissioner has disapproved, to the Minister ?",53
301,Mr CHIFLEY,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,If appeals to the Minister were permitted there would be no end to them.,53
302,Mr CALWELL,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Then , in my opinion, clause 36 should suffice. Clause agreed to. Clause 25 (Allowances to certain widows).",53
303,Mr BLACKBURN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Bourke) [10.21]. - This clause is taken in substance from the New South Wales act, and I offer two criticisms of it. It is not so generous as the provision contained in the New South Wales measure as recently amended. The clause as it stands, and as the New South Wales act stood before the recent amendment, provides that a widow not maintaining a child and less than 50 years of age, but still, in the opinion of the department, in necessitous circumstances, may, at the discretion of the department, get a pension for a period of not longer than 26 weeks immediately after the death of her husband. The New South Wales Parliament has inserted in the State act a provision that where, at the end of 26 weeks, it still appears to the Deputy Commissioner that the widow is in necessitous circumstances, he may to grant the payment of the pension for a further period of 26 weeks, but not more than twelve months in all. I submit that proposal for the favourable consideration of the Minister. My second criticism is the benefit of this clause is not extended to the widow who loses her pension by reason of the fact that her child has died or has reached the age of sixteen years. I suggest that the benefit of this clause be extended to widows in that class, and that if they cannot have their pension continued, it should be within the power of the Commissioner to grant to them the temporary allowance provided for in this clause. That would necessitate a redrafting of the clause.",53
304,Mr MORGAN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Reid) [10.25] - I agree with the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Blackburn). The clause might well be widened to give to the Commissioner greater power with regard to the period for which discretionary payments might be made. I also suggest that such payments be made to widows who, having been left childless, have formed alliances, perhaps of only of a temporary character, with the result that children have been born of the union. Such women might be deserted by the fathers of their illegitimate children, but they would have no claim to payment in respect of those children. The mothers may be left in necessitous circumstances, but, under the bill as it stands, they would not be regarded as entitled to a pension. In such cases, a discretion should he given to the Commissioner to make payments from time to time to such women until they could obtain employment, particularly during the first few years after the birth of the illegitimate children. If the Minister is not prepared to consider an amendment along those lines at this stage, I hope that he will do so later. Clause agreed to. Clauses 26 to 31 agreed to. Clause 32 (Allowance to cease in certain circumstances).",54
305,Mr CALWELL,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Melbourne) [10.27]. - I suppose that this clause will have to be agreed to as it stands, but I hope that the Minister will - be able to make recipro- made. cal arrangements with the governments of New Zealand and other dominions so that it will be possible to delete subclause 2 of this clause, which provides that an instalment of an allowance shall not in any event be sent to any person outside Australia. I am not well informed as to whether success was achieved in the direction of concluding reciprocal arrangements with New Zealand, or any other country, with regard to invalid and old-age pensions but it is unfortunate that people coming to Australia from New Zealand have to live here for twenty years before they become entitled to the old-age pension. I presume that widows from New Zealand will have to reside in this country for five years before they will be entitled to the benefit of this bill. .1 believe that, although New Zealand is close to Australia, no reciprocal arrangements have been made with that country with regard to pension payments, and that even New Zealand 2s. pieces are not legal tender in the Commonwealth. Although Australia's High Commissioner in London negotiates reciprocal arrangements regarding many matters with Great Britain, it seems anomalous that very few such agreements have been entered into between the Commonwealth and the sister dominion of New Zealand. An approach should be made to the Government of New Zealand, at any rate, in an endeavour to reach a reciprocal agreement in regard to invalid, old-age and widows' pensions and child endowment. Clause agreed to. Clauses 33 to 35 agreed to. Clause 36 (Payment of pensions and allowances to otlier persons).",54
306,Mr CALWELL,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Melbourne) [10.31]. - Is it the opinion of the Minister that any person who feels aggrieved because of the action of the Commissioner or a Deputy Commissioner should ultimately have a right of appeal in such a way as would enable the Minister to give a direction on general principle? In clause -24, there is a right of appeal from a Deputy Commissioner to a Commissioner, but there is no provision in this clause for a similar appeal. In the cause of uniformity such provision should be Clause agreed to. Clause 37 (Suspension of pension or nllowance while recipient in hospital for the insane).",54
307,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Parramatta) [10.34] - I cannot allow this clause to pass without making a further appeal to the Minister to remove an injustice. This clause provides that the pension of a widow shall cease when she enters a mental hospital, and this applies, not only to the pension of 25s. payable to the pensioner herself, but also to whatever allowance she may receive in respect of her children. A widow who enters a general hospital will continue drawing her pension, and the same applies to one who enters an institution such as an eventide home. Therefore, I cannot understand why this discrimination should be practised against the widow unfortunate enough to enter a mental hospital. I know that it is argued that the maintenance of mental hospitals is a matter for the Stales, but until recently the same was said of widows' pensions. It is also claimed that people, as a rule, stay in general hospitals for only a short while, whereas they usually stay in a mental hospital for a long time. However, they also stay in eventide homes for a long time, generally for the remainder of their life. Again, it is claimed that it would be impracticable for a mentally afflicted person to receive the pension. That is true, but in clause 36 it is provided that, in certain circumstances, the pension may be paid, not to the pensioner herself, but to some person approved by the Commissioner. The same could be done in the case of an inmate of a mental hospital.",54
308,Mr BLACKBURN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"In clause 36, it is provided that the pension shall be paid to some person other than the pensioner in the event of the pensioner's "" infirmity, ill-health, insanity or improvidence "". ' Sir FREDERICK STEWART - Pre sumably that applies to the case of an insane widow who continues to reside in her own home, so why should it not also apply to the widow who is so unfortunate as to have to go into an institution for the insane? I am not permitted under ihe standing orders to move an amendment, but I suggest to the Minister that he remove this anomaly. I know that if the suggestion were accepted, there would be reactions in other spheres, but that would not deter me. As a matter of fact, there is every reason why justice should be done in those other cases also.",55
309,Mr BLACKBURN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Bourke) [10.38]. - I support the proposal of the honourable member for Parramatta (Sir Frederick Stewart). Clause 36 is taken from the New South Wales act, and provides that the pension may be paid to some person nominated by the Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner should the pensioner herself be insane. Nothing in the nature of clause 37 appears in the New South Wales act, and there is no need for it in this bill, either. It should be deleted, leaving clause 36 to cover the case of an insane widow, whether she be an inmate of a mental hospital or not Clause agreed to. Clauses 38 to 43 agreed to. Clause 44 (Acquisition of property and receipt of income to be notified).",55
310,Mr JOLLY,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,Lilley) [10.40] - Is there a similar provision in the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act?,55
311,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Yes, it was included in the last amending bill.",55
312,Mr JOLLY,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Then I am satisfied. Clause agreed to. Clause 45 agreed to. Clause 46(3.) In any proceedings for an offence against this section the burden of proving the truth of the statement in respect of which proceedings have been instituted, or the genuineness of the document presented, shall rest upon the person accused.",55
313,Mr CALWELL,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Melbourne) [10.40]. --The penalty prescribed in this clause, namely, £50 or imprisonment for six months, seems unnecessarily severe. In clause 44 a maximum penalty of £10 is prescribed for certain offences, and in another clause the penalty of £50 was reduced to £20. I suggest that the Minister should agree to a reduction of the penalty in this clause.",55
314,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,Why shelter people who deliberately make false representations ?,55
315,Mr CALWELL,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Quite recently, Myer Emporium rohbed the people of £250,000. The firm was not prosecuted, but only made to refund an amount equal to that overcharged. If that logic were applied, we should be content with making offenders under this clause refund the money and then forget about it.",55
316,Mr HOLLOWAY,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,This provision would seldom be enforced.,55
317,Mr CALWELL,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,I do not trust the judgment of police magistrates. Some of them are just as irascible and temperamental as honorary justices.,55
318,Mr BLACKBURN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Bourke) [10.42]. - The penalty provided in this clause is inordinately severe. It is easier to prove an offence under Commonwealth legislation than it is under the New South Wales act. For instance, this clause provides that any person who makes a false or misleading statement in support of a claim, either for himself or for any other person, shall be guilty of an offence. In order to obtain a conviction under the New South Wales act it must be proved, not only that the statement was false, but that it was wilfully made. That means that the accused person must have known :it the time he made the statement that it was false. I cannot understand why the Parliamentary Draftsman, having the New South Wales act before him, omitted that provision. The clause also provides that proceedings may be commenced at any time within three years after the commission of the offence, whereas the New South Wales act provides that proceedings may be taken at any time within six months of the facts coming to the notice of the Registrar. That means that all the Commonwealth has to do is produce the document and say, "" We say that this is false; it is for you to prove that it is true, and, if you do not prove to the satisfaction of - the magistrate that it is true, you shall be guilty of an offence and shall be sentenced to up to six months imprisonment, or fined up to £50 and also have to repay whatever amount the magistrate says you owe to the Commonwealth "". The burden of proof is not cast upon the accused by the act of New South Wales.",56
319,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"The next clause provides that the Minister must give h'""> consent in writing to any prosecution.",56
320,Mr BLACKBURN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"-If the honourable gentlem?n had bad any experience of the way in which Ministers authorize prosecutions, he would not rearard that provision a? » wjfesri'ard.

321,Mr MORGAN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Reid) 110.461 - I supwill be. por* the contention of the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Blackburn) that the onus of proof should not be thrown on the defendant. The corresponding section of the widows' pension legislation of New South Wales provides that before the making of a false statement is rendered punishable the act must have been wilful. Under this legislation, however, all the Crown has to do is to aver that a false statement has been made. The onus of disproof is thrown on the defendant. That is contrary to all the principles of British justice. Unfortunately, however, the tendency in Commonwealth legislation seems to be to throw the onus of proof on the defendant. That is a tendency which ought not to be countenanced especially'where widows are concerned. It would be quite conceivable that a distracted widow could unwittingly make a false statement and thereby render herself liable to all the penalties of this provision.",56
322,Mr BLACKBURN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,"Bourke) [10.48]. - The corresponding section of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act contains the word "" wilfully "". It contains no provision whereby the burden of proof is on the accused. The draftsman must have had the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act before him. It is curious that he departed from the provisions of that act to the detriment of the accused in every respect but one, the exception being a penalty of £100 instead of £50 for making a false declaration. The prescribed term of imprisonment is the same as that prescribed in this measure, namely, six months.  honourable member's own argument that section of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act was amended when it was passing through committee.",56
323,Mr BLACKBURN,STATIONS LICENCE FEES,I have never supported such a clause as this and I do not propose to start now.,56

325,Dr PRICE,FROM AUSTRALIAN MILITARY FORCES,"Boothby) [10.55] - I have received some rather disquieting information about the state of affairs in South Australia, which I am impelled to place before the House, particularly since in some respects the difficulties increased over the week-end. Matters will be serious unless the Government acts. The explanations of certain matters given by Ministers last week are not regarded as satisfactory or adequate. I shall not say very much about the clothing regulations, because their immediate effects have been brought thoroughly to the notice of honourable members, but there are serious complaints about the way in which the regulations operate, particularly as regards munitions workers. For instance, the State president of the Australian Railways Union, Mr 0. F. Page, points out that munitions workers and other people ('C cities of working overtime in South Australia are unable to buy essential clothing and boots. There are, however, more serious indirect effects from these regulations. Correspondents inform me that there is a considerable flight of currency and that people are patronizing shops whose trading hours remain unchanged, such as jewellers, in order to have something tangible rather than bank-notes. There are whispers that the Government intends to ration food, and the people are beginning to acquire stocks. So far as the flight of currency and securities is concerned the Lord Mayor of Adelaide has contradicted the statement that the people are not disposing of war savings certificates in order to .buy clothing and other articles. Another development, which I do uot think has been mentioned in this House, is that the large departmental stores hold the main stocks of certain essential articles such as toilet goods of various kinds. Those stores are closed for most of the time, or they will not sell. The small holders, such as chemists' shops, have been depleted of stocks, and there is a demand that the large holders be permitted to dispose of their stocks in order to meet the need. trouble in Adelaide is extending to country districts. For instance, Port Augusta complains of a clothing shortage. Another difficulty is the position of small businesses-the sellers of firewood, boot repairers and egg and milk suppliers. It is alleged-and I know of a number of instances-that these businesses cannot obtain supplies. Some of them, such as wood merchants, are beginning to close in disgust, and the public is being deprived of essential services. [Newspapers which arrived here today confirm what I have been told by letter and telegram. The position is very serious so far as wood, milk and, possibly, egg suppliers are concerned. The feeling in South Australia is summed up by a statement of the secretary of the Dairymen's Association that if it were a case of the coal-miners the Government would hurry to try to settle the problem. The third cause of the trouble is that Adelaide may be facing at least a partial meat famine. It is alleged that price fixing has already wrecked the businesses of many large wholesalers of meat. Master butchers in Adelaide have no reserves on which to draw, and recently they met to decide whether they themselves would not have to ration meat by 25 per cent. For some unexplained reason, South Australia and Western Australia are the only two States in which the price of meat has been fixed. On the 13th May, the price of lamb in the Adelaide market was lOd. per lb., but the butchers had to sell it at the fixed price of 8d. per lib. There are now hints that the price-fixing authorities in South Australia are contemplating fixing the price of live-stock; yet stock people in New South Wales say that if that happens there will be greater chaos than ever. I understood before I left Adelaide that part of the trouble was due to lack of transport, as the federal authorities were refusing to permit the back-loading of North Australian cattle from Alice Springs to the south. A further complaint is in regard to the anxiety which has been created by the Government's action in freezing capital. Although the position has now been remedied, the effects of the action taken are still serious. There have been The long, unexplained, and seemingly unexplainable, delays in issuing detailed information about the Government's decision to reduce interest to 4 per cent. Legitimate and absolutely necessary business on the Adelaide Stock Exchange remains stagnant. How can any one buy or sell o per cent., 6 per cent, or fi per cent, preference shares when the Government takes so long to decide what interest those different types of shares ought to carry, and how they are to be compared with ordinary shares as regards dividend payments ? Most of the 16,000 or 17,000 people who own shares of different kinds in the Adelaide Electric Supply Company Limited, for instance, are small investors. What is their position, and what is their view of the delays which have taken place? I know of an instance in which the trustees of a deceased estate are unable to realise their assets; they cannot sell securities owing to the long delay which has taken place. I also know of instances in which perfectly solvent people cannot pay their taxes owing to the delay of the Government in coming to a decision. The chaos which has been caused is largely due to the fact that the Government will not look before it leaps. I raise these questions because they are of considerable importance, and are causing great indignation and commercial disorder in South Australia. I assure the Government that the people of South Australia regard these federal muddles as a most discordant overture to the comedy of errors which, under the name of uniform taxation, the Commonwealth Government proposes to force upon the people of Australia next week.",57
326,Mr MORGAN,FROM AUSTRALIAN MILITARY FORCES,"Reid) [11.4] - Las t week I asked the Minister for the Army (Mr Forde) a question in regard to alleged overcharges to members of the Military Forces for goods purchased by them through military canteens. To-day T. received a reply in these termsI now inform the honourable member that the prices charged by canteens service throughout Australia should in no instance be higher than retail stores, but in the great majority of cases, the prices are lower. If the honourable member will indicate where this is not the case the matter will be immediately investigated. Without going into individual complaints which have been made to me, I shall content myself with referring to the following paragraph which appeared in Smith's Weekly of the 9th MayMany complaints have been lodged at Smith's Brisbane office by service men, who state that camp canteens are charging prices for certain articles in excess of those charged by city stores. ABMT CANTEEN'S STEEP PRICES. "" Smith's "" Warned of Trouble. Specific instances quoted are such lines as i-Ib. blocks of chocolate which are priced at lOd. in any city shop but for which, it is alleged, certain canteens charge l i d . Toothpaste, razor blades, boot polish and similar articles are stated to be priced at i d . to I d . dearer in camp canteens than the price charged by retail stores. One man who has been employed in the canteen service for the past twelve months claimed that non-commissioned officers in charge of canteens price their goods to suit themselves. "" Only thing which concerns them figures,"" he claims. ""The more profit they show, the more chance they have of being promoted. Camp canteens have developed into a gigantic system of chain stores with readymade customers. "" Profits of the canteens are supposed to be returned to the troops in comforts, but mostly the men have left camp long before anything in the way of comforts is supplied. "" Comforts consist of such things as butter and f r u it dishes for mess tables, things which the Army ought to supply anyway. "" No explanation can be obtained as to how accrued profits are being distributed."" Smith's took these complaints along to Brisbane office of the Canteen Service and submitted them to Mr Hall, manager and secretary, for comment. Mr Hall refused to say anything on the matter at all and stated that if Smith's said anything about the Canteen Service without the official sanction of the Canteen Board we would find ourselves in serious trouble. The proprietors of Smith's Weekly then proceeded to relate the steps which they took to get to the bottom of the matter. It is clear that the prices charged for If r . Morgan. goods in military canteens are in excess of the rates charged for similar goods in city stores. I submit that the prices charged should certainly not be more than those charged in city stores, seeing that the canteens have a monopoly. Only reasonable charges should be levied. Should excessive profits be made, the money will probably eventually go into the coffers of the Government, as happened at the conclusion of the war in 1914-18, with the result that certain people were decorated with the Order of the British Empire, or honoured in other ways. I ask the Minister to inquire into these complaints as his reply to my question shows clearly that he does not know the facts. I urge that each canteen service should be required to supply a properly audited ibalance-sheet from time to time. Last week, the Minister for the Army announced that members of the Australian Military Forces would be allowed to transfer to the Australian Imperial Force. In doing so, he made it clear that such action would be voluntary on the part of individual soldiers, and that no pressure would be applied to cause men to make the transfer. In spite of that announcement, information has been supplied to me which indicates that certain officers in charge of units of the Australian Military Forces are using is coercive and intimidatory methods to prevail on men to join the Australian Imperial Force as complete units. One case which has come to my notice is connected with the Army Service Supply Column with head-quarters at Willoughby. I am informed that a certain officer parades members of the unit before him when he asks them whether they are willing to transfer to the Australian Imperial Force as a complete unit. He then orders those who express their willingness to do so to stand on one side and those who are not willing to make the change to stand on the other side and their names are noted. The position is. put to them in such a wnv that those who nvf. in the minority are expeefpd to abide by the decision of the mainrity. Should the motion for transfer be carried hv a maioritv. the whole unit, is exneotprl to fcran^fpr to the Australian Imnerisl Force. This practice, in addition to being undemocratic, is entirely contrary to the announcement of the Minister that the decision to transfer would be left to men individually.",58
327,Mr CALWELL,FROM AUSTRALIAN MILITARY FORCES,The honourable gentleman should name the officer concerned and the Government should sack him.,60
328,Mr FROST,FROM AUSTRALIAN MILITARY FORCES,Whether guilty or not?,60
329,Mr MORGAN,FROM AUSTRALIAN MILITARY FORCES,"At this stage, I do not think it desirable to name the officer concerned, but I do ask that the complaint be investigated. In my opinion, it is not fair to name any one until after an impartial inquiry has been held. I have named the unit, and the officer can easily he identified. I am confident that an inquiry will disclose that the position is as I have stated. Moreover, the way in which the vote is taken is not democratic, because various sections of the unit are spread throughout the district and members do not know how their fellow-members have voted. The officer concerned has told the men that they must not discuss this matter among themselves, it being regarded as of a political nature. Recently, when a debate took place in this House as to whether the Defence Act should be amended to enable members of the Militia to be sent overseas, this officer caused members of the unit to be asked to say whether they were prepared to transfer to the Australian Imperi.al Force and they were asked to sign a questionnaire. In that wayj he tried to prejudice public opinion in this country. Such behaviour calls for action on the part of the Minister. I have advocated that members of the Australian Military Forces should be given the right to transfer to the Australian Imperial Force if they so desire, but I have always held that such a decision should he voluntary, as indeed the people of this country have decided shall be the case.",60
330,Mr HUTCHINSON,FROM AUSTRALIAN MILITARY FORCES,"Deakin) [11.13]. - The decision of the Government on the 12th May last to prohibit the advertising of controlled goods has had a serious effect on the country press, and may well prove disastrous to some sections of the press. At the best of times, a country newspaper is beset by many difficulties, whilst, particularly in war-time, costs rise considerably, and circulation falls owing to the transfer of population to the cities. In many country towns, businesses of various kinds are closing down. For instance, ' many persons engaged in the motor trade have gone, or are going, out of business, new car advertising having practically ceased, with the result that advertising by those businesses has fallen off considerably. Petrol advertisements have also been withdrawn. Advertising of sports gatherings and entertainments generally have greatly diminished as owing to war causes many such entertainments can no longer be held. In addition to all of these difficulties the country press is now faced with the direction of the Government that goods subject to the sales restriction order, including all kinds of clothing and footwear, are not to be advertised. This means that very little advertising may be done. The country press is an important factor in rural life, and is necessary for the people who live beyond the metropolitan areas in order that they may exchange information of all descriptions. Moreover, the country press takes a large part in assuring the success of various war efforts and is eager to do everything in its power to promote the success of appeals for war loans, patriotic funds and the like. The Government itself uses the country press for propaganda purposes. In these circumstances, it is surely not too much to ask that some degree of advertising should be permitted even in respect of rationed goods. I can see no reason why any restriction should have been placed on the advertising of even rationed goods for, after all, storekeepers will only be able to sell the quantity of goods they are allowed, and the curtailment of advertising cannot affect the position greatly. Eventually, sales will be governed by coupons. I do not think it too much to ask that advertising should be permitted even though sales be restricted. Unless there is a lifting of the restrictions in relation to advertising, many country newspaper proprietors will find it extremely difficult to continue publishing their journals. I wish now to bring to the notice of the Minister for Transport (Mr Lawson) the difficulties being experienced by country storekeepers in the delivery of goods. Instructions have been issued that meat and bread may be delivered on certain days but that groceries may be delivered only once a week. That procedure may be satisfactory in the metropolitan area, but it is entirely unsatisfactory in country districts where the local storekeeper is often not only the grocer but also the butcher and the baker. Country deliveries by the general storekeeper very often include bread and meat, aud even pollard and bran, and clothing and drapery as well as gnoceries. It is most unfair, therefore, to oblige country storekeepers to restrict their deliveries in the manner required 'by the Government. If they are f orced to do so, they will bave to stop delivery. In these days of petrol rationing farmers who live in outlying areas cannot visit their accustomed shopping centres as frequently as formerly. This makes it all the more necessary that facilities shall be provided for a more general delivery of goods than formerly by country storekeepers, yet the Government has restricted these activities. Not only do the country storekeepers deliver goods to farmers but also they often pick up cans of cream from the roadside and deliver them to the butter factories or railway stations. If the general delivery of goods be restricted, it will become more difficult than ever for farmers to get their cream to the f actories. I urge a more generous outlook in these matters.",60
331,Mr CALWELL,FROM AUSTRALIAN MILITARY FORCES,"Melbourne) [11.22]. - I ask the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Ward) whether he will do his best to convene an early meeting of the Cabinet sub-committee which has been appointed to deal with Government policy in respect of exemptions for military service? I have in mind, particularly, the case of men who were obliged to take the oath when they were attested and who now find that magistrates will not deal with their applications for exemption because they have taken the oath. Many such cases have been brought to my notice. A few magistrates have dealt with applications for exemption but most magistrates bavs held that once a man has been attested he is removed from the jurisdiction of the. court. It is urgent that a decision a.= to policy should be reached by the Government on this important matter. I have been informed, unofficially, by certain Crown law authorities that magistrates have power to deal with these cases, but no authoritative opinion has been expressed publicly on the subject. I am aware that fifteen cases have been dealt with recently at North Melbourne, and two adjournments have been granted; but that is an isolated instance. What WP require is an immediate statement of Government policy on the question so that the men concerned will know their fate. I support the protest of the honourable member for Reid (Mr Morgan) against military officers asking for mass decisions of units of the Australian Military Forces on the question of enlistment in the Australian Imperial Force. If it. be true, as stated by the honourable member, that the names of men who have refused to volunteer in the Australian Imperial Force have been taken, it is most improper and amounts to a form of duress. In fact, it savours of the press-gang method of another age. I understand that it is the policy of the Government to place no difficulty in the way of members of the Australian Military Forces volunteering for the Australian Imperial Force, but that is a very different thing from subjecting the men to ballots, plobiscites, and the like in order to obtain mass decisions by units on the subject. The Minister for Supply and Development (Mr Beasley) promised me this afternoon, in reply to a question, that the attitude of the Government towards Myer Emporium Limited would be reviewed. I am advised that that firm recently allowed members of the staff to purchase goods at marked-down prices under conditions which did not apply to the general public. In purporting to comply with an order to return £250,000 to the public which had been improperly taken from it, the management, on one day in particular, charged members of the staff only 2s. for every £1 worth of goods bought. These conditions were not available to the general public. Consequently, the slick Mr Myer converted the order of the Prices Commissioner into something in the nature of a staff bonus at the expense of the general public. He is a most fruitfu l gentleman in adopting ways and means of ingratiating himself with his staff, but surely he cannot be allowed to divest himself of his ill-gotten gains in this way. My view is that the firm should be obliged to pay £250,000 into the Commonwealth Treasury. The same principles should apply to this big firm, and to other big firms for that matter, as those which apply to small shopkeepers. I can see no reason why the Government should treat Myer Emporium Limited magnaminously. The flimsy pretexts which the firm has offered in excuse for fleecing the public, such a3 the multiplicity of small transactions and the like, are ridiculous. Public opinion everywhere has been outraged at the manner in which this firm has been able to avoid the consequences of its actions. The report of the Joint Committee on Profits showed clearly that many small firms had been fined amounts ranging from £10 to £50 for breaches of the prices regulations, yet this big firm has been able to escape any penalty. If the Government wishes to re-establish itself in the esteem of the people, it should prosecute this firm without delay. Beyond question, the firm should be obliged to return the £250,000 which it has illegally taken from the general community in Melbourne.",61
332,Mr RANKIN,FROM AUSTRALIAN MILITARY FORCES,"Would the honourable member be in favour of extending that treatment to the .Sydney firm that robbed the people of that city of £40,000, which the honourable member for Dalley (Mr. Rosevear) tried to protect?",62
333,Mr CALWELL,FROM AUSTRALIAN MILITARY FORCES,"I am not aware that the honourable member for Dalley tried to protect any firm that had robbed the people of Sydney. A firm guilty of taking from the public £40,000, £10,000 or £5,000 more than it was entitled to receive, should be treated as are small shopkeepers who rob the people of £5. My complaint is in respect of differential treatment being accorded to big business. I refuse to believe that the people of Australia would condone preferential treatment in the matter of the infringement of price-fixing regulations by Myer Emporium Limited or breaches of the censorship regulations by Sir Keith Murdoch.",62
334,Mr WARD,FROM AUSTRALIAN MILITARY FORCES,"East Sydney-Minister for Labour and National Service) [11.31.] - The honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell) drew attention to discrepancies in the decisions of magistrates in cases they are competent to hear under the man-power regulations, and asked that an early meeting of the sub-committee of Cabinet be held in order to define the position. The committee referred to was appointed as the result of a decision of the War Cabinet, and I was added to it. The chairman of the committee is the Minister for War Organization of Industry (Mr Dedman). with whom I shall be pleased to take up the matter in order to see whether a meeting of the committee may be held this week with a view to a decision being arrived at.",62
335,Mr CHIFLEY,FROM AUSTRALIAN MILITARY FORCES,"Macquarie-Trea surer) [11.32] - in reply - I shall endeavour to have dissected thespeech of the honourable member for Boothby (Dr Price), in order to refer to the respective Ministers the very many matters he has raised. I rather gained the impression that the honourable member had collected a number of grievances, and thought that he would fire off a preliminary budget speech. The honourable member said that the Lord Mayor of Adelaide had told him something in regard to the cashing of war savings certificates. All that I have to say is that there has always been a number of war savings certificates cashed. I replied to a question on the subject in this House recently. The opinions that I then gave were those of the Commonwealth Bank Board, which is as competent as the Lord Mayor of Adelaide to express views concerning the cashing of war savings certificates. That gentleman may have an axe to grind, and may have thought that some good would be served if he were to whisper in the ear of the honourable member. I have obtained my information, not from some person on a street corner or a lord mayor, but from the Commonwealth Bank Board, which bas exact knowledge of such matters. The honourable member for Reid (Mr. Morgan) has asserted that undue influence is being used in order to obtain transfer from the Australian Military Forces to the Australian Imperial Force. If he has correctly stated the case, action by the Minister for the Army is needed in order to stop the practice. I shall bring the matter to the notice of that Minister - Statutor y Rules 1942, No. 191. I shall refer to the Minister for War Organization of Industry (Mr Dedman) the remarks of the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Hutchinson) in regard to advertising. I am able to appreciate some of the difficulties of country newspapers, because of the knowledge that I possess concerning them. The other matter that the honourable member raised T shall refer to the Minister for .Transport (Mr Lawson). The Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Ward) has already referred to one of the matters raised by the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr. Calwell). One of the remaining two in some degree affects my department. I shall have inquiries made into both of tbem. Question resolved in the affirmative. PAPERS.

336,Mr WILSON,FROM AUSTRALIAN MILITARY FORCES,"the Minister for Commerce, upon notice I. Has he seen the following statements appearing in the New Zealand Farmer Weekly-(a ) No farmer could make a better contribution to the war effort than by growing wheat; (6) sufficient petrol and oil fuel will be made available to all - wheat-growers both for harvest and for preparing the land and sowing the new crop; (c) labour will be made available for both the above purposes; and (d) the Dominion requires 300,000 acres of wheat annually. Not once since 1933 has such an area been sown. In that year 302,000 acres were cropped, and, aided by an exceptionally good yield of 364 bushels an acre, more than 11,000,000 bushels were garnered? 2. In view of this position in a sister dominion, would it be advisable, in the interests of the disposal of surplus Australian wheat stocks, that immediate negotiations should be begun for some reciprocal trade arrangement to meet the New Zealand requirements of wheat in part, as this should prove advantageous to both countries under the present stress of war conditions?",63
337,Mr SCULLY,FROM AUSTRALIAN MILITARY FORCES,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as 1. Yes. 2. The Commonwealth Oovernment has already conferred with the Government of New Zealand regarding the supply of wheat from Australia, and satisfactory arrangements have concluded. The object of the present New Zealand programme is to make New Zealand as self-supporting as possible in this primary commodity. HOLIDAY PAY .",63
338,Mr CALWELL,FROM AUSTRALIAN MILITARY FORCES,"the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice-1. What action has been taken to ensure that members of the Fibrous Plasterers' Union Victoria are paid the wages they are entitled s by to for work done on Easter Monday and Labour Day? 2. Is it a fact that the employers in these cases have refused to pay the wages due? 3. Will he ensure that machinery will be Nos. devised to protect the wages and conditions 224, of the members of this union and other unions against pinpricking methods of employers?",63
339,Mr WARD,FROM AUSTRALIAN MILITARY FORCES,"The answers to the honourable members questions are as follows:1. Owing to the refusal of the employers observe the regulations in regard to the payment of fibrous plasterers employed on Easter Monday and Labour Day, action was taken by my department to have the matter placed in the hands of the Deputy Crown Solicitor, Melbourne, with instructions to proceed against the firms concerned for a breach of the regulations. 2. Yes; but all except two of the employers have now paid the wages due. 3. Yes. Prosecutions will be lodged in all cases where employers attempt to defeat the purposes of the National Security Regulations. CORAL SEA NAVAL ENGAGEMENTS: NEWS CENSORSHIP.",64
340,Mr FORDE,FROM AUSTRALIAN MILITARY FORCES,"On the 14th May, the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr. Calwell) asked a question, without notice, in regard to the publication by Sir Murdoch in the Melbourne Herald and other newspapers of an article in which it was alleged that certain facts had revealed relating to the battle of the Coral Sea, but which war correspondents had, by censorship instruction, been prement parts. cluded from using. A report has now been received from the State Censor in Victoria to the effect that the article by Sir Keith Murdoch which objection was taken, was passed by censorship after certain deletions were made in consultation with allied headcamps quarters. Similar security deletions had been made by military censors from war correspondents' despatches. breaches of the censorship regulations have occurred action has been taken prevent a recurrence. AUSTRALIAN ARMY : PERIOD OF LEAVE.",64
341,Mr FORDE,FROM AUSTRALIAN MILITARY FORCES,"On the 15th May, the honourable member for Deakin (Mr. Hutchinson) asked whether members of the Australian Imperial Force recently returned from the Middle East had been given seven days' leave, while personnel from Darwin and other northern stations were given one month's leave. I now inform the honourable member that the statement that personnel who have been serving at Darwin were to granted leave of one month's duration is the result of a press announcement service. which emanated from unofficial sources. However, action is at present being taken to devise a system of relief, compatible with the situation, in regard to these personnel, as well as other troops serving into isolated or tropical localities. Instances have occurred of personnel evacuated from islands adjacent to Australia being granted one month's leave on return to Australia. This was done on the recommendation of the medical authorities in order to assist such members to regain their health in a domestic environment, in cases where the member's medical condition permitted such a course to be taken. IMPRESSMENT OF RIFLES.",64
342,Mr FORDE,FROM AUSTRALIAN MILITARY FORCES,"On the 15th May the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr. Duncan-Hughes) asked whether .22 repeating rifles recently impressed were being held unused, and if so, when they Keith would be returned to their owners? I now inform the honourable member that it is not proposed to return any of been the impressed rifles to their owners.. Rifles not in military use are being either reconditioned or broken up for replaceWERRIBEE BEEF.",64
343,Mr FORDE,FROM AUSTRALIAN MILITARY FORCES,"On the 15th May, the to honourable member for Bendigo (Mr. Rankin) asked me, without notice I. What butchers supply beef to the military at Royal Park, Darley and Seymour? 2. Has any of the beef supplied to those camps during the last three weeks come from the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of When Works farm at Werribee? The answers to the honourable memto ber's questions are as follows:1. Royal Park and Seymour camps are supplied with meat by F. Watkins Proprietary Limited. Darley camp is supplied by W. Angliss Proprietary Limited. 2. No. ARMY CANTEEN PRICES.",64
344,Mr FORDE,FROM AUSTRALIAN MILITARY FORCES,"On the 8th May, the honourable member for Reid (Mr Morgan) referred to the prices charged for certain articles to Army canteens which he stated were in excess of those charged by city stores, and asked that the service men who patronize the canteens be charged the be lowest prices for goods, thus enabling them to obtain the full benefit of this I now inform the honourable member that the prices charged by canteen services throughout Australia should in no instance be higher than those charged by retail stores, and in the great majority of cases they are lower. If the honourable member will indicate where this is not the case, the matter will be immediately investigated. CANBERRA : OMNIBUSES - AIRRAI D  senting the Minister for the Interior, upon notice I. Is there any ordinance governing the number of passengers to be carried on motor omnibuses operating in Canberra? 2. If so, what does such ordinance specifically provide? 3. Is it a fact that there have been frequent complaints that omnibuses are often overcrowded to such an extent that members of the public have refused to travel on them for safety reasons? 4. In view of the possibility that if one of these overcrowded omnibuses was involved in an accident considerable injury and perhaps loss of life might result, in the interests of public safety will he take immediate action to prevent overcrowding in the future?",64
345,Mr LAZZARINI,FROM AUSTRALIAN MILITARY FORCES,"The Minister for the Interior has supplied the following answers:1. The Motor Traffic Ordinance 1936-1041. 2. Section 24(3) provides for the licensing of omnibuses. The licence indicates the loading capacity for each vehicle. These loadings vary according to the size of the vehicle. 3. Not so far as I am aware. 4. The safety factor on the chassis of the vehicle is well above the licensed capacity of the vehicle. Additional omnibuses are on order, and delivery is overdue owing to war conditions. When these vehicles are available the position will be relieved. In the meantime, the effect upon omnibus loading of petrol rationing and the increased Canberra population, owing to services activities, is a condition which cannot be avoided. At the same time, the residents of Canberra must realise that, owing to the great difficulties which arc being experienced by the Transport Section of the department in providing the services, they must be prepared to expect some inconvenience at peak periods. A new timetable, designed to provide for a more regular stream of traffic, is being prepared. It is hoped to introduce this timetable within about a month.  Home Security, upon notice I. Are there in existence any ordinances or regulations governing the provision of properly constructed air raid shelters in hotels and otlier buildings in Canberra in which more than twenty persons, or any given number of persons, are accommodated ? 2. If such ordinances or regulations do exist, will he inform the House who is responsible for the provision of such shelters, and what action, if any, has been taken to ensure that they are provided?",65
346,Mr LAZZAKINI,FROM AUSTRALIAN MILITARY FORCES,"The following answers have been supplied by the Minister for the Interior, who is responsible for SHELTERS. enemy raids precautions in the Australian Capital Territory. 1. Yes. The Air Raid Shelters Order made under the provisions of the Enemy Raids Precautions Ordinance 1942. 2. The owner of every building normally accommodating twenty or more persons is responsible for the construction of air raid shelters, and the owner is liable to penalties provided under the Enemy Raids Precautions Ordinance 1942 for failure to comply with the provisions of the order. Where the Commonwealth is the owner, suitable protection against aerial warfare has been provided, either by internal measures or trenches, or both. Trenches have also been provided at shopping centres, schools, and other areas. Some private owners concerned have made the necessary provisions, and others arc either in course of doing so, or being notified of their obligations. INTERNEES.",65
347,Mr BLACKBURN,FROM AUSTRALIAN MILITARY FORCES,"the Minister for the Army, upon noticeHow many Australian-born persons are now in internment camps in Australia?",65
348,Mr FORDE,FROM AUSTRALIAN MILITARY FORCES,"The total number of Australian-born persons now in internment camps in Australia is 167. This number is exclusive of (.hildren who have been permitted, cn humanitarian grounds, to accompany their interned parents. PREFERENCE TO UNIONISTS .",65
349,Mr CURTIN,FROM AUSTRALIAN MILITARY FORCES,"On the 15th May, 1942, the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison) asked me. without notice, whether forms required by the man-power authorities to be filled in by the tally clerks at the waterfront in Sydney were a means of effecting compulsory unionism. The honourable member's question related to an arrangement made by representatives of employers and employees to review men employed as casual tally clerks on the waterfront prior to the 1st October, 1941. The form referred to by the honourable member was agreed upon by representatives of the Federated Clerks Union as a means of determining the number of tally clerks necessary effectively to maintain shipping transport services.",65
