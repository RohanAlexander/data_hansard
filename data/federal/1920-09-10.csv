1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Eon. Sir Elliot Johnson) took the - chair at 11 a.m., and read prayers. VATJCLUSE HOUSE.",19
2,Mr MARRS,Unknown,"In the absence of the Prime Minister, I desire to put before the Treasurer an offer made by the Vaucluse Trust to place at the disposal of the Commonwealth the historic and valuable building known as Vaucluse 'House, at Watson's Bay, Sydney, for the purposes of a permanent war museum. It is a magnificent offer. Money could not buy the house; and I ask the Treasurer whether due consideration will be given to the matter?",19
3,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I agree with my honourable friend that the offer is a very fine one. If the building be at all suitable for the purpose I think we shall be very grateful for it. FLINDERS NAVAL BASE.,19
4,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Will the Minister for the Navy state when it is anticipated that Flinders Naval Base will have its fall complement of men, and what class of training will be undergonethere?",19
5,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"I cannot give the honourable member offhand the information he desires. The men will be moved to the base with the greatest possible expedition. The first unit has already been despatched, and others will shortly follow. UNIFORM RAILWAY GAUGE.",19
6,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,Will the Government lay on the table of the House the report submitted at the recent Premiers' Conference in regard to the unification of railway gauges?,19
7,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I see no reason why, at the earliest possible moment, the whole report of the proceedings of the Conference should not be presented to the House. I shall inquire what is doing in the matter. NA ASSOCIATION. EXEMPTION FROM INCOME TAX.",19
8,Mr MARRS,NEW SOUTH WALES CRICKET,"Will the Treasurer give consideration to the request of New South Wales Cricket Association community ? that it should be placed on the Eederal income tax exemption list? The fund3 that matter. of the association are not distributed amongst the members. The whole of the takings are used in the renewing and preparation of the cricket ground, on which a sum of £5,000 has recently been expended. Will the right honourable gentleman favourably consider the quest?",20
9,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NEW SOUTH WALES CRICKET,"May I say that, on general principles, any man who deis sires in this way to get money out of the Treasury is mine enemy. Speaking seriously, I am afraid I cannot honourable member a definite reply to his question; but I can say that the matter will be considered. SUGAR SUPPLIES.",20
10,Mr FENTON,NEW SOUTH WALES CRICKET,"Considerabl e anxiety prevails in regard to sugar supplies. the Minister for Trade and Customs in that form the House what arrangements are being made with regard to future supdene, plies. Is any attempt being made, as days gone by, to lay in reserves ?",20
11,Mr MASSYGREENE,NEW SOUTH WALES CRICKET,"We are buying sugar, whenever the opportunity offers, to make good the deficiency between Australia's requirements and the Australian crop, and our purchases will provide for the necesnot sary carry over of about 15,000 tons.",20
12,Mr TUDOR,NEW SOUTH WALES CRICKET,Is that in addition to what is necessary to make good the actual shortage?,20
13,Mr MASSYGREENE,NEW SOUTH WALES CRICKET,Our object is always to have in hand sufficient to carry us over until the new crop comes in. BUDGET.,20
14,Mr RILEY,NEW SOUTH WALES CRICKET,On what day does the Treasurer propose to deliver his Budget statement?,20
15,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NEW SOUTH WALES CRICKET,On Thursday next. TAXATION COMMISSION.,20
16,Mr WEST,NEW SOUTH WALES CRICKET,Will the Treasurer state what effect the Royal Commission on Taxation will have so far as proposals may be made in his Budget for relieving the of taxation the wealthy section of the,20
17,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NEW SOUTH WALES CRICKET,I will consider COMMERCIAL AVIATION .,20
18,Mr GREGORY,NEW SOUTH WALES CRICKET,"Las t night we had a very interesting statement from the Prime Minister in regard to the Defence policy of the Government. I desire to ask the reTreasurer whether the Government will seriously consider the advisableness of providing for a larger expenditure than proposed to assist commercial aviation, even if a corresponding reduction has to be made in the contemplated expenditure give the on Defence aviation.",20
19,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NEW SOUTH WALES CRICKET,"I think my honourable friend will find, in the sequel, that the sum of £100,000 to be placed on the Estimates is as much as can be spent during the financial year. The intention of the Government is to develop civil aviation to the fullest possible extent, and if it is found that more money can be spent Can during the year, I think I can promise it will be available. May I suggest, however, that before anything else can be a great deal of survey work must in be carried, out. That preliminary work will involve a great deal of time, and we shall not be expending very much on actual aviation until the latter half of the financial year. I am quite sure that when the end of the year arrives, we shall have spent the whole of the amount which is to be set apart for this purpose. I shall be glad if we have been able to do so, because I think the matter is very urgent, and the Government so regard it. It was only because the Government felt that no larger sum could be spent within the financial year that the amount to be provided was. fixed at £100,000. DEATH OF CAPTAI N HOWELL. .",20
20,Mr BRENNAN,NEW SOUTH WALES CRICKET,"Havin g regard to the fact that the Commonwealth was interested in the recent competitive aerial flight from England to Australia, I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether the Government have satisfied themselves as to the circumstances of the death of the late Captain Howell; aud, if so, whether they will be good enough to furnish the House with information, by way of a short report, as to the conclusion at which they have arrived with respect to the cause and circumstances of his death.",20
21,Mr HUGHES,NEW SOUTH WALES CRICKET,"I understand that we have no information other than that in the possession of the Defence Department, but I shall make inquiries on the subject. T have been noting carefully, ancl with great interest, the doubts cast by the parents of Captain Howell upon the reports as to his death. I think that I have also had a personal letter from the widow of Captain Howell, who came out here. I shall telegraph to the authorities' at Home, asking them to supply us with whatever information they have, ancl will make available to the House the reply that I receive. NA EXCHANGE.",21
22,Mr BRUCE,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"In view of a promise made recently by the Prime Minister that legislation would be introduced without delay to remedy the present basis upon which Customs duties are levied, I desire to ask the right honourable gentleman when that legislation is likely to be introduced?",21
23,Mr HUGHES,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"That is a difficult question to answer. I am very sorry that, in making up the list of measures that I thought ""stood between us and the temporary end of our sittings, I omitted that Bill. It has, however, to be included in the list. If we are ever to reach a temporary end, we shall have to proceed with business a little more speedily. The best answer I can give the honourable member is that the Bill will be introduced as soon as possible. Getting behind that rather ambiguous observation, I think that one may say that, unless there is a general desire on the part of honourable members to get through the business within a reasonable time, we cannot justify our existence as a Parliament. If , instead of what I am, I were an ordinary citizen outside Parliament, I should say so, and pretty flatly, too. Talk about the fable of the hare and the tortoise! Why, Parliament is at best progressing sideways, and I think it is about time it took a move forward. I suppose that in a few minutes we shall have a motion for the adjournment of the House. That will occupy the best part of the forenoon. Later, no doubt, we shall have some other proposal to delay the business. Thus we do our ""work,"" and it cannot be said we do it very well. AVIATION.",21
24,Mr WEST,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"The Prime Minister stated last night that aviation schools and stations will be established. Will he make such provision at Canberra, so that honourable members may return to the various capital cities by aeroplane at the week-end ?",21
25,Mr HUGHES,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"I shall do so. I shall provide single-seated machines, in which honourable members may come and go. In the interests of morality, I do not think I should go further than that. AFFORESTATION AT CANBERRA.",21
26,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"Will the Minister for Home and Territories lay upon the table of the Library the reports upon afforestation at Canberra, made by certain experts; also the correspondence in regard to ithe application of the Department of Repatriation for the employment of returned soldiers in forestry work there, and any other papers throwing light upon the refusal of the Department to permit returned soldiers to be so employed ?  to do so. In regard to the latter part of the question, I have no knowledge that the Department has refused permission, as the honourable member suggests. NEW GUINEA.",21
27,Mr BRENNAN,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,Can the Prime Minister inform the House when the civil administration will be. instituted in former German New Guinea?,21
28,Mr HUGHES,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"We propose to proceed being with the New Guinea Bill next week, and as soon as it becomes law an Administrator will be appointed, and civil administration will commence. I hope that it wiU start within a month from now. The following papers were presented:Papers presented to the British ParliamentPeace TreatyItalian Reparation Payments - Declaration modifying the Agreement of 10th September, 1019, between the Allied and Associated Powers with regard to. Signed in Paris, 8th December, 1919. Serb-Croat-Slovene State - Declaration of Accession by, to the Treaty - of Peace with Austria, the Treaty between the Principal Allied and Associated Powers and the Serb-CroatSlovenc State, and the Agreements with regard to the Italian Reparation Payments and the contributions to the cost of liberation of tories of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire. Signed in Paris, 5th December,. 1919. ADJOURNMENT (Formal). PURCHASE OF SAW-MILLS AND TIMBER AREAS IN QUEENSLAND.",21
29,Mr SPEAKER,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"I have received from the honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams) an intimation that he desires to move the adjournment of the House to discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, "" The purchase of certain saw-mills, plant, and lands in Queensland, at a cost to the Commonwealth of about £500,000, without the approval of this House."" Five lionorable members having risen in their places, Question proposed.",22
30,Mr MCWILLIAM S,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"F r a n k l in ) [11.21]. -'Despit e the little pleasantry by the Prime Minister in regard to wasting the time of the House with a motion for adjournment, I make no apology for calling attention to what I consider a matter of very gravo importance indeed. announcing the policy of the Country party, on the 10th March last, I saidAnd, above all, there must be a return to parliamentary control of the public purse. The war, thank God, is over, and the earlier this Parliament returns to the traditions of responsible government, the better it will be for the country and the easier for the Ministry. All expenditure of any magnitude should be authorised by this House, and reasonable opportunity should be afforded for its proper consideration. Parliament must immediately resume absolute control of the public purse. PAPERS. Parliament has the right to protest against matters of such vital importance as this purchase of certain saw-mills in Queensland being notified in the public press before being made known to it while it is in session. Apar t from that, a very grave principle is involved. Although Parliament is in session, it finds itself committed to an expenditure of about £500,000 without-having had any opportunity of expressing an opinion on the matter. I do not propose at this stage to enter into the merits or demerits of the purchase; but, if this Commonwealth is to embark on a policy of State Socialism, it should be done directly and the Terriopenly, with the consent of Parliament. We should not have what the Actin g Leader of the House (Sir Joseph Cook), when sitting in Opposition, described a3 "" this pernicious system of sneaking State Socialism into Australia without the knowledge and consent of Parliament.""",22
31,Sir JOSEPH COOK,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,The House happens to have authorized this particular kind of State Socialism.,22
32,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,I say deliberately that the House did not authorize this kind of expenditure.,22
33,Sir JOSEPH COOK,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"Oh , yes.",22
34,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"In moving the second reading of the War Service Homes Bill , the present Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Groom) saidVery wide discretionary powers arc given to the Commissioner, but there is a limitation that land or land and buildings exceeding £5,000 in value shall be acquired only with the approval of the Minister. And section 16 of the Act concludes with these wordsBefore exercising any power under this secWhen tion which involves the expenditure of more than £5,000, the Commissioner shall submit his proposal for the approval of the Minister. The Prime Minister has adopted the fair and straightforward attitude of j u s t if ying the purchase. He announced that the Government had purchased these properties after the matter had been referred to Cabinet. But it is idle to say that power to make these purchases was given to the Commissioner; it was deliberately refused; and, in moving the second reading of the War Sendee Homes Bill , the Minister in charge deliberately stressed the limitation that was imposed. An amending Bill, which has been carried through another place, adds that same limitation to section 14, which deals with the delegation of powers by the Commissioner, because there might be some doubt as to whether the restriction applies to delegated powers. The Commissioner did not delegate his power in regard to this particular purchase; he dealt with it himself.",22
35,Sir JOSEPH COOK,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"In that same amending Bill I intend to submit other proposals, which will establish further Treasury control.",23
36,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"Accordin g to the best advices I have been able to get, the Government have full and complete control over all expenditure of amounts in excess of £5,000. It is a well-known legal axiom that no one can delegate powers greater than those he possesses. If the Commissioner has no power to expend more than £5,000 without the approval of the Minister, most assuredly he cannot delegate such power.",23
37,Mr RYAJJ,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"No one will dispute that contention, but has the Commissioner the power ?",23
38,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"Unquestionably, he has not the power. The Minister who introduced the Bill distinctly said .so; and section 16 of the Act is definite upon that point ",23
39,Sir JOSEPH COOK,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,Neve r mind what the Minister said; read what the Act provides.,23
40,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"Sub-sectio n 5 of section 16 provided that, before exercising any power under that section which involves the expenditure of more than £5,000, the Commissioner shall submit his proposal for the approval of the Minister.",23
41,Mr CHARLTON,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,What power does that section confer?,23
42,Sir ROBERT BEST,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,The question of delegation does not arise in this matter at all.,23
43,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"It does to this extent-that the Senate has already passed a Bill to include a new section, which will remove any doubt which may exist as to whether the Commissioner able to delegate power in respect of penditure in excess of £5,000.",23
44,Mr RYAN,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,The honourable member is entitled to say that it is against the spirit of the section.,23
45,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"And I am em titled also to say that this project was referred to Cabinet before the actual purchases were made. I can show that the matter of the purchase of saw-mills has been under the consideration of the Minister for Repatriation (Senator E. D. Millen) for twelve months. I have had some correspondence sent me today dealing with the purchase of another timber mill. I propose to read a letter from Mr. F. E. Dixon, as follows:Adverting to my interview with your Mr. Morell of a few days ago on behalf of the Rubicon Lumber and Tramway Co. Ppty. Ltd., as arranged, I have now to ask t'mt, in the event of j'our Department deciding to purchase any saw-mill plant, I shall be glad to be given the opportunity of placing this company's proposition before you with a view to the purchase of same by your Department. . Mr STEWART - Was that written to the Minister ?",23
46,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"It is addressed to the Commissioner, and is dated ISth August, 1920; but it follows up a correspondence which began nearly twelve months ago.",23
47,Mr RILEY,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,Where is the mill situated?,23
48,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"In Victoria. In another letter, dated 20th August, 1920, and addressed to the Minister for Repatriation, Mr Dixon writes:When this proposal was first being considered about twelve months ago, I saw the  who was favourably impressed with the proposition I placed before him, and who told me to bring the matter under the notice of Colonel Walker. I was not able to see the Colonel, but saw Mr Morell, who told me that his Department had been oiTered several mills, hut it was very unlikely that they would purchase any, so to save his time and mine, it was agreed between us that should they decide to. purchase, I would be given the opportunity of placing my proposition before the Commission.",23
49,Mr RILEY,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"What bearing has that on the Act, anyhow?",23
50,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"I want to show conclusively that the suggestion which has now been made by the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook), that the Queensland puris chases were carried out by the Commisexsioner without the knowledge of the Government",23
51,Sir JOSEPH COOK,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,No ; I have never said so.,24
52,Mr BAYLEY,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,The Minister certainly never made such a suggestion.,24
53,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"Then if the ject has been sanctioned by the responsible Minister, we can take out all the provisions of the Act, and come back to the solid proposition that the Minister and the W a r Service Homes Commissioner agreed to this purchase, involving half a million sterling, without the knowledge or approval of Parliament. Mr RICHARD FOSTER,-Now you are coming to the point.",24
54,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"I think it is a very serious matter that a man, after having placed a plant under offer to the Department, and having been told that, before any purchase was made, his offer would be considered, should learn-with out any further official intimation or, in deed, without knowledge from any source - that the whole proposition has been completed.",24
55,Mr RILEY,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"The honourable member's complaint is that there has not been a full and free selection, and that certain parties, who sought to place properties under offer, have been excluded?",24
56,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,I am endeavouring to put the whole case full y before the House. I think I have established that Cabinet - has considered and has had . the project in hand for a considerable time.,24
57,Sir JOSEPH COOK,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"Hear , hear!",24
58,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"And , therefore, that the Government take full and complete responsibility for the deal.",24
59,Sir JOSEPH COOK,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"-We have got to do so, anyhow.",24
60,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"If a proposal of a similar character had been launched when honourable members who are now in Opposition, were in power; if they had bought £500,000 worth of saw-mills with the intention of running them as a State Socialistic concern, honourable members now behind the Government would have risen in wrath and protested. We have had two or three of these State deals without the consent of Parliament. One of them- I am bound to say-ha s turned out an exceedingly good proposition. I refer to the purchase of the Strath line of steamers by the Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes), when he was in London. U n doubtedly, that venture has proved a really good commercial undertaking. But there have been some other State ventures inaugurated under similar circumpro- stances-that is, by the Cabinet solely, and without the approval of Parliament - whic h certainly'have not been successful. For instance, there was the purchase of the Shaw wireless plant. That was made a Cabinet matter, and was undertaken without the sanction of Parliament. Then there was another project which, although it did not prove so disastrous politically, has been very much more serious from the financial aspect. I refer to contracts entered into for the building of certain wooden ships-.",24
61,Mr BRUCE,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,But the honourable member is not suggesting that the test of this kind of thing turns upon the question of success or failure?,24
62,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"I am not. I am purposely avoiding such a line of argument, although a great deal could be said in regard to that phase; and I might add that certain information has come to hand, by the use of which I could throw an interesting light upon certain specific Commonwealth business ventures. However, when I perused the statement of the Minister for Repatriation, which was read to the House by the Prime Minister, it recalled to my mind boyhood days in the Huon country. I remember that a man came into the timber country to make certain very large purchases of timber supplies. He did splendid business. He bought tens of thousands of palings, and hundreds of thousands of shingles "" in the round "" ; and he paid a deposit. He did not discover what was meant by the phrase "" in the round "" until he went out into the bush to look for his timber. Then he learned that "" in the round "" meant growing trees. Some of the figures proffered by the Prime Minister reminded me very much of that deal.",24
63,Mr BRENNAN,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"As a matter of fact, the honourable member's interpretation of the phrase is not technically correct. "" In the round "" means when the timber is cut.",24
64,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"I am not prepared to accept that ; and, in any case, the timber was sold as I have described the deal. If the Queensland project has been put through with the idea f i at there will be an increase in output from the mills, I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that the Government will soon find out their mistake. The Lahey Brothers are amongst the hardest-headed business men in Queensland. Do the Government mean to suggest that, as an outcome of those men selling their plant to the Federal authorities, the output of the mills will be increased ? No one will say that men who know the game from A to Z cannot get a greater production than an inexperienced Government. l""-have lived in timber country for the best years of my life. I have never known one big company to make money out of sawmilling in Tasmania.",24
65,Mr BELL,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,I have; and small ones too.,25
66,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"I repeat that I have never known one big company which has made money out of saw-milling in that State. Of course, the saw-mills during the past two years or so have been .011 a far better basis owing to the fact that there have been no importations of American timber, as a result of which prices in Australia have risen by more than 200 per cent.",25
67,Mr FENTON,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,That is the profiteering which we want to put a stop to.,25
68,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"So far as that is concerned, the Prime Minister remarked, in effect, that the State mills are profiteering also-if there is any profiteering at all-because , he said, one cannot buy timber more cheaply from the State mills than from private mills. A6 for the wooden ships venture, that contract was entered into without the approval of Parliament, and it has cost us more than £500 000. Then there is also the wooden shipbuilding venture in which the firm of Kidman and Mayoh were concerned.",25
69,Mr BATLEY,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,What has that to do with this business ?,25
70,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"It is an underof taking which wa6 entered into in just the same circumstances; that is to say, without the knowledge or consent of Parliament. And the honourable member has to accept his individual responsibility for the deal, as a supporter of the Government, along with his fellow members behind the Treasury benches.",25
71,Sir JOSEPH COOK,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"The answer to this illustration is that every other country in the world has made similar losses. Some have lost ten times as much money, during the war, upon this same kind of thing.",25
72,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,If any country in the world has made a worse deal than Australia over' its wooden ship contracts,25
73,Mr HUGHES,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"Well , other countries haye done so, and have done far worse.",25
74,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"I intend, despite opposition, to make use of the figures representing the loss in connection with the Kidman and Mayoh contract, in regard to which class of deal the Treasurer, and the Prime Minister, say that other countries have done much worse. The Government entered into a contract with that firm for the construction of six ships. The building of four was cancelled, at a cost of £52,000. The other two ships were built, and were sold privately.",25
75,Mr SPEAKER,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN," Order ! Will the honourable member say how he proposes to connect this matter with the motion?  should not forget that the Americans made a loss at the rate of £13 per ton on their wooden vessels, as against our loss, which works out at £5 a ton.",25
76,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"I want the House to decide whether the functions of Parliament are to be vested in the Executive, or to remain with Parliament itself. I want honourable members to say, now, whether they are prepared to allow any Minister, or any official under that M in ister, to commit Parliament and the count r y to any enterprise he may select, and to any extent he may choose; and then, for honourable members to be told that it is useless to say anything, seeing that the deal is closed, and is a good bargain. A f t e r all of which, when the proposition proves to be a rotten bargain-as some these ventures have been-ther e is no course open to honourable members but to stand aside and watch the country pay and look pleasant. I want the House to express an opinion now. We cannot stop this latest deal. It has been completed, no matter what the ultimate cost is likely to be. If the Government were to be compelled to retire tomorrow, it would be for those who succeeded it to carry out the terms of the contract. In all British communities, the principle of inheriting public responsibilities by one Government from its predecessor is unquestionably accepted.",25
77,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,I hope the Corner party will observe that rule in connection with Canberra!,26
78,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"I am afraid there is a tendency to "" side track "" this important issue. I wish the House would decide now whether Ministers are to be allowed to enter into contracts extending over half-a-million in money on projects which this House has not sanctioned, of which it knows nothing, and in regard to which it has, without protest, surrendered its entire power to the Executive. As for myself and the party which I have the honour to lead, we intend, as far as we to restore to Parliament its proper tions-it s proper power over the purse. This enormous growth of the Executive power has grown up in other countries as well as in this. If we refer to Mr Sidney Low, or other recent writers, on British politics, we find them making exactly the same complaint-that the individual member, whether in Opposition or behind the Government, has surrendered, and is surrendering daily, the con- ment. trol of Parliament over the public purse. I know we shall not be able to bring this question to an issue now, but I intend to take the first opportunity that offers to have a direct expression of the opinion of the House",26
79,Mr RYAN,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,The honourable member has an easy way of bringing the matter to an issue.,26
80,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"If the question is not brought to a vote today it will be my fault, for I shall do nothing to stop it. On the contrary, I shall take the first opportunity to have a deliberate resolution of this House that no Minister, or no Cabinet, shall make this Parliament or this country responsible for over a certain amount, and it will be a small amount.",26
81,Mr HUGHES,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,What amount? Let know the amount.,26
82,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"I shall announce the amount when I am dealing with the matter, but I can assure the Prime Minister that it will be very much less than that they have incurred in the saw-milling Socialistic enterprise. Mv. BRENNAN - That is the honourable member's trouble? Mv. MCWILLIAMS - No , that is not my trouble; but I would limit the Government to an amount less than one-tenth of [186] what they have spent on that enterprise - considerabl y under one-tenth. The Government are not limited at all now, in the matter of expenditure.",26
83,Mr GREGORY,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,They are limited under the Public Works Act.,26
84,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"What effect did that Act have on the purchase of these sawmilling properties ? Was that purchase referred to the Public Works Committee, or to the Public Accounts Committee; or, indeed, to anybody except the Commissioner, who sent in a report, which the Government chose to call for? I am not can, speaking of the merits of that deal, but func- entering my emphatic protest",26
85,Mr RYAN,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,Do you suggest that we should limit the amount in that transaction?,26
86,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"We cannot do that, for the transaction is completed.",26
87,Mr RYAN,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"Then the honourable member's remedy, if the Government do anything wrong, is to censure the Govern",26
88,Sir JOSEPH COOK,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"The honourable member for Franklin talks of Socialistic enterprise. Is he, or is he not, in favour of the Government building homes for the soldiers ? Mr M o WILLIAMS - - I believe the Government would have carried out that work much more satisfactorily under contract. We have heard of some of the arrangements made in connection with not the erection of these homes, and I have no doubt that more will be heard of the matter in the near future. If the Treasurer (. Sir Joseph Cook) fancies that the provision of these homes will prove a great advertisement of the wisdom of the Government in entering into Socialistic enterprises of the kind, he is on an exceedingly ""bad wicket,"" as the us near future will prove. I venture to say that a great deal more will be heard about the commissions, rebates, and other circumstances that will not prove quite savoury. I shall not detain the House longer. My object in rising is to show the Government and the country that there are some members, at least, in the House who will take every opportunity to enter an emphatic protest, to the fullest extent they can go, against the Government exercising autocratic Executive powers to the absolute deprecation of the rights and privileges of this House in the control of the public purse. If we go to a division on this motion, I say very candidly I shall vote for the adjournment of the House, whatever the consequences may be.",26
89,Mr HUGHES,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"Bendigo-Prime M in ister and Attorney-General) [11.51] - I am very sorry that the honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams) moved the adjournment of the House this morning, because there are matters of great importance and urgency awaiting decision. The honourable member, under cover of his motion, has delivered a lecture about what the House ought to do, and, in particular, what the Government ought to do. The honourable member has been a member of this House for many years, and his attitude towards various transactions has been coloured by what may be termed his political prospects from time to time. We are not, therefore, to take his observations this morning too seriously. What, in effect, the honourable member says is that nothing wil l ever be well with this country until he is at the head of the Government. Singularly enough, we have a gentleman who was returned to this House by virtue of his rather vehement and hysterical denunciations of the sin of gentlemen on the other sidei-member s of the official Labour party-declarin g that the only hope for this country is a sort of collaboration . between himself and an honourable member whom Dr Mannix says is the "" greatest Sinn Feiner of them all.""",27

93,Mr HUGHES,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"The honourable memfifteen ber for Franklin, in speaking of the funcmotion, tions of the Government, says he is much f concerned about the country. We know is not concerned about the country at all. interjections. He rises from time to time with a view of creating the impression that he is the fountain of wisdom and knowledge. On the sugar question, he says that years ago he foresaw everything that has taken place, and that the Government foolishly rejected his advice, which would have saved the situation. Hi s advice was to buy sugar ahead; but how were we to do that? A f t e r consulting Parliament? No ; he said it was to be done without consulting Parliament. Now he stands up in his place, and becomes most eloquent about the right of Parliament to control the public purse, and speaks of the soldier, and the difficulties of housing him. The other day he desired a morahas torium in order to prevent soldiers being ejected from their homes. But when it is proposed to erect houses for the soldiers, the honourable member says that we are doing it in the wrong way-that we are flouting the fundamental principle of responsible government. I say these things in order to show that the honourable member's real motive is not disclosed by his observations, and that his criticisms of the actions of the Government must be taken for what they are worth. Let us look at the saw-milling transaction on its merits-whic h the honourable member failed to do for a moment. It is, perhaps, the greatest tribute to the wisdom of the deal that the honourable gentleman was unable to say that, taken ' on its merits, it was a bad one.",27
94,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,Y o u will have that presently!,27
95,Mr HUGHES,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"If the honourable member only realizes, as he will in the course of years, how little he counts in the scheme of things, he will not make interjections of that kind. There was a time when I was nearly as foolish as the honourable member.",27
96,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"And when it pays me as well to turn my coat Several honourable members interjecting, in your Mr SPEAEiER (Hon. Sir Elliot Johnson) - Honourable members have only minutes in which to speak to the and, therefore, I ask them to rer a in as much as possible from interjecthe ing, particularly loud and continuous",27
97,Mr HUGHES,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"P u t t in g all those matters aside, let us come down to the gravamen of the honourable member's charge. He says that a basic principle has been set aside; that is to say, the basic principle of the power of Parliament over the public purse. I am amongst the first to recognise that the principle upon which responsible government rests is that the responsibility shall lie where the power is, and that the power ancl the responsibility shall go hand in hand. Tho honourable members says that, clearly, the functions of Parliament include power over the purse. I admit that; but the functions of Parliament also include the power of legislation, and, under the power of legislation, Parliament may delegate any or all of its powers to a Commissioner, or to Commissioners, to a Minister, or to anybody it thinks fit. In doing that, Parliament docs not derogate from that authority with which it is vested. The honourable member may not be aware of the fact that, by - section 5 of the ""War Service Homes - Vet 191S, Parliament deliberately delegated its authority to the Commissioner. Thut section isThe Commissioner shall be a body corporate by the name of the War Service Homes Commissioner, and shall have perpetual succession and a common seal, and be capable of suing and being sued, and shall, subject to this Act, power to acquire, purchase, sell, lease and hold lands, tenements, hereditaments, goods, chattels, and any other property for the purposes this Act. It. is clear, then, that power is deliberately given to the Commissioner for a specific purpose. What is that purpose? Everybody knows that Parliament cannot of itself do this business. Every day Parliament, declares its incapacity for dealing with matters of business, and delegates them to specific bodies and persons. Tho repatriation and rehabilitation of our soldiers is one of the first duties of the Commonwealth, ancl is, perhaps, the primary obligation resting on the shoulders of its citizens, but it is not merely u question of at some time housing them; we must house the in quickly and effectively. If it is said that the Commissioner is corrupt or incompetent, then Parliament has its remedy. He must be removed from his office - But it is not said that he is either incompetent or corrupt. I want honourable members to look at the Act in the light in which the Government interpreted it. We came to the conclusion that the Commissioner had this power. We may have made a mistake; but if Ave have done so it is a mistake the Crown Law authorities have also made. [185]- 2",27
98,Mr GREGORY,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,It is a great straining of the Aet.,28
99,Mr HUGHES,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"Pa r be Lt for me, a lawyer, to set my opinion against that of a layman in the interpretation of the law. At any rate, that is the conclusion to which we came-w e may have been wrong - bu t whether we have been right or wrong in the matter of the expenditure of large sums of money, I admit freely that, any doubt ought to be resolved in favour of the opinion expressed in the House this morning, namely, that thedecision should lie with Parliament. However, the Government's, action in the matter was quite bond fide.: the Commissioner carried out the deal and entered into this contract. True, the actual contract has not yet been signed, but I should think it is certainly one upon which the other parties to it could sue for any breach. However, as it is not yet signed, Parliament has a remedy, subject, of course, to any consequences that might follow upon have whatever action it may choose to employ. It is impossible for all the multifarious duties resting upon the shoulders of a of Government to be carried out without tin; aid of experts, who, for all practical purposes,* are business advisers. Every day when sugar is offering on the market, we are obliged to make purchases which, in the aggregate, cover a far greater amount than is covered by the transaction under review this morning, in order to guard the Commonwealth against a shortage. Is it contended that the Government ought to come clown to this House every time and ask, "" May we buy this cargo of sugar?"" It would be impossible to do so. However, that cloes uot mean that that course could not have been pursued in this transaction. Sir 'ROBERT BEST - Hear , hear! Thut is the point.",28
100,Mr HUGHES,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"I want to put the matter quite fairly. We must differentiate between classes of transactions, and on a fair interpretation of the Act it may be said that the Commissioner had the power to make this particular contract. At any rate, the Government construed the Act in that way. We may have made a mistake. If so, we must avoid making mistakes of that kind in the future. Mr 'SPEAKER - The right honourable gentleman's time has expired.",28
101,Mr HUGHES,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,'Can I have one minute longer? Honorable MEMBERS - No !,29
102,Mr MAHONY,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"The right honourable gentleman has been "" putting in too much d i r t "" to get an extension of time.",29

104,Sir ROBERT BEST,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"Kooyong) [32.5] - My right honourable friend, the Prime Minister, is certainly at all times very entertaining and interesting, but during the greater portion of his speech he did not deal with what was relevant to the matter raised by the honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams), or the principle involved in the transaction which the honourable member has brought under the notice of the House. I wish to associate myself with those who protest against the completion of a transaction of this character without consulting the House and securing its confirmation. The Prime Minister seeks to show by the Aet itself that the Commissoner had the right to make this contract, and, technically, this seems to be the case; but the spirit of the Act is demonstrated by a study of section 16, which stipulates that thfi approval of the Minister must be obtained for any land transaction involving the expenditure of over £5,000. That means that some control must be exercised over the Commissioner. Certainly it was never contemplated that a vast deal, involving ttni country in an expenditure of £500,000, could be carried out without the consent of Parliament first being obtained. It was not so inserted in the Act, as Parliament relied on the unwritten law and practice for its protection. regret that the Prinie Minister has seen fit to introduce the question of honourable members being in favour of, or against, the erection of War Service Homes, which has no connection whateverwith the principle the House has been invited to discuss. We passed the War Service Homes measure unanimously, and we are all anxious that the work of building soldiers' homes should proceed with the utmost expedition. But if the Government thought it was desirable that this transaction should be entered upon for the purpose of building these homes speedily, the Prime Minister could readily-as he himself admits-hav e come to Parliament and first sought its approval and confirmation on the merits of the deal. He admits the principle for which I am contending, which I hope honourable members generally will scrupulously and assiduously conserve and jealously guard, namely, the power and control of this branch of the Legislature at least over the public purse. It is true that during the war this fundamental principle had to be brushed aside, and government for the time being became government by the Executive, and not by Parliament-ther e was much to be said in favour of that method of administration; indeed, it was necessary, because of the emergencies that arose from the dislocated conditions brought about by the war-bu t for the' past eighteen months, since the war ceased, we have been struggling to secure a return to parliamentary government. My right honourable friend has been so accustomed to act on his own responsibility, and has become so imbued with the idea of undertaking transactions such as this in a light and airy way that he has failed in his duty to consult Parliament on this matter.",29
105,Mr HUGHES,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,I had nothing to do with it. My only responsibility lies in the f act that a Minister authorized the deal.,29
106,Sir ROBERT BEST,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"I dispute the principle that the Commissioner, although he may have had a technical right to do so, had a substantial right to deal with this matter. Everybody realizes the basic principle to which the Prime Minister has referred, namely, Che control of the public purse.",29
107,Mr HUGHES,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"I do not admit that, under the interpretation of the Act, the I Commissioner and the Minister had not ample power to deal with this matter Parliament has given them that power.",29
108,Sir ROBERT BEST,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"I admit that, technically, the Commissioner had the power to carry out such a transaction; but, as he consulted the Minister, and sought his approval, and lie in turn no doubt obtained the consent of Cabinet, I contend that Cabinet ought to have consulted Parliament in regard to this purchase. The right honourable gentleman has very properly discriminated between various transactions, and, of course, the duties of government must be carried on; but he has given away the whole case by saying that, in regard to this contract, Parliament might have been consulted. deal is one which severs itself from the ordinary class of transaction, such purchase of sugar. It is an individual transaction, involving a vast expenditure, undertaken when Parliament is sitting, and upon which it ought to have been consuited. The Prime Minister says that he is satisfied as to the merits of the deal. they are such as lie claims, aud had brought those merits before Parliament, it would probably have immediately confirmed the purchase. But have protested on more than one occasion against transactions such as this being undertaken without consulting Parliament. I protested against the shipping purchase, and I now protest against purchase, which, as I have said, has been carried out without consulting Parliament even at a time when it was sitting. urge the right honourable gentleman to '^proceeded - with. observe more closely the traditions practice of parliamentary government.:;' The suggestion has been put forward that the process of consulting us in regard deal of this kind would be too cumbrous, but I do not concede that point. It would have been quite competent for the Commissioner to get an option of purchase for a short period, or to have entered into contract subject to the confirmation Parliament. It frequently happens a contract is entered into by an agent ject to confirmation by the principal / : withm a fixed period.",29
109,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,But suppose five or six other people are in the field to make the same purchase?,30
110,Sir ROBERT BEST,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"I am not prei pared to admit that this transaction one of those which several persons were running after and anxious to except secure. The precedent created by the Government is one that they may hereHomes after bave reason to seriously regret, It is quite possible that if we had power a reckless, unscrupulous Minister, who did not realise his duty",30
111,Mr BELL,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,We would not put such a man in power.,30
112,Sir ROBERT BEST,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"But we have to consider such a contingency as a reckenterprise less, imprudent, and even unscrupulous Minister being in power. Is such a Minister to be at liberty to commit the country to au expenditure of £500,000 l;or £1,000.000, or any other sum, without This | consulting Parliament?

113,Sir ROBERT BEST,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"I do not think was the Government immediately contemi t entering into a trade or industry, p a e in so far as it may be incidental to the carrying out of the War Service scheme. We clearly have the constitutional power to build War Service in Homes, and there is power also for Parliament to enter into a contract of this kind in order to facilitate the construction of these homes. I rose, however, tc enter my strong protest against the action of the Government in entering upon an of this magnitude without first consulting Parliament. In view of the feeling that was expressed by the House some time ago, I think that the Governe n t have not acted fairly to the m Parliament in enteringinto this transaction without first consulting; it .",30
114,Sir JOSEPH COOK,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"ParramattaTreasurer) [12.19] - I propose to deal briefly with the constitutional aspect of this matter. The honourable member for Kooyong (Si r Robert Best), who has just resumed his seat, correctly states the principles of responsible government when he says that Parliament intends that, in regard to all these important transactions, it should have the final voice and the final responsibility. He refers to the safeguards with which Parliament has surrounded itself by means of the Public Works Committee, which it has authorized to inquire into works involving an expenditure of over £25,000. All that he says as to that is true. I merely suggest that the Public Works Committee Act does not apply to this particular transaction.",31
115,Sir ROBERT BEST,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,I said so.,31
116,Sir JOSEPH COOK,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,The Public ' Works Committee Ac t relates to expenditures which are initiated by a Minister.,31
117,Sir ROBERT BEST,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,I merely referred to the principle laid down in the Act.,31
118,Sir JOSEPH COOK,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"And I am pointing out that that principle was never intended to apply to a transaction of this kind. We passed a special Act relating to War Service Homes. Why was it thought necessary to pass that special Act, creating the Commissioner, and clothing hi m with full authority, if we already had the necessary safeguards and machinery ? We deliberately took the Commissioner of War Service Homes out of the category to which those safeguards apply. The Parliament, in effect, said to him , under the Act, "" Get along with this work of yours.""",31
119,Dr EARLE PAGE,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"In moving second reading of that Bill the Minister in charge of it said that the Commissioner would not have power to spend more than £5,000 without Ministerial authority.",31
120,Sir JOSEPH COOK,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"May I suggest what is the best way of testing that point? The Commissioner is building house.e all over Australia. This House has told him to do so. It has given him millions of money with which to build them, and hns snid to him . "" B n P d them at the rate of 7.000 or 8,000 houses a year if you can."" How could he build houses on that scale if he could not expend more than £5,000 on material at any one time?",31
121,Dr EARLE PAGE,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"This transaction relates, not to the buying of material, but to the making of material.",31
122,Sir JOSEPH COOK,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,The honourable member will recognise that it is quite impossible that the Public Works Committee Act could be intended to apply to transactions of this magnitude and on this scale. The point I am stressing is that the usual safeguards relating to ordinary Government contracts do not apply to a particular and unique case of this kind. If they did it would not have been necessary to pass the War Service Homes Act for this special purpose.,31
123,Mr GREGORY,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,We had no idea of anything of this sort being attempted when the Bill was before us.,31
124,Sir JOSEPH COOK,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"The power of the Commissioner is clearly beyond question. The question of whether it was wise to enter into a transaction like this before submitting it to the House is a matter which must be determined by the circumstances of the case. Here are the circumstances as set out in a report made by the Commissioner, to the Minister, on 6th May lastI t has been very evident for some time past that it is impossible to secure supplies of timber at anything like reasonable rates for the erection of War Service Homes. This is largely owing to the operations of timber combines who control prices, and who meet monthly, and each meeting for the past six months has produced a further rise in the price of timber. The Government Departments in Queensland and Western Australia have not been any more reasonable than the merchants. Owing to the enormous quantities of timber required (80,000,000 super, feet per annum), and to insure continuity of operations at reasonable cost all over Australia, and especially in New South Wales and Victoria, the only policy left to the War Service Homes the Commission was to acquire saw-mills and forest areas to meet its own demands, thus insuring supplies at reasonable cost, and allowing thereby the general public to have their original sources of supply for public requirements uninterfered with. The scheme for timber supplies has been developed as the result of very careful and exhaustively conducted investigations in all States with timber merchants, timber merchants' associations, and State Government Departments, over a period of several months coupled with a careful investigation of the position in America and the Old World. Unless the requirements of the Commission are protected at this stage in regard to timber, I gravely doubt the success of the War Serviee Homes Commission. I suggest, therefore, that this matter has been initiated, not by a Government official who is always open to the criticism of the public, and with all the safeguards that surround him. It has been initiated by a specially qualified man brought in from outside who knows his job from A to Z. He was appointed to this position, and clothed with special authority to do this work, which is of a unique character.",31
125,Sir ROBERT BEST,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,Does the honourable member say that the Commissioner knows all about timber from A to Z?,32
126,Sir JOSEPH COOK,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,I ' should imagine he does.,32
127,Sir ROBERT BEST,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,Is it only imaginahomes tion after all?,32
128,Sir JOSEPH COOK,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"May be it is. But does the honourable member think that the Commissioner relies solely upon his own judgment in all these matters? Nothing of the kind. He relies on experts as well. All that I have said is that the Commissioner knows his business. He has a knowledge of timber and bricks, and other material. As to the financial and business side of this undertaking, the best authorities obtainable by the Government were appointed to inquire into this side of matter, and they reported absolutely in its favour. The point that I wish to emphasize that the War Service Homes scheme has been taken out, of the category of ordinary Government contracts- and taken out deliberately by this Parliament. The distinction between such au undertaking and other projects is illustrated the business paper for today. Honorhas able members will see on the business paper a Bill relating to a-n arrangeto ment that has been made with a body of men in Western Australia, to silos in that State. That matter is brought to the' House for its considerahonorable tion. The point is thus emphasized that point. the building of War Service Homes has been taken out of the ordinary category of works initiated by the Minister.",32
129,Sir ROBERT BEST,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"Who finds the money, that is the point?",32
130,Sir JOSEPH COOK,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"The public, of course, but the real point is as to initiates the spending of the money. In this case, it is not the Minister, but Commissioner. The House has said to scheme originated. him, "" You must take the initiative. Your service shall not be conducted an ordinary department. We create you a body corporate and we instruct you to initiate all these things. Y o u ber requirements. must buy the land and material, but as to land purchases, we subject you to the stipulation that you must not buy more than £5,000 worth in one l ot without Ministerial authority.""",32
131,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"If the right honourable gentleman had made these statements on the motion for the second reading of the War Service Homes Bill , it would not have been passed.",32
132,Sir JOSEPH COOK,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"Perhaps not. I suggest again, however, that when Parliament instructs a man to build these as rapidly as possible-to build them at the rate of 8,000 per annum, if he can do so-it is useless to say that he shall buy only £5,000 worth of material in any one lot.",32
133,Mr GREGORY,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,We do not say that.,32
134,Sir JOSEPH COOK,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,That is the point involved.,32
135,Mr GREGORY,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"It is not, because the Minister has power to give him permission to buy more.",32
136,Sir JOSEPH COOK,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,And the M in ister has given him permission. That the appears to be the trouble in this case.,32
137,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,Will the r i g h t honourable gentleman tell the House why he gave the Commissioner permission to is enter into such a large contract?,32
138,Sir JOSEPH COOK,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"My impression is that the Minister gave him this permission because he believed it to be the - intention of Parliament that the matter by should be so dealt with. If a mistake been made, it has been a perfectly innocent one. I beg honourable members believe that no more painstaking, careful and scrupulous Minister than erect Senator Millen ever held office.",32
139,Mr GREGORY,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,I quite agree with the member in regard to that,32
140,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"Were there any business reasons why this deal snould be made secretlv ? Sir JOSE PH COOK - I suppose the honourable member refers to the fact that the matter was not submitted to Parliawho ment. The Commissioner was constantly stressing the point that he coul 1 not prothe ceed with his work and that was how the T i e Commissioner told the Government that he could nofi as build houses, and he could not carry on the job unless he WHS given permission to buy m ils which would supply his t i m ",32
141,Mr GREGORY,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,He said that the people - were combining together and charging him excessive prices.,33
142,Sir JOSEPH COOK,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,That means the same thing. He told us that unless he could rely upon his own resources he could not carry through the work for which he was appointed.,33
143,Mr CORSER,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,Will the Treasurer in form the House what experts verified the Commissioner's report as to the advisability of this purchase?,33
144,Sir JOSEPH COOK,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,I know that Mr Barton was one of them.,33
145,Mr MASSYGREENE,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"He dealt with the financial aspect, but other experts were consulted.",33
146,Sir JOSEPH COOK,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"Yes . I ask the House to believe that if there has been any technical breach of a sound and healthy constitutional practice with which [ am in hearty accord, it has arisen from the fact that t i e Minister for Repatriation believed that this House intended that the Commissioner should have power to proceed in this way. Only in that belief was the transaction undertaken.",33
147,Mr GREGORY,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"Dampier) [12.32] I very much regret that the papers relating to this matter have not been laid upon the table. I am not blaming the Minister, because he has assured me that some of the papers are in Sydney, and that he has made every effort to get them here in time. But it is a matter for regret that we are not able to consult the files so that we might be able to discuss in more detail the merits of ' the purchase. I hone that never again shall we have an exhibition such as the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) save us today. If there is a repetition of that sort of conduct, I will do my best tQ remove him from office as speedily as possible. will have to behave himself in this chamber. We have had too much of that sort of thing from him. He must not proceed further in creating grave sectarian differences in the House, and insinuating charges of disloyalty against who dare do anything in opposition to him. While the war was on it was essential that the Government should take grave responsibilities on many occasions without consulting Parliament. ] They did many things that were r i g h t : on the other hand, they made many mistakes, as they were bound to do. We are prepared to forgive the errors that were committed under the abnormal circumstances existing during the war time, but now that the war is over the members of the Country party are pledged to do their utmost to restore constitutional methods and parliamentary control of the purse. We made that promise to our constituents, and are determined to enforce it, no matter what the cost. Probably the Government were technically within their rights in' authorizing this purchase, notwithstanding that the Act states specifically that not more than £5,000 can be expended by the Commissioner without the consent of the Minister. The Minister has given his permission in connection with this transaction, so that, technically, the Act has been observed, but the purpose for which it was passed was to enable the Commissioner to build homes, not to enter into a trading concern. Undoubtedly there has been a grave straining of the meaning of the Act. It is true that a lawyer might say that technically the Government nad the power to do this thing, but it was never intended by Parliament for a single moment that the Commissioner should commit the country to a purchase involving a very large sum of money, and a new policy involving vast commercial and trading concerns. Let us assume that the Commissioner and the M in ister had justification for the transaction. The Commissioner has to build an enormous number of homes for soldiers, and he has experienced a difficulty in getting material for that purpose. He desires to build them at a reasonable price. Every honourable member has a similar desire, for we do not want the buildings to cost £200 or He £300 more than they should. The Commissioner says that the business people who control timber supplies have in creased tiheir prices so much that he cannot pay them and erect the houses at a reasonable cost. He has, therefore, those bought a number of old saw-mills. By so doing, he has not given the community one extra foot of timber. Mr .STORY - He is supplying the timber at a much cheaper rate.",33
148,Mr GREGORY,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"It must be remembered that these mills are old. I make no charges, but it is only f a ir to assume that if a m ill has been working for ten or fifteen years a big proportion of the cut surrounding timber has been cut out. The price of Queensland pine has been jumning up by leaps and bounds, and, owing to the scarcity of freights, vei'y little pine has been received from Baltic and America in recent years. The Commissioner estimates that he has acquired 97,000.000 feet of Queensland Commissioner has placed upon it? pine in the round, from which he hopes get 65,000,000 superficial feet of timber, which he values at £1,811,875 to have that timber cut and available in c Sydney at a cost of £1,283,750, showing an effective saving to the soldiers of £528,125. That was one of the chief for soldiers? reasons which he adduced in support of the transaction, and which induced the Minister to approve of it . But when he presented to the Government the report which induced them to authorize the purchase, he did not tell them that he had entered tract with a big saw-milling pany in Queensland for a three years' supply of timber at the rate of 6,000,000 feet superficial per annum, at 32s. per 100 feet superficial-say , 35s. in bane.",33
149,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,That fact was known all over Australia.,34
150,Mr GREGORY,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"Tet , in order to make show this alleged saving of £528,000, valued the timber he had acquired at per 100 feet superficial.",34
151,Mr MASSYGREENE,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"I know the details of fix that transaction, and there is a complete answer to the honourable member's point. of trade. That particular contract was entered into by the company for the supply of a stated quantity of timber out of stocks, they had acquired when they purchased royalties at 5s. per 100 feet. iit that price 'cannot be obtained today, nor could timber be purchased at 3os. per 100 feet superficial.",34
152,Mr GREGORY,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,Surely the increase in the royalties does not account for the difference between 35s. and 56s.,34
153,Mr MASSYGREENE,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,The royalties have risen to 15s. The Commissioner could not make another contract of that kind today.,34
154,Mr GREGORY,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"That contract was made within the last few months; further, royalties have not increased more than 7s. 6d. per 100 feet super. The Commissioner estimates to 12,000,000 superficial feet per annum; that will allow him five and a half years' cutting. Does anv honourable member believe that within the next two or three years, when shipping in-the creases, and the importation of Baltie timber is resumed, Queensland pine will have anything like the value which the I to mention these facts merely as one indication that even the wisdom of the purchase .

Make no mistake, there is a commercial section Briswho are thieving and robbing the community for all they are worth, and it is time that the States and the Commonwealth combined to enact a law that would prevent restraint of trade, and it a criminal offence for business he men to organize in order to force up 56s. prices day after day and month after month.

"" Mr TUDOR - T he facts are just as the honourable member says. It is quite possible that the persons controlling these enterprises for the Government may bo out of sympathy with State enterprises. But the fact remains that, where genuine State concerns are running in undoubted competition with private companies, they go ahead. Take, for example, the institution of a State Insurance Department in Queensland by the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan), when he was Premier of that State. That Insurance Department has done great practical good in reducing the cost of in surance. I support the principle generally, and I hope the Government will f u r nish an opportunity for the taking of a vote.

180,Mr HUGHES,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"I desire to make a personal explanation. Before the luncheon adjournment I understand that the honourable member for Hunter (Mr . Charlton), by way ,of privilege, made some remarks in reference to an observation made by me to him prior to the conclusion of the division then being taken. I desire, first of all, to .tender to that honourable member, and to the House, an apology for making that observation. I had no right to make it . I think I ought, in justice to myself, to explain why I did make it-no t by way of justification for making it , but m explanation. The honourable member for Hunter, on Thursday, I think, speaking on behalf of the organization with which he is so closely associated, told me that it was vital that the Industrial Peace Bill should be passed into law at the earliest possible moment. He gave me very good reasons why that should be done. I explained to him the position of public business, and said that I would do everything in my power to pass the Bill into law this week. That being the case, and. as I had listed the Senate's amendments in the Industrial Peace Bill for today, I naturally felt considerably annoyed at the honourable member voting for a motion which would have the effect of preventing my doing what he had asked me to do. I feel called upon to make this explanation, which, as the honourable member understands quite well, is in accordance wibh: the facts, in justice to myself; but, as I have said, this does not in any way lessen, nor is it to be taken as extenuating, what I did. That, I admit quite frankly, was most improper; and I ask the honourable member to accept my apology.",37

It might permit the admission of organizations that are not recognised as trade unions.",37
184,Mr HUGHES,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,This clause has only to do with District Councils.,37
185,Mr CHARLTON,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"So long as it is clear that it is only a verbal amendment, I am satisfied.",37

192,Mr TUDOR,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"Y a r r a ) [2.43] - The Minister introduced this Bill on Friday last in a very brief speech, pointing out that it merely contains one or two verbal chairamendments, which are designed to bind certain persons, such as boardinghousekeepers, to secrecy; but I wish to take this (1) opportunity of asking whether, in connection with the forthcoming census, it the would not be possible to take another represenwealth census similar to that which was of emtaken five years ago, during the Avar. I have had a consultation Will the Statistician on the subject, and I shall be very pleased to f all in with Avhat he suggests. Statistics have no value unless they can be compared Will figures relating to some time in the past. We may knoAv that the population of Australia is about 5,000,000, of but the knoAvledge is of little use to us unless, by comparison with other figures, to Ave can ascertain what the increase has been over a given period.",38
193,Mr FLEMING,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,Does the honourable member really belieA'e that a A\ ealth census r will be of any value?,38
194,Mr TUDOR,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"I do. When the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) asked the then Treasurer (Mr W at t ) award Avhether he Would make available the in or a crease in the incomes of certain persons, shall indicating them by numbers instead of award by names, the Treasurer replied, as Sir Alexander Peacock had previously done in the Victorian Parliament, that information which contained income tax returns Avas confidential, and could not be - I disclosed. I am now taking this opportunity of endeavouring to secure that information through a Avealth census. Figures gleaned by Mr Knibbs from the of last wealth census, if I remember rightly, showed that about seven-eighths of the female Avorkers in the community Avere not earning much more than £ 1 per week. Ex-Senator Grant at that time was largely interested in obtaining returns as to the unimproved value of estates in Australia. There has been an enormous increase in land values, and also in the value of herds. The values are far in excess of those which the Income Tax Department allows. The Department allows the graziers, for the purpose of their income tax returns, to ' estimate the value of their sheep at 10s. per head. No one sells a sheep for that price today.",38
195,Mr FLEMING,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,But that is over a series of years.,39
196,Mr TUDOR,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"T he honourable member will be able to put his own views as to that mattter. Before interviewing Mr . Knibbs, I thought it would be possible to distribute simultaneously with the ordinary schedule to householders, a wealth census card, and that we would be able to ascertain in that way, not only the wageearning capacity of the community, but also what is an average family. latter point was raised by a deputation which waited quite recently on the Minister, and urged that, in taking the census, information under this heading should be obtained, since there is a keen controversy as to whether an average family consists of more or less than three individuals. Mr Knibbs has informed me by letter, however, that it would be difficult to obtain information in this way as to the wageearning capacity of each household, since people would not be disposed to make known their financial position to the collectors of cards. The only way in which to obtain a reliable wealth census is by means of letter returns directed to the Department. As I understand that the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) wishes to introduce another measure, I ask leave to continue my remarks at a later date. Leave granted; debate adjourned. NA AGREEMENT BILL. SECOND READING .",39
197,Mr HUGHES,WESTRALIAN FARMERS,"Bendigo-Prime Minister and Atttorncy-General) [ 2 . 5 0 ] move That this Bill bo now read a second time. This is a Bill to r at if y an agreement made between the Commonwealth and Mr Basil Murray , managing director of the Westralian Farmers L t d . It is proper to state, at the outset, that the farmers of Western Australia have made great strides in the direction of co-operation, and have set an example which I hope will be followed by farmers in every State. Their organization is conducted on business lines, and comprises a very large proportion of the farmers of the State. The possibilities of the development of Western Australia are almost illimitable. Amongst other things, it is a great wheat producing State. It s potentialities in that direction are almost infinite. The farmers of Western Australia recognise that if they are to hold their own in the normal years that are to come, they must be prepared to land their wheat in the markets of the world at reasonable rates. To that end, they realise that all unnecessary expense must be eliminated. They are men of progressive ideas, and they recognise that the present practice of bagging wheat is uneconomic. The present high price of jute imposes a very serious handicap on the producer. Various suggestions have been made to the CommonThe wealth that it should make arrangements with the jute merchants for the purchase of jute, and distribute it amongst the farmers. I should like to point out, however, that whatever the Commonwealth might do, it could have no possible control of the world's price of jute. The added cost of the production of wheat, as a result of bagging, must be very considerable, and in the future will, I think, be still more considerable. One of the phenomena of which I spoke last evening as being the aftermath of the war, is that the workers in Eastern countries are demanding higher wages. That, together with the depreciation of money, means that jute goods will continue to be high in price. The Western Australian farmers, therefore, have decided to adopt bulk handling. That involves the erection of silos for storage and terminal elevators for loading wheat into vessels. Incidentally, it also' involves structural alterations in wheat-carrying vessels. Recognising all these things, the farmers of Western Australia decided to - I for m a company for this particular purpose, and their representative approached the Commonwealth Government and asked for its co-operation. The Commonwealth Government was returned upon a policy of assisting by every possible means co-operative effort amongst the farmers. It , therefore, welcomed this proposal of the Western Australian farmers, and looked upon it from its in ception with friendly eye. Negotiations were carried on for some considerable time between myself and Mr Basil Murray, to whom I wish to pay my t r i bute of recognition as an up to date business man who has the interests of the farmers at heart. The result of these negotiations, which were somewhat protracted, has been embodied at last in an agreement. The points outstanding between the parties have been adjusted and are; set out in the agreement which I have signed subject to ratification by this Parliament. I shall briefly recapitulate the main heads of that agreement, which is set out in a schedule to the Bill , so that honourable members may concentrate their attention upon them. The agreement with the Westralian Farmers Limited. is to lend £550,000 for the purpose of erecting silos and elevators for the bulk handling of grain. The estimated cost of the scheme ie £800,000, of which £ 2 5 0 000 is to be provided by the farmers, and £550,000 is to be loaned by the Commonwealth. The period of the loan is twenty years. The interest on the loan is 6 per cent., or such higher rate, if any, as the Commonwealth may pay on the loan from which the advance or any instalment thereof is made. That is to eay, whatever we pay they pay. object of the company is, as I have said, to erect and operate silos and terminal elevators for the handling of grain in bulk in Western Australia. The company is not to traffic in grain, but to act only as operators of silos and elevators. The shareholders of the com,pany are the farmers who own the grain, but the company dose not traffic in g r a in ; it merely handles it and operates the silos and elevators. It is provided in the agreement that the companyshall receive and deal with grain from nonshareholders of the company upon the - same terms and conditions as it receives and deals with grain from shareholders. Therefore, this company is not a close corporation designed to erect silos and elevators mainly for the benefit of its own shareholders. It offers the same privileges to every farmer. The engineers employed by the company to design and supervise the erection of silos and elevators are to be approved by the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth is advancing £550 000 of its own money, and it is of importance, therefore, that the desien shall be satisfactory, since these silos and elevators will be the security for our monev. I wish to direct the attention of the House to the fact that the company, as an earnest of its bona fides, is to soend £100 000 of its own money before it receives any from us. I commend that to co-operative eflFort throughout the Commonwealth, and, in passing I desire to say, once and for all , that what we are prepared to do for Western Australia we are prepared to do for every State on these terms. There is here an earnest of the bona fides of these farmers that should appeal to every man. They are prepared to back the venture with their own money. It would be a bright day for this Commonwealth if , in every State, the producers, not merely of wheat, but of other products that lend themselves to co-operative effort, would take similar action. The 'Commonwealth is prepared to encourage the producer, who in turn must show that he not merely desires to lean against the Commonwealth, but is prepared to stand on his own feet, and stake his own money. The security to be held by the Commonwealth is an important consideration, because we are the guardians of the people's money. The comThe pany is to deliver to the Commonwealth first mortgages and other securities over its assets, real and personal, including uncalled capital. To briefly recapitulate the advantages that w i ll accrue from the scheme: There will be the saving of expenditure of many thousands of pounds per annum on the purchase of cornsacks, upon which approximately £200,000 is yearly spent in Western Australia alone.. Those figures will carry conviction to every farmer - throughout Australia.",39
198,Mr FENTON,WESTRALIAN FARMERS,"That amount is based on the present high value of jute goods. Mr HUG f l ES - I have already said that there is little prospect of the jute market falling , owing, firstly, to the appreciation of money, and, secondly, to the fact that labour in Eastern countries is demanding higher wages, whioh will mean increased <'.ost of production. I do not know that we need regard the - latter fact, as an unmixed calamity; it has its good and its bad sides. The second advantage will be the prevention of deterioration and loss of grain, such as are caused by mice, weevils, &c. That is important, becnuse through those factors the Wheat Pool lost very many hundreds of thousands of pounds' worth of grain. ' The third advantage will be the saving of unnecessary handling, ancl consequent waste. There will be facilities for prompt handling, both at the railway siding and at the ship's side. The grain will be handled in a fraction of the time now occupied. Under the bulk-handling scheme, Australia will be in a better position lo compete in the world's markets than under the old system of .bagging. construction of grain silos and elevators in New South Wales was carried out entirely at the Government's expense, the money being advanced to the State Government by the Commonwealth Treasury. In Western Australia the fanners - are contributing £250,000, approximately one-third of the cost of the scheme. The silos and elevators in that State are to be controlled and worked by private enterprise, and not by the Government. commend the B i ll to the House, and hope there will be little delay in its adoption. My only regret is that I am not in a position to bring before the House a similar agreement for each State. hope that the farmers of Australia - will realise the tremendous advantages that are conferred by bulk handling, and recognise that the arguments used against the system are mostly adduced by interested persons, who handle jute goods, or in some other way have an axe to grind. Bulk handling has come to stay; already ihe Commonwealth has invested millions of pounds in it . I hone that' before long I shall have the privilege of introducing other measures of this character. Mr 1'UNTON - What will be the value of the security to be held by the Commonwealth?",40
199,Mr HUGHES,WESTRALIAN FARMERS,"The whole of the money is to be spent in the erection of silos and elevators, over which the .Commonwealth Government will have a first mortgage. Before we spend one penny, the farmers must spend £100,000. Thereafter the expenditure will be in - the same proportion as the contributions to the total cost of the scheme; that is to say, of all expenditure after the first £100,000 the farmers will provide one-third and the Commonwealth two-thirds. We shall be lending on a 66 per cent, margin, which, I think, in an ordinary transaction, any hanker would regard as a sound business proposition. At any rate, the security is quite good enough for the Commonwealth, and I recommend the scheme to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr TUOOB) adjourned. House adjourned at 3.6 p.m. The I I",41
