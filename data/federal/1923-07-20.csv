1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Kt. Hon. W. A. Watt> took the chair at 11 a.m., * and read prayers. NA .DESTITUTE PERSONS. Mr E. EILEY - I have received a telegram from Sydney to say that the unemployed there have noted what the Prime Minister has been good enough to do for the unemployed in Melbourne, and I wish to ask whether the right honourable gentleman can see his way to extend the same consideration to the unemployed in Sydney. I am sure it would be greatly appreciated.",13
2,Mr BEUCE,ACCOMMODATION FOE,"I was seen yesterday by certain gentlemen who have been active in connection with unemployment relief in Victoria. They pointed out to me that they had ample funds to provide shelter for those who need it, but unfortunately the necessary accommodation is not available, and men who have money in their pockets to pay for beds are walking about the streets unable to secure accommodation. I told those who waited on me that the Victorian Government had made representations to the Commonwealth Government pointing out the position, and asking whether the Commonwealth Government could make any place available for these men. Last night we found accommodation in drill halls for 150 men, who were provided with palliases and blankets. If similar representations are received from the Government of any other State this Government will be prepared to take similar action. In Sydney, such action was taken a fortnight ago, at the request of Mr Oakes, the Acting Premier of New South Wales, accommodation being made available for the unemployed there.",13
3,Dr MALONEY,ACCOMMODATION FOE,"I should like, with the permission of the House, to say that a meeting of the unemployed in Melbourne was held at half-past 7 o'clock this morning, at which appreciation was expressed of the prompt action of the Prime Minister, who, with about two hours' notice, found accommodation for 150 men in certain drill halls. The meeting passed a resolution thanking the right honourable gentleman and this House for enabling them to get the best night's rest they have had for a long time. Mr E. RILEY - I would remind the Prime Minister that drill halls are available in Sydney, and the right honourable gentleman might provide for the accommodation of unemployed in that city in such halls in the way he has done here. Mr BRUOE ^ The Government has quite clearly indicated the attitude it is taking up in this matter. Provided that representations are made by the State Governments, who are responsible in this connection, the Commonwealth Government will do everything in its power to assist. NEW STATES.",13
4,Mr FENTON,ACCOMMODATION FOE,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether it is the intention of the Government to deal with the New States movement in piece-meal fashion, or to submit a comprehensive all-Australian scheme to give effect to the objects of the movement?",13
5,Mr BRUCE,ACCOMMODATION FOE,"I saw a deputation yesterday, which made certain representations with regard to the creation of new States. I undertook to consider the views advanced by the members of the. deputation. To the honourable member's question whether the Commonwealth Government will view this matter from an all-Australian point of view, I have no hesitation in answering that, of course, they will. It is the function of the Commonwealth Government to view all questions from an all-Australian point of view. NORTHERN TEREITOEY. ESTABLISHMENT OF NAVAL BASE.",13
6,Mr NELSON,ACCOMMODATION FOE,Will the Prime Minister place before the Imperial Conference the claim of the north-west coast of Australia to the establishment of a Naval Base in preference to Singapore? Will he point out that there are several harbors on the north and north-west coast capable of carrying the navies of the world? Will the right honourable gentleman give consideration to the advantage which would accrue to the Northern Territory from the establishment of a Naval Base on the north-west coast?,13
7,Mr BRUCE,ACCOMMODATION FOE,"I shall place the agenda-paper of the Imperial and Economic Conferences before the House in the very near future, and the honourable member will then have an opportunity of raising all the points referred to in his questions. The following paper was presented:Lflnds Acquisition Act-Lan d acquired at Carnarvon, Western Australia, for defence purposes.",14
8,Mr WATSON,ACCOMMODATION FOE,"the Minister for Trade and Customs, upon notice I. Is there any substantial international trade in sugar? 2. Do sugar prices' differ materially in the principal countries of the world, under the influence of duties and other local causes? 3. Is there such a thing as a world parity price for this commodity; and, if so, in what way does the Government arrive at it?",14
9,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ACCOMMODATION FOE,The information is being obtained. HMAS. AUSTRALIA.,14
10,Mr MARRS,ACCOMMODATION FOE,"'the Prime Minister, upon noticeAs France has now ratified the Washington Treaty1. Will H.M.A.8. Australia be scrapped? 2. If so, wben, and in what manner? 3. Will consideration be given to the suggestion that, instead of handing over this ship to be broken up, she be sunk off the coast of Australia which she so adequately helped to defend ?",14
11,Mr BRUCE,ACCOMMODATION FOE,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o llow :1. When all the contracting Powers have deposited their ratifications at Washington, the Treaty comes into force, and HMAS. Australia must, within six months thereafter, be rendered incapable of further warlike service. The scrapping must be finally effected within eighteen months of the Treaty coming into force. 2. The method of scrapping is receiving consideration. AIR MAIL SERVICE. EYBE' S PENINSULA.",14
12,Mr LACEY,ACCOMMODATION FOE,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Is it a fact that Lieutenant Miller proposes establishing a service of flying boats between Adelaide, and Fort Lincoln? 2. If so, will the Government consider negotiating with Lieutenant Miller for the conveyance of mail matter, thus expediting the delivery of such mails .to residents of Eyre's Peninsula?",14
13,Mr BRUCE,ACCOMMODATION FOE,"I am advised that Lieutenant Miller has expressed his intention PAPER. of establishing a service of this character, and the matter will receive consider a tion. IMMIGRATION. Mr W . M . HUGHES asked the P r i m e SUGAR. Minister, upon notice I. Whether there has been any modification in the instructions issued to the Immigration Department during the regime of the late Administration relating to the admission, into . the Commonwealth, of immigrants of other nationalities than .those of British originwhich instructions provided for the limitation of the numbers of immigrants of other nationalities in any one year in such a way that the quota for each nationality could not exceed the proportion of the total number of immigrants that the persons of that nationality bore to the population of the Commonwealth? 2. If so, in what way and to what extent have they been modified?",14
14,Mr BRUCE,ACCOMMODATION FOE,"There has been no modification, as such, of these instructions* and no occasion has so far arisen for any action in connection therewith. ASSESSMENTS ON LEASEHOLDS.",14
15,Dr EARLE PAGE,ACCOMMODATION FOE,"On the 5th July, the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Manning) asked the following questions:1. What is the total' amount of assessments levied in respect to taxation of leaseholds up to 30th June, 1923? 2. How much of this has been paid? 3. (a) What is the total amount of original assessments issued under the provision of the War-time Profits Tax Act; (6) how much of this amount has been paid; (c) how much haB the original amount .been reduced by amended assessments? I am now able to give the following information:1.. f2.037.B53. 2. £690,648. 3. (a)The total amount of original assessments, together with amendments creating further debits, amounts to £14,047,492, (6) of which amount £11,224,649 has been paid; (c) the actual amount by which original assessments have been reduced by amended assess' ments cannot at present be stated, but the total refunds to date amount to £1,036,451. NOTE ISSUE BOAED.",14
16,Dr EARLE PAGE,ACCOMMODATION FOE,"Yesterday I promised the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey) that I would supply the names of the members of the Note Issue Board. They are- Mr James Kell, Acting Governor, Commonwealth Bank (Chairman); Mr James R. Collins, Secretary to the Treasury; Mr J. J. Garvan; Sir Henry Yule Braddon. NORTHERN TERRITORY. NA TO DALY WATEBS.",15
17,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [11.12] j - I have just received notice that, unhappily because of ill-health, the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Stewart) is unable to be present, and therefore, on his behalf, I move-Q. That, in accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act 1913-1921, it is expedient to carry out the following prcposed work :-Norther n Territory Railway-Extensio n from Mataranka to' Daly Waters, which said work was referred to the Public Works Committee and upon which the Committee has duly reported to this House the result of its inquiries. In accordance with the provisions of the Railway Act, sections 59 and 60. I lay on the table all necessary plans, books of reference, estimates, and other information required by the Act. This motion is submitted following upon a reference which was made by this House on the 25th November, 1920, when the construction of a line in the Northern Territory was referred to the Public Works Committee for their investigation and report. Honourable members who know the Territory will be aware that the existing railway extends to 198 miles 54 chains south of Darwin. The House on the 'previous occasion to which I refer made a reference to the Public Works Committee of the section extending from the Katherine River southwards to Mataranka, or Bitter Springs as it was then known.",15
18,Mr FENTON,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,Is the bridge over the Katherine River built yet?,15
19,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"The bridge is included in that section. The House on the 25th November, 1920, approved of that section being proceeded with, and a Bill was introduced for the purpose of giving effect to that resolution. It was, however, deemed inadvisable at that timp to go on with that particular section until a report on a further extension south from Mataranka to Daly Watere was received. That report has been received, and is in the possession of honourable members. The position is that the House, in accordance with the Public Works Committee Act, has approved of the first section of a line which will be included in a Railway Bill to be subsequently introduced. The Government now asks the House to approve of the second section of the line. After that has been done, the Government will bring down a Bill authorizing the construction of the railway.",15
20,Mr FOSTEE,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,Why does the Minister select only a portion of the recommendation of the Committee?,15
21,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,Because this is the portion with which we propose to proceed.,15
22,Mr FOSTEE,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,The Minister is not treating the House fairly.,15
23,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,I am treating it quite fairly.,15
24,Mr FOSTEE,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,The Minister is reversing the order of the Cornmittee's recommendation.,15
25,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"I am asking the House to approve of part of the recommendation, and we must do that in order to get on with the work. The length of line constructed to date is 198 miles 54 chains. The section already approved by the House measures 65 miles 35 chains, including a line from the present terminus over the Katherine River, and the length of line referred to in the motion is 95 miles; making a total, roughly speaking, of 160 miles. A Bill will be introduced to. authorize the construction of 160 miles. There are good reasons for not constructing the line in short sections. When a 'long railway has to be built it is better to proceed with thp job straight out than to do it in sections at different times. The material and plant have to bo brougbt together, aud this is a matter of considerable expense. The total cost of the two sections will be £1,545,000. That estimate is based on the construction of a 3-ft. 6-in. gauge line, with bridges to permit of subsequent conversion to 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge. It would not be advisable to build a 4-ft. 8-J-in. line connecting witli a 3-ft. 6-in. line. The method proposed will be, in the end, the most economical. The first big work to be undertaken will be the large bridge over the Katherine River.",15
26,Mr FOSTEB,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"Yes , and that cannot be done inside twelve months.",16
27,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"Exactly , and the Government is anxious to proceed with it as soon as possible. The estimated cost of it is £95,000. ' The revenue which will be earned by the 160 miles of line is estimated at £24,000, and the working expenses at £26,700. interest charge on capital will amount to about £77,250. The immediate effect of opening the line will be that the 198 miles of line already operating will produce more revenue. The traffic over the whole line will be increased. Apart from that, we have to consider the value of the line for developmental purposes. Mr ""WHITSITT - Does the estimate include rolling-stock?",16
28,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,It includes the additional rolling-stock which will be required.,16
29,Mr JACKSON,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,The line will pass one station-the Government's - along,16
30,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"-That is not the point. The advantage of the line will be that it will bring the Northern Territory railway farther south and nearer to the main sources of live-stock traffic. Also, it will come nearer to the great Barkly Tablemotion:-""an lands.",16
31,Mr FOSTER,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,Why has the Minister not adopted the whole of the Committee's recommendation ?,16
32,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"It is necessary to open up the country as soon as possible. Minister for Home and Territories realise, (Senator Pearce) is formulating a geneState ral policy for developing the Territory.",16
33,Mr FOSTEE,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,And he is pledged to the construction of the other section of the line.,16
34,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"The honourable memrecommended ber can deal with that aspect of the question later. The Minister's policy is to open up the Territory and increase pastoral settlement. All those who have had any experience in the Territory say that the greatest drawback to development is the absence of transport facilities, and that the remedy for this consists in providing railways and roads. Reduced transport charges would increase settlement. The first essential is to extend the railway facilities. The section of railway proposed will be a considerable extension of the existing railway southwards.",16
35,Mr YATES,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,It will not.,16
36,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,I say the line will go soutb.,16
37,Mr YATES,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,It will not.,16
38,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"That all depends on the way the honourable member looks at it. The intention is to extend the line farther south. The Mr YATES - It is not, and the Minister knows it is not.",16
39,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"Perhaps the honourable member will be able to show that the line will go east or west. The extension to the point proposed is quite consistent with its ultimate extension to South Australia. There is nothing in the motion to raise the issue of the direction of the route. If a north-south connection, across the continent is to be constructed, the portion proposed must be built. I believe there is a general desire on the part of honourable members to give the Territory an impulse by developing it the lines of natural progress, so that it may become an important producing part of this continent.",16
40,Mr YATES,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"Adelaide) [11.26], - I move- i That .the (following words be added to the d also the extension from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs, upon which the Committee also duly reported to this House the results of its inquiries."" I move this amendment, not from parochial motives, although I know, and The every other honourable member must that a debt is due to the central of the Commonwealth. The Territory has been too long tied to the fringes of the Commonwealth, and no proper en-, deavour has been made to develop it. Lord Kitchener, when he was in Australia, the construction of a line - from Adelaide to Darwin. All the calamity howlers in this country say that the danger to Australia lies to the north of it, and yet the Government will not formulate a sound, policy for providing railway communication to that most vulnerable spot. I doubt whether even the Prime Minister will say that it is goo,d statesmanship to build a few inches, comparatively speaking, of railway line to a dead-end, where it must remain for all time. This House has too long toyed with the development of the central portion of Australia. As I pointed out a few days ago, I raised the question in my first address in this House. I did not do so on my personal knowledge, but on the report of a Commission appointed by this House. The desire of the statesmen of that day was to develop Australia along the lines recommended by that Commission, which consisted of Mr. Combes, Mr David Lindsay, and Mr. Frank Clarke. They investigated the subject extensively, and travelled the areas covered by the Public Works Committee. The majority of that Commission said that the line, to be effective, should be constructed from the soutb to the north, direct to Port Darwin. Since then we have done nothing, and now the Government has come forward with an emasculated proposal which will not improve the position. The sinister feature of it is-and this has been pointed out by those newspapers which adopt a neutral attitude towards proceedings in this House-that the trip of the Minister for Home and Territories (Senator Pearce) followed a route through Queensland to determine how the Northern Territory railway could be connected with the Queensland railways at Camooweal. That is where the line will end for many years, until a true spirit of patriotism prompts the members of this House to do justice to South Australia. I alleged a few moments ago that the Minister was saying what he knew to be incorrect. In saying that I assumed that he had read the report of which he was asking the House to adopt a, portion. The Committee sets out what it calls an "" Abstract,"" which contains what is really at the back of its mind. If this motion be carried, the House will affirm a principle set out in page 25 of the report. The paragraph readsTo extend the existing railway to Daly Waters on the understanding that it is to attempt to develop the Territory. form portion of an eventual line through Newcastle Waters to Camooweal. In no sense whatever, apparently, is it the intention of the Public Works Committee to bisect Australia by a railway line. They give the reason for their recommendation on page 19. Senator Foil is reported on that page to have movedThat the Committee place on record its opinion that the construction of the section Mataranka to Daly Waters will of itself contribute very little towards the early development of the Northern Territory, and that the recommendation for its construction is only agreed to as being a section of an eventual line to cross the Barkly Tableland to Camooweal, vid Newcastle Waters. The Committee itself, therefore, says the line will do very little to develop the Northern Territory. There was a division on that motion, and I was surprised to know that an honourable senator from South Australia voted for a railway which it was agreed would do very little to develop the Northern Territory.",16
41,Mr JACKSON,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,I would like you to hear his explanation on that.,17
42,Mr YATES,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"Hi s vote is there, and that is what counts.",17
43,Mr JACKSON,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,My name is in that division list also. .,17
44,Mr YATES,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"The honourable member for Bass (Mr Jackson) will, no doubt, be able to tell the House what was in the .minds of himself and Senator Newland. He will probably try to justify the attempt to construct this line. He will also Have an opportunity to show, the sincerity of the Public Works Committee in its desire to do justice to the Commonwealth. He will find it hard to do so in the face of the following resolution which he moved, and which appears on the same page of the report:Tihat the Committee place on record its opinion that, with the construction of a light line to Alice Springs, and the extension of the existing northern section to Newcastle Waters and thence to Camooweal, the whole of the railway requirements of the Northern Territory will be met for many years. The line is to go to Alice Springs, and there stop for many years. How many years, Heaven alone knows. This Parliament has promised for long years to do something to give effect to its undertaking to South Australia; but, as I understand the motion now before us, it will actually be inconsistent with an If ihe iiae goes across to Camooweal, it will satisfy honourable members Who represent the eastern portion of this continent, but there appears ito be not one scintilla of evidence to show us that honourable members who support this motion - possess >the broad Australian sentiment which should influence ithem to develop our (.country.",17
45,Mr JACKSON,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,The honourable member sho.uld realise that we were only asked to report ion the two sections.,18
46,Mr YATES,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,I am glad to have the admission from the honourable member that the construction of this work will simply run a railway line to a dead-end. It would have been far better had the Public Works Committee reported .that it was not inclined to make any report on .a railway proposal for the Northern Territory which would not make for true development. Mr JACKSON;-Why not allow future development to decide where any continuation of the line shall go-?,18
47,Mr YATES,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"I hope we shall not leave it for future development. time is long jpast when this Parliament should have decided to bisect the (Continent from north to south. This railway was recommended by Lord Kitchener. The honourable member for Bass has the following notice of motion on the business-paper of this House :That, in the opinion of this House, (the Government should immediately commence the construction of that section o i railway Oodnadatta-Aliee Springs, as part of the North-South railway, and as recommended by the Public Works Committee. He will lead a discussion on this matter. It will be very interesting to hear where he wants the line to go. In my opinion the Northern Territory would become a valuable asset if we developed it . We are not doing justice either to the Commonwealth or to South Australia unless we carry the railway right through. On behalf of the pioneers of South Australia. I plead for the construction of the through line. The prevailing thought in the minds of the early-day settlers of South Australia was to build the NorthSouth line. They revealed their intention by building the through telegraph line and the railway down to Pine Creek and np to Oodnadatta. At the time the Territory was handed over to the Commonwealth the Leader of the Government ol the'day was examining ways and means of connecting Oodnadatta with Pine - Greek. Mr WHITSITT. - Will this line not be most unprofitable'?",18
48,Mr YATES,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"I was waiting for an interjection of that description. I 'knew some honourable members would, object to the construction of a non-paying lime. I ask them how many developmental railway lines in Australia pay for axle .grease even. The taxpayers in South Australia are losing considerable sums every year on non-paying lines. Im ithat State vwe have more lines .that do not pay than ws have lines that do pay. That is (true of other States also. I read an article in the Bulletin recently which 'dealt with the development <of the Northern Territory. That paper gave a 'list of the - railway lines in New .South Wales which did not pay. Mr WHITSITT. --We cannot long carry on under those conditions.",18
49,Mr YATES,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"We can and do carry on. We can always go i o "" Uncle."" We The went to him and got money at 4$ per cent, for war purposes. To-day we are paying 5£ per cent, for it. It will he a burden even to my little grandchildren.",18
50,Mr SPEAKER,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,Rt. Hon. W. A. Watt).. - The honourable member's discussion is not relevant either to the motion or the amendment.,18
51,Mr YATES,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"I admit I have been line drawn off the track of the North-South line. I shall return to it. That there are losses on developmental railway lines is no sufficient reason for refusing to build them. So far we have received nothing from the Oodnadatta to Port Augusta line. It does not follow, however, that with the expenditure of more capital, and the extension of the area from which traffic may be drained, we shall not eventually recover all we have lost, and make a profit. We do not know the potentialities of the country through which the North-South line should go. Until we have facilities for transporting to that country the developmental material necessary, we shall never receive any return from it. A business man may lose money by his trading, but the investment of new capital and the consequent extension of his operations very often recoups his losses. That is what I believe to be possible with our railway works. It is our bounden duty to construct the NorthSouth railway, and thus recoup Australia for her losses. If there isanything in the Eastern war scare, a railway line through the continent from north to south will be a most, effective means to protect the country. I sincerely trust that we shall not on the score of expense neglect to build the line. I have no desire to traverse the arguments for and against this proposal that we have heard so many times, but I know South Aus-' tralia is very much interested in it.",18
52,Mr LACEY,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,And has been very much wronged over it.,19
53,Mr YATES,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"That is so. The fair thing has not been done. Sir John Forrest had sufficient power by virtue of his inclusion in so many Administrations to secure the construction of the EastWest railway. It certainly was not the quality of the land through which the railway goes that influenced Parliament in pushing on with that work. One has only to go to Ooldea to discover that. Cook and Hughes were well-named after barren individuals, for they are barren spots. The East-West line was built without any promise, such as was made about the North-South line. A condition of the construction of the East-West line, however, was that the Western Australian Government should reconstruct the railway from Kalgoorlie to Perth on the gauge of the overland line. was a condition absolute, but nothing has been done to fulfil the undertaking. For some reason, the Commonwealth Government have not pressed for the fulfilment of that promise. The East-West line is not paying. I am positive that the North-South line will be a more profitable concern than is the railway to Perth. I do not say that the East-West line should not have been constructed, because I agree that our policy should be to develop Australia. Mr. Bruce, when he became Prime Minister, made a suggestion of what the policy of our Parliament should be. He has suggested the building of a line from Hay to Port Augusta, which I regard as another attempt to side-step the obligation that rests'on the Commonwealth to build the North-South railway. I trust fhat in the debate today the opponents of the North-South line will state clearly why they are opposed to honouring the compact made with South Australia, namelyj that the Commonwealth should undertake the development of the Northern Territory and build a railway from the south to the north. I have with me today a letter which appeared in the Adelaide Register just after the reception accorded to Sir Henry Barwell's proposal at the recent Conference between Commonwealth and State Ministers became known in South Australia. I am referring to the occasion when that Conference fell foul of our ""strong man"" of South Australia. I hope that I am not misjudging the Prime Minister when I assume that his decision to build this little stretch of railway in the Northern Territory, which even the Public Works Committee cannot thoroughly recommend, is' a bit of spite on his part because of the attitude adopted by Sir Henry Barwell towards the proposal to build a line from Hay to Port Augusta. I should think that, in the interests of Australia, the right honourable gentleman would rise above that sort of thing, and not let the little flies on the wheel worry bim. The letter which appeared in the Register was written by Alfred Giles. The name of Giles stands very high in the esteem of those people who have watched the development of the Commonwealth. The Giles family have played a most prominent part in the development of the Territory, and in his letter Mr. That Giles states the South Australian point of view as it can only be put by one who knows his book. The letter appeared in the Renixter on the 19-th May last, and is as follows:As one who attended that splendid deputation to the Prenrer on Tuesday last, and which was described by one speaker as ""the most representative deputation in the history of South Australia,"" I feel that the patience of my fellow Territorians is really going to be rewarded by practical results so soon as Sir Henry Barwell placps the full case before the Federal Ministry. The facts should so appeal to that Ministry as really to convince it that twelve or fourteen years of a promise is a reasonable time to begin with the pick and shovel in earnest. If talking eould have assisted the railway, it should have been built tw ce over. I remember *vhen T first crossed ; this continent, in 1870, on the first exploring trip after MCDouall Stuart. We used to talk around the camp fire, and wonder if it were possible for a railway to follow us in the .dins iuture. 1 was a very young man then, with a black beard, and afterwards recrosaed the continent five times, and then remained in the Territory, forming the first cattle stations, until I was grey-headed; and we were still talking of the railway. Then I remained another fifteen or twenty years, u n t i l I became baldheaded; and we were still talking about it , and after a forty years' absence from Adelaide I find the talk is still going on. But we are getting more hopeful, if , perhaps, more insistent. The people more interested have expressed their opinions as to the real value of the Northern Territory through the medium of the leading dailies, which have evoked leading articles and many paragraphs to the subject. Nor have the country papers concealed their views, but have been most favourably inclined towards the early fulfil ment of the Federal promise. Lecturers, too, like Captain White, have done much to eliminate the ignorance as to the value of the Northern Territory. It is, however, only natural that South Australia, should show a greater interest than the people of any other State, seeing that State owned it since the early "" sixties,"" sending out the great Stuart, and later many other explorers, to spy out the land. < And ten years later, with a population of only 250,000, she constructed, with the people's money, great work, the overland telegraph, 2,000 miles of practically unknown No sooner was this work completed than she practically threw open her great pastoral area at 6d. per mile-"" select your own blocks""and the result today is that the largest herds of cattle in the world are roaming .over those areas. Ambitious little colony, she later commenced to follow her telegraph line with a transcontinental railway, and nearly 500 miles from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta. Not only this, but she built 140 miles of railway from Darwin southwards to Pine Creek. In the "" seventies"" the Northern Territory, under her administration, was flourishing, both in pastoral, and agriculture, vfilt one time there nearly 2,000 white men on Sandy diggings, and there were miles of gardens along the Margaret and other sites. Our GovernmentResidents were all sound practical men, and. the Botanical Gardens, under that able agriculturist, Mr Maurice Holtz, and, later, by his son, the late Mr Nicholas Holtz, were demonstrating that the soil was, and is, capable of producing any tropical produce grown in tropical countries, such as sugar, rice, tobacco, coffee, peanuts, coconuts, sago, sisal maize, and numerous other especially cotton; also all tropical fruits and vegetables. Instead of paying a heavy and exorbitant duty on tobacco, we should be growing, not acres, but square miles of it, and the same with rice and maize. The Territory is the home of cotton, which does not need a Tich black soil, but a red loam, and even stony ridges suits it. There are miles of cotton land along the proposed railway. is growing wild along the Flora River, where the writer planted it on Delamere Downs in 1882. Along the Roper, below Elsey there is about 5 miles of cotton growing wild. Particulars of the tropical products Afr. Yates. in the experimental garden at Palmerston in the "" seventies"" and "" eighties"" can be seen in the official records and reports of those days, but they are poked away in Federal, pigeonholes. South Australia has been frequently taunted by Federal politicians with having done nothing for, or with, the Northern Territory during the forty years of her occupation. We, who have lived there a lifetime, know better, and can, and do, confidently assert that since the Commonwealth took it over it has never, progressed, but has gone backwards more and more every year, and now it is at a standstill. Not one scheme has succeeded in spite of unlimited expenditure. Only one exception is a railway of 54 miles from Pine Creek to Katherine, but they pulled up within a mile and a half of the river, causing no end of worry and expense in carting goods across the river, which is generally not fordable from Christmas to May or June, except by boat. The river is about 400 yards wide, and occathis sionally rises 50 feet in one night. It has never been known to stop running. The construction of a bridge over it for' the railway would probably occupy twelve or eighteen months, and might well be. commenced at once that now the wet season is over. It would give through employment to many scores of men and teams. country. Some foresight was shown in the building of this short line, as although it now runs on the narrow gauge, the sleepers are 4 f t . 8ir in., and when the time comes-the rails will have merely to be spread apart to meet the full gauge. The line from Darwin to Pine Creek is on the narrow gauge, and the alterations to the broad gauge should be started simulconstructed taneously with the Katherine Bridge. In face of the fact that there is an agitation afoot for a universal broad gauge, it seems remarkable that the Railway Committee suggested, or rather, and "" eighties "" recommended, in its report, that the line to Alice Springs should be constructed - on the mining, narrow gauge, and, moreover, one would were imagine that a railway built wit h a view to Creek strategical purposes should be built upon the broadest gauge, insuring greater safety as well as higher speed. Another matter that is likely to cause much uneasiness is a belief that when the railway does reach Alice Springs it will stay there for another decade or two. This, if true, would be most unfair, and should be strenuously opposed. While such a course would be a boon to the Central Australians, we of the tropical Tegions of the Territory hemp, would .not share in it . Not only should the crops, and railway go straight through, but the work should be continued from both'the present termini at the same time. Any deviation into Queensland would be disastrous, and we would be worse off than we are now, and it would cut out the big mineral belt extending from Arltunga to the Wauchope Creek, some 250 miles in length, which has been It proved to contain gold, silver, lead, t in , copper, mica, and precious stones in payable quantities when carriage is reasonable' and available. Station, Such a deviation would not assist those pastoralists on the MCArthur portion of the grown splendid Barkly Tablelands. They would be better assisted by the opening of a port at or near tlic entrance to the MCArthur River. A safe and deep-water anchorage is known to exist there, and was reported favourably upon by Captain Barclay, and must be also well known to my old friend, Mr Alfred Searcy, who chased Malay pirates and other duty dodgers for some years when head of the Customs in Palmerston. Senator Pearce and Admiral Clarkson are now in Darwin, and it is to be hoped that their visit wiU enable them to for nui late a policy suitable to the needs the people and country. I do not wish to add much to what Mr. Giles has put forward. I am prepared to rely on what is set out by a practical man who has a knowledge of what should be done for the development of the Northern Territory; but I should be lacking in my duty as a representative of South Australia if I did not place on record today my protest against the proposal put forward by the Government this morning. The Public Works Committee, in presenting a report - upon this project, asserted that this section of railway would not prove to be efficient or effective for the purpose for which it was intended. How, then, can this House approve of the construction of the work? I hope that honourable members will agree with me that the work of constructing a railway whose purpose is to develop the Northern Territory should commence at both ends, and that the rails should meet half way, as they did on the EastWest railway. When the first sod was turned in the construction of the EastWest railway, the honourable member for  enough to say that the wheelbarrow which was used on that occasion should be set aside for use when the first sod was turned in the construction of the North-South railway. Where is that wheelbarrow boused? Where is the plant that was used in building the East-West railway ?",19
54,Mr FOSTER,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"Yes , where is it?",21
55,Mr YATES,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"That is the question I am asking. This Parliament has to answer to the electors for the spasmodic way in which Commonwealth works are undertaken. It is no wonder that the accusation is made that public money is , frittered away when we find that upon the completion of the East-West railway the construction plant was not immediately shifted to the point at which the NorthSouth railway would start, and work commenced upon that project. It is true that this work has been long delayed, but that is no reason why there should be any further delay, or why we should set about doing it in the piece-meal fashion proposed by the Attorney-General this morning. I ask honourable members to support my amendment. I am not, as a matter of fact, opposed to building the of stretch of railway covered by the motion submitted by the Attorney-General; but I want the House to lay it down that the Government should also commence to build the southern portion of this big national work, which it is our duty to undertake. I am not asking for any favour for the people of South Australia. I am simply asking honourable members to carry out a duty they owe to the citizens of the Commonwealth. I have not had an. opportunity of visiting the Macdonnell Ranges, but I rely on the statement made by Mr Giles, that the Northern Territory can grow almost everything; certainly coffee, tobacco, rice, and almost everything that can be grown in . tropical countries could be cultivated in the Northern Territory if we would only proceed with the development of that portion of Australia in a business-like way.'",21
56,Mr MAKIN,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"Hindmarsh) [12.0] I desire to second the amendment. I regret that the Government feel it necessary to submit this motion at the present juncture. The Prime Minister, one day next week, is to receive a deputation of representatives of South Australia on the very subject that is now engaging our attention.",21
57,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,That deputation is not adverse to the work contemplated in the motion.,21
58,Mr MAKIN,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"What we wish to impress on the Ministry is the urgent need for the construction of the Oodnadatta to Alice Springs section, as well as the section from Mataranka to Daly Waters. Before submitting the motion, the Govern-' ment might have been courteous enough to hear the views of those who more directly represent the interests of South Australia. It is quite evident, however, that, irrespective of any argument to the contrary, the Government intends to proceed with its projects. That is most unwise, because the section from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs must bo a much more profitable undertaking. It is true.that the extension from Mataranka to Daly Waters is part of the direct north-south line, but it is not the extension that will tap and develop the most rich and fertile lands. I trust honourable members realise that the supporters of the amendment have as their immediate desire the speedy progress of the areas surrounding the MCDonnell Ranges. It would seem, however, that other interests are prompting the Government to first proceed with the line from Mataranka to Daly Waters; and there is every justification for the fears of the people of South Australia that there is no intention to honour the compact made'between South Australia and the Commonwealth. There is ground for supposing that there will ultimately be a deviation made in the interests of a certain northern State.",21
59,Mr MACKAT,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,Have you read the evidence of the report of the Public Works Committee ?,22
60,Mr MAKIN,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"Yes ; but much of that report is not in keeping with actual facts as set forth by men of experience and authority on this question. Recently, a special commissioner was employed by one of the leading newspapers of Australia to investigate and report on conditions in the Northern Territory, with special reference to the north-south line, and that commissioner, in his articles, expresses very definite opinions concerning the claims of South Australia. He writesI n almost every instance I have met with surprise that any doubt should exist in the minds of southerners as to the proper and most remunerative route. In every instance I have been faced with the inquiry as to what political influence was being used to divert the Commonwealth Government from its pledged word to construct the railway from Darwin to Adelaide via Katherine and Oodnadatta. The writer of that article declares that certain of the evidence accepted by the Public Works Committee was unreliable, and he asked permission to appear before that Committee and refute the misleading statements.",22
61,Mr MACKAT,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,Surely the honourable member is not opposing the construction of the section mentioned in the motion?,22
62,Mr MAKIN,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"No ; but I submit that the section between Oodnadatta and Alice Springs should receive prior consideration. The extension from Mataranka to Daly Waters will not prove nearly so remunerative or beneficial from a developmental point of view. The writer of the newspaper article declares that if a referendum were taken of the residents of the Northern Territory and Central Australia, a large majority would be found in favour of the Oodnadatta to Alice Springs section being first constructed. It will be very interesting to hear the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr. Nelson), because he, with his first-hand knowledge, is in a position to afford the House considerable assistance in arriving at a decision. Quite apart from the moral obligation that the Commonwealth is under to South Australia, the section advocated by the amendment is the most advantageous from a financial point of view. When the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Yates) was speaking, the honourable member for Darwin (Mr Whitsitt) asked whether the line between Port Augusta and Oodnadatta was a paying proposition. To the best of my knowledge, it is not, and the Commonwealth has to bear the loss. The Oodnadatta to Alice Springs section, besides opening up fertile country and areas rich in mineral resources, will afford quick transit for cattle to South Australian markets, and materially help to make the Port Augusta to Oodnadatta line a paying concern. But the Government prefer to further tinker with the situation by proposing an extension that will not cause any feeling of uneasiness in Queensland, and may, perhaps, temporarily satisfy South Australian interests. We are not going to allow ourselves to be fooled i:> this way, . or allow the Commonwealth to be involved in expenditure that can only add to the loss on the existing line. All the amendment does is to ask Parliament to proceed with that portion of the north-south line that will prove of the most benefit in the immediate future. It does not mean that the section proposed by the Government will not be constructed, but merely that the two sections shall be considered together. I have reason to question the sincerity of the Government in the matter of keeping the compact with South Australia. It is known that some members of the Government do not view with favour the construction of the direct North-South railway. The Minister for Home and Territories (Senator Pearce). has. made, a very pointed reference, which would seem to suggest that there is some strong influence at work to induce the Government to divert the railway to the eastern side of the Territory. The Minister has recently visited the Northern Territory, and we do not forget the route which he followed on his return. He has emphasized the great advantages, in his opinion, of the suggested connection with Camooweal. He stated that over the Camooweal route there were Government wells that could be utilized. Honourable members from South Australia would be false to their trust if , in view of this statement, they did not express grave fears for the direct NorthSouth railway. The section of the line which the motion covers would not materially assist in the development, of the Northern Territory. If the Governmeut sincerely desire the development of the. Territory, it will accept the route sugr gested in the amendment, as' well as. the section included in the motion. The Government will give proof of its sincerity regarding the obligation of the Commonwealth to South Australia by accepting the amendment.. The conclusion arrived at by the Public Works Committee that the sections from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs; and from Mataranka to Daly Waters would provide sufficient railway construction for the development of, the Northern Territory for years is a misstatement.. The gentleman to whom I have already referred has said I challenge the Public Works Committee on the North-South railway to, review the arguments I have stated above and publish a fresh report embodying their conclusions and' my arguments for the direct route, and then to recommend a referendum of the people of the Northern Territory as to the route which, should be adopted. According to the evidence this gentleman was able to secure from people he met in the Territory, there can be no doubt as to what they desire in this matter. -> urge the Government to accept the amendment,, which proposes the construction of a section of the North-South railway which I think will assist Materially, is the development, of the Northern Territory and Central Australia.",22
63,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"I make an appeal to honourable members, not to. proceed with the amendment.",23
64,Mr FOSTER,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,I certainly shall do so. [54],23
65,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"The amendment is,"" in . effect, inviting the House to reject the motion.",23
66,Mr FOSTEE,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,The honourable gentleman must take the responsibility for that.,23
67,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"I am quite prepared to accept responsibility for' my action. My anxiety now is to let the honourable member know where he. stands. I want to remind him of the procedure that is followed in these cases. When a report is presented f row the Public Works Committee on a proposed"" work, a motion is submitted that it is expedient that the work be proceeded with, or the House may by resolution declare that it. is not expedient to carry ont the proposed work. The anien<:hnent is really inviting, the House to come to a decision and possibly to reject the. construction of the line that the honourable, member desires, to see carried out. I really rose tomise the question whether the amendment is in order. On the 25th November,. 1920, two distinct motions were moved in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act. One was for a reference to the Committee for investigation and report of the NorthernTerritory railway extension from Mataranka to Daly Waters. Another reference made on the same date, in accordance with the provisions of the Act, was. the extension of the Port Augusta railway from Oodnadatta to AliceSprings. The procedure is that whenreports, are received from the Publio Works Committee each reference must ba dealt with separately, and a motion that it is. expedient to proceed with the proposed work may be approved or rejected. But the proposed work must be connected with the reference made to the Paoiie Works Committee. Another point which must be borne in. mind, is, that where the proposed work is a railway the Minister who submits, the motion that .it is exI pedient to proceed with the work is obliged, under section 59, of the Railways Act, to supply a plan of the railway,, books of reference, estimated costs, additional rolling-stock required, working expenses, and so on. If the Minister moves that it, is expedient to carry put theproposed work,, the information supplied to him, in pursuance of this section must,, at the same time, be laid before the House of Representatives. The"" procedure. v:hicb the House is to follow in. a matter of this kind is clear. When a proposed railway work is referred to the Public Works Committee, then when the report of the Committee is received, before the House can consider a motion that it is expedient to proceed with the work, the Minister must lay all this information before it .",23
68,Mr FOSTEB,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"Then I point out that in the present instance the honourable gentleman has supplied that information with respect only ""to half the reference to the Public Works Committee.",24
69,Mr MAKIN,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"If the amendment were carried, the Attorney-General could ask for the postponement of the matter to comply with the procedure he has mentioned.",24
70,Mr GROOM,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"I remind the .honourable member for Wakefield that we have carried out the procedure with respect to only one .of the references to which I have referred. As regards the second reference, we are not in a position to do so because the information is not available. I , at first, made a personal appeal to the honourable member for Wakefield not to ask the House, at this stage, to express an opinion for or against the construction he desires. In his own interests I think it would be a mistake for him to do so. I raise a point of order on the ground that when there is a specific reference of a work to the Public Works Committee, and a report from the Committee is presented-althoug h I admit that in this case the Committee's report covers both references-the procedure is for the House, by resolution, to declare that it is expedient or is inexpedient to proceed with the proposed work. must be the work included in the particular reference to the Committee.",24
71,Mr SPEAKER,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"Rt. Hon. W . A. W at t ) . - I have listened to the statement of the Attorney-General (Mr Groom); but as soon as the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr . Yates) was handed to me I commenced an examination of the Acts which seem to bear upon this matter. As honourable members are aware, we have no standing order defining the procedure to be followed in these cases. We' have no practice that applies. On the point that has been raised, our only guide , is the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act of 1913 and the Commonwealth Railways Act of 1917. I am, therefore, placed in a somewhat difficult position. Under subsection 2 of section 15 of the Public Works Committee Act the submission and explanation of a proposed work to the House must, in the first place, be by a Minister of the Crown, and he must produce certain data to guide the House in its decision. A f t e r the Public Works Committee has dealt with the proposed work referred to it , in the manner prescribed by the Act , its report must be presented to the House. The House has then to declare whether it is expedient or not to carry out the proposed work. A proviso contained in sub-section 6 of section 15 empowers the House to refer a matter back to the Public Works Committee, if it is not satisfied with the report. Section 59 of the Commonwealth Railways Act requires the Commissioner, after a railway work has been referred to the Committee, to submit to his Minister elaborate data, and section 60 requires the Minister, when moving that it is expedient to construct a given railway, to lay all such data before the House.. On that point the Minister's arguments, I think, have weight. It appears to me to be clear that, in ordinary circumstances, the Chair would not be justified in accepting any amendment to the motion that the carrying out of a proposed work is expedient, except such an amendment as is contemplated in the proviso to subsection 6 of section 15 of the Public Works Committee A ct 1913. The amendment there contemplated is an amendment to refer the matter back to - the Committee.",24
72,Mr MAKIN,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,Coul d we move such an This amendment ?,24
73,Mr SPEAKER,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"It would be competent for any honourable member in accordance with that proviso to move to refer the report back to the Committee. .In the present case the matter is complicated, and doubtless, honourable members interested in this railway line are prejudiced by the fact that two separate references of lines were made to the Committee and the reports upon them have been made to the House in one document. Without pronouncing on the merits of the question it is clear that the two works concerned are intimately related geographically, but the - House referred them separately to the Committee, and I say emphatically, .as the voice of the House for the time being, that it would have been better if the matters, having been referred separately to the Committee, had been reported separately. I am asked to rule whether the amendment is in order. If the House desires a ruling now, I must rule against the admissibility of the amendment, gestion, which is, for three reasons, against spirit of the Acts. In the first place, as an original submission under the A ct required to be by a Minister, the motion for the adoption of the report authorizing construction- a much more important step-shoul d by implication be made a Minister also. By submitting this amendment, a prito vate member is seeking to take action the Governor General's Speech. which should be taken only by a Minister. In the second place, Parliament has acted clearly in the Railways A c that it desires plans, estimates, and data of various kinds to be placed appeared. before ""the House wh'en a motion of this kind js made. That information has not House today. been presented ""in relation to the amendserious ment. In the t h i r d place, perhaps, most important phase is that the Public Works Committee Act clearly lays it down that.when a reference is returned to House, the House should have one clear inter-dependent issue in front of it . The issue should whether a particular project is expedient or inexpedient, and the issue should be confused by rival propositions. Honmembers orable members realise that in electing lay Speaker, and asking him to interpret Acts of Parliament, both in their spirit and letter, in the absence of Standing Orders, they must abide by the consequences. Believing that I have so interpreted the law, and mindfu l of my duty to preserve the rights of honourable members, I rule that the amendment is not in order.",24

76,Mr NELSON,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"Northern Territory ) by [12.36] - I desire to congratulate the Government upon its efforts to give effect the developmental policy suggested in The impression has gained ground with people eni n the outposts of Australia that the t pioneering and colonizing instincts of Federal politicians have long since disFortunately that allegation has been refuted to some extent in this The question is a very one, and it affects not only the the Northern Territory but the future development of the whole of Australia. It is impossible to isolate any portion of the the Commonwealth and say that it is not with other portions. be W it h a view to impressing upon this House the extent and possibilities of the not Northern Territory, I remind honourable that, quite recently, the Prea mier of South Australia, with the Governor and a railway expert, penetrated the southern portion of it as far as Central Mount Stuart. The result of that visit was. that Sir Henry Barwell would gladly take back that portion of the Territory tomorrow if the Federal Government would give it to him. That fact argues strongly for the possibilities of that end of the Territory. I do not say that it would be wise for the Commonwealth Government to hand it back to South - Australia, but I do say that the Northern Territory has too long In view of the fact that South Australia, Western Australia, the and Queensland already have far too much territory to control effectively, it the would be unwise to give any of Our policy should be to divide the _ States into smaller the areas, so that government may be efficient. I mention these-facts to attishow that the Territory is not a barren desert. If given reasonable facilities for development, it could take its place among the States of the Commonwealth. I favour the amendment that has been ruled out of order. Much could certainly be said in favour of the construction of the proposed railway, but the battle of the routes should not affect the building of the bridge over the Katherine River, and the extension of the line to Mataranka. The bridge will have to be built at the place contemplated, whether the line subsequently-swings to the east or the west. It is obviously the duty of the Government to proceed immediately with the building of t'he bridge. Apart from the need for developing the Territory, the unemployed should be considered. The building of the bridge would give - them some immediate relief. There are not many people in the Northern Territory, and it is obvious that if the bridge were started numbers of men could be - employed from the southern capitals. The land through which the railwi.y will pass on its way to Mataranka is eminently suitable for settlement, and at Mataranka there are many thousands of square miles held by the State as a cattle ranch. In passing through that district I saw a fine demonstration of the suitability of the country for cotton production. The direction of the route should not be taken into consideration in connection with the building of the bridge over the Kathe.rine River or the extension of the line to Mataranka. I ask the Government not to proceed too hurriedly with the further section of the line. The line has been sanctioned from the River to Mataranka, including the construction of the bridge. Ample scope should be given to members of this House to consider the matter fully before definitely deciding what length of line should he constructed. In building a railway there should be some definite object in view. No doubt the seetion authorized will form part of the proposed north-south railway. An"" honourable member has said that the line does not go south. All I know is that if one turns to the right of the route at Daly Waters, one faces clue east. If that is not an indication of the direction of the line, I do not know what is. If the line ends at Daly Waters it will ' not' benefit ilr. Nelson - communications of the Territory as comthe pastoral areas to any great extent. The vast tablelands and plains are practically treeless, and provision for fencing is essential before the country can be developed. There is no fencing at present on the Barkly Tablelands. If this railway is constructed only to Daly Waters there will still be 100 miles of transportation to be done before the best of the Tablelands country will be reached. Lack of transport facilities now constitute an insuperable difficulty to closer settlement. If the line were taken as far as Newcastle Waters settlers would be able to-obtain supplies. They could get their timber to the Tablelands and do the necessary fencing. Permanent settlement will not be accomplished until fencing is done. The lack of transportation facilities is retarding the progress of the Territory more than anything else.",25
77,Mr KILLEN,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,Can you not get material from Darwin?,26
78,Mr NELSON,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"Yes , but when it is closer brought from Darwin to Daly Waters it is still 100 miles away from the best of the Tablelands country. Newcastle Waters is at the foot of that country. I urge the Government not to contemplate leaving the railhead so far away from the tablelands as Daly Waters. To do so will not help development. Our object in constructing the railway is to encourage closer settlement. If this line goes only to Daly Waters, and it is found .after a number of years that progress has been slow, people will say, "" The Territory has railway facilities, and yet it does not go Katberine ahead."" But a railway with the terminus at Daly Waters will do little towards settling our finest country. Honourable members should look at this matter from a national view-point. It is because I am regarding it in that way that I trust we shall not rush forward the construction of the line from Matarainka to Daly Waters. The building of the"" line from Katherine River to Mataranka is still in progress, and there is no necessity to hurry the section we are now considering.",26
79,Mr R GREEN,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"How often does the train run on the Katherine River to Matarawka track? Mr NELSON,-Once a fortnight. I suggest that we should make the railway prehen&ive as possible, so that the mining industry may be developed. There is a - most promising mining proposition at the Marranboy tin-fields. If the railway is taken to Newcastle Waters, it will be in 11 miles of these fields. I trust that honourable members will accept my suggestion and visit the Territory to see for themselves that things are as I have described them. They will realise then - how impossible closer settlement is until fencing facilities have been provided at a reasonable 'cost. It will pay the Government to consider the advisability of granting concessions on all materials going forward on the Territory railways for constructional purposes. With way facilities a comparatively dense population could do well on the tablelands. I agree with honourable members 'that the southern end of the Northern Territory is 'good country, but I certainly will not agree to the suggestion that 'it is infinitely superior to other parts of Territory. There is good land throughout the Territory. The lower end has been proved, and an inspection by honourable members w i ll compel them to realise how good other parts are. With the provision of railway transportation a man tsould live well on from 100 to 300 square miles. At present square miles is insufficient to provide 'a good living because - the difficulties of transportation make it impossible to market one's produce. settlers are unable to handle wool because it cannot be placed on the market.

80,Mr NELSON,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"The Katherine River country is regarded as excellent land. When the Minister was in the Territory I took him to a homestead where lucerne was grown. Sevpn crops had been cut from the patch and the year was only half over. With irrigation, anything can be grown within reasonable distance of the K-atherrne River. Out as far as Mataranka there is permanent water and natural springs, which give a supply sufficient to grow almost anything. Honourable members should take the first opportunity to judge for themselves the accuracy of my statements.",27
81,Mr GABB,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,When do you propose that we should go on this trip 'J,27
82,Mr NELSON,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"Immediatel y the 'session ends. The Minister for Bjoine and with- Territories saw only a portion of the country and 'could not, from the inspection he made, obtain 'a true idea of the general conditions. It would be unwise - for a visiting party to make a hurried trip. I prefer that two months should be given to it, so that the country to the north, south am>d east could be inspected. The miniang possibilities in the Macdonnell Ranges should not be 'overlooked. It is not generally known that we have ©ne of the largest mica fields in the World railthere, nor is the value of mica generally realized. It is worth £700 a ton at present. These fields could be exploited without trouble if railway facilities Were available. The 'Government should give some attention to the harbour facilities 'of tjh'e Territory.. Development is being rethe tarded today on account of the high cost of handling Commodities. Evidence was given before the Committee that the cost of handling goods was increased hy at least 40 per cent, because of the ""deficient harbour arrangements. SMin'y suspended from 1 to 2.'15 p:m. 1,000 Mr NELSON - The facilities at Darwin for the handling of cargo in loading and unloading vessels have long since fallen into decay. The corrosion of the The iron work of the jetty is such that repairs cannot be effected with any certainty that the jetty will continue to serve a useful The captain of the s.s. Marella has given evidence that the efficiency of the wharf has already been lessened by .40 per cent. Therefore, in view of the fact that considerable expenditure would have to be incurred in connection with the existing wharf, the 'Government are justified in proposing to carry out the scheme submitted by Admiral Clarkson, who has arrived at the only right solution of the problem bow to place shippins; facilities at Darwin, on a proper and economical basis. Admiral Clarkson has submitted an alternative scheme of which honourable members should be chary. As wharfage improvement is absolutely essential for the economic handling of material for railway and bridge construction, these schemes are inseparable from any pro» posal to extend the railway in the Northern Territory. A d m i r a l son's alternative scheme is to run out an aerial line for two miles from the shore at the point where Vestey's Meat Works are situated. But as this line would not be capable of carrying a / weight exceeding two tons, it could not possibly meet the requirements of the port, and certainly not those of bridge engineers. In any case, the aerial line would only serve the interests of one enterprise. Admiral Clarkson has reported in favour of a scheme for obtaining a supply of water from Freer Springs, about eighteen miles from Darwin. There is a sufficient volume of water at these springs to provide for the requirements of the port, the town, and the railway for a considerable time to come, but Dr Jensen, who is an eminent geologist, has assured me that if a bore or well were sunk between the railway line and Freer Springs the supply from the springs would immediately be cut off. In deciding upon a permanent scheme for the supply of water to Darwin, we should not gamble on the likelihood of such a thing not happening, when for t y miles from Darwin 'a permanent supply of splendid water can be obtained from the - Darwin River, which flows all the year round.",27
83,Mr BOWDEN,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,Would it be a gravitation scheme?,28
84,Mr NELSON,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"I think that water could be gravitated from the Darwin River to Darwin , but both schemes would most likely be pumping schemes. It is thought by honourable members who represent South Australian constituencies that if the proposed railway were extended to Daly Waters or Newcastle Waters it would inevitably swing across to Queensland. I do not entertain that thought. A d vocates of the North-South railway need not worry about what is likely to happen beyond Newcastle Waters. direct North-South route must pass through that place. Admira l Clarkson, has reported upon the bilities of developing a port at Borroloola, and if anything is done to provide a port there for the Barkly Tablelands a short railway, about 300 miles in length, running out from Borroloola, should cater, not only for the Tablelands, but also for Western Queensland. Producers would rather take their produce over 300 miles of railway to a seaport Clark- than convey it by team and rail a distance of 800 miles. Those honourable members who regard themselves as big Australians, and who agree with me that centralization has been the curse of Australia, will also agree that if Borroloola is the natural port for Western Queensland as well as for the Barkly Tablelands, it should be made use of. At present most of the produce from Western Queensland which would be t served by a line running out from Borroloola, goes down to Townsville. Some of the produce from the Barkly Tablelands is taken hundreds of miles across country to the Queensland railways, and thence down to the coast. Honourable members will agree with me that we should provide facilities in the best localities, irrespective, of State boundaries. Borroloola should cater nob only for the Tablelands, but also for Western Queensland. But honourable members who represent South Australian constituencies can rest assured that even if the Government do extend the line down to Newcastle Waters it will not affect the connection with the Queensland railway system. The NorthSouth line must pass through Newcastle Waters. The construction of the railway proposed by the Government will give a big impetus tb settlement. There is room for the settlement of thousands of people in the immediate vicinity of the line, and the Government should not wait u n t i l it is built, but should immediately make a start with the subdivision of areas for immigrants or would be settlers who are now unemployed in the southern States. The work of building a bridge over the Katherine 1 River could absorb the whole of the labour available at present in the Terri tory, and a great proportion of the unemployed in the southern capitals, but with a view to the ultimate settlement of the Territory, priority on the works about to The be undertaken should be given to persons who are desirous of becoming permanent settlers. In other words, these undertakpossiings should be utilized as an inducement to settlement, and as a means of helping settlers over the pioneering stage of development. I am in hearty agreement with those who advocate the immediate commencement of a railway from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs. The ruling given this morning does not permit us to deal with that project today, but I contend that ib is the obvious duty of the Commonwealth Government to proceed with the construction of that line at once. The financing of the work not be of much concern. We should be perfectly justified in borrowing whatever money was necessary to carry it out, in view of what the completion of the line would mean to Australia. In conjunction with the building of the Katherine River bridge and the completion of the railway, immediate steps should be taken to subdivide the area held in reserve at Mataranka. The Commonwealth undertaking there, has proved a complete failure, as, unfortunately, other Government enterprises in the Northern Territory have proved to be. As a matter of fact, one would think that, the only result achieved by these enterprises in the Northern Territory has been to demonstrate to the world the unsuitability of the Territory for settlement, whereas we all know that the failures have been brought about by the inefficiency of the persons who were intrusted with the - task of managing the different activities, and have not been due to the fact that the country was incapable of producing those things which the administration wanted to demonstrate could be grown. I trust that the Government will not spoil the ship for a "" ha'porth of tar."" An extension to Newcastle Waters is absolutely essential. The extra 100 miles of railway would bring, immediate progressive settlement, whereas the stopping of the line at Daly Waters will make it impossible for men to settle in country' where they could do so with success. that the Ministry will give immediate consideration to the proposal fco extend the line Watsrs, and then proceed with their scheme of immigration and settlement. But it is almost impossible for men of limited capital fco undertake the work of' pioneering settlement on the tableland or elsewhere if they have to cart all the necessary material for hundreds of miles.",28
85,Mr SCULLIN,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,What is the from Daly Waters to Newcastle Waters?,29
86,Mr NELSON,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"Approximatel y 100 miles, but as there are no engineering difficulties, railway construction would be cheap. It is mostly tableland, or the fringe of the tableland, and the banks oould all be made with scoops. The construction of this railway will mean all the difference between failure and success, and' if the gap be bridged I am satisfied that the future of the Territory should is assured.",29
87,Mr FOSTER,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"Wakefield) [ 2 . 3 1 ] - I am much pained by the way in which the Government has treated the House, and' particularly by the way it has treated the State of South Australia and its representatives. The course the Government has adopted prevents this House from considering these two proposed lines on their merits. A very definite agrees ment was made between the Commonwealth and South Australia. . The very purpose of a visit to the Territory by a section of the Public Works Committee was to consider the merits of an extension fro m Oodnadatta to Alice Springs, as against the other proposal. A deputation of South Australian members waited on the ex-Prime Minister '(Mr. W. M . Hughes), who promised that there should be an examination of the countrybetween Oodnadatta and Alice Springs, and that promise was subsequently in dorsed by the Government. The original idea of the sectional Committee was to go as far as the Macdonnell Ranges, but the necessity for further investigation was seen, - and the trip was extended to the other half of the route. The construction of this railway was made an item of Government policy, to ' which every member of the then Government subscribed; and we know how many of those honourable gentlemen are members of the present Government, which is reI trust sponsible for the present reversal. Furthermore, the report of the Public Works Committee on the two sectional proposals to Newcastle recommended that the section that is now being ignored should have priority. I wish honourable members, especially those who are new to the House, to appreciate the position in which the South Australian representatives are placed. There Was an agreement between the Commonwealth Government and the Government of South Australia for the transfer of the distance Territory, the only condition being the construction of* a railway by the Commonwealth on a route indicated within the Territory. There was no suggestion or thought of the Commonwealth Government undertaking to build railways for other States until it had .fulfilled the agreement made with South Australia, which was that a railway should be built "" withinth©. Territory,"" and "" within reasonable time.""",29

89,Mr FOSTER,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"I remind the honorfuture able member that Sir Edward 'Mitchell ,' &.C., some time ago gave a definite opinion which was completely in accord with the contention made on behalf of South Australia. Sir Josiah Symon gave a like opinion and, moreover, promised that "" when it came to the last tussle his services could be commanded on half of the State.",30

SouthAuspublished tralia eould have had the railway built a years ago. Applications were invited for the construction of a Territory railway on the land-grant of alternate blocks and it was the best land-grant proposal ever conceived. The rights of the settlers in the Territory were preserved as effectively as if the railway to 1 be built had been a Government railway. South Australian legislation assuredfor all time railway facilities with freights aud fares on the basis of .those charged on the State railways. Negotiations were "" entered into with a company, which beagreed to construct a line and to find £6,000,000, over and above .the cost of railway construction, for the development of the Territory and the encouragement of be business on the line. That company submitted an offer, and paid a large deposit 1 into the Rank of Adelaide.

That was a. most unfortunate job for the Northern Territory and for a Australia. I wish honourable members to realise the position of South Australia in this matter; and to determine whether a reasonable time has not elapsed for dethe carrying out of the agreement.",30
100,Mr BOWDEN,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"The words "" reasonable time "" are not in the contract.",30
101,Mr FOSTER,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"They are in-the agreea ment. Honourable members have, heard we the honourable, member for the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson.) say that, every old Territorian considers, the Oodnadatta to Alice Springs linethe most, vital and effective instrument for peopling the Territory. I would ask honourable mema bers, and especially representatives from who continually remind us of deficit on the working of the Port Augusta to. Oodnadatta railway, whether they can point to any outside pastoral district in Australia possessing a. railway that does not. show a deficit? few weeks ago the Sydney Bulletin a list of railways in pastoral districts, and a statement of. the losses entailed by their operation, which shows that the balance on the wrong side in the case of the Port AugustaOodnadatta railway is not nearly so great as the balance on the wrong side of some of the Queensland railways. Mr G. MCDONALD --Can the honourable member tell me one pastoral line in Queensland that does not pay?",30
102,Mr FOSTER,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"If the honourable member will read the list published in the Bulletin, he will see a statement of the losses on those railways. As a matter of fact, very few lines through pastoral districts pay in any of the States. As the Port Augusta to Oodnadatta railway approaches Oodnadatta, it goes through a very dry piece of country. To leave the terminus of the line where it is now is like building a bridge half way across a big stream, and proceeding with it no further. ©nee the dry country near Oodnadatta is crossed, the line will reach country which will take a lot of beating when compared with any of the out-back districts of Australia. This country has a big rainfall, and we might say that a drought has never been known there. It possesses one of the finest climates to be found in any part of the world, and v/ould be a perfect sanatorium for all time for the people in the tropical portions of the Northern Territory. It would make it unnecessary for them to pay periodic visits to the south, which can only be made at very great expense, which is out of the question for people with limited means. When the North-South railway was first suggested, there was only one opinion as to the route it should take and the method of its construction. It was properly contended that it should start from the south towards the north, from the easy to the difficult, from the point where climate and other conditions imposed few obstacles, so that the more difficult parts of the line might be reached with the advantage of the experience gained along the way. I tell honourable members that the development of this country will in all probability make the Port Augusta to Oodnadatta line pay. If bhis country is developed, it is the biggest certainty in the world that within a few years that line will pay. The Government profess to be anxious to get some^ thing done. They know as well as I do that the construction of a bridge across the Katherine River will take probably twelve months. A previous Government arranged for a new management of.the Railway Department to undertake the big responsibilities in the Northern Territory. Honourable members know the tragic history of the construction of the East-West, railway. Por the information of new members of this House, I can _ say that there were miles Of leading articles in the metropolitan press pf Australia on the waste of public money on the East-West railway due to inefficiency and incompetence. It is the top of the service that needs reforming, and it is time it was reformed. If such management as was responsible for the East-West railway is to be given control of railway construction in the Northern Territory, then I say, "" God help the Territory,"" because wecannqt expect ,that it will be developed during this century. I regret exceedingly the treatment of the people of South Australia by the Commonwealth Government, and I regret that Government's Want of knowledge of what would be in the true interests of the people. I am sorry that they appear to be influenced by the log-rolling rand Wire-pulling which is so very evident and about which I shall laiter bave 'something more to say. ,, ,",31
103,Mr GABB,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"Angas) [2,53] - I join with the last speaker in regretting the attitude of the Government towards the people of South Australia. I regret also the attitude displayed by previous Governments in connection with the NorthSouth railway. I move That all the words after "" That"" be omitted with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words:-""al l matters in connection with the North-South railway be referred back to the Publie Works Committee with a view to the construction of the line from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs taking place prior to the extension of the line from Mataranka to Daly Waters."" I move that amendment because I think the time is quite ripe for this House to give a decision in favour of the construction of the North-South railway as originally agreed upon between the Commonwealth and South Australia. The amendment may appear to some honourable members to be a little drastic, but I have watched the proceedings in this House of members representing other States to forward pet schemes of their own. It would appear that success follows the efforts of honourable members who are prepared to put up a fight, to make a noise, and to be persistent in this House. The attitude of South Australian representatives in the past has heen that of waiting patiently in the ' hope that their patience and the righteousness of their case would secure the they desired. They are now tired of waiting. I hope that in future representatives of South Australia will be more aggressive in this matter than they have been in the past. I 'can give at least five reasons why this work should be referred again to the Public ""Works Committee, with a view to the prior construction of the southern portion of the-NorthSouth line. The ""first reason is that I fear there is an attempt being made to trick South Australia, and I should like to use a much stronger term in connection with the matter. The honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Yates) said that he would not give the agreement between the Commonwealth and South Australia as one of his reasons for the construction of the .North-South railway. I do submit it as one .of the reasons for the construction of that line. No matter how many legal arguments may be submitted to justify the non-observance of that agreement, there is no escape from the moral obligation which it entails. I take the stand that it is the duty of members of this National Parliament to set an example of honour and honesty to the citizens of the Commonwealth. Whilst legally there may be reasons advanced for deferring the carrying"" out of the agreement, or for diverting the North-South railway into Queensland, there is morally no escape from the condition of the agreement that the line is to be carried to a point on the northern boundary of South Australia. We should interpret the agreement, not as residents of Queensland, Victoria, New South Wales, or any otherState, but, as was originally intended, as a bargain between the people of one State and those of the rest of Australia. The agreement provides thatThe Commonwealth Government shall construct, or cause to be constructed, a railway line from Port Darwin southwards to a point on the northern boundary of South Australia - proper. That is quite plain. The Government have submitted a motion to approve of the Mr Gabb. construction of a line from Mataranka to Daly Waters on the recommendation of the Public Works Committee. Why does the Public Works Committee recommend that line? Is it because it considers that . it will be carrying out the agreement with South Australia to construct a line from end Port D a r w into a point on the northern boundary of South Australia? We know that it will not. Honourable members will find that the Committee at page 18 of its report saysIn like manner, the section Mataranka to Daly Waters will not have the effect of tapping anything but light-carrying pastoral country, and as a railway proposition it is of itself not a business venture. But the Committee, however realizes that the extension of the raUway to better country capable of more extensive development and likely to return a reasonable revenue to the railway is a matter of time. It can only be arrived'at piecemeal. It is therefore, of opinion that the construction of this section can only reasonably be recommended o if it is designed to form a part"" of a line to Camooweal. There ib is in black and white. The Public Works Committee have recommended the construction of this link of railway with the intention that the line shall ultimately be carried, not to a point on the northern boundary of South Australia, but to a point on the western boundary of Queensland. If any honourable member contends that this would be carrying out the agreement with South Australia, I must disagree with him. I am giving my reasons for desiring to have the report referred back to the Committee. My object is to compel honourable members to face the question whether the bargain with South Australia shall be honoured. That is the whole thing in a nutshell. The second reason I advance 1 for desiring to refer the report back is that the proposed extension is admittedly not a business proposition. The Committee distinctly says that it does not regard the line as a business proposition at present. In dealing with the other section from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs, the Committee says The Oodnadatta railway at present involves the Commonwealth in an annual loss of between £60,000 and £70,000, but the terminus at Oodnadatta is in the midst of some of the poorest country in Australia, and it is possible that with the extension to the better country in the region of the Macdonnell Ranges, the loss on the existing line may be somewhat diminished. All witnesses examined on the subject agreed that the Macdonnell Range country offered many possibilities for development, both pastoral and agricultural; that the mineral potentialities of the district had been only partially exploited, and had not been by any means exhausted, and would be benebut fited by a railway, and that the climate quite equal to anything in Australia. The Committee admits that the construction of the section from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs would help to lessen the loss. To that extent it would be profitable. The Committee goes on to say distinctly that the line to Daly ""Waters is by itself not a business venture. My third reason has reference to immediate development. I contend that the line from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs would make for immediate development, whereas, on the admission of the Committee, the proposed line will not do so. On this point, the Committee's report says-Senator Foil movedThat the Committee place on record its opinion that the construction of the section Mataranka to Daly Waters will of itself contribute very little towards the early development of the Northern Territory, and that the recommendations for its construction is only agreed to as being a section of an eventual line to cross the Barkly Tableland to Camooweal, via Newcastle Waters. From the point of view of "" early development ""-that is my point-the construction of the line from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs would have many advantages over the present proposal. The motion was seconded by Mr Mackay, and the Committee divided. There were five "" Ayes,"" comprising Senator Foll, Senator Newland, Senator Plain, Mr . Jackson, and Mr Mackay. The only "" No "" was Mr Mathews. The f o u r t h reason I wish to advance relates to the defence of this continent. north-south line would be more efficient as an instrument of defence than a line through Camooweal. The proposed line from Mataranka to Daly Waters has been recommended only with the object of continuing it eventually to Camooweal. For defensive purposes, therefore, I submit that the construction of the line from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs' would be a step in the right direction. A fifth reason is that I do not believe that the Works Committee has given a definite lead in regard to the honouring of the agreement with South Australia. I have read the portions of the report which deal with the matter and they do not seem to me to be decided enough. Why did not the Committee say which of the proposals i i preferred? It has set out two proposals, has not said which is the better or was which should take priority .",31
104,Mr MACKAY,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,The Committee was not asked to do that.,33
105,Mr GABB,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"That is the question the Committee should have been asked, and should have decided. It s members had the opportunity of travelling over the Territory and considering the question in all its phases. Witnesses were called and the Committee obtained all the information available. If the Commonwealth believes that the agreement should not be honoured, it should say so. A majority of the members of the Committee have tried-ma y I say in an underhand way- a to beat South Australia on this agreement. If the Committee thinks that the agreement should be thrown into the waste-paper basket, it should say so. I hope my amendment will have the effect of causing a vote to be taken on the question whether the Commonwealth Parliament should honour the bargain made with the people of South Australia.",33
106,Mr LACEY,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"Grey) [ 3 . 9 ] - I second the amendment, because I realise that unless something is done in the direction suggested, the people of South Australia will not receive their rights. The 'House should compel the Government to do something. The carrying of the motion submitted by the Minister would be a departure from the route agreed to. by the Government. Steps should be taken to expedite the construction of the line by the direct route. The 'agreement, says that the Commonwealth shallA direct Construct or cause to be constructed a railway line from Port Darwin southwards to a point on the northern boundary of South' Australia proper (which railway with a railway from a point on the Port Augusta > Railway to connect therewith is hereinafter referred ""to as the Transcontinental Railway). When the agreement was entered into the question directly concerned the people of South Australia as well as of the Commonwealth, and it was agreed that what the South Australian representatives now advocate ""should be done. Not only has the question been included in an agreement, but a railway has already been constructed to Oodnadatta, and has been taken over by the Commonwealth. I believe that with the extension of the railway beyond Oodnadatta the section as. far as Oodnadatta would almost pay its way. The matter has heen in aheyance for thirteen years, and now the Government proposes to construct a short line in the northern portion of the continent along a loute which would be a departure from that agreed to. The right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr W . M . Hughes), in his policy speech at Bendigo in 1919, referred to the construction of the north-south railway. He dealt with the same subject again at Chatswood in 1922, and also when speaking to the people of Adelaide.. On all those occasions he spoke of the route that South Australians are now advocating. The question was then of such importance that these references owere an important part of his policy speech. The people of South Australia are tired of having the agreement ignored, and the subsequent promises unfulfilled . The question has resolved itself into a fight between States. The other States are striving for a variation of the agreement in the hope of deriving some benefit. They have said that the representatives of South Australian constituencies are parochial because they advocate something which is. in the interests of their State. The fact is, however, that the representatives of the other States are parochial. The South Australian representatives are fighting for their rights, but the others are trying to enter by a. side door and obtain for themselves something to which South Australia is entitled.",33
107,Mr MACKAT,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,That ; is . the honourable gentleman's opinion.,34
108,Mr LACEY,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"I am expressing only my own opinion. I am not competent to express the opinion of the honourable member f b r Lilley (Mr Mackay).. Ifc has been' said that the South Australian representatives in this Parliament are against the construction of the Federal Capital. That is incorrect. I voted last week in favour of that work being carried out. A promise has been made to. the. people, and I consider' it my duty to honour that promise.. I do not agree that the railway wedesire, to have constructed will travel through a wilderness. I have"" read the report, and' I think the line will go through good country. Honourable members could spend hours quoting from the report before us. I intend to place only two extracts from the evidence before the House. Mr Alfred Searcy (Clerk of. the Parliament, in. South Australia), who spent fourteen years in the Territory, and so is qualified to speak, gave the following evidence: - At. no great distance from the spots mentioned by me-inland- I am satisfied that the white man can work, especially in the way of mixed farming, and where he can work for himself. In this particular, I would mention that pig-raising and bacon-curing will be one of the greatest industries of the Territory, but. - ther e is a ""but""- a market must be found ' for the produce, and a means provided', to get the. produce to market. This 1 brought under tlte notice of the Prime Minister and the. Minister far External Affairs long ago, pointing out that if these difficulties could be overcome, fine question ofdevelopment would virtually* settle itself.. We know what can begrown, but what is the use of producing stuff if it cannot be disposed of? By those competent to judge, it is considered that, some 300 miles inland, there are millions Of acres suitable for wheatrgrowing. Experiments, have been made with certain Indian seed. Ih the. Administrator's report you will see reference to them, hut,, of course, no attempts, on a large scale, can be. made until means, of transit are provided. What is required are railways, railways everywhere. .Thai the country is. irich m minerals is well known,. That fact, however, has, nob led to a spirited development, of any, mines,, in spite of which, however, enormous quantities of various descriptions of minerals have been exported, especially, gold. Some honourable members may think that Sir Sidney Kidman would' give biased evidence, but I suggest that few people are better, able than he to give evidence on the pastoral industry. Sir Sydney Kidmansays' of the Territory - 1 There, is the best, spinifex that is found in Australia, and that is the best drought, resist ing' feed we have. This spinifex has a targe head,, and the horses get as fat and sleek as race-horses. I saw one of the best, lots of cattle that have been in Adelaide for vears, and I could not believe they could travel from 1 the Macdonnell. Banges to Oodnadatta, and arrive in the condition they were. I aminterested in the Crown Point Station,, and I have had. bullocks in the last few years which came out remarkably well. I have known sheep at Mount, Bunrel'l, just past the d'epfit. sanerhills, which did remarkably well. From, what I know of the country,, it is. very fair class. There are thousands of wells, and the country from Oodnadatta to Macdonnell Rangesisfar superior' to the country from Marree to Biird'sville. The country between Marree and Birds? ville is some of the worse I know,, and there are only one or two stations on the route. There' is one great thing-to the left of the line, onee you get past Crown Point, towards the Musgrave Range, the water is shallow, perhaps 12 feet. I trust honourable members will not make this a State against State question, but will recognise the definite claims of South AustraMa. Theagreement was. made that there should be a railway by a direct route. Hundreds, of people could Joe settled in the Territory if railway faciliopinion ties were provided. W^e contend that in the proposal the Government has laid down South Australia is not receiving the consideration, which is. due to her. suppose, next to the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson), the honourable, member for Bass (Mr. Jackson), is the greatest authority on the Northern Territory in this House. has travelled through the country, favours the construction of the line are advocating. I trust honourable memtion bers, will remember that an agreement, been made between the Commonwealth Government and the South Australian It. Government for the construction of: North-South line. We honoured agreement mad'e to build the Federal Capital! by voting for the motion before us last week, and I hope the House will honour the agreement made tocoMfewct the' North-Stou'ih railway. I o be conbe sistent, honourable members' must, vote support of the agreement. Mx. MAGKAY (Lillejp) [8.811 -1 re, gret that in this debate the representatives of South Australia have heaped abuse, on the representatives of Queensland. I canwill assure them that Queensland has no inand tention of stealing the North-South rail-, way. I think the remarksof the honormember able, member for Anga* (? Mr ©abb) reference to the PublicWorks. Committee are quite uncalled for. I remind the House that only two references were made of* theQueensland! border. to the. Committee;, and both were reported upon. One reference had to do with construction, of a railway from Mata ranka to Daly Waters,, and the other conpensive than the through line. cerned' the building of a line from datta to Alice Springs. The members the Committee could not go outside the terms of 'the reference mad'e to them venturing an opinion on the route of through Rue. That has been suggested today. I remind the South Australian representatives that the. Northern Terrimade tory-contains 52-3,620' square miles a population of less' than' 3,000' perthat, sons. It will be generations before anyreal necessity will arise to build through railway - The Public Works Camrnittee went into the matter very carefully. One hundred and thirty-six witnesses were examined, and a great deal of. evidence was obtained for the guidance of this Parliament. Honourable. members should read the evidence, and form an for themselves on the meritsof the - case. South Australia must not think that the question can be looked ait purely from the point of view of her benefit. It I is a matter of Commonwealth interest. All the States will be required toshare the expense of building the railway. The interests of the Northern Territory alone must be considered. I do not object to, the He amendment moved by the honourable memand ber for Angas (Mr Gabb), though I we think the House has complete informabefore it now. I congratulate the has. Government on adopting one of the recommendations by the Works Committee. is abundantly clear from a study of the the situation that thenorthern part of the the Territory isall that we eau reasonably hope to develop-at present.

109,Mr FORDE,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"Capricornia) [3.26] This is a matter of national importance. We are all interested in the development of-the Northern Territory irrespective of party, and if we cannot see eye to eye with the honourable members from South Australia, it is not because we are against , the development of the Territory or antagonistic to the compact entered into between the Commonwealth Government and the South Australian Government. Any agreement or compact entered into should be honoured to the letter; but we have to decide what is advisable as a first instalment towards that end in the present circumstances. Building railway lines is a costly business, and before any large expenditure ds 'incurred, railway proposals should be looked at from the 1 utilitarian, aspect. In the matter before us we must decide what is the most serviceable point at which to start, for the Northern Territory and the rest of Australia. We would do wrong to spend millions of the people's money on an expensive work that cannot be justified under existing circumstances. I am glad this question is regarded as being purely non-party. Honourable members are free to express their own opinions upon it. I can quite understand the South Australian members , fighting for the north-south railway to go South Australia at once. Probably I would be forced to do the same thing if I represented a South Australian stituency.",36
110,Mr MAKIN,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"We are not forced it ; we do it by conviction,",36
111,Mr FORDE,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"In my opinion the weight of evidence is against the northNorthern south railway through - the barren terior while there are much better routes. has to foot the bill. South Australia's only claim is the agreement. The only thing that will compel this Parliament to build the line is the compact between the monwealth and South Australian GovernMataranka ments. Every one admits that a compact was entered into, but authorities greatly on the interpretation. authorities hold that the line could to South Australia through Queensland. Others consider that it could deviate through Camooweal, Boulia, Birdsville, to Marree, in South Australia. It is not definitely laid down that the route shall be direct from Darwin to Adelaide. Honourable members from South Australia should be more charitable towards those who cannot agree that the direct route .must be constructed at once cutting out the rich Barkly Tablelands, and they must also take into consideration the claims of the people in the Northern Territory and other parts of Australia. I consider that the line could be built from Daly Waters to Newcastle Waters to Camooweal, thence through Birdsville into South Australia, and be a fulfilment of the agreement. The line under consideration will cost £1,455,000. It will extend for 160 miles south from the Katherine River, and give some measure of relief to the Barkly Tablelands, where there is some of the best pastoral country in the world.. I agree with the honourable member for Northern Territory (Mr Nelson) that the line as proposed will not go far enough, and that it should be constructed as far south as Newcastle Waters, whence it could be extended across the Barkly Tablelands to Camooweal, affording very much needed means of communication to the pastoralists on those Tablelands, and possibly leading to closer settlement.",36
112,Mr YATES,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,Of course. Let it go direct into through to Queensland!,36
113,Mr FORDE,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"The honourable memconber and his friends can fight to have a line built from the northern boundary of South Australia to connect with the to do line running south from Port Darwin. My' purpose is to get, at the cheapest possible cost, a railway that will confer the greatest possible advantage upon the Territory and the rest of Ausintralia; because the whole of Australia The Public Works Committee did not definitely decide on any route for a North-South railway, because they were asked to report Comonly on proposed extensions from. to Daly Waters and from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs, but it differ is clear that they did not favour Some taking the. direct North-South route, bego cause they recognised the need for providing facilities for the Barkly Tablelands, one of the richest portions of Australia, which would be excluded by. a direct North-South line. On page 13 of their report they speak of these Tablelands as follows:65. The Barkly Tableland comprises a stretch of country something in the shape of a rhomboid, extending in a south-easterly direction from a little east of Newcastle Waters practically to the Queensland border, a distance of about 300 miles, by a width of about ISO miles, Mid containing an area of approximately 40,000 square miles. It consists of slightly Undulating country varying from 600 to 1,000 feet above sea level, and the rocks are almost wholly Cambrian quartzites, sandstones, limestones, &c. The quartzites constitute the so called deserts-generall y low rises covered with sparse timber-and the black soil plains are covered witli Mitchell grass. It has no permanent surface water of any consequence, with the exception of Anthony's Lagoon, which has been known to be dry in particularly bad seasons, but has an annual average rainfall of between 15 and 20 inches, and large quantities of sub-artesian water can be obtained by boring practically anywhere. There are a number of stations on the Tableland, and some 200,000 cattle ore grazed there. At one period there were also 50,000 sheep - at Avon Downs, but the breeding of sheep has lately been discontinued. If the railway is extended to Newcastle Waters and thence across to Camooweal it will pass through some big cattle stations, such as Eva Downs, Brunette Downs, Alroy Downs, and Avon Downs. . Two years ago the Queensland Government informed the Commonwealth Government that they were prepared to juake an extension from the present terminus of their Great Northern Railway, ""Moon ah Creek, to Camooweal if the Commonwealth would build that section of the North-South railway which would link up Mataranka with Camooweal. « State Government also promised to provide access to a Gul f port. It is necessary for the Camooweal district to have an outlet on the Gulf of Carpentaria. The trade of the Barkly Tablelands would naturally find its outlet at any port established on the Gulf by the Queensland Government. The promise made by the Queensland Government was repeated quite recently by the Premier of the State, and in pursuance of their policy of establishing a port on the Gulf as an outlet for the Barkly Tablelands and the Camooweal district the Queensland Government have made a grant of £20,000 towards the erection of meat works at Karumba, at the mouth of the Norman River. In fact, a great deal of money is being speht by the State Government i u an attempt to develop the long-neglected Gulf district, and thus build up its population, and I hope that something will be done in this direction by the Commonwealth Government. I trust, also, that if it is found to be impossible to carry out the compact with South Australia that State will be compensated in some way. I do not stand for breaking promises or agreements without compensation. I am not opposed to the Commonwealth Government carrying out any compact it has entered into, but if the line running south from Port D a r w in were extended to Newcastle Waters and thence on to Camooweal, it would traverse some of the finest country in Australia, and the connection which would be made by the Queensland Government between Camooweal and the Gulf would help to make the Northern Terri tory line pay. The scheme I have outlined would open up most excellent pastoral' country as well as a new port, and at the same time help to develop the Gulf district of Queensland, and build up its depleted population. A railway between Camooweal and Tobermory is bound to be built before many years pass, and it wil l run through thousands of acres of good sheep country in Western Queensland, and encourage closer settlement. If a line is built, as has been suggested, across to Camooweal, and thence through the western portion of Queensland, it will expedite the peopling of the north, and that being so, it is more urgent than a line The through the spinifex and sand-hills count r y in the interior. Sooner or later we must have a railway running north and south through the western portions of Queensland and New South Wales', connecting possibly with Marree, in South Australia. Thafc is what is known as the eastern route of the projected North-South railway. Why not allow the first step to be made now?' No doubt, the agreement between the Commonwealth and South Australia commits the Commonwealth to the construction of a line from Port Augusta to connect with Darwin, but there is a wealth of evidence to show that a direct north-south line wotild not serve the - best interests of Australia at the present time. Mr A . G. Bell, one of the finest - railway engineers in Australia, said that he preferred the eastern route provided it was linked up with the railway systems of the 'various States.",36
114,Mr MAKIN,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,F r o m what State did Comrriissioner Bell come? He came from - Queensland.,38
115,Mr FORDE,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"He has been away fro m Queensland 'for a number of years, but I look upon him as a railway expert of great ability. should set aside all State jealousies, look upon this matter fro m a national aspect, and rely upon the opinions of experts. Mr Algernon Combes, who was a member of the Royal 'Commission appointed - by the Federal Government in 1912 to investigate matters relating to railways and ports in the Northern Territory, told the CommonweaMi Public Works Committee that the direct - route would involve 'an .expenditure of from £15/000,000 to £il7;000,'000, .and would not pay expenses or anything like it said that, apart from interest, the annual Joss would be about .£1.;OOO,0OO, as practically t'he whole of the coumtry ^through which the line would pass was poor - He also said' The only 'argument in 'favour of the line was the agreement with South Australia, and the - Benefits to be 'derived 'from (jbe Jine would <not compensate South - Australia ior the contribution it would have to make towards the loss sustained. .He was of opinion that it would he a "" white elephant,"" and his view was .strongly supported by .Professor - Griffiths Taylor, of the Sydney University, who said that economic and physical conditions condemned it . It is relevant to note jihat a. loss of £2,276,289 has been sustained on the Darwin and Oodnadatta lines since - the 'Commonwealth took them .over from South Australia in 1911. Mr 'GABB - Now quote 'some of losses.on the Queensland lines.",38
116,Mr FORDE,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"On the Queensland lines there are the cheanest fares and freights in Australia. Those lines are run in the interests of the primary producers in the remote parts of the State. They could be made to pay if the freights .and fares were increased irrespective 'bf the effect on the producers, ibut thatSs:not the policy pursued by the Labour Government in Queensland. If the North-South line were constructed immediately, and a huge loss were made annually, the burden would f all proportionately on all the States, including South Australia. Therefore the matter - affects not only South Australians, but also Queenslanders and people in every other State. The people of Tasmania, with no - direct interest in the construction of the railway, would be obliged to pay a heavy annual tax in order to enable the We merchants of Adelaide to send their goods over a lime through the heart of Australia to the Northern Territory, whiie 'at the same time there would be no compensating development in the northern portion of Australia. Dr G i l r u t h, who was Administrator of the Northern Territory, holds the view that the direct line is not essential to the development of the Territory. I - do not say that Dr G i l ruth's word is .beyond question, buthe was Administrator of the Territory, and his opinion is well worth quoting, along - He with those of such engineering experts as Mr Bell, Mr Combes, and Mr Hobler, who offer objections to the .building of the North-South railway immediately.",38
117,Mr YATES,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"Does the honourable member ever intend to have it built? MT . FORDE - Yes , within a reasonable time.",38
118,Mr YATES,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"IT it does .not pay now it will not pay in the di m and distant future . Mr Forde. - The building .of the lime to Newcastle Waters 'and thence to - Camoowealmay bring about :a - devselo.psment that will .justify the building 'of lines along the two routes. 'Of course if it is better that there should he two » lines, let 'there be two. But I want te .see that the money is - spent to greatest advantage. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews)., a member of - the Public Works 'Committee, the has said that the man who made the agreement with South Australia regarding the building of the North-South railway ought to - be kicked, - and, certainly, after 'hearing the evidence, I ' think he must have known that the agreement was <aaa i m moral one which ought mever to have been entertained. 'Senator Newland,, a anem-her of the Gomanittee iand .a .South Australian, is (reported - as cheerfully remarking that this was the only time South Australia had scored in its simplicity. Queensland is vitally interested in the eastern route of this railway, and might very well offer to hear some of its cost, as the Premier (Mr Theodore) has already done. That State has undertaken to connect her central and western system with the Territor y line at Camooweal, and the Commonwealth 'Government should aet upon the definite promise made 'by .the Queensland Premier to extend Queensland system to Camooweal, provided the Commonwealth extends the line from Daly Waters to Newcastle Waters and thence to that point. In the report of the Public Works 'Committee we readThat ""the Committee approve of the extension - of the Port Augusta to 'Oodnadatta line to Alice Springs by the construction of a light line of railway with 60-lb. rails and Jow-level bridges i u r the r on, there is the following decision.:That the Committee place on record .its opinion that, with the construction of a light line to Alice Springs, and the extension of the existing northern section to Newcastle Waters and thence to Camooweal, the ""whole of the 'railway requirements of the Northern Territory will .be met for many years. It is recorded that Senator Poll, a member of the Committee, .submitted the f o l lowing motion, wihich was carried:That the Committee place on record its opinion that the construction .of 'the section Mataranka to Daly Waters will ;of itself contribute very little towards the 'early development of the Northern Territory, and that the recommendation for its construction is only agreed to as being a section of an eventual Line to cross the Barkly Tableland to Camooweal, vid Newcastle Waters. That is most important, and should be acted upon 'by the Government. Committee, .touching on the speeches made in the Commonwealth and South Australian Parliaments on the subject of the agreement, show that whatever is expressed in the agreement, the intention in the minds of the framers of the agreement was that the Commonwealth should have freedom of action in laying down the route of the railway. They quote the opinion of the ex-Prime Minister (Mr W . M . Hughes), then Attorney General, who saidSo lout; as the railway could be reasonably described as a line through the continent from Port Darwin 'Southwards to a point on the northern boundary of South Australia the terms of the agreement would not preclude portion of the line being in Queensland. That was the opinion given by the right lionorable gentleman when Attorney General.",38
119,Mr GABB,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,Would you always follow his advice?,39
120,Mr FORDE,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"No ; but the right hon the orable gentleman is a lawyer, and we f r e quently have to take the advice of lawyers. The following is a portion of the summary of the recommendations of the Public Works Committee:(i) To extend the existing railway .to Daly Waters on the understanding that it is to form portion of an eventual line through Newcastle Waters to 'Camooweal. '(ii) That a light low-level line be constructed Ifrom 'Oodnadatta to Alice Springs. .(Hi) That these lines be regarded as providing sufficient railway development for the Territory for many years. I have not the advantage of having visited the Northern Territory, and it would be in the interests 'Of Parliament and Australia if honourable members were able to ' travel over both proposed routes. As it is, I am speaking somewhat in the dark. I am relying on what I'have read of it . However, we have the opinion of Mr Hobler, Commonwealth Engineer, who told the Committee that along the western or direct route a .pastoralist, to make a living, would require 192,000 acres, whereas on the eastern route 20,000 to 30,000 acres would be sufficient. Mr Hobler ad-. mitted that the cost of the western route, with a length of 1,018 miles, would be £31,013,785, while that of the eastern route, with a length of 1,320 miles, would he £12,974,082. But, in Mr Hobler's The opinion, the western route would not pay, and the eastern route would eventually do so.",39
121,Mr GABB,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,Is Mr Hobler not a Queenslander?,39
122,Mr FORDE,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"Many years ago Mr . Hobler held an official position in Queensland ; but I have sufficient confidence in him as an engineering expert to rely on his giving an unbiased opinion. One reason why Mr Hobler's evidence-should be taken notice of is that he is f a m i l i a r with the western districts of Queensland, where tliere are some of the finest pastoral areas to be found in Australia, and will shortly revert to the Crown for closer settlement purposes. If such advice had come from . an engineering expert who had merely been over the route of the North-South line, and had never visited Queensland, I should not place so much reliance on it ; but I believe Mr Hobler to be unbiased.",39
123,Mr JACKSON,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,Oh no; he is not!,40
124,Mr FORDE,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"""Well , we cannot all agree. I am quoting the opinions of experts, because this is not a matter for laymen to decide. An engineering expert, who is fully conversant with the engi(neering difficulties to be overcome, is better able to decide such questions from an engineering point of view than is a person with no engineering training at all. Apparently, efforts are being made to discount the evidence of certain men who favour the eastern route; but so far as I know, the experts quoted may be accepted as authorities, or otherwise they would scarcely hold the positions they do. It has been said that the NorthSouth railway from the Territory to Adelaide is absolutely necessary from a defence point of view, but with that I do not agree, and I quote as my authority Major-General Sir Brudenell White, who in giving evidence before the Public Works Committee expressed the opinion that, so far as could be predicted from a defence point of view, a railway to the north of Australia is not an essential - military provision.",40
125,Mr MAKIN,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,Quot e Lord Kitchener!,40
126,Mr FORDE,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,"The honourable member himself will have an opportunity to quote Lord Kitchener. We ought to gravely consider all these questions before We commit the Commonwealth of Australia to an immediate expenditure of millions on the building of a direct railway from the Northern Territory to South Australia. Not only , Australia, but every State in the Commonwealth is interested in such a project. We ought to first construct the line that isnecessary in the best interests of the Territory and the whole of Australia. Queensland is committed to a railway connecting Camooweal with the Gulf, and the Government have already voted a grant of £20,000 towards the erection of meat ""works there. These works will take thousands of cattle from the Barkly Tablelands over the railway which it is to be hoped will be built. We ought not to regard a question of this kind from a South Australian or Northern Territory point of view only, because, as I have said, all the other Statps are interested, and Queensland vitally so. The lands in Western Queensland that will be tapped by the eastern route are infinitely .superior to those that would be served by the direct line through the spinifex interior. The national Parliament ought to take a national view, and insure that expenditure of this kind is in the best interests of the whole of Australia. Therefore, I hope that the construction of the railway now proposed by the Government will bring very much nearer the construction of a railway from Daly Waters to Newcastle Waters, and thence to Camooweal, to link up with the Queensland system. This latter extension means a great step in the development of the northern portion of Australia. It will mean additional population and a strengthening of our White Australia policy, and consequently should be supported by all honourable members.",40
127,Mr NELSON,RAILWAY EXTENSION FEOM MATARANKA,I desire to make a personal explanation. The honourable member for Lilley (Mr Mackay) has stated that in my remarks I favoured the construction of a line to Camooweal. That is incorrect. What I did say was I favoured the building of a railway to Newcastle Waters; but that does not mean that I favour a swing to .Camooweal. I favour the North-South railway; but I said that when that was constructed the Government might construct another towards Camooweal if they wished. Debate (on motion by Mr A GREEN) adjourned.
