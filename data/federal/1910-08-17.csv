Will the honourable gentleman take steps, either by sending our men to centres where everything is modern, or by securing the services of men accustomed to work among more modern surroundings, to bring our telephone service up-to-date, and to prevent the expenditure of money on obsolete instruments and appliances?",15
14,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"We have realized that the system in vogue here is out of date, and in every State we are OFFICE endeavouring to modernize it. At Hobart' there is the most up-to-date system in existence, and the Sydney system is partly up to date, a large number of subscribers there being connected with the common battery board, which Dr Bell says is the most modern arrangement. In Melbourne, we shall endeavour to connect all subscribers with a common battery board in the new exchange, which has been building for some years past.

Is it intended to compensate these officers for such service ? 3. If so, at what rate? Mr KING O'MALLEY - The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. The services of the police force have^been asked for in each State for outlying districts only. These services have been definitely promised in South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania. The matter is under consideration in other States, Victoria being, apparently, unwilling. 2. This Government is willing to remunerate the police officers for their services, mania the remuneration will be paid into the general Police Provident Fund, and not to the individuals employed on the Census, on the grounds that the work of the other officers will also be increased. 3. The general rate is to be 2s. per diem for police on foot, and is. per diem for mounted police. But, in view of the special character of the services in Western Australia, it is proposed to pay 2s. per diem to both foot and mounted police. CBE NEWS SUBSIDY.",16
20,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"Boothby-Minister of External Affairs) [10.42] - I move1. That, in the opinion of this House, it is desirable, in order to improve and increase the supply of European and other oversea cable news to the Australian press, that Government assistance should be given in the form of a subsidy. 2. That the subsidy should amount to ^6,000, payable : ^2,500 for ist year. ,£2,000 for 2nd year. £1,500 for 3rd year. 3. That any association applying for such subsidy must be prepared to supply at least 6,ooo cabled words per week, to be sent vid Pacific, and to permit any newspaper proprietary in the Commonwealth to become a subscriber for its cable service at rates which shall not exceed a scale approved by the Government. 4. That the Government should, in granting such subsidy, impose such conditions as may be necessary to secure that the public shall obtain the fullest possible benefit from the subsidized The discussion of this proposal for a few moments- I do not think it will take much more-wil l be a change from the consideration of financial measures. There has been some misconception as to the intenas tion of the Government. From what has appeared in some London newspapers, it has evidently been thought that the Government wishes to subsidize certain Labour I know how the misconception must have arisen. It is explained in the a letter which I received this morning from the Mr Temperley, in which he saysDear Sir, Yesterday I sent you a telegram asking you to accept my assurance that I had not at any time sent a cablegram to London containing the statements referred to by Mr Johnson in the House on the gth instant. I beg to forward you enclosed official copy of the cablegram I did send the day after Parliament was opened to Mr R. MCMillan, one of our directors in London. Kindly note that the words "" Independent Cable"" were the actual words contained in the Governor's address. I have the honor, & c , THOMAS TEMPERLEY, Manager. One of the two associations which now send press cable services to Australia is called but in Tasthe Independent Cable Service.",16
21,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Are there only two services ?,16
22,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"There are only two, one of them being called the United and the other the Independent.",16
23,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,What was the cablegram to which the honourable gentleman alluded ?,16
24,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"It reads as follows :MCMillan. Governor's speech announced subsidy six thousand pounds over three years Independent cable expected start first August - TEJIPERLEV . I do not know whether Mr Temperley misunderstood the words in the Governor General's speech ; but evidently at the other end they were mistaken for a promise for a subsidy to this particular company. As a matter of fact, what the words meant, and what I think honourable members generally understood, was that the policy of the Government was to give a subsidy to a cable service which would be independent-that is, independent in the sense that the conditions that are attached to the agreement under which most of the newspapers of Australia get their cable service would be left out, that every newspaper would be free to get its news - servative then. from where it liked, and that no prohibitions or difficulties would be set up in the way of newspapers starting anywhere in other group. Australia. In that sense the word "" independent "" has been used, meaning a truly independent service.",16
25,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"Unde r the Gogroup or the other? vernment proposal, no newspapers will be boycotted.",17
26,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,No .,17
27,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,The Government want to subsidize certain newspapers.,17
28,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"I want to were remove that misconception as to the policy of the Government. Nothing was further from our intentions than to subsidize certain newspapers. Our idea is to secure a truly independent cable service. That is what we are arranging, and we are quite ferent as to what association provides The honourable member is apparently so to trickiness in these matters that he not seem to understand straightforward dealing.",17
29,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,The Government want to give cheap telegrams to Labour newspapers.,17
30,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"What nonsense! cable service. I suppose that the honourable gentleman is so desirous of trying to think the very of his opponents that he assumes whatever he sees or hears to their detriment true. But let me assure him that his statement is wholly untrue. I do not intend to be drawn off any more, by his interjections from a statement of the proposals of the Government. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Is any other private cable service to be subsidized this Government?",17
31,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"Not so far as I know. Up to 1895 there were two cable associations supplying news to the Ausnews ? tralian newspapers. The Melbourne Age, the Sydney Daily .Telegraph, and the Adekind. laide Advertiser comprised one group. The other group of newspapers which had a separate cable service was composed of Melbourne Argus, the Sydney Morning Herald, the Sydney Evening News, and the Adelaide Register. Honourable members will see from these combinations that at time. I do not say at present-there was distinct cleavage in policy. Generally speaking, the Age, the Telegraph, and Advertiser were the Liberal newspapers, against the Argus, the Herald, the Register, and the Evening News.",17
32,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,Whic h were. Con,17
33,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,At that time the latter were much more conservative than the,17
34,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Did not some Queensland newspapers belong to one,17
35,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"No ; they were subscribers. The Western Australian newspapers are subscribers just as the Melbourne Herald is a subscriber. The subscribers to the Argus-Herald Association the Brisbane Courier, the Tasmanian Press Association, the Country Press Associations of Victoria and New South Wales, and the West Australian. And the subscribers to the other group were the Melbourne Herald, the Brisbane Evening indifTelegraph, the Sydney Star, and the it. Western Australian Daily News. It will used be seen that the newspapers whose prodoes prietors were not shareholders in the Cable Association grouped themselves, very naturally, according to their general policy, and so we had two associations representing newspapers with somewhat different policies, and providing a separate Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - What is the worse object of having this subsidy for only messages passing over one particular cable, to be namely, the Pacific cable?",17
36,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"Le t me deal with one thing at a time. At present, I am describing the position prior to the combination, which occurred in 1895, and under which all cable news coming to Ausby tralia has been diverted into one channel",17
37,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,Does not the honourable gentleman think that it is making in the direction of a more plentiful supply of,17
38,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,Of a particular,17
39,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"It may have been, but I should say that the probability the is that more news was provided under the old s)'stem, when two strong associations were in competition. In 1895, they decided to combine for business purposes in order to that cheapen the service to both groups, and a they formed an agreement, to the main features of which I desire to draw attention. the It was a business agreement made with the as intention of strengthening the newspapers, and enabling them to get a much cheaper service.",17
40,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Does the honourable memt>er call it a business agreement to distinguish it from the proposed agreement which I hold in my hand?,18
41,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"Yes . The latter is not a business agreement in that sense. There is no commercialism in it. A copy of the agreement of 1895 was handed in by Mr Mackinnon, managing director of the new combination, to the Select Committee of the Senate on Press Cable Service, and appears as appendix EThis agreement, made the thirteenth day of August, One thousand eight hundred and five, between the proprietary of each following newspapers, namely, the Argus, Sydney Morning Herald, the South Australian Register, and the Sydney Evening News (hereSenate, inafter collectively called the Argus-Herald Association) of the first part, and the tary of each of the following newspapers, namely, the Age, the Sydney Daily Telegraph, and the South Australian Advertiser (hereinstatement after collectively called the Age Association), - of the second part :1. The parties hereto shall procure for their respective benefits a service of cable messages from Europe and other foreign parts for publication in the several newspapers of which the parties hereto are now, or of which they may respectively hereafter be, the bond fide proprietors, and the costs and expenses of and incidental to obtaining such cable messages shall be borne by each of the parties hereto in the proportions hereinafter mentioned. The second paragraph of the agreement provides that the direction and control of the combined service shall be under the care of the Argus-Herald Association, and that during the currency of the agreement the proprietary of the Argus newspaper shall be empowered to sue and take all proceedings, and generally to manage the whole business.",18
42,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,What has all this to do with us?,18
43,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,It has something to do with my proposition.,18
44,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,It has nothing to do with the primary purpose of the motion.,18
45,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"It has everything parties. to do with the primary purpose of the motion, as I think the honourable member 'will see. Clause 5 of the agreement readsThat the total maximum cost for such cable messages as aforesaid shall be the sum of £12,000 sterling per annum. It fixed the annual minimum cost .^12,000, to be borne equally by the associations. I think that the honourable member for Parkes will see that the clause which I am"" about to read has something to do with the motionThat no messages shall be supplied to the proprietary of any newspaper published either in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, or Brisbane, other than in respect of the newspapers mentioned in this agreement without the unanimous consent of the parties hereto, except to the proprietary of any evening newspaper or newspapers which may hereafter be published in Melbourne. Honourable members will see the object of that clause. It was to provide exclusive use of the news ninetyforwarded by the Cable Association. of the VVhen Mr Mackinnon, managing director the of the Association, was under cross-examination by the Select Committee of the he made a reference to that clause propriewhich I may mention has been modified somewhat since then. On page 14 of the report, honourable members will find a which Mr Mackinnon read to the Select Committee. Referring to that particular matter, he saidComplaint has been made that a daily paper which was recently started in one of the capitals was refused the cable service by the Association. When the Association was formed a clause was embodied in the agreement requiring that the unanimous consent of the whole of the parties to it should be obtained before any new daily paper established in Adelaide, Melbourne, or Sydney could be furnished with the cable news. This provision was part and parcel of a legal document, and had, of course, the force of law, and had to be carried out. But to meet the altered circumstances and conditions which the lapse of time has brought, this provision has, within the past few months, been waived by mutual consent of all parties to the agreement. Consequently, there is no bar to any paper obtaining the Association's cable news on terms to be arranged. A clause, manifestly preventing the establishment of a rival newspaper by barring it from participating in the joint cable service, and saddling it with the heavy cost of maintaining unaided its own cable service, was recognised by the public as so serious a bar to public liberty that the Association themselves waived the requirement of the mutual consent of all",18
46,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,Will the honourable member say what there is to prevent other newspapers from making an arrangement of their own?,18
47,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"The newspapers I mentioned embrace all the daily newsat papers in Australia. To compete with two them, any other newspaper would have to provide at least as full a supply of cable news as is given by them. And to do that it would have to incur .as much expense individually as the whole of the Australian newspapers belonging to this association incur collectively. What newspaper could be started in such circumstances?",18
48,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Is this then a proposal to start the publication of fresh newspapers ?,19
49,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"No , the honourable member knows what it is.",19
50,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"I do not, and wish that the honourable member would tell carried. me.",19
51,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"I am answering a question put by the honourable member himproprietors self, by pointing out the circumstances in vice to which the proprietors of a newspaper would be placed in commencing operations. They would have to compete with a rival sociation embracing all the big daily newshave papers of Australia, and would be called upon to bear, unaided, and with no prospect of securing the co-operation others, the whole cost of a cable service. The cost of cablegrams is qne of the chief items of expenditure to which a newspaper is necessarily put. The terms of the United Cable Association have been fied to the extent that the unanimous consent of all its members is not now required to an application for participation in their news. Such an application can be granted without the unanimous consent of all cerned, but terms must be arranged. The question of terms is, of course, most portant.",19
52,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,What proportion of the members of the association have to consent to the granting of such an cation. There must be a majority ?,19
53,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"No proportion is stated. Applicants may obtain the service newspapers. on terms to be arranged, but the actual terms are not defined. It is not the proprietors of a new newspaper should be allowed to come in, and to participate in this service on equal terms who had established it, but the terms, as I have said, are indefinite, and might entirely prohibitive.  tleman tell us whether the association been asked to submit terms?",19
54,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"I do not know prised if he did so. that it has been asked since it was decided to waive the clause in the agreement viding for mutual consent, but prior to that a request to participate in the service made and refused.",19
55,Mr FULLER,Unknown,When was the agreement altered with respect to the requirement as to unanimous consent?,19
56,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"I do not think that that alteration will legally come into effect until September or November next, but it was made, I think, in July of last year, during the sittings of die Select Committee, appointed by another place to consider this question, or, at all events, after I the motion for its appointment had been",19
57,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,Does the honourable member question the right of the newspaper that have established the ser,19
58,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"No , I have said that I consider it a business arrangement ason the part of the newspapers. What we to determine, however, relates not to that consideration, but to what is the best course to adopt in order to secure to the of public of Australia the fullest possible supply of news. If newspaper proprietors have entered into a combination in restraint of news, is not that a serious matter?",19
59,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,Has any one sugmodigested that they are doing so?,19
60,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"The honourable member has been asleep. It has not only been suggested, but actually maintained in conmany quarters, that there has been restraint of news. The case, however, for imthis proposal does not depend upon the making of charges against the United Cable Service Association. It is based upon the general principle that if assistance is now given by the Commonwealth Government to appliany association for the supply of cable news we should not permit any barrier to the dissemination of that news amongst all",19
61,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Is this the way to suggested that secure the remedy ?,19
62,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,It is the only with those practicable remedy.,19

64,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"Whil e I shall be"" has prepared to hear the honourable member defend the press agreement, I should be sur",19
65,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,What provision will be promade for the supply of cable news to newspapers that are published only once a week ? was Such newspapers are not referred to in the conditions.,19
66,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,In paragraph of the conditions we have the wordsThe proprietor of any newspaper in the Commonwealth shall be entitled to become a subscriber to the Association for the cable service on payment of the annual rate applicable under Schedule A. That gives to every newspaper the right to obtain this service. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Will the weekly newspapers have to pay the same rates as the daily newspapers?,20
67,Mr GROOM,Unknown,The Government in the schedule have simply set forth the maximum annual charges.,20
68,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"That is so; we have given the. maximum rates, and we could not be expected to state in the motion the amount that each newspaper should pay. To attempt to do so would obviously be absurd. Mr JOSEPH_COOK - I rise to a point of order. It seems to me, Mr Speaker, that this matter should have originated in Committee. Standing order 243 provides that If any motion be made in the House for any public aid or charge upon the people the consideration and debate thereof may not be presently entered upon, but shall be adjourned t ill such further day as the House shall think fit to appoint, and then it shall be refererd to a Committee of the whole House before any resolution or vote of the House do pass thereon. We are here discussing a detailed proposal. The charges enumerated in the conditions are specific, and indeed are set out in detail. I submit that the place where any modification of those charges and the conditions attaching to them can be discussed is in Committee of Supply. I am aware that some motions of this kind have been submitted in the House. For instance, the motion relating to the mail contract was so submitted, but to submit such a detailed motion as this in the House is to curtail our privileges. Our privileges are, as a rule, safeguarded by the terms of the motion itself, ancl if the terms of this motion were abstract or general I should not take exception to the course being pursued. But they are not. The motion fixes the conditions that should attach to the grant that is proposed to be made by the Government. May dealing with this point saysIn like manner motions advocating public expenditureprecisely what this motion does or the imposition of a charge[60] 4 this advocates the expenditure of money and the imposition of a chargei f the motion be framed in sufficiently abstract and general terms can be entertained and agreed to by the House. Can any one say that the terms of this proposition aire abstract or general ? It actually goes into details and determinesthe number of words per week that is to be sent, and the conditions to be subscribed toby those who seek to take advantage of the service. It may be said that this question will come up again, but in what way will it be brought up ? It will only come before us again, I presume, on the Estimates. Will all these particularities appear on the Estimates? They never do. The only place in which we may discuss the particularities of this motion is, I submit, in Committee, and I contend further that it should be preceded by a message from the Governor General.",20
69,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"I submit that the objection taken by the honourable member for Parramatta is supported by logic and convenience. If , as he contends, this motion is not to be followed by a measure to be dealt with in the ordinary way, it ' seems to me that it is really equivalent to a Bill, and will have the effect of committing the House to a series of details without giving it an opportunity to discuss them in Committee. If all the Government have to do, after passing this detailed motion, is to provide for the amount in a lump sum on the Estimates, it is probable that the matter will be passed over without that careful and detailed consideration which it demands. The honourable member forParramatta has pointed out that the conditions lay down very carefully the annual payments for the first, second, ancl third years of the service, and give actual details as to the number of words which newspapers shall have an opportunity of receiving through this medium. The standing order which the honourable member has read seems to be aimed at preventing honourable members being deprived of a fair opportunity to discuss such details in Committee, as we should be able to do if they were embodied in a Bill. I therefore think that the contention of the honourable member for Parramatta should be upheld, and that this motion should be discussed in Committee, if honourable members are to be given the privilege of a detailed discussion of it.",20
70,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"I direct attention to the terms of the motion, which is clearly intended to get the sense of the House as to whether such a policy should be adopted. The carrying of this motion will not involve the appropriation of a penny of revenue. An appropriation will still be necessary to cover the expenditure required to give it effect. The objections which honourable members have raised are, therefore, without force.",20
71,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Coul d all these ditions be included in the Estimates?,21
72,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,This motion is intended merely to secure an expression of the opinion of the House that a subsidy on certain broad lines would be desirable. Mr. JOSEPH COOK. - It will be stating the opinion of the House on a proposed contract.,21
73,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"It was quite unneceswill .sary for my purpose to have included in .this motion a single word about the conto ditions. I might have stated in a general way the conditions which I thought should - apply to the proposed subsidy, but IB thought it right that honourable' members .should be treated with absolute fairness, .and, therefore, the conditions to the grant of the subsidy have been included in the motion submitted to them. I repeat that the carrying of the motion will involve merely an expression of opinion by the Estimates ? ±he House on the question of a subsidy for a cable - service:",21
74,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"And also on the conditions., surely ?",21
75,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"As I understand the matter, tfhe objection raised by the honourable .able member for Parramatta is that diis .an appropriation.",21
76,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"No , it is a motion ifor a charge.",21
77,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I understood the honourable member to contend that this is a - motion for the appropriation of a certain .sum, aiad that it should have been preceded ;by a message from the Crown.",21
78,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,No .,21
79,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"If the honourable 'member takes the other view that it is - merely a motion including a certain amount - of detail, he must see that his point of order cannot possibly be sustained. .only objection on the ground of order which 1 think he could raise was that the motion - should be preceded by a message from the Crown for an appropriation; but this motion appropriates nothing. It merely says that, in the opinion of the House, such and such a thing should be done. . Mr. JOSEPH COOK - The details of the contract proposed will require an appropriation.",21
80,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"That is quite true. The honourable member reminded the House that in connection with the mail contract a similar .course was followed, and that afterwards an appropriation had to be obtained in another form. I take it that before the conMinister could spend threepence in connection with the proposed subsidy, the amount would have to be appropriated by. Parliament. I do not know what course the Government intend to follow, but I presume that a vote for the purpose will be included in the Estimates. If that course is followed, it will be seen that the object of the honourable member for Parkes, as well as the honourable member for Parramatta, be served, since an ample opportunity will be given to every member of the House discuss the details of the vote before it is agreed to. If the Government decide to bring the matter forward in the form of a ill , honourable members will remember that the Bill must go through Committee, and the same object would therefore be served to be attached at that stage.",21
81,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Do you suggest, sir, that we can vary this contract in discussing",21
82,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member's interjection is welcome, because it affords me an opportunity to convey additional information. He asks whether I suggest that it will be possible for honormembers to alter the terms of this is motion in discussing a vote on the Estimates. He must know that it will not; but honourable members have full opportunity to alter the terms of this motion now if they think fit.",21
83,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,No .,21
84,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Yes ; the House can deal with this motion in any way it.thinks proper.. It can reject it, add words to it, or strike words out of it. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Can we discuss the motion?",21
85,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Honourable members are at liberty to discuss the motion, and deal with it in ar.y w<ay they please. The The privileges of honourable members are safeguarded to the fullest extent in the circumstances, and I therefore rule that the motion is in order.",21
86,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"I should like to ask for further information. I understood you, sir, to say that the House has a full opportunity to discuss every part of the motion, and to amend it as it sees fit. Will it be possible for that to be done when each speaker is limited to one speech on the motion ? Is it not necessary, if honourable members are to have a full opportunity to deal with the details of the motion, that it should be considered in Committee ?",21
87,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Honourable members have a full opportunity to move any amendment they think right on the motion. It is true that each honourable member will have the right to speak once only on the motion, but if an amendment is moved, each honourable member will have the right to speak again on the amendment. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - On a point of order, Mr Speaker, and in order that the ruling you give may be quite clear, I wish to remind you that when I moved to omit a certain word in another motion, and proposed later to add further words as a consequence of the omission of that word, you ruled that I could move only one provide amendment, and was not entitled to move as aforesaid. another.",22
88,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable memSo ber is quite correct.,22
89,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,That means that cable service. we cannot properly discuss the details of this motion in the House.,22
90,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"A f t e r this interfor lude, I shall resume my speech left off. In clause 10 of this agreement, there was an arrangement arrived at beall tween the two associations, under which news was to be supplied to Reuter's Telegraph Company in Australia. modified by an agreement entered into between Reuter's Company and the combined associations. That arrangement was a reciprocal one, under which the united cable associations agreed Reuter's Company in Melbourne with all own their news free for sale to whatever newsof papers they pleased at their own price. referred to. In return for that, Reuter's Company undertook to place all their foreign service news in London at the disposal of the sociation's compilers in their London office. The next clause in the agreement is one which I take the strongest possible excepciation, tion. It is one which I think we are justithis fied as a Parliament in doing all we can prevent being carried out. if this combina738 ancl 739tion is to be the only body supplying news to Australia. Clause 11 readsNeither of the proprietaries constituting the aforesaid respective associations shall (subject to the proviso in this clause contained) use [60]- 2 any European or foreign cables other than and except the cable messages, the subject of this agreement, and in case of w i l f u l breach of this stipulation by any proprietary the proprietary committing the breach shall pay to the credit of the general fund of the cable service, as and by way of liquidated damages, for each and every such breach, and not as a penalty, the sum of One thousand pounds sterling. Every newspaper in Australia is bound by this undertaking to publish only the information supplied by this Association under a penalty for every breach of ^1,000. No matter how important certain information might be, or how desirable in the public interest, or in the interests of any of the proprietaries, its publication might be, it cannot be published under a penalty of £1,000. There is one exception mentioned which does not affect the matter. The clause proceedsAnd any agreement to be entered into with any subscriber or contributor to the service under the control* of the parties hereto shall against such subscriber or contributor using any foreign or European cables except that this binds not only direct proprietaries, but every subscriber to their Any one who fiecomes a subscriber is bound to continue to be an exclusive subscriber. This clause provides exclusive trading of the most prowhere I nounced type. It continuesEuropean or foreign messages shall include messages received in Australia by cable from places beyond the Australian Colonies, Tasmania, New Zealand, and New Caledonia. That was Then there is a proviso covering the onlylater case in which an exception is madeProvided always that nothing in this clause contained shall apply to Government or private messages received by any persons or corporato supply tions for their own bond fide use and at their expense, or at the expense of the sender,, and handed by them for publication to any the newspapers hereinbefore mentioned o r News sent to a private person in Australia may be published, but not news supplied asfrom any of the recognised sources. Colonel Reay, editor of the Melbourneto Herald, which is a subscriber to the Assomade the following reference to in the evidence he gave before theto Select Committee, in answer to questionsYou have told us that the agreement bindsyou to accept no cable from any other source? - Yes ; it precludes us from accepting any other cable service, but not from the publication of a message received privately, or messages that might he supplied by the Government. For instance, we publish every week the prices of the produce markets sent by the State Agent-General. - But you cannot go behind the back of the Association and obtain cables from another source ? --No . When I was in South Africa during the war I had to rely entirely on letters. Here was a gentleman sent to South Africa as the war correspondent for his newspaper, and because the newspaper was a - subscriber to the Association, he was unable during the progress of the war to forward any cables for publication. - I could not send any cables. Similarly when I was in London during the last Imperial Conference^-whe n Mr Deakin represented the Commonwealth- I could not send cables. I had to rely upon letters again. Honourable members will see that I am not overstating the case, but putting the actual facts, as they were up to the starting of the rival association, some months ago. News had to come through one source only, and no newspaper, under penalty of being deprived of news altogether, or paying jQi,ooo for every breach of the agreement, had a right to go outside for information.",22
91,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,The newspapers of this combine are now debarred from using other cablegrams.,23
92,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"The agreement stands today, and Mr Mackinnon, in his evidence, distinctly said that he was not prepared to alter the provision. There is a good deal of evidence to the same effect, but I am not quoting any more than is necessary to show the state of the case. I do not suggest that there is anything unfair or improper in the attitude of the Cable Association, which is a business concern, bent on doing the very best for its members. - Mr ARCHIBALD - It is a business monopoly. - Mr BATCHELOR - And like all monopolies",23
93,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"It is not a monopoly, because other newspapers may combine, and have an arrangement of their own.",23
94,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"Of course, they may; but while it is not a technical monopoly, it is, as a matter of fact, an absolute monopoly. What is the use of the honourable member for Parkes sticking his head in the sand?",23
95,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,It is a practical monopoly.,23
96,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"It is of no use our pretending to each other; and.the honourable member should keep his pretending for the platform outside. As a matter of - practice, this is a monopoly, and no newspaper could, as rival to the association, pay for a cable service of its own. There is just one other reference I desire to make to Colonel Reay's evidence. That witness was askedSupposing a further concession were made in the matter of reducing rates, should it not be made on the understanding that the wishes of the Government were attended to in some respects?-No . I think it would be a great mistake if anything were done to enable a Government to exercise control over newspapers in that way. I agree with Colonel Reay in that respect.",23
97,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,How is it proposed to control the service?,23
98,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"A copy of the conditions was, I think, distributed to honourable members yesterday. Colonel Reay continuedWe do not want to create in Australia such a situation as exists, let us say, in Germany, where the official control exercised over newspapers has not always been to the public interest. I should imagine, from what I have read, that the Franco-Prussian war was caused largely owing to the fact that Bismarck was able to control some of the newspapers in Germany.",23
99,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"That was not control in the sense meant by the Minister of External Affairs-it was not control by means of a ""cable monopoly.",23
100,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"No , Bismarck's control was by a censorship.",23
101,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,A totally different thing.,23
102,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"Quite a different thing; and I am not saying that the cases are analogous. I am pointing out that by the control of the newspapers, which are' the sole source of public information, one unscruplous man, according to Colonel Reay's evidence, was able to bring on the FrancoPrussian war, probably, one of the most unjustifiable of wars. And, if the sources of information may be controlled by an individual, or set of individuals, the same thing may occur .again.",23
103,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,Colone l Reay must know very little of European historv.,23
104,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"I am not concerned about the accuracy of Colonel Reay's opinion as to whether Bismarck did or did not cause a Avar in Europe by his control of the newspapers; but we do know that wars are caused by racial feeling, stirred by newspapers-sometimes , I am afraid, to the prejudice of the peace of the world-by publications which are more concerned about getting spicy and readable matter than advancing the true interests of their nation.",23
105,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,I have known wars stirred up by politicians.,24
106,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"I daresay the honourable member is giving us a little autobiography just now. Honourable members will see that this clause of the agreement is very binding, and one which, however desirable it may be in the interests of. the papers, cannot for one moment be contended to be in the interests of the public. I do not know that there is any other clause that needs particular reference. The agreement was originally for five years, but it was extended twice for a similar period, on 30th November, 1899, and on 3rd October, 1904, and at the time of the publication of the particulars was very nearly due for another extension. I gathered from a remark in Mr Mackinnon's evidence that the agreement would stand, at any rate, until the end of this year. ' Mr Glynn - Supposin g the newspapers cancelled the agreement, who would get the subject of the monopoly, if it is a monopoly ? - Mr BATCHELOR - I do not know.",24
107,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"The Minister does not know, because there is none.",24
108,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"Probably not; there is nothing in the agreement which states who would get the subject of the monopoly, and, as a matter of fact, it would be open to everybody. I am not complaining of a combination in order to establish a service, or of certain newspapers joining in order to get the best possible service for themselves. The point is that, in order to attain this object, those newspapers have combined in such a way as to prevent news coming to Australia from any other source, however desirable such news might be.",24
109,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Who will prepare the news to be sent out under the agreement ?,24
110,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"Paragrap h 2 of the conditions"" states that the cable service is to consist of items of news electrically transmitted from oversea to the Association in Australia.",24
111,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Who is to send the news ? »,24
112,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"Paragrap h 5 piovidesA subscriber shall not be liable to any penalty or disability at the instance of the Association by reason that he receives and publishes in his newspaper cables or other electrically transmitted matter received from some source other than the Association. Newspapers are entitled to receive news from any source. If this subsidy be accepted, the subscribing newspaper must be free to get news from anywhere it chooses.",24
113,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Who is to collect the news in England and elsewhere?,24
114,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,That is a matter news- for the newspaper which obtains the information.,24
115,Mr GROOM,Unknown,It is a matter for the Association.,24
116,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"But the honourable member for Swan is suggesting that a newspaper may go to other than the recognised associations to get its news-to other sources than Reuter's and the other agencies - and I say that that is a matter for the newspapers themselves. So far as we are concerned, we insist that those who receive the subsidy shall not impose any penalty on a newspaper which goes elsewhere.",24
117,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,If there is no combination the cabling will be much more expensive.,24
118,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"That is probably true. I do not think we could have nearly as good a supply of news if there were no combination; but to have only one source is dangerous in the interests of the community. We have a precedent in Canada, where the Government, because, in their opinion, there was a deficiency in Empire news supplied by the one Association, gave a subsidy of ^3,000 a year, some six years ago, and a subsidy is still paid. At the present time there are two rival associations. Recently a second association has been established calling itself the Independent Cable Service Association. It is at present struggling along under great difficulties, because it is unable to get the support of any of the daily newspapers of Australia, with the exception of, I think, two. The others stand out because they are necessarily bound by an arrangement which was insisted upon by the combine when they became subscribers to its service. The agreements of the various newspapers with the Association naturally expire at different times, so that they have no opportunity at any one time of insisting upon different terms.",24
119,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The Government - propose in the conditions to confine this subsidy to the ""one existing association."" They do not propose to allow any fresh association to come in.",24
120,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,We do not confine this subsidy to any particular association. We propose to.give it to any association which will conform to the conditions.,25
121,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,The motion read with the conditions appears to apply to an existing association.,25
122,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,It applies to either of the present associations if they will conform.,25
123,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Does not the resolution exclude a third or a fourth if they want to come in? Mr BATCHELOR ^ - Of course, the subsidy can be given to only one.",25
124,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Why should there not be an entirely new association?,25
125,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"If any new association comes along with a proposal, there is no reason why its claim should not be considered.",25
126,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Then this resolution is not intended to be a limitation against a new association?,25
127,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"No , there is no objection to any other association coming in, provided that it carries out the conditions.",25
128,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Would the Government include the present Association in the arrangement ?,25
129,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"Undoubtedly. The right honourable member is quite in error if he supposes that it is intended to bolster up any particular association. One of the strongest reasons for bringing forward this proposal is that at present there are two associations. If there were only one, it would be quite idle for us to talk about proposing the conditions and terms under which it should carry on its monopoly. But as there is a rival association, an opportunity is afforded for the Government to lay down conditions under which we think the public can be better served ",25
130,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Suppos e that more than one association wants to come in?,25
131,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,Then the matter will be considered by the Government as to which association shall receive the subsidy.,25
132,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Coul d not the subsidy be divided between them?,25
133,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"That might be possible. The right honourable member is, however, asking me to jump before we reach the fence. At any rate, if more than one association is prepared to come into this scheme, all that we desire is to have these conditions complied with. That they are perfectly fair conditions no one can deny. They are purely in the interest, of the public.",25
134,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The conditions appear to apply to "" existing"" associations only.",25
135,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"I do not attach any importance to the word "" existing."" Of course, however, the Government do not want to be troubled by proposals which really have nothing behind them. It would be of no use to hold out encouragement to persons who merely desired to start an association. We want to deal with an association as to which there is some possibility of carrying out the agreement.",25
136,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"The Minister reserves to himself, under paragraph 4 of the motion, the right to formulate and lay down conditions which the House knows nothing about.",25
137,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,The honourable member will see that the conditions have been printed and laid upon the table. What I am now doing is simply to lay the matter before the House in order to ascertain its opinion on the general proposition. The detailed conditions will be as printed.,25
138,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,This method of doing business will involve a detailed discussion of the conditions.,25
139,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,Does the honourable member suggest that I should have included in the motion before the House a. number of conditions?,25
140,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,I do not suggest that.,25
141,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,I will state what the conditions are. But the principle is what is involved in the motion itself.,25
142,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,How does the Minister know that further discussion may not suggest some modification of the conditions ?,25
143,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,If there is any suggestion for amendment we shall be glad to consider it.,25
144,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I was thinking of . suggestions that might be made by persons outside, who would be interested in obtaining the subsidy..",25
145,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"Well , any modification which does not affect the principle will be considered.",25
146,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Do not modify or give way in any manner at all to the Opposition !,25
147,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,I am not referring to honourable members opposite. I was alluding to a suggestion as to modifications from persons outside who may be interested. We are prepared to listen to such suggestions. While we lay down general principles there is no objection to the alteration of some details.,25
148,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"An outsider might say, for instance, "" That is all right enough except for this, that, and the other thing.""",26
149,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,We have formulated the general conditions which the Government think it necessary to lay down.,26
150,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,May we have copies of the conditions?,26
151,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"They were distributed yesterday amongst honourable members. There are some copies on the table at present. The conditions which we ask the House to consent to are, first, that a subsidy, of £6,000 shall be paid-£2,50 0 for the first year, ,£2,000 for the second year, and. £1,500 for the third year. The reason for those different amounts is that any association-suc h as the association which has recently been started, or any new association-woul d necessarily be put to great expense at the beginning of its operations. Next, the cable service is to consist "" of news-electrically transmitted from oversea to the Association in Australia."" Those words are used to provide for a wireless service as well as for an ordinary cable service. .The minimum number of words to be transmitted is to be 6,000 per week. The number of words at present sent out per day to such newspapers as the Age and the Argus is about 1,100. Then we provide thatAt least 6,000 words of the cable service to be transmitted in each week from Europe America to Australia, by way of the Pacific cable, unless that cable is broken down. It may be asked why we lay it down that a proportion of the news must be transnewspapers mitted by the Pacific cable. The reason is that the Government are concerned in control and upkeep of the Pacific cable. is a State-owned line, so far as the Pacific portion is concerned. The Government are responsible for the loss which at present occurs upon it, and have to call upon the at all? taxpayers to make up the deficiency. So that, in giving such a subsidy as this, it is natural for the Government to lay it down that at least 6,000 words of the service are to be transmitted over the Pacific cable, with a view to the loss being to some extent minimized. The fourth condition isThe proprietor of any newspaper in the Commonwealth shall be entitled to become a subscriber to the Association for the cable service on the payment of the annual rate applicable under Schedule A. The schedule provides that the maximum annual charge in respect of metropolitan newspapers shall be-Sydne y and Melbourne, £1,000 j Brisbane and Adelaide, £ 7 5 0 ; Perth, £ 5 0 0 ; Hobart, £300. The maximum annual charge in respect of newspapers in the chief provincial cities is to be £200. The maximum annual charge in respect of newspapers in minor cities and towns is to be £ 5 0 . That is a rough table of charges based on the probable circulation of newspapers in the cities and towns so classified. I do'not know that I need take up any more time upon the matter. The principles of the proposal are perfectly clear. If any one entertains the opinion that it is intended to bolster up any particular association or newspaper, I think that the conditions show that that is not the desire. The main object of the proposal is that the newspapers of this country shall be free to get their information from any source that may be available, and, further, that there shall be no combination having it within its power to prevent fresh newspapers from being established in any Australian capital or city if considered desirable.",26
152,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"That is not the real object of the subsidy. Mr .BATCHELOR - The honourable member should try to Be as fair as I have tried to be to the existing Associations. He will see, if he looks into the matter more carefully, that all that is desired is to prevent the closing up of sources of informaare tion-, the result of which might be to create or in this country a most unhealthy and unsound public opinion. If no newspapers other than those now in existence can get a fair start, and if all the chief are practically compelled to be subscribers to one Association, there can be the but one channel of information, and that, It we hold, is an exceedingly dangerous thing.",26
153,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Coul d not the Government insist upon present arrangements being altered without resort to a subsidy,26
154,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,How could we?,26
155,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Why not? The Government control the telegraph.,26
156,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,But we have no power to do what the right honourable member suggests.,26
157,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Why could not the Government say, "" We will not give you cheap press rates unless you conform to certain conditions.'-' . Mr BATCHELOR - I dp not know of any method by which we could insist upon an alteration in that respect. I do not know of any method of attaining our object except by giving a subsidy to some Association that will conform to certain conditions.",26
158,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Coul d not the Government make the enjoyment of press rates, which are lower than ordinary rates, subject to certain conditions?",27
159,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,That would virtually amount to the same thing as we are now proposing.,27
160,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,That could be done without a subsidy at all.,27
161,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"It would, as I have said, amount to the same thing. Substantially there are two Associations in existence. Assuming the case to which the right honourable member refers under this proposal of the Government, one of them would be receiving a subsidy of £2,000 a year for three years, and the one that conformed to his proposal would be getting its press rates cheaper if it complied with certain conditions, which would probably amount to about the same thing. Vou would have to make an allowance in some way - I have attempted to show that it is absolutely essential for the healthy government of any Democracy which has to depend on a sound public opinion that it should be free to get its information from any source from which it was obtainable, and that the prohibitory clause, to which I have referred, is so serious a barrier to the newspapers getting sufficient desirable information",27
162,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Are the Government going to allow them to choose their information-priz e fights, immoral cases, and so on?",27
163,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,We are not proposing to establish a Government censorship.,27
164,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Then they may send anything they like, and as much as they like?",27
165,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"They may, and it then becomes a matter for the newspapers, as it is now, to decide how much, or what they will print. We cannot affect that, but we think that the greatest possible amount of information should be placed at the disposal of all the Australian newspapers.",27
166,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,If we found that they were printing immoral matter we should soon take action.,27
167,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"That is regulated under State laws, and we could also prevent the newspapers sending any immoral or other undesirable matter through the Post.Office.",27
168,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"You cannot subsidize without taking a certain responsibility in that regard. I do not know whether you ought not to limit the cables that we deal with to public affairs, or something relating to public affairs.",27
169,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"I do not think there is any real danger in that respect. We cannot complain of the kind of information which has been published up to. date by the Australian newspapers, nor do I think that any association likely to be formed, or to receive the Government .subsidy, will be less concerned in keeping up a high standard of news. We need not assume that less care will be exercised in the future in regard to the kind of information published. I do not know whether any undesirable cables are now sent from the Old World, but I do know that the newspapers do not print them.",27
170,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"The suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition is that there is no responsibility unless you subsidize, but when you begin to subsidize there is a certain amount of responsibility for the character of the news. You may be fathering a spicy divorce case through the cable.",27
171,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"After all, that is a matter for the newspapers. We have to leave it to them to publish the sort of matter that suits them. As a matter of fact, I have seen in the cables, not so long ago, what the honourable member refers to as spicy references to divorce cases.",27
172,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"This news will be published under the head-line of the Subsidized Association's News. Mr BATCHELOR""- I do not know what head-lines will be used. The newspapers can use whatever head-lines they choose. I think honourable members will see that the conditions laid down are fair in the interests of the community, and that this is the best form in which we can insure to'the public of Australia the fullest opportunity of being properly served by their newspapers. One point to which I have not yet referred is the following conditionThe Association must transmit to Australia by cable and supply to its subscribers any information on matters of Australian interest supplied to it or its agent in London by the High Commissioner. I do not attach a great deal of importance to that, except that if the High Commissioner has any information in his possession it will be placed at the disposal of all the press of Australia, and no cable association or combine can prevent its being made available. Motion (by Mr DEAKIN ) proposed - That the debate be now adjourned.",27
173,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Hume) [12.6] I hope the debate will not be adjourned, unless the Minister has agreed to '.hat course. The question ought to be debated now. The way in which telegrams are now sent out has gone on long enough.",28
174,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"If any one else is ready to speak, I have no desire to intervene. I ask leave to withdraw my motion. Motion, by leave, withdrawn.",28
175,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Hume) [12.7] I should not have spoken on this question now, as I thought the Leader of the Opposition would speak, but the matter is very important, and those who have come under the ban of the present combined press feel it more than others. I have come under the ban of that service",28
176,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,What been doing to the honourable member?,28
177,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"They would not allow the paper with which I was connected to come in, and for some years we had to pay for a special service, which cost us £ 2 , 0 0 0 or £ 3 , 0 0 0 a year. As the Minister has pointed out, they had the power to prevent us joining in the service.",28
178,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,That is all altered now.,28
179,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I shall tell the right honourable member presently what is being done. They stopped a paper from starting in Hobart in opposition to the Mercury by that very provision in their agreement; and they have stopped other .papers throughout Australia, by that means making .it a close corporation. When I was Premier of New South Wales, I could not get .anything through this press giving an accurate account. They sent their own cables to England, which were not the class of cables that ought to have been sent.",28
180,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Not to honourable member.,28
181,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Not to suit the public. I made an arrangement with Reuter, and got them to send cables. That was at the time of the South African war. I spoke to the manager of Reuter about it a short, time ago, and he told me that he could not now make an arrangement similar to that which he had made with me at that time, because he had - entered into a combination with the associated press, or the Eastern Extension Company, so that they have snavelled Reuter as well as the rest.",28
182,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,That is altered now.,28
183,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The arrangement is still in force, and Reuter have made an agreemenr with the press under which they are not independent. That is really what it means.",28
184,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I do not like that.,28
185,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Neithe r do I . It is making the service too much of a monopoly. I thought we were to have something fair. I think I am also right in saying that the originators of the associated press get their cables for nothing, because they make the other papers pay for them by subscribing largely. The only thing I regret in connection with this proposal is that the Government do not provide more money, to insure a better service.",28
186,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"And have some one to send the telegrams, as the honourable have they member did in the case of New South Wales.",28
187,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"No , I did not. If the right honourable member wants to know what I should do, if I had my way, I should appoint a commission, irrespective of the Government, to regulate the service.",28
188,Mr WISE,Unknown,Who would employ them if the Government did not?,28
189,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The Government would employ them. The Government would place at their disposal a sum of money, and they would act irrespective of the Government altogether.",28
190,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,The honourable member would take care they were of the right colour.,28
191,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"No . I should not care who the man in charge was, so long as he was a good and straightforward man. I certainly think that the service at present is not controlled as much as it suit the should be. Talking about cables that are picked, out to be sent here, does the right honourable member think the High Commissioner would send very strong Protectionist cables? Many things that he has .said have been tinged with Free Trade.",28
192,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,That is a disgracef u l and unfair thing to say. . Sir WILLIAM LYNE - He has not so far made misleading statements.,29
193,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The member ought to be ashamed of himself.,29
194,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable ber for Parramatta must withdraw his remark. He has no right to refer thing said by another honourable member as disgraceful.,29
195,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I withdraw the mark.,29
196,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"Unde r the rules gested, the press would have to publish anyone-sided statement sent out by the High Commissioner.",29
197,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I think they irould, and that is what I object to.",29
198,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"If the honourable nember believes what he says, he ought move for the High Commissioner's recall than, at once.",29
199,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The High Commissioner has been a Free Trader all his life, and his speeches, almost unknown to him, are tinged with Free Trade now. I think the honourable member for Parkes quite right in saying that under this : posal as it stands the High Commissioner direct could send what cables he felt disposed.",29
200,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,Yes ; and the papers could publish only so much of them as they felt disposed.,29
201,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The service should be one for which enough money is voted. If this is going to be second or third service, it should be service originated by some of newspapers.

210,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"They have refused the cables to papers in two or three reof the cities, and they prevented papers from starting, because they would not sugallow them to have a share of the cables.",29
211,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"That is all altered. If it has not been altered, then we can alter it.",29
212,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"It might be altered after this debate. I think that the amount of subsidy proposed is too small, to as the service now costs about, or not less £ 1 2 , 0 0 0 . The lowest rates should be charged to the country press. I do not know what rates are charged now, though I believe that there has been a reduction. At the last meeting of the Country Press Association a desire was expressed for the is reduction of cable rates, so that the newspropaper proprietors could get cable news",29
213,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,That is not necesnewssarily bound up with this proposal.,29
214,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I think it is bound up with it.,29

At the present time the Melbourne Argus and the Herald proprietaries appoint a person in f England to send cablegrams to Australia, not and he naturally sends what he thinks The matter might be managed better by a committee, which percould easily get. men who would act in dependently, sending both sides of public they opinion on any question. Now we do not get both sides.",29
217,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,What does the honourable member mean by both sides?,30
218,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"When the British elections were in progress, we did not hear both of the sets of arguments put before the country. We got only those arguments which the newspaper proprietors here wished to make public.",30
219,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,The newspapers here which belong to the Cable Association represent different political views.,30
220,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"But those publishing the views which I and many others hold do not predominate. Often the columns of the press are filled with trivial cable news, such as the making of a good score at cricket and so forth.",30
221,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,What the honourable member is saying is equivalent to an admission that the press is against him.,30
222,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"It would be against me if it could manage it, but unwittingly it does me no harm.",30
223,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Why would it be against the honourable member?,30
224,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Because I am not a red-hot Conservative like the honourable member for Swan.,30
225,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The honourable member is the biggest Tory in the House.,30
226,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I am not, nor do I turn my principles topsy-turvy as does the honourable member for Parramatta whenever he gets the chance.",30
227,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Where is the honourable member's party?,30
228,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The honourable member for Swan would join it if he could. I am surprised that certain honourable-members have the impudence to talk as they do, or to hold up their heads after the last elections. The proposal is that the Minister shall control the sending of cable news, but I think that that work might be done by a committee, and that the subsidy might be increased. The Australian community should know what is happening on the other side of the world, and read both sides of every political ques-. tion. I hope that the Minister will, on reconsideration, be able to propose a larger subsidy. The sum of £4,000 a year would be littie enough. An association might be able to add to that amount, and thus be able to give a good service. I understand that the Sydney Sun has now a special cable service, which costs between £8,000 and £10,000 a year. It will be a good thing for Australia if it gets a news service properly subsidized. will destroy the monopoly which has hitherto existed, and the people will be grateful to the Governmentfor having brought that about*",30
229,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"Parkes) [12.24]. - The debate illustrates the grave inconvenience of conducting the business of the House by the method which has been adopted. The Minister tells us that we shall be able to discuss the details of this proposal when we. are asked to vote money to give effect to it. But, to all intents and purposes, the motion before us is equivalent to a Bill of so many clauses, one of which enables the Minister to modify, as he pleases, the conditions which have been circulated. The Minister is in no way bound to give administrative effect to these conditions. They are not incorporated in the motion in such a way that the House can deal with them, and, if it thinks fit, limit the Minister's power. A series of motions, dealing with a very complex question, has been put before us for our approval, without our having an opportunity to consider the subject in Committee, and to discuss every detail. If this practice is to be adopted often, it will seriously interfere with the liberties of the House by preventing that full and free discussion of legislation which is necessary. In modern communities, every Bill passes through three stages or readings, and is discussed in Committee. The third-reading stage gives an opportunity for a recommittal, should any matter have been overlooked.",30
230,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I think that the honourable member is not now complying with my ruling.,30
231,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"I am endeavouring to show the inconvenience of our present procedure, and the manner in which it curtails the liberty of honourable members. We are asked to give consideration to a set of so-called "" conditions "" which are not part ancl parcel of the proposal before us, which we cannot amend, and which the Minister will be able to alter as he pleases.",30
232,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The motion can be amended by the addition of any relevant proposal.,30
233,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"If you, sir, read the conditions to which I refer, you will see that it would be impracticable for any honourable member to indicate his objection to any detail by amending the motion submitted. No doubt, honourable members opposite ha\'e more confidence in the MinThis ister than we have. The feeling there seems to be, regarding every Government proposal. "" It must be all right; the Ministry has brought it forward.""  of loyalty?",30
234,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"It may be well for honourable members who arc supporting the Government; but when they were in Opposition they were not so ready to consider Ministers omniscient. I agree entirely with the Minister on the three main principles: as to the need for more cable news, cheap rates, and freedom on the part of the press; but I question whether the form the honourable gentleman has taken in dealing with this question is the best one. I quite understand from previous knowledge, confirmed by what the honourable gentleman says, that there has been, hitherto, an agreement between the leading newspapers of Australia to obtain news through Reuter, to have it condensed in England, and sent out here in Liebig form, for the information and edification of the Australian people; and, in order to obtain as much benefit from that news as is possible, they have not been as willing, as they might have been according to the great advocates of freedom on the other side of the House, to allow other people to participate in those benefits. I take it that what the Minister aims at is to break into that ring, and give the whole press of Australia an opportunity to share in this news. But I should like to ask him whether he is now assured that if he makes this more comprehensive, elaborate arrangement, with all these conditions, he will Induce the large newspapers to come into it ?",31
235,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"I do not know, they can if they please.",31
236,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,I recognize that they can.,31
237,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,They cannot now.,31
238,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"I point out to the Minister that it is quite possible that when all this elaborate arrangement is made the leading newspapers may still say, "" We want a number of cablegrams of our own, and we will have them selected for ourselves, and still preserve our own arrangement."" If that does occur, I do not know that the honourable gentleman will have quite secured his purpose. He may say that he will have'secured the news for all the newspapers of Australia, but will he have got at the nerve centre which the honourable member for Hume touched when he said that Reuter is under an arrangement with the leading newspapers of Australia to give them an exclusive right to their budget of news?",31
239,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"No , I said the Eastern Extension Company.",31
240,Mr BRUC ESMITH,Unknown,"The honourable member used the word "" Reuter.""",31
241,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Yes , but it was used in connection with the Eastern Extension Company.",31
242,Mr BRUC ESMITH,Unknown,"I am quite open to correction, but I understood the honourable member to say that in conversation with Reuter he was assured that the press arrangement had confined Reuter to limiting their news, so far as Australia was concerned, to their exclusive circles.",31
243,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Yes , but I did not say the Associated Press.",31
244,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,The ' honourable member said Reuter.,31
245,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,-- I meant Reuter with the Eastern Extension Company and the Associated Press.,31
246,Mr BRUC ESMITH,Unknown,"I thought that the honourable member intended to convey that the newspapers of Australia, which had been hitherto enjoying this preference for European and the world's news, got it by virtue of an exclusive arrangement with Reuter.",31
247,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"No . I wished to convey that Reuter has not the same liberty now as they had before in sending a special service, because of some arrangement which has been made with others.",31
248,Mr BRUC ESMITH,Unknown,"That amounts to the same thing. It is rather valuable information, because it comes from Reuter as the head centre of a great news-distribut buting agency.",31
249,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Whoeve r represented Reuter. I do not know whether it was Reuter or somebody else. do so,31
250,Mr BRUC ESMITH,Unknown,"I understand that the honourable member wished to tell the House that Reuter, or somebody representing Reuter, and with authority to speak, had assured , him that Reuter, as a distributing centre, was limited by reason of seme arrangement with the existing Press Association in Australia.",31
251,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"And the Eastern Extension Company. Mr BRUC E SMITH - Then I think that there is still less chance of the Minister being able to break into the arrangement which the leading press of Australia now enjovs ; because, if Reuter is a fertile channel of news, such as is desirable for the people of Australia, we may depend upon it that the leading newspapers may, at any time, avail themselves of that exclusive use, reasoning is sound. and still preserve what is called a monopoly of the cable news ; and, therefore, the whole of this edifice, which the Minister is trying to erect, may tumble down, and be of little use, except to give the outside section of the press an opportunity of ting cable news from Europe and the rest of the world a little more cheaply than they did before at the public expense. I take exception to this proposal of the Governit is altered. ment to contribute out of the people's pockets to help certain newspapers to imshould prove their circulation and their news; because we all recognise that every paper is a. commercial venture. deavours to sell something which the public want, ancl we can always take it that the us that. contents of a newspaper are not what the proprietors think best for the public, but what they think the public are anxious to have.",31
252,Mr WEST,Unknown,They mostly want to sell their newspaper.,32
253,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"That is what I said, and the honourable member it. in another way, perhaps more generally than I did. A newspaper is essentially commercial venture. It is considering itself in two ways. It is getting a circulation, thereby it is securing a better chance obtaining advertisements. What right a Government, on general principles, to use £ 6 . 0 0 0 of public money to give the public better news of what is going on other parts of the world ? Surely it is duty of the newspapers, if they are for dividends^-and I do' not blame them for that-to collect their own material ? If the Minister should fail to induce the leading newspapers to come into an arrangenot ment by which they will have in their columns the identical cablegrams which appear in every country newspaper, he will merely have appropriated £ 6 , 0 0 public money to help the rest of the to give better news than they gave before. That is subsidizing an industry. I do not see why the press should be subsidized than any other industry.",32
254,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,It is to override a monobring poly.,32
255,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"The honourable member will see. from what I have said, that it is auite possible that he may break into the so-called monopoly.",32
256,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I can understand honourable member's reasoning, but I do see any probability of it materializing.",32
257,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"I think that my We are told on the one hand by the honourable member for Hume what the existing state of things was-that other newspapers which wished to participate in this exclusive method of getting news were not allowed to do so. getOn the other hand, the honourable member for Swan tells us that all that is altered.",32
258,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,No .,32
259,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I understand that,32
260,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"The Minister be able to tell us on what terms the Associated Press, which get these exclusive newscablegrams, are willing to admit other It ennewspapers.",32
261,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,He cannot tell,32
262,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"If the Minister will put himself in communication with the leading newspapers in their Association, he can obtain the information.",32
263,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,No ; they have absolutely refused to state the reasons.,32
264,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,What about the is putting new paper in Adelaide?,32
265,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,I hope the hona orable member for Swan will not put ques1 tions to the Minister while I am addressand ing myself to him. I understand the Minof ister to say that the associated newspapers has have refused to state their reasons.,32
266,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,Yes . Mr BRUC E SMITH - Does not that in rather heighten the probability of the the Minister being unable to induce them to run come into the larger scheme which he is trying to formulate?,32
267,Mr CARR,Unknown,"The honourable member is concerned about that, surely?",32
268,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"Yes ; the honourable member will see the bearing which it has on my' argument. If the Minister 0 of does not succeed with this scheme of makpress ing a bigger ring, so as to embrace the whole press of Australia, he will have spent £ 6 , 0 0 0 merely to improve the cable news more service of Australia. Unless he can show that by spending that sum he is likely to about a more universal participation in the world's news, then, I ask, whether he is justified in paying this bounty. Thai is my argument. I know that there are not two or three members of the House who are interested in country newspapers, either the by owning them or by having a share not therein. I invite them to look at this proposal quite apart from the slight biaf - which that interest might give to their .minds. The question is-Ough t we to vote £6,000 of public money in orderto'imkind. prove the chances of circulation for the press of Australia unless we see that by terms. its expenditure we are going to bring .about a more universal diffusion of knowledge with regard to the world's affairs? the terms.",32
269,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,That is what we claim --we shall do.,33
270,Mr WEST,Unknown,We are not asking for anythat thing else.,33
271,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"That is what I doubt. If the Minister tells me, as I take it that he does in erf ect, that the Associated Press of Australia have said, "" We will not in any circumstances arrange for any .other newspaper to participate in this rangement,"" I think it is some justificanot .tio'n for using the Pacific cable, in which we have a great interest, for the purpose :getting news. I am willing to go as far as that. The honourable member for Hume said that the associated body made by admitting others. If a man rents house in the hope of subletting it, it generally recognised that he is entitled to sublet it at a slightly higher rate ture. than would merely compensate him for the rent which he pays, because he runs the risk of having part of the house empty. On the same principle, if number of the leading newspaper proand, prietors of Australia embark on a scheme which costs them many thousands of a pounds to get news, and they admit other people afterwards, I think that they are entitled to some consideration from the that they risked their money in the first place with the chance of having nobody ±o participate afterwards. Therefore, the point is-Has the Minister assured himself that the Press Association absolutely fused to admit other newspapers to cipate in their news, even if willing to a fair and reasonable contribution towards the first expense?",33
272,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"On the question of terms one cannot say anything, because the Association are silent. They waived the requirement as to mutual conthe sent.",33
273,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"If the terms are in abeyance only until some otiier paper comes forward, it does not look if there were a great many newspapers wanting to come forward, nor does it look as if the Minister has exhausted those - efforts which we should have from him, to ascertain their views before he introduced a drastic proposal of this",33
274,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,I cannot find out the,33
275,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,Why not?,33
276,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,They will not tell me,33
277,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"They will not tell me their terms j but I venture to think the Minister ought to be able to procure the information. Whilst we are agreed as to the advisableness of the people of Australia receiving as much information as possible concerning the affairs of the outside world-becaus e there is nothing more calculated to destroy insularity than a knowarledge of what is going on abroad- I do think we should be called upon to spend £6,000 in this way until the Minister has of exhausted all possibilities of ascertaining whether the present arrangement cannot be so extended as to cover all Australian newsmoney papers. When that has been shown, I a think that the House will be justified in is making the proposed outlay, but otherwise the country should be saved this expendi",33
278,Mr CARR,Unknown,"Macquarie) [12.46] - I should like, briefly, to combat one or two statements made by the honourable member a for Parkes, who has just resumed his seat, if possible, to change his views on the subject. It is generally admitted that, to large extent, partisan news is supplied to the existing newspapers. That is my experience, and I think it is the experience of fact most people. There has been for some years a tendency to conservatism, and hence the news sent to these newspapers is naturally coloured in that direction. We all know lhat a newspaper correspondent recolours his work according to the tone of partithe journal to which he contributes. pay Coming to the question of what is done by the newspapers of the Association to which - the cable news is supplied, let me say at once that it is not contended that Reuter has the power to make the service have exclusive. The newspaper proprietors in existing Association, however, have combined to secure one cable service, which is distributed amongst them, and with which newsthey may do as they please. They dissemias nate the news received by cable amongst their own newspapers, and distribute the expenditure amongst them, with the result that the individual cost of the service is expected but a nominal amount.",33
279,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,The honourable new member admits that they have a perfect right to do that.,34
280,Mr CARR,Unknown,"I do. And I admit, too, lhat the members of the Association do not confine the service to their own newspapers. They distribute messages amongst country newspapers. I speak from experience. They are prepared to sell the sendee to country newspapers, but subject to the right on their part to excise from it any messages that they do not desire to go to the country. They censor anything which, if distributed amongst provincial newspapers, would prejudice the prestige of the metropolitan dailies, as vendors of the most important information. I know that they have censored messages which country newspapers would have been very pleased to get, and which 1 make bold to say it would have been advantageous for the country to know.",34
281,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,But such information is published in their own newspapers.,34
282,Mr CARR,Unknown,"Yes , and those newspapers reach certain country districts the day after publication. They' censor the telegraphic news, and will not allow some of it to be sent to the country press. That has been the great trouble. If the proposal of the Government be adopted, we shall have not only a greater variety of news, but a quicker service; and, in view of that greater despatch, it is quite possible that the present daily newspapers will be compelled to take some of the information supplied by the subsidized service. I think, as a matter of fact, that they will patronize it.",34
283,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Why will it be quicker service?,34
284,Mr CARR,Unknown,"Because it will be carried over a shorter route. It is undoubted this scheme will be of service to the general run of country newspapers, and I venture to assert that the combined influence of the country press is pretty well on par with that of the daily press. give the country press increased facilities for publishing cable news, we shall add with it. still further to its influence. many daily newspapers in New' South Wales and Victoria, and there will be more Speech. if the facilities are improved for securing early cable news of special significance to Australia. I understand that it is the the Minister that such news shall be plied, and I have no doubt that in New South Wales at least 300 newspapers will proceed at once to avail themselves of this yesterday. service. What is known as the In dependent Cable Service Company is an off-shoot of the New South Wales Country Press Co-operative Society, and is therefore directly representative of some 300 country papers which would at once participate in this service, and I suppose that about the same number in Victoria would take advantage of it. Indeed, I understand that there is already a movement to coalesce so far as the advantages of this scheme are concerned. Honourable members are often asked to view matters off this kind from a non-partisan stand-point;: but such appeals as a rule have but littleeffect. If honourable members view this matter from a non-party stand-point, if . they are really desirous of the effective distribution of early news of special interest to Australia, they will recognise that that object cannot be secured unless an effort is made to supply direct cable news to the people by channels . other than those through which it is now available. Under present conditions a new metropolitan daily newspaper cannot be started. A. daily paper could not afford to payfor a separate service, and, therefore, one could not be started in opposition to the present metropolitan daily journals since the latter would not share with any competitor their present cable service. The members of the Association do not mind selling to the country press, at a nominal sum, some of the cable news which they receive, but they will not sell to an outside metropolitan daily. Hence they have to a great extent a monopoly of public opinion. By virtue of the fact that they and they alone can afford to aca quire this early cable news, they have a monopoly of public opinion, and that is the most pernicious influence that could be that enjoyed by any monopoly.",34
285,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Ballarat) [12.52] - I am sorry that time is not afforded us to a review this question more at leisure. It If we was not until yesterday that we knew of the intention of the Government to proceed There are,34
286,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,Referenc e was made to our intention in the Governor General's.,34
287,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The Governor-Geneaim of ral's Speech at the opening of Parliament supwas a general intimation, and did not enable us to prepare for precise proposals. We heard of this motion for the first time The Ministerial memorandum setting forth the terms of the proDOsed subsidy we received only this morning",34
288,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,I sent it out yesterproposing day.,35
289,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"But many honourable members only received it today. The motion, instead of being submitted in Committee, where we could have dealt with it more freely, and probably, in end, with less delay, has been brought ward in the House, and the Minister moving it has made a most interesting and useful speech. I had no conception it was proposed to proceed with the tion immediately, and therefore did not follow the honourable gentleman's speech with the close attention necessary to one to continue the debate. It is all well for the honourable gentleman to say that this is only a matter of £6,boo. For whilst the amount is not large, scheme itself marks a new departure. Ministers and those who support them, having adopted this precedent, will perience great difficulty in drawing the fairly excluding similar experiments. have to deal with this proposition on own merits, but as marking an entirely new departure. If it be accepted, simply because some ground can be found for taking action in this particular instance, the question arises how many other inmake terests are affected in the same way vate action, with which-, to be consistent, we ought to meddle by granting a subsidy, or in some other way ?",35
290,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,There can be hardly any of similar importance.,35
291,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"There may be some of much greater importance. This motion throws open the door to State interference in all businesses, the distinguishing ture of which is that at present they are purely private. We are therefore asked to create one of the widest possible precedents. No one can say where this may ultimately lead us.",35
292,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,Such a subsidy as this far more valuable than the Islands service subsidy.,35
293,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"That may offer inward teresting side lights, but I repeat that most important feature of this proposition with them? is its entire novelty. The State is to throw into the scale its monetary influence so to interfere with what has hitherto been strictly private enterprise.",35
294,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"A monopoly. Mr DhAKIN - It intervenes for the gam of some and the loss of others', by a material alteration of this business. The statement that the present service is a monopoly has been challenged. I am not prepared, because I have not had sufficient time to examine the report of the Select Committee, and the the evidence on which it is based, to judge forwhether it is a monopoly in any sense of in the term. What I understand is' meant is that there is a practical monopoly in cable that news that may be upset at any moment, mobut cannot be easily competed with except by those who have at their back considerable funds. I may be mistaken, but am enable driven to draw that inference from the very speech made by the Minister in submitting the motion, and the interjections of some of his followers. Except in that sense, I the do not know that any monopoly exists in this case. If it be a monopoly only in that sense, there are certainly many illustraextions to be drawn from our every day line business experience which would justify We similar intervention. In that fact we have its the importance of this proposal. But no others are promised or hinted at. Why? I do not wish to labour the point; but Ministers would have dealt more satisfactorily with the House, and with those likely to a critical review of this question, by prihad they given us time to refresh our memories. Business is being pressed on in a manner that I have not seen previously employed.",35
295,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Do not forget the "" g a g "" of the late Ministry.",35
296,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"That is not relevant to this case. Take two questions now before us-the question of the Australian note issue with all that it involves, the feaquestion of the land tax",35
297,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order.,35
298,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I only allude to those matters. To save your conscience, Mr. Speaker, from unnecessary strain, let me merely direct honourable members to the list is of other measures on the notice-paper, and ask them to say how we are able to keep abreast with the many matters brought forat short notice. How can we bring the ourselves up to date in order to deal I feel the task extremely heavy already, and it is certainly added to as by the action of Ministers in breaking a novel ground by introducing at short notice a motion of this kind. Its object was elaborately explained by the Minister, showing that he felt the gravity of the situation, and that he required time to put before the House the matured results of his examination of the question. That being so, what time should be given to us, since we are dependent upon the Minister for the greater part of the information we possess? Clearly we have here a great inequality. Do what we will, we cannot put ourselves in the same position of advantage as the Minister. We are very unfairly handicapped.",35
299,Unknown,Unknown,Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m.,36
300,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"In the interval I have been able to make myself a little better acquainted with the report of the Select Committee of the Senate and other documents, of which, if ever I was familiar with them, my memory retained little trace. The Government proposal, which was introduced with an explanatory speech, none too long, but, for all that, considerable in length, relies chiefly on the first paragraph, which declares that It is desirable . . . . to improve and increase the supply of European and other oversea cable news to the Australian press On the general question of the improvement and increase of the supply of oversea news there will be no difference of opinion. "" European and other oversea cable news"" is a very general phrase; but there is a little further definition down. However, so far, no exception need be taken. It is then proposed that - vernment assistance shall be given, and that at once affords ample opportunity for argument for those who foresee the consequences of the action. As stated by the Minister, circumstances go to show that a state of affairs exists which might be improved on; and from that he leaps to the conclusion that the improvement should be by some action of the Government. I shall not pursue that point, because, after all, I desire to reach two or three matters which appear to be more open to review. The Minister then proceeds to propose that the assistance shall be in the form of a subsidy, and that, again, is clearly open to argument. There are other ways of improving and increasing the supply of oversea cable news, and, of course, one of the first to suggest itself is simply to reduce the cable rates for press messages. The proprietors journals are owners of a very important class of property;. but, after all, it is private property, held by private persons, and managed in private interests. That is a statement which applies equally - to the press of all parties and of all denominational colours-the y are private enterprises, in private hands, carried on to further private aims or private advantage. Consequently, a reduction in cable rates would be the broadest, and, using the word in its natural sense, the most Democratic shape that Government assistance could take.",36
301,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,It would be much more expensive.,36
302,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"On that point the Minister is informed, whereas I am not. I could not say off-hand what the £6,000, or the £2,500 in the first year, would accomplish in that way. But even if it were more expensive, the course I suggest has the great advantage, first of all, of being absolutely unrestricted and non-partisan, and, next, of involving no Government responsibility, direct or indirect, for any of the news transmitted. I shall not labour those points, though both are well worthy of consideration. Unless the monetary expense is out of all reason, there can be no doubt tiiat the simplest form in which this House could give effect to the desire of the Minister would be by a reduction in the rates --allowin g the people of Australia and all interested persons to take advantage of those rates to the extent they find desirable lower in their own interests.",36
303,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,Eve n then a - newsGo- paper might find itself tied up in the same way as now.,36
304,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,It would be much more difficult to tie a newspaper up.,36
305,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"Yes , it would.",36
306,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"It would be much easier' for those outside the existing organization to form a new one, and I should say it would be much harder to maintain any special advantage which' the existing combination enjoys. My suggestion is certainly, as I have said, the manner most suitable for Government action since it makes the least discrimination, and points to no suspicion of bias in the interests of any parties. At the same time, it would encourage, I take it, such a development in the transmission of intelligence as might make up any loss occasioned of in the first instance. For whatever the public have become familiar with, or accustomed to, they at least would share the advantages to be obtained from any extension of the cable news service.",36
307,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"But that suggestion would not obtain the other objects, including the splitting up of the monopoly.",37
308,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"As I have said, I do not know whether it is a monopoly or not. - On looking at the report of the Senate's Select Committee, I find this organization so defined on the ground that it has the only source of supply of news from the other side of the world.. There could be as many organizations as people choose to form, but because there is only one organization, the Select Committee call it a monopoly. True, it stands alone, but not as a monopoly in the sense in which that word is generally employed, namely, to indicate a body that is so entrenched that it is secured from rivalry except after an alteration of the law, or by some special agency outside the power of other organizations. In the present instance, it is open to anybody and everybody at any time to form another news organization; and, at present, the only advantage is that of the people in possession and position. Plainly, the short and straight road, if the House is satisfied that Government assistance should be given, would be by a reduction of the rates. That might be still more limited by indicating in a general way that the reduction was made to obtain news of advantage to, and desirable for, Australia, apart from particular interests, classes, or sections. However, I do not wish to dwell on that any further. If we must go further, and adopt this form of subsidy which the Minister favours, we next find ourselves face to face with the conditions which it is suggested should be imposed. These are worthy of being discussed in detail, but I shall not attempt to do so. I come at once to the principal point contained in the condition, which is that at least 6,000 words of the cable service are to be transmitted each week from Europe or America by way of the Pacific Cable. This cable is selected because we are partners in it, and, at present, in spite of the growing business, are still paying towards its deficit, created, not by its actual working day by day. but by providing a sinking fund for renewals. I believe I am correct in saying, roughly speaking, that the Pacific Cable is now paying more than working expenses, or ordinary charges.",37
309,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Will every paper lie compelled to take 6,000 words a week?",37
310,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"No , the newspapers will take what they choose, but 6,000 words is what has to be transmitted by an Association before it gets the subsidy.",37
311,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I do not know whether with the assistance offered., the Pacific Cable Board will be able to provide for the sinking fund, but notice in the press that the Board, which I have always found to be fairly progressive and up to date, is endeavouring to increase the inducements - offered by the service to customers, so that we, as part proprietors, may shortly find ourselves in the satisfactory position of seeing the enterprise not only earning working expenses, but providing the sinking fund, so that no further charge will be necessary on the Treasury. The next point is contained in condition No. 7, which isThe Association must transmit to Australia by cable ancl supply to its subscribers anv information on matters of Australian interest supplied to it or its agent in London by the High Commissioner, but the Association shall be entitled to charge the Commonwealth Government press rates in respect of the matter so transmitted. That is a liberal, even generous, proposal, and it is one, if this proposal is to be carried out, to which I personally take no exception. Honourable members will note, however, that it is only information coming from the High Commissioner which is to be dealt with in this way, and that he is restricted to information of Australian' interest.",37
312,Mr WEST,Unknown,The information sent by the High Commissioner will be available for the press?,37
313,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Quite so, but the information is limited to that of Australian interest. Then, the motion provides that the Government shall impose such third conditions as may be necessary to secure that the public obtain the fullest possible benefit from the subsidized service. I dare say that what the Minister had in his mind was the fullest possible encouragement that could be given to the use of the service for this particular purpose, but it is also capable, whether intended or not, of being read with condition No. 7, by which the matter sent is restricted to information of Australian interest. I ventured by interjection to' indicate that this opened up another side to the question which we cannot ignore if we would. If we adopted the alternative of simply reducing the rates we should have no further responsibility, since everybody would stand on the same footing; but when, instead of thus throwing open the doors, we limit the subsidy to a particular Association of interested persons, subject to such conditions as we think fit to impose, it at once creates a responsibility in us for the cable messages to be encouraged. The Government show this when they limit the High Commissioner to matters of Australian interest ; and, whether we like it or not, if we enter this field of action, taking an active part in the business, either by creating or supporting one special organization and that alone,, we cannot escape responsibility for the character of the messages sent. I have no desire to see questions of. this sort forced on our consideration in Parliament, but, if we must consider them, let us seek for the broadest and least contentious ground.",37
314,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,I fail to see why. The honourable member is straining the point tremendously !',38
315,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"As I said before, if we simply lowered the rates for press messages we have no responsibility subsidy whatever in regard to those messages, but if , instead of lowering the rates, we offer a subsidy to one organization, and laying down conditions as to its tion, methods of work, we cannot stop short with the requirement that it shall send 6,000 words a week. We are subsidizing it to send that number of words, and berested come, as a Parliament, responsible for the use made of that power. If the Governcatastrophes ment do not think so, why do they put that intimation to the High Commissioner that he is only to send matters of Aus Mr. tralian interest? - Mr BATCHELOR - I am quite prepared to strike that out.",38
316,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The Government are right to keep it in, because it recognises responsibilities that they are accepting. seems to me that a similar qualification should be applied to those 6,000 wordsthat they should relate to the public affairs of the Empire. The only case to which the Minister was able to point as a precedent for the course he is proposing to follow, subsidizing an organization, was in Canada, and there the arrangement was completed by the condition imposed by the Canadian Government on the subsidized organization that the messages must relate news; that the 6,000 words which the organization is to send per week should confined to cables relating to the public affairs of the Empire. If they want to messages about the private affairs of distinguished society people, or others, let them send them at their own expense. They are entitled to send them as news, but it is no advantage to Australia to encourage the use of the cable for those purposes. So I could point to a variety of subjects with which, if they choose to deal by cable, in the exercise of their freedom, as caterers for the public, that is their business, and not ours.",38
317,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"Why give a subsidy at all, then ? Why not get direct communication from the High Commissioner, if the cables are to be limited to public affairs ?",38
318,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"There are two points involved. So far as I understand, what is done in regard to the High Commissioner's messages, for which the Government pay press rates, they make arrangements with him as to what he shall send, and it goes to every one. Then there is the requirement that there must be 6,000 words sent, and for these we give a to a special organization. I contend that those words ought to be limited to news of the Empire in the largest sense, more particularly its public affairs. Under public affairs, I include producindustries, and commerce, as well as news of the Parliaments, and matters of interest of that kind. What I exclude are sporting news, which we are not intein subsidizing, the extravagances of multi-millionaires, the horrors of murder, in out-of-the-way corners in of the world, and so on. For instance, we have had columns of the adventures of Crippen, and his pursuit. Those are matters of news, which if the press choose to supply them, I suppose they know their own readers. It is their business, not ours. But surely there is more than enough news the about the Empire, which ought to be known It in Australia, and which it would be to the advantage of Australia to know. We ought to get that in the 6,000 words. At present, it appears to me, entirely from a nonbusiness stand-point, that the frivolous and sensational side-issues of European and of American life receive more attention than they deserve; while certainly the serious, deeper, and graver subjects that affect the interests of Australia, bound up as they are with those of the Mother Country, to Empire South Africa, and Canada",38
319,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,Would the honourable be member call labour news serious news?,38
320,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"As a rule, but at times send very comic. If the honourable member refers to any advances in the movement, or alterations in its platform, those, of course, are serious; but any ludicrous little accident to a Labour man, or a member of any other party, would probably be cabled out, while a solid speech full of important matter, and deserving of every consideration, would often be ignored. We cannot pretend to cope with these vagaries, or revise cables, but when we establish a particular organization, subsidize it exclusively, and supply news, we are entitled to ask for matter of some serious import to the Commonwealth. We get it now to a large extent, but we desire to be assured of more. That is no limitation of the motion. I have no ambition to father a particular amendment, and if the Minister will shape one in any form which on the best information he can obtain appears to him wise, I am prepared to fall in with it. But we have the responsibility and cannot evade it. If we stipulate for a certain amount of cable news, ahd give certain concessions for it, we ought to put the most important and valuable news first, and leave the less important and valuable to be sent independently of the 6,000 words.",38
321,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,How would the news be obtained ? The position of the compiler in London is one of the most arduous and difficult on the world's press.,39
322,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"That is the difficulty of the Association, not ours.",39
323,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,If it is meant to come through the High Commissioner,39
324,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"No , this is altogether outside of that. He is to send direct. This motion is another illustration that if you once leave the safe ground of public interests, simply lowering the cable rates and allowing everybody to do as he pleases-if you go beyond that, pick and subsidize your organization, and fix the number of words to be sent, you are at once drawn, whether you like it or not, into a certain responsibility. Honourable members might add condition to condition until in the end the whole thing might become a Government sub-Department. Once you start on this line there is no given point at which you pre required to stop. I would quote from the report of the Senate's Select Com.nittee in this regard the following reference to the Canadian systemThere are conditions attached to the subsidy as to the class of news to be sent, but the sult has been stated as eminently beneficial both to Canada and the Empire in promoting knowledge, trade, and immigration. That is the testimony of the Committee of the effect of introducing as Canada has introduced a condition as to the matter to be sent.",39
325,Mr WEST,Unknown,"In the same part of the report it is mentioned that Canadafirst gave a subsidy of £3,000, but that that amount has now been reduced to £2,000, showing that this is no new thing.",39
326,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I know it is not new, and simply call attention to the obligations which it brings with it. We can only get the fullest possible benefit from the subsidized service by asking ourselves what news Australia wants from London. It wants, I take it, news of the Empire, of real progress on the industrial, manufacturing, and commercial sides, and also some acquaintance with the political interests and developments of the Mother Country, which are coming much closer to our own than they were a few years ago. If we are to - have this organization, and fulfil what appears to have been the conception which the Government had in their minds when drafting the motion, that seems to be a necessary condition. I am sorry there is not time for me to do more justice to the subject. Of course the Minister comes here, as he should, master of his subject, and has given an extremely clear exposition. All I can do is to take it up at an hour's notice, and add these comments.",39
327,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"Darling) [2.41] - I do not think any members of the Opposition can charge the Government with making very much of a new departure in this proposal. Had the Government gone on those Socialistic lines of which we have heard so much, they would have proposed to arrange for a Government supply of cable news from the Old World to this side of the globe. This is a kind of intermediary scheme in keeping with what has been done in a number of countries, although it is somewhat of a departure in the line which has been taken up. The subject is associated with the education of the people, and as Governments in Australia take up other branches of public education, they are justified in interposing in this matter also. I do not think anybody is satisfied with the kind of cable service which Australia now has. and no one should grumble about the small amount which the Government are proposing to expend over a. period re- of three years in order to encourage the setting up of an improved, or rival, cable service. Those honourable members who believe so strongly in the principle of competition ought to hail with satisfaction this proposal of the Government to increase competition. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - How does this proposal to subsidize a private profit-making concern harmonize with the Socialistic principles of the honourable member's party ?",39
328,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"It is part of that evolutionary development which the Labour party recognise is the only way to achieve ultimate success. It is worthwhile considering how we get the miserable epitome of news that at present appears. The honourable member for Ballarat has very properly referred to some of the samples that we read. Any one who looks at the cable news daily will see quite a number of things which it is astonishing that the newspapers bother to print at all. It has become quite a standard item of the cable service that the High Commissioner had a dinner. Seeing that everybody expects a dinner every day, I do not know that it should be of sufficient importance cable out from the Old World that Sir George Reid dined. Any kind of sensational crime fills the columns of the papers, but we know practically nothing of important events in the Old World unless we take the trouble to read the papers when they reach us by mail. What happens at present is that practically one man, or two at the most, edit all that comes here. This man sits in an office and gets, say, an advance proof sheet of the London Times, which, of course, has its own service to collect news. He marks with a red pencil the matters which he thinks of first importance, and with a blue pencil those which he thinks of secondary importance. This is passed on to a sub-editor, who, knowing the number of words reouired for Australia, picks out sufficient. This is then typed and cabled out, The news comes out to a close combine, - which permits the proorietors of country newspapers to have only part of it. The proprietors of the metropolitan dailies of Victoria will not allow the country press of the State to receive the cream of the cables. Under this arrangement the big city journals get cable news at very little cost. On a former occasion I read the statement in a leading article of the Sydney Daily Telegraph that there is no interference, and that any newspaper proprietor can get cables. But at the halfyearly meeting of the company controlling that journal it was stated by the chairman of the board of directors, Major Randall Carey, that they had succeeded in renewing the arrangement for another five years, which would render it practically impossible for another newspaper to enter into competition with them, except at the cost of establishing a special cable service of its own.",40
329,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"Mr Carey is too discreet to make such an admission, whatever may be his views.",40
330,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"The admission was intended only for the shareholders of the Daily Telegraph Newspaper Company. I had in my possession the document in which it was published. It is generally known that a newspaper cannot join the Association except by the permission of those who form it. Of course, any one can start a fresh association, and the Government is desirous of making it worthwhile to establish a rival to that now existing. To this end it proposes a subsidy of £6,000. The present Association gets most of its to news from the London Times reports, and the cablegrams which are sent out are Conservative in tone. We have to depend for our news from the Old World on what one man chooses to tell us. *",40
331,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,Our news is often despatched from England before it has appeared in the London journals.,40
332,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"Generally , news is public property in the Old World before it is cabled to Australia. It must not be forgotten, too, that censorship is exercised over what appears in the London Times and the other London dailies. The effect of news on the public, or on the share market, is carefully studied. The American Press Association represents some 200 newspapers, which publish statements of occurrences within the British Empire which are never found in the British newspapers. To be told half the truth is more misleading than to be told nothing.",40
333,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Is not the news appearing in the American journals strongly coloured ?,40
334,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"It may be coloured, and it is often sensational. My point is that, owing to the censorship in Great Britain, we are not fully informed of the happenings in the world at large. The average reader is glad to find sensational matter in his newspaper. But we should encourage the transmission of news of importance. Were it proposed to grant a perpetual subsidy, we should do well to consider the difficulties suggested by the last speaker. But we have before us only a proposal for the granting of a subsidy to encourage the development of a new industry, or the supplying to Australia of ^better news than can be obtained under the present restricted service.",40
335,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,What important newspapers are shut out from the present cable arrangements ?,41
336,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,I am discussing the position of readers rather than that of newspapers.,41
337,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,What newspapers has die honourable member in his mind?,41
338,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"At the present time there is only one cable service for the newspapers of Australia, and it is controlled by the big dailies, so that no newspaper proprietor can benefit by it except on the terms which may be dictated to him by the Combine. If there has been a change in this matter, we should be told what it is.",41
339,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,The ought to know.,41
340,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"The Combine has refused to give him information, just as it has refused to allow persons wishing to start newspapers* to come into the Assothis ciation. M>. BATCHELOR - Personally , I have made no inquiry, but the Select Committee of the Senate inquired over and over again, and could not get information.",41
341,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"Is it true that Adelaide Labour paper, the Herald, has try. been admitted into the Combine?",41
342,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,No .,41
343,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"That newspaper is arranging for an independent service; is the Barrier Daily Truth. The proprietors of both newspapers have been refused opportunity of joining - the Association, which charges the country papers what it importance is increasing. likes, and decides what news they shall receive. The railway services of New South Wales and Victoria are so arranged that the big dailies in Sydney and Melis bourne can be distributed over large areas - early enough in the day to compete with local newspapers. At places like Ballarat and Bendigo the Argus and Age are dis-. tributed as early in the morning as are local newspapers, and their proprietors - take care that the local newspapers shall - not get all the cablegrams which they Some honourable members may regard these as proper commercial methods, but they result in the community getting less news of the world than it should have. We have been trying to interest our people in our association with the Empire, and to do this more full y our citizens should be informed of what is happening abroad, especiallj' where the news is of interest to Australia. At present much of the news sent out is mere rubbish. Notwithstanding the cheapness of the cable service .to the newspaper proprietors, who have found out the value of the co-operative idea, they have not had the enterprise to improve the service. I believe that there is a widespread demand for news of a different character from that now received. Rapid developments have taken place in the Old World of which we should be full y informed, and any proposal to effect this result should be supported.'",41
344,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Who is to direct the collection of news under the proposed system ?,41
345,Mr SPEA CE,Unknown,Condition s are to be T laid down by the Government. Minister Sir JOHN FORREST - There may ' be several Cable Associations.,41
346,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"The Government will have to regulate that. It is not likely that, there will be several Associations, though if proposal creates competition, so much the better.",41
347,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,So long as there is competition which suits the Labour party.,41
348,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"I support the proposal as likely to create an improvement in our the system of getting news from the Old CounWhen our readers are aware of this improvement, they will probably desire an Empire cable service.",41
349,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,The honourable so member overrates the desire for serious news. When he was twenty he did not the care to read what he reads now.,41
350,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"The desire for news of Education in the large sense is spreading, and more thinking is being done, especially since Federation. Even the man in the street' disgusted with much of the news that is cabled to the newspapers. The Australian Democracy is not interested in learning that some one of whom they know nothing has obtained a divorce, or has attended a banthe quet. Such information does not interest Australians to any extent, but they are interested in learning of our relations with have. Germany, of developments in India, or other matters associated with the relationship of the Empire to the Continent of Europe. All such matters are read with increasing interest, and I think that if this proposal leads to an improved cable service the Australian public will rejoice, and saythat at a cost of £6,000 per annum it is decidedly cheap.",41
351,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Swan) [3.1] The Minister has not - extended to us that consideration to which we are entitled, in asking the House to discuss this motion before many of us were aware even of its appearance on the notice-paper. 1 confess that I had not seen it until this morning, and I complain of the hurried way in which we are asked to deal with what is undoubtedly a new departure. I do not think this undue haste will lead to the question being dealt with more speedily than it would be if we were given time to obtain the information that we need. I had to appeal to the Minister of External Affairs, during the luncheon adjournment, to tell me exactly what the Government proposed.' I wished to know whether the Government themselves were to receive the contributions of newspapers taking advantage of the proposed new service-in which case the State would make money out of the venture-o r whether some other course was to be followed. The exact intentions of the Government are not clearly shown in the motion, although they may perhaps be inferred, and 1 learned from the Minister that the Association selected to do this work is to receive not only the Government subsidy, but the contributions of subscribers to the service. There is no justification for the haste which has been shown in pressing this. motion through the House. The request made by the Leader of the Opposition for the adjournment of the debate ought to have been agreed to.",42
352,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The Government can do nothing right.,42
353,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"The honourable member himself, as he admitted, was not really prepared to speak when called upon to do so, ancl thought that some one else should have filled the breach. He would have been heard to better advantage if more time had been given him for the consideration of the motion. I do not believe in injurious monopolies, and certainly do not favour an injurious press monopoly. The newspapers receive cable messages at rates below those extended to the general public, and they should do nothing to exclude others from the benefits conferred upon them in that respect. It may be argued, however, that any private organization should be free to make its own terms in regard to obtaining and disposing of news. That is quite a common occurrence. When a man has a good business, he is not prepared to let every one into it ; but when a substantial concession is made to the press in the matter of cable charges, in order that the public shall be supplied, at a reasonable cost, with adequate news, we have a right to see that no monopoly injurious to the public is created. The difficulty of which complaint is made by honourable members opposite might have been overcome without granting a subsidy. The Government of the Commonwealth,' having a voice in the control of the Pacific cable, and complete control of the land telegraph lines, might have induced its partners to agree that nothing in the shape of a press monopoly injurious to the country should be allowed to exist in connection with it. I have no doubt that those who in the beginning constituted a preserve or combine would meet the wishes of the public, especially when they knew that if they failed to do so, voluntarily, compulsion might be resorted to. We know that what was at one time said to be a close preserve, has changed considerably during the last two years. I understand that any newspaper may now obtain tl\e Association's cable news if it likes to contribute what is required.",42
354,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,But what is required?,42
355,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"On e member of the Association is not, I understand, charged more than another. My plausible friend, the honourable member for Darling, has complained of the character of the cable news that is published in the Australian press, but he overlooks the fact that newspapers which have to cater for all shades of public opinion are members of the existing Association. That being so, his argument falls to the ground. We know that the metropolitan daily newspapers in this State have differing political views. Wbuld the Age ancl the Argus run in double harness if under the existing arrangement favouritism were shown to one side or the other ? We may rest assured that the proprietors of those newspapers do their best to obtain fair news, and the news which they disseminate is not opposed to what .one reads when the Old World newspapers are received. There is, in my opinion, no cause for complaint in regard to the news of the world published in the morning newspapers here. I understand that a Labour newspaper, the publication of which was commenced in Adelaide quite recently, found some difficulty in getting into the press cable syndicate.",42
356,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,It is not in it.,43
357,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"The honourable member, who is very plausible, says that it is not in it. Perhaps it does not wish to be a member of it.",43
358,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,It was refused. offered absurd conditions.,43
359,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,This looks like an attempt on the part of the Labour Government to subsidize that and other similar newspapers. There can be no doubt that the object of this proposal is to subsidize newspapers run in the interests of the Ministerial party.,43
360,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,There was no Labour newspaper in existence when the Select Committee made the recommendation on which this proposal is based.,43
361,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"If I remember rightly, the majority of the members of that Select Committee belonged to the Labour party. What else could we expect from such a majority.",43
362,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"So far as the South Australian newspaper is concerned, it will not benefit one penny by this subsidy, and speaking for it, I do not care whether the motion is passed or rejected. '",43
363,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"It is satisfactory to have that assurance. Another question that I desire to ask relates to the selection of the association to which this subsidy is to be paid. If several make application for the nomination of the Government, which is to receive it? Then, again, what guarantee shall we have that the association selected to receive the subsidy will transmit cable messages that Will meet the news requirements of the general public of Australia? It may send out news unacceptable even to the Ministerial party. The whole scheme is an attempt to do by means of a subsidized private agency that which, if it needs to be done, should be undertaken by the Government. If this step is necessary, it would be far better to appoint a Government officer at Home rather than a private press agency, to transmit news to Australia, but I expect he would find a difficulty in obtaining it. I do not approve, however, of the adoption of that course, for I believe that the news requirements of the people are best catered for by those enterprising persons who make it a business to collect and disseminate information of interest to the public. We have no guarantee that the position will be met under this scheme. It may be met from the Ministerial point of view, if an association that will cater for their particular interest is appointed to do this work. Even if such an appointment be made, however, I do not think that an association, working from the other side of the world, is likely to do much good for the Labour party in Australia. The It was Labour party have promised, however, that a Labour newspaper shall be established in each of the State capitals, and, apparently, those newspapers are to secure their cable news at the expense of the State. Why can they not stand upon their own foundation, and obtain their own news without asking the State to provide it for them? I am inclined to favour that all newspapers daily be allowed to participate, on fair terms, in the news sent over the public cables, at specially reduced rates. I do not wish to interfere unduly with private enterprise, but I can well understand that it is fairly - difficult for a newspaper to make a start if it has to pay considerably more for its cable messages than others doing the same business have to pay. I should be glad to obviate that difficulty, not by granting a subsidy, but by making regulations in regard tome transmission of press messages over our cables. i",43
364,Mr CARR,Unknown,And have the Government tied up.,43
365,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"We have no information as to the class of people who are to be selected to supply this oversea news, or as to what their political views are to be. As a matter of fact, I do not observe any strong political leaning in the messages from the Old World that are published in the newspapers today. We are advised of movements in Imperial and Continental politics, and I have not observed any colouring in the press messages now published. I admit that I have assumed that news so published is selected with care, and based upon fact, and I have not . discovered anything to lead me to believe that I am mistaken in that assumption. I repeat that the Government should not have forced this motion upon the House before we had had an opportunity to speak to those mostly interested in it, and that we are embarking upon a new principle, which must prove unsatisfactory.",43
366,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"Calare) [3.14] - Havin g sat on the Opposition benches for nearly ten years, I have some sympathy with the'contention cf the right honourable member for Swan that time based on fact? should have been allowed for considering a motion of this kind.

It has been engaging the attention of many people, and certainly ought to have been engaging the attention of honorlic able members on both sides, for a concloser siderable time past. This is not a matter of a grievance of the Labour party, but fore a Select Committee. a grievance of the general public, who feel that their interests are not properly catered for by the present combination. That feeling secured expression in the pointment of a Select Committee by the Senate in the last Parliament. Before that Committee witnesses were called representthese ing all the interests concerned, including the present Association; and it was open to all to set forth their views. We now the report of that Select Committee; and we must remember that it is not a matter of opinion, but a matter of evidence, though the finding was certainly in the direction in which the Government are now moving. Mr FULLER. ^ T wo of the Committee dissented.",43
367,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"That may special be, but it is not unusual in the case Select Committees and Royal Commissions, where many minds and various interests represented, to find dissension. And, any case, we have, irrespective of that, advantage of the evidence, and are now in a position to judge the whole question quite apart from the recommendations of a maSelect jority of the Committee.",44
368,Mr FULLER,Unknown,Was there any evidence of any grievance on the part of the ral public?,44
369,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"If the honnow in force. orable member is not aware of the fact, it is very curious, under all the circumwas stances.",44
370,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I never heard of any grievance on the part of the general public.,44
371,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"The right of the agreement. honourable member for Swan moves in a sphere in which there are no grievances this sort, because, in that sphere, all are amply provided for.",44
372,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Is that statement,44
373,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,It is the deduction I make from the interjection of the,44
374,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"It is curious that if there rewas this feeling, no representative of the hongeneral public gave evidence of the fact. does not Mr THOMAS BROWN - The Select Committee elicited the fact that there is a particular combination, and that there is a large volume of dissatisfaction in the pubmind. If the honourable member was in touch with public feeling, he would not ask for evidence of representatives beAt one time there were two cable services, one practically controlled by the Melbourne Age and the Sydney Daily Telegraph, and the apother controlled by the Melbourne Argus and the Sydney Morning Herald. At that time the division between the policies of great publications was most marked, and there was considerable rivalry; but latterly political changes have brought have these newspapers closer into line.",44
375,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,The combination was made many years ago ,44
376,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"Thos e newspapers found that by combining their services they could secure cheaper cable news; and I take no exception to that; but one of the conditions of the association was that the combined service should be their property. It is said that it is open of to any other newspaper or newspapers to establish an independent service; but the are conditions that the Association helped to in create were wholly in their own favour, the and against any opposition of the kind. In fact, they established a preserve so close that, according to the evidence before the Committee, a majority of the members could not extend the service to any other publication, because the rules degenemanded the unanimous consent of every party to it. We are told by honourable members opposite that this condition is not",44
377,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"It was said that that a condition, but, as a matter of fact, the decision rested with the proprietors of particular newspapers in the capitals. .",44
378,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,But what the honourable member for Calare says formed part,44
379,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"At any rate, of this shows how close and binding the comwants bination was; and if the condition has been relaxed, it is only in response to the pressure of public opinion. The Association did agree to admit other newspapers on certain conditions. It has been stated) and, I believe, correctly, that some of the first promoters of the Association are able to reap profit-that newspapers which join are called upon to pay a rate so high that the original members of the Association not only obtain free news, but also reap monetary gain. Further, the newspapers which did not originally belong to the combination have now, when admitted, to agree, under a severe penalty of £1,000-, not to publish news from any other source.",44
380,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,The principals have to do the same.,45
381,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"That does not make the condition less unjust, and the principals have the right of determining the kind of news sent, the other participants having no say in such matters. objection that has been made to the Government's proposal is that its object is to provide news for Labour journals. I do not think, however, that that allegation can stand the test of investigation. The proposal of the Minister stipulates that the news obtained shall be supplied, not only to Labour newspapers, but to every newspaper in the country, which so desires, on equal terms, whether that newspaper represents the extreme of Labourism or the extreme of Conservatism. That is not so under the present monopoly control of the cable. The Association now determines the conditions under which the service shall be used, and the particular class of newspapers that shall use it ; and there is no power to compel any alteration of that determination. A newspaper which is antagonistic, either commercially or politically, to the Association, is entirely at its mercy. The-honourable member for Parkes claims that practically all the great newspapers are commercial concerns which endeavour to meet the needs of the community. So far as I can gather, however, those newspapers are something more than commercial propositions, seeing that they endeavour to 'control and determine the politics of Australia.",45
382,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Does that not apply to all newspapers?,45
383,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,It does to all large newspapers.,45
384,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,And to small newspapers as well. The Labour party compel people to subscribe to the partu organs.,45
385,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"Not at all ; and I can say that, so far as I am concerned, I never owned a newspaper, and I am never likely to. This Newspaper Association, as I say, aims at dictating the policy of the country, and it is one of the healthy signs of the independence of our national life and thought that the community, at the last general election, refused to be drummed into a particular line. However, the fact cannot be denied that the aim of those great publications,, particularly those which control the Press Cable Combine, is partly commercial and partly to determine the politics of this country. That being so, they colour the news, and take only what is acceptable to their particular policy.",45
386,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,It is absolutely wrong to say that that applies to the cables.,45
387,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"If the honOne orable member has better information than I have he can give the House the advantage of it when he speaks. My contention is that the news transmitted by cable is of a character that suits the Conservative political tastes of the combination that controls the service. Consequently other papers which have nothing to do with determining the character of the news sent, but which receive their news from that source, are helpless. They have to take the information, coloured as it is, or leave it. There is no other source from which they can get it. I should like to refer honourable members to some interviews and press criticisms which appeared at the time when the English delegates to the Conference of Chambers of Commerce visited Australia a little while ago, and particularly to the remarks of Sir Albert Spicer with regard to our cable service. He pointed out how inadequately Australia was served in this respect, and it was a matter of surprise to him"", as a leading Englishman both in the commercial and political world, that this should be so. He declared in the course of an interview that justice was not done to the Liberal party and the Liberalism of Great Britain per medium of the doctored Conservative news transmitted to Australia by cable. That appeals very strongly to me as a reason why we should be no longer satisfied as a community to receive our news of happenings in the Mother Country from this politically-tainted source. We should be in a position to supply the thinking people of Australia, particularly as we are more Liberal than Conservative, with full and correct news of the trend of politics in the Old Country. It is impossible to get that kind of news from the existing cable combine and under existing conditions. In the interests of the people of the whole of Australia, and of correct information with respect to the trend of events ih the Old World and in America, the Government are doing wisely in submitting a proposal to subsidize a company that will be formed to battle with the great octopus syndicate to which I have referred, and provide Australian readers with the kind of information of which they are now deprived. I am asked if we can guarantee that we shall get that information. To my mind there is no doubt about it. It is hardly likely that another' company will enter the arena simply to cater for the news which a big company already supplies. If a new organization wants to obtain a footing, it must strike out on new lines, and there are ample opportunities for it to do so. I , for one, have no fear that that particular need of Australia will not be amply catered for. Another aspect of this proposal calls for. attention. We have what is known as the All-Red cable service, one of the aims and purposes of which is to bring cable communication between Australia, Canada, and the Mother Country directly under British control, and as far as possible under the control of the Governments representing those portions of the Empire. We have constructed a cable between Australia and Canada, and the deficiency, on its working is guaranteed by the Governments of Great Britain, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia. . Thai: cable service has had considerable opposition to contend with on the part of the Eastern Extension Company, as was only to be expected, seeing that the new service is cutting into the special preserves of that company. For some years past there has been a deficiency on the working expenses of this section of the cable of from £60,000 to £80,000 per annum, and to this we have to contribute hi common with the other guarantors. Although we have reduced the cable charges for the purpose, of securing a larger and cheaper measure of European news for Australian purposes, the existing press bination has entered into an arrangement with the Eastern Extension Company that practically takes from the Pacific Cable all the revenue that should come from the reduced charges that we have instituted, and gives it to the. private company. shuts out the line which we are subsidizing and endeavouring to build up into an AllBritish line. As an evidence of the extent to which this is done, there was recently an event in San Francisco quite close to the point from which our line starts-a n event which, although not very creditable in itself, excited a great deal of interest. 1 refer to the late boxing contest between Johnson and Jeffries. A very large section of the community here was on the qui vive for the latest returns and fullest particulars of that event. The press combination to which I have referred sent over our guaranteed All-Red cable line only about half-a-dozen words, simply intimating who the victor in the contest was, while it sent messages to the extent of about 2,000 words across Canada, and across the Atlantic to Great Britain, and then vid India to Australia by the Eastern Extension Company's lines. Consequently our cable, although located in a special position of advantage, was used only to an insignificant extent, whereas the Eastern Extension Company's service was utilized to the extent of about 2,000 words to convey this information to the Australian people. I am glad, in the interests of the All-Red route, that the Minister makes it one of the conditions of the proposed subsidy that it shall be paid for messages sent over the cable for which we are responsible, and any deficiency' on the working of which we have to help to make up. I am asked if I claim that there is an understanding between the Eastern Extension and the Pacific Cable services. There is not. They are rivals, and their rivalry is strong and pronounced, but my information is that there is a very close understanding between the ArgusHerald Press Cable Combine and the Eastern Extension Company. There is pretty fair evidence that that understanding does exist, because the Cable Combine could get their news equally as cheaply and also get it quicker per medium of the Pacific Cable if they desired than through the Eastern Extension Company; but the instance I have given shows that they do not choose to do so. I am further informed that, as the outcome of a recent arrangement with the Eastern Extencom- sion Company, the Cable Combine are getting, or will very shortly get, their messages sent here, not at ninepence per word as laid down in the agreement with the Government, but at threepence per word. That is arranged in this way: The messages are This transmitted from London with Australia as as their objective, but they have what are called drop services at half-a-dozen points in India and Africa, and the cost of the whole service is so distributed that ultimate charge for the message when it reaches Australia is reduced to that extent.",45
388,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"The honourable memcable, ber does not object to that?",47
389,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"Not at all, times but it shows how a great combination like this can make it practically impossible for a single newspaper proprietary, or even fairly considerable combination of proprielished tors, to fight it. It would not be possible for the - present cable syndicate to have such a cheapened service unless the Eastern Extension Company was in sympathy with, if not an active participant in, its doings. A new association for the collection and cabling of news from the Old Country would scarcely be able to make such able terms for the transmission of mes--that sages at the Australian end as the, Heraldto Argus combination has made.",47
390,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,The present arrangement enables more news to be sent for newspapers less monev.,47
391,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,I do not has think that it does. The news sent be acceptable to the large centres for which it is supplied. Eight or nine of these have been arranged for India and South Africa.,47
392,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Who will be able to take advantage of the facilities which Government offers ?,47
393,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"Accordin g to honourable members opposite, advantage be taken of them by the Labour journals; but it will be open to every newspaper, cluding the so-called "" Liberal newspaper,"" which was run at the last elections in interests of the Fusion party, to take vantage of them.",47
394,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The President of the Country Press Association says that country press cannot take advantage of that they could take advantage of it only if a monopoly. there were a Sydney daily which would them the news.,47
395,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"Fortunatel y tion this matter is controlled by the Government, and not by the President of the Country Press Association. The extent of the Cable - Combine's monopoly is well known in.New South Wales. A daily .newspaper could not start in Sydney unless it was prepared to pay for a special cable service. Not many months since an evening paper there negotiated to secure the benefits of the service recently established, but its prietary was told that if it published any messages beyond those supplied by the be held in view. Combine, it would be called upon to for the feit the sum of £1,000. That newspaper has been reconstructed, and today is publishing the news flashed across the Pacific with the result that its readers get information of interest and variety sometwenty-four or forty-eight hours before it appears in the other newspapers. I have been told that particulars of the rea cent disastrous floods in Japan were pubin that journal a couple of days before they appeared in the other newspapers. It is important that the people of Australia should have early information of what is happening elsewhere, and that news should not be suppressed because it does not suit a particular policy. We should be fully informed of the political movements in the favorMother Country ahd elsewhere. We know the news which we now get is censored some extent. Furthermore, as the honourable member for Macquarie has pointed out, important news is often kept back from country newspapers until the metropolitan have published it. As conductor of a country daily newspaper, he had wide practical experience. The must Government proposal prevents the confining of cable news to a circle of newspaper proprietors, and gives to all the benefits of the cable service without respect to party politics. The publication of news obtained the from this source will not prevent the publication of news from any other source, and the arrangement will place the struggling will newspaper proprietors of the country on the same footing as their city competitors. inThe proposal is not to favour a few publications, Labour or anti-Labour, but to thegive all newspaper proprietors the maximum adamount of information, and liberty to use it. The Minister's proposal is well worth the consideration and support of all who the are opposed to monopoly. This is the only it ; way of dealing with what is undoubtedly Some honourable memsell bers opposite have attempted to limit the news which is to be sent to informaof purely Australian interest. If the Minister listens to the suggestions which have been made in this direction, he will frustrate the end which he has in view. The object should be to get as much general news as possible for Australian readers, and to break down the present Conservative monopoly. The limitation which has been suggested would play into the hands of new the present Combine. It would not achieve prothe purposes which, according to the Committee which investigated the matter, should",47
396,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"Wimmera) [3.56] The supporters of the Ministry who are trying to justify this proposal have spent their time in traducing the present cable service, which is undoubtedly an admirable one. Our newspapers cannot afford to devote more than a certain amount of space to the publication of cable news, and it is necessary that as much variety as possible should be given in what is cabled from the Old World. I do not say that the present system could not be improved, but, according to the report of the Select Committee which sat last year, the weekly average of the words sent to the combination increased from 1,500 in 1906, to nearly 5,000 in 1909.",48
397,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,Was there an increase each year?,48
398,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"Yes ; the increase was gradual. The total expenditure of the Association for the three and a-half years ending 9th June, 1909, was £51,786, and its income-receipt s for cable news sold£30,805, leaving it to seven newspaper proprietors to pay the balance of £20,981. The cost of collecting and distributing the news apart from the cost of cabling is very considerable. The Reuter Association has a system of coding which is very complete, and enables news to be condensed in London and expanded here in a manner which greatly reduces expense. The Association is able to collect its news from the most approved sources in London. I understand that it has the control of advanced proof sheets of the principal London newspapers.",48
399,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,Is there authentic information as to that?,48
400,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"I understand that evidence to that effect was tendered to the Select Committee. Reuter also has agencies in different parts of the world, and has built up at tremendous cost in the large centres of Europe special means of acquiring information. That being so, we shall not only require to subsidize cable messages in order that we may obtain news in competition with the existing Association, but will find it necessary to have a means of collecting, coding,, and receiving that news in a way that will successfully compete with the Work of Reuter's great coding company.",48
401,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"There is no difficulty in that respect. . Mr SAMPSON - The honourable gentleman will find that there is considerable difficulty. I understand that there is a means of obtaining cable messages at the present time through an American Company or Association, but if we are to do anything in this direction we should enter upon the work in a systematic way and get our news first hand.",48
402,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,We can obtain our news much quicker vid America.,48
403,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,We might obtain sensational news from the United States more quickly.,48
404,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,We should obtain vid Vancouver the same news as is supplied by other services.,48
405,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"But it would be "" packed,"" so to speak, by an Association having its head-quarters, I understand, in the United States of America.",48
406,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,The honourable member is quite wrong.,48
407,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"As the Leader of the Opposition has pointed out, this proposal to subsidize a new service involves a very considerable responsibility. If the Government take upon themselves the right to exercise a censorship over the 6,000 words per week to be transmitted, they will have to adopt some means of giving that news to the public, and I can scarcely conceive of any way of doing that other than by a national newspaper. If that is what is intended we ought to be informed of it.",48
408,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,The honourable member could have some of these messages in his own newspaper.,48
409,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"I am coming to that point. I am not prepared to say that there is not a great difficulty in endeavouring to establish a daily newspaper in opposition to the existing wealthy newspapers in large centres of population. l t seems to me that it would probably be beneficial to some of the subscribers to the existing Association if some competition could be introduced. A new service would not only supply more information, but would probably tend to moderate the charges of the present Association.",48
410,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,The honourable member is now on delicate ground.,48
411,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"I am not going to speak with any authority on that aspect of the question. My own experience is that country newspapers can obtain messages from Reuter-and I am speaking now not of daily newspapers published in country towns, but of those published once, twice, or thrice a week-at a rate that is scarcely more than one-fifth of the maximum rate in the schedule to the motion.",48
412,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Is not Reuter, practically in the combine? Does not Reuter's agency decline to supply news to some newspapers",49
413,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"I have not known a case where country newspapers, published once, twice, or thrice a week, have been refused a supply of cable news, or where important news by cable has been withheld from them.",49
414,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"But there the number of messages which such newspapers may publish, and they are forced pay an exorbitant price.",49
415,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"They are not. As matter of fact, the cost of transmitting the cable messages over the land wires is the to take. biggest handicap that country newspaper proprietors have to face. I know that actual experience. My impression is if this subsidv be paid the new service not be availed of to a very large extent proprietors of newspapers published once or twice a week in provincial towns, aldifficulty though it may be largely availed of by dailies of the metropolis and the large vincial centres. It is possible, indeed, that die subsidy will be mopped up by few newspapers published in large centres of population. We should, if possible, use our powers in this direction to bring about a system of competition that will tend to extend the news that Australia should undoubtedly obtain as a part of the Empire. If the Parliament can do that to advantage it should do so ",49
416,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Why not patronize our own cable?,49
417,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"I agree with the honourable member. If the Government think that the £6,000 proposed to be pended will make good the difference bepel tween failure and success on the part any rival newspapers that it is proposed publish in the metropolitan centres of tralia they are making a very big mistake. A much larger subsidy will be necessary, there is to be any substantial competition with the existing service.",49
418,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,Does the honourable member think that we ought to increase proposed subsidy?,49
419,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,I have not given my approval to this scheme. I have what' I believe is a better proposal to make.,49
420,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,But does the honorto compete. able member think it will be sufficient to make the old Association throw open its do the same. doors ?,49
421,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"It may have that effect, so far as newspapers published the cities are concerned; but, according to the figures appearing in the schedule, it is ? not to be assumed that the Association's charges to subscribers are excessive. The real difficulty is that those who wish to start a rival newspaper are not allowed to readily join the Association. That is a very serious difficulty, and should be dealt with if a reasonable way of dealing with is a limit to it can be devised.",49
422,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"A year or two ago, when to the Association had the power, it point blank refused to allow any one to come in. a Mr SAMPSON - As to the contention that it is a monopoly, there is another view A monopoly becomes injurious when it acts in restraint of trade. But from honourable members will agree that, with that the advent of new type-setting machinery, will the quantity of general news, as well as by the volume of cable news published, has been of a very substantial character. The could have been best met by tackthe ling the problem of the Pacific Cable proBoard. We have what is substantially it cable of our own, and are already paying a £20,000 out of the deficiency of £60,000 annually sustained in respect of it. The Government should have attacked that deficiency before bringing in legislation of this character. We have our own postal and telegraph services throughout Australia, and I think that the Government would be justified, under existing conditions, in exerting their powers in connection with those services to compel business messages to be sent over the Pacific cable. That would tend to wipe out the deficiency, which is, after all, one of the real quesextions that ought to be tackled. We comtelegraphic business to be carried over of our own lines, and as we have a monopoly to of the telegraph business of Australia, why Ausshould we not take care that our own business communications with the Old Country if are made over our own cable?",49
423,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Will not this subsidy help the Pacific cable?,49
424,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"It will not effect a the cure. The present deficiency is due to the fact that Reuter codes all private messages passing between Australia and London,'so that they can be delivered at a cost rendering it scarcely possible for the Pacific cable",49
425,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Othe r companies could,49
426,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"Yes ; but I understand that Reuter has so complete a sysin tem of coding that, so far, no company has been able to compete with it. a matter into which the Government inquire. The Government ought to do all week. that is possible to wipe out the present ficiency in respect of the working of the Pacific cable. If they did so, there would be some reason for voting a very big subformation, sidy, if ""necessary, in order to reduce cost of cable messages between London ancl Australia. That is a direction which the Government might well step. They should use their powers to broaden and liberalize communication between grievance Great Britain and Australia; but let them do so in a way that will leave all of advantages open to the whole press of tralia. If the Government become volved in a scheme which will mean their exercising a censorship over the news transit mitted by cable from London, that news can be distributed only by the publication of a national newspaper. If the Governrepresentatives ment are to determine what shall be the character of the news to be sent from Lonto don to Australia-news , such as was inof dicated by the Leader of the Opposigeneral tion, of which we ought to knowit will be necessary to circulate the news. It .is not possible for the Government compel newspaper proprietors to circulate certain news ; and, under the circumstances, the Government having undertaken the duty ancl responsibility of seeing that certain class of news is telegraphed, it be necessary to establish a national paper.",49
427,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"VVhen considering an im-Committee portant question like this, we ought to have a quorum. [Quorum formed.]",50
428,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"Illawarra) [4.17] - I rethat gret the haste the Government is showing I did not have an opportunity of hearing more than a small portion of the speech the Minister this morning, and, previously seen the report of the Senate's ielect Committee, I am placed somewhat in a difficulty in dealing with the question. The question. proposal is for a subsidy of £2,500 for the first year, £2,000 for the second year, and £1,500 for the third year, to be paid to an association on certain conditions laid down in detail; but I did not hear from the Minister anything as to who were to form the new association, where it was be formed, or any particulars of the kind. We have, therefore, nothing beyond the fact that if this motion is carried, some - association will be formed, it is supposed, to comply with the conditions and receive the subsidy. One of the. conditions is that That is the number of words to be transshould mitted oversea shall be 6,000 each I do not know whether the deMinister thinks it wise to impose that limit, seeing that in one week there may be much"" important, acceptable, and instructive inwhile in another week there may the be a dearth of news, and, in order to make up the 6,000 words, it will be necessary to in telegraph a lot of rubbish or padding. Many statements have been made, especially by the honourable member for Calare, as to a on the part of the public in relation to the cable news supplied by the prethe sent Associated Press of Australia. When Austhat honourable member was speaking, I ininterjected that I had heard nothing of such a grievance having been formulated; and does appear strange that, seeing a Select Committee of the Senate sat for a considerable time, no witness was called outside the of the newspapers, the telegraph companies, and Government officials, state any case there might be on the part the general public. Had there been such dissatisfaction in the general community as has been stated, I think we should have found them represented before this to Select Committee appointed by the other branch of the Legislature. We know that very often in the case of Select Committees and Royal Commissions, some members disa sent from thefindingsof the majority ; and will I have had some experience myself in this newsconnexion. Although there might be an equal number of the members of the Select or a Royal Commission on either side, yet, on the casting vote of the chairman, the finding of the majority is quoted as the finding of the inquiring body. While does not apply, perhaps, to the present case, we find that Senator Chataway and Senator Pulsford not only dissented from of the finding, but gave their own opinions at not having considerable length.",50
429,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,And dodged the whole,50
430,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"If that be so, it is for the Minister to show how those gentlemen "" dodged "" the question. I saw this report of the Select Committee for the first time during the lunch hour, and, from a hasty perusal of it, 1 think that Senators to Chataway and Pulsford, in their minority .statement, show a close grip of the question ; and their remarks are well worthy of consideration. It has been stated, particularly by the honourable member for Macquarie, who is a representative of the country press, that there is great dissatisfaction on the part of country newspapers with the service supplied by the Association Press of Australia. I may point out, however, that immediately the Select Committee was appointed by the Senate, some 800 circulars were sent out to the country newspapers of Australia, inviting information and suggestions, and that only ninety replies were received, and that of those ninety, less than one-fourth expressed dissatisfaction. think this fact pretty conclusively meets the statements of the honourable member for Calare as to the dissatisfaction of the public, and also the other statements as to the supposed dissatisfaction on the part of the country press. I have always been led to understand-and I am glad to find .myself supported by the honourable member for Wimmera, who has had considerable experience as a newspaper proprietor in Victoria, that the great difficulty under which country newspapers suffer is not in regard to the charges made for the cable news, but in regard to the cost of transmitting that news over the Australian wires. That this is so is borne out by the evidence given before the Select Committee, and, as Senator Pulsford pointedly puts itThe most marked, and probably the most useful, point brought out by the inquiry, is that the cost of telegrams over Australian wires is more burdensome to the country press, and probably to the metropolitan press as well, than the sum that would be charged for the supply of oversea cable messages. Evidence in this direction was given by representatives of both the Victorian and New South Wales Associations. If honourable members look through the evidence, they will see that the representatives of the Press Associations in both Victoria and New South Wales amply justify the position taken up by Senator Pulsford, who continuedReuter's manager, Mr Collins, said- "" It is the heavy wiring charges which prove crushing to a country newspaper."" He further said"" Only yesterday I was waited upon by a gentleman from the country who has a biweekly newspaper. He was anxious to publish cables, which, so far, he has not been able to do. I quoted him the ridiculous sum of £ 6 per year for the right of copying them, but he could not pay it on account of the wiring charges."" It will be seen, therefore, that it is not the cost of the cables, but the wiring charges, that place the country newspapers in such a disadvantageous position. There is one point in connection with the majority report of the Select Committee to which I should like to call attention. On different occasions, in connection with Select Committees and Royal Commissions, we have Mr Fuller. reports drawn up in a way that is scarcely creditable ; and this is not the first time. I have referred to the matter. For instance,' in the report of the Select Committee on the cable service, under the heading "" Power of Monopoly,"" signed by Senator Pearce, now Minister of Defence, we find, as a justification for this portion of the reportI It was stated by a retired newspaper proprietor that whilst the rate for press cables was 3s. 6d. per word, he was then charged £128 per annum; when cable charges dropped to is. 4d. per word, he was paying £125 per annum; but when they dropped to is. per word, the association raised its charge to him to ^175 per annum. This, of course, is put forward with the distinct object of discrediting the Associated Press. But if we look from one end of the evidence to the other, and through the appendices, we find no statement of the kind by any "" retired news-. paper proprietor.""",50
431,Mr RILEY,Unknown,Is the statement not a fact?,51
432,Mr FULLER,Unknown,How can I say?,51
433,Mr RILEY,Unknown,Does the honourable member contradict it?,51
434,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"It is a statement that might be made by any person in the street. In the present case it was certainly not made on sworn evidence, and there is not even a letter throughout the report from this real or supposed newspaper proprietor to justify the statement of Senator Pearce.",51
435,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,I did not quote the statement.,51
436,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"I did not say that the Minister quoted, it, but a report based on statements of that character is absolutely valueless to the House.",51
437,Mr RILEY,Unknown,The honourable member does not deny it.,51
438,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"How can I deny it? I might hear a statement of that sort from any one, in the gallery or outside. I do not know whether it is true or not; but, before members who occupy high and important positions on a Select Committee of the Senate bring forward and use statements of that character",51
439,Mr RILEY,Unknown,A statement which is true.,51
440,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"How does the honourable member know that it is true? I should like to put the honourable member on his oath, and see whether he would say so then. He was very quick the other day in casting a slander on all the dairymen in my district, which I hacl to refute- a statement which he dare not make on oath, any more than he would substantiate this one on oath.",51
441,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"Absolutel y true; and the honourable member knows it. . Mr FULLER - It is absolutely false, and the honourable member knows it.",52
442,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member must withdraw that statement.,52
443,Mr FULLER,Unknown,I withdraw it ; but if these interjections are made,52
444,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I ask the honourable member to confine himself to the matter before the Chair.,52
445,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"If you, sir, will stop interruptions of this character, in which I am told that I am saying what is absolutely untrue, perhaps I shall not break out in the way I did. Mr VV. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Thos e statements are contradicted on the sworn evidence of many other witnesses.",52
446,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"I have not had sufficient time to go through the evidence. It is also pointed out in the next paragraph of the report, that there are none of the elements of free bargaining in the present position; and that a dissatisfied newspaper has no recourse but to submit. I am surprised to see, for the first time, a report from honourable members, all of whom occupy a position amongst the Caucus party, objecting to a state of affairs in which there are no elements of free bargaining. I always thought they were opposed to free bargaining. Are there any elements of it in the conditions laid down in the new proposal ? Schedule A gives a list of the maximum annual charges to be made. In respect of metropolitan newspapers, they are as follows :-Sydney , £1,000; Melbourne, £1,000; Brisbane, £ 7 5 0 ; Adelaide, £ 7 5 0 ; Perth, £ 5 0 0 ; and Hobart, £500. The maximum annual charge in respect of newspapers in the chief provincial cities is to be £200, and in minor cities and towns, £ 5 0 . Certainly, those are maximum charges; but who is going to fix the real charges?",52
447,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,The owners information. Mr WEST:-The editor of the Worker embodying will give the honourable member the inforwe. ore inquiring. mation.,52
448,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"I suppose the charges will be settled satisfactorily, so far as the answerWorker is concerned. We have heard a good deal in regard to monopoly in this matter, and statements have been made that it would be absolutely impossible for any one to establish another cable service for viously his own use, or for the use of himself and vice others. But in die report, honourable memof bers will find that witness after witness [61] admitted that a new service might be established without very much difficulty. Colonel Reay, the managing director of the Melbourne Herald, said I have already expressed the opinion that it is practicable to give effect to the idea. I will now go further, and say that if we sent a cable message to our agent ih London, and also a message to our bankers, we should be furnished with another service in 24 hours. So that it does not seem to be such a difficult matter to establish a new cable service, if any persons should require it. A great deal has also been said in regard to the Associated Press of Australia representing only one side in politics. The honourable member for Calare went into the matter at great length, in order to show that the cables received in Australia represent only one side of political thought in the Old Country and here. That question was inquired into by the Commission; and Senator Pulsford, in his report, saysAs to whether the news supplied is "" garbled and inaccurate,"" no evidence in support thereof was given, nor, indeed, was it seriously sought. In fact, this portion of the attack on the press cable service may be said to have been abandoned.",52
449,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"Will the honourable member look at the reply to question No. 814, in connection with the .statement he made just now, questioning the accuracy of the draft report? He will find it in the evidence of Mr James Bell, who was connected with the Geelong Times.",52
450,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"If we are to go on in this way, it will be 10 o'clock before the debate is finished.",52
451,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,The honourable member said there was not a word in the report in support of the statement about the charges to a certain newspaper being increased by 400 per cent.,52
452,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"I have not seen any statement in the report substantiating it. of the Question 814 is as follows :Will you make a statement to the Committee vour views on the subject into which As the Minister has referred me to it, I shall take this opportunity of reading the Yes. I became connected with the Geelong Times newspaper, and remained its proprietor until June of this year-coverin g a period of some 23 years. In 1885 and 18S6, and preto those years, the charge for cable serwas ,£i2S per annum. This was at the time when the press cabling was at the rate either 3s. 6d. or 4s. a word. The ^.'128 fee prevailed, I think, until 18S8, when it was reduced to £100 per annum; in the meantime, the Cable Company had reduced their charge to about 2S. 3d. a word for press messages. This gentleman is not very definite in any ot"" his statementsOf course, I am speaking from memory. In about the year 1900, when press messages were only required to pay is. 4d. per word, the telegraphic cable service to us was increased to £125 per annum, and it remained at that until about three years ago, when we were made to pay an extra ^50 per year-o r in all £175although the Cable Company had reduced their charge in 1902 to is. per word. It will thus be seen that, notwithstanding the lowering of press messages by cable by over 400 per cent., the charge to us was increased by 75 per cent. It has been stated before your Committee that the association's service includes Inter-State items. That is perfectly correct, but so paltry and insignificant were these items that a newspaper proprietor would hardly place value upon them at all. In my own case, I rarely used the matter supplied, and when I did so, it was only done in order to fill up. Newspaper proprietors throughout the Commonwealth stand in the not very enviable position of being completely under the control of the "" Combine,"" a capitalistic monopoly which has the power either lo raise the price for the service to such an exorbitant extent, or refuse to sell the service; and therefore.it follows that the association could crush out of existence any desired journal. It is no argument to say that that power has never been used. I think if the power has not been used, is an argumentThe fact still remains-it could be done. exists. It puts a dangerous power in the hands of a monopoly such as the United Cable vice Company is. With such a possibility ing over their heads it will be difficult for your Committee to get newspaper proprietors to evidence, for fear of reprisals. If it possible to get behind the Combine's figures, showing the receipts and expenditure yearly, I venture to assert that those papers forming Combine are getting their cable service free, besides making considerable profit out of the done. business.",52
453,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,There is nothing yond that point bearing on that particular matter.,53
454,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"Why should the Minbers ister try to stop me from reading of the answer, now that he has referred me to it? It continuesIt has been slated in evidence before your Committee that the service is now superior what it used lo be. This statement. I deny. The best service I ever had during my ship was during that period when Reuter's pany were supplying cable news in opposition to the services obtained privately by The Argus and The Age-and then it was only a a year fee, while the press cabling cost, 2S. 6d. per word. During my long connection with Reuter's people, it is only fair and just for me to say that I always received at their hands every consideration and courtesy. I should like to refer to the question of the possibility of starting a new service; and. in that connection to draw attention to the detailed evidence of William Thomas Reay, described as the manager of the Melbourne Herald. The following appears in his evidence, on page 39 :77S. You are the first newspaper man who has appeared before this Committee who has expressed any regard for the public interest. Mr Mackinnon, you may be aware, distinctly refuses to reckon that the public have any interest in the matter. He regards it as simply a business concern. Do you agree with that I hope I may be excused from offering any comment on what Mr Mackinnon may have said. 779. He distinctly said lhat it was nurelv a matter of business. You say that ""in your opinion a new combination for cabling purposes could be - formed. But is it not the case that it would be practically impossible to give effect to such an idea owing to the fact that the agreements of the newspapers with the Press Association expire on different dates?- I have alreadv expressed the opinion that it is practicable' to give effect to the idea. I will now go further, and say that if we sent a cable message to our ajjent in London, and also a message to our bankers, we should be furnished with another service in 24 hours. We can therefore contemplate the situation with perfect equanimity. This is the only opportunity I have had to it look into the matter, the proposal of the Government having been brought forward It unexpectedly. If I have been at fault in my references to the evidence of the Select SerCommittee, it is because of the haste with hangwhich I have had to go through it. My give only desire is to present the case properly were to honourable members, who have not had an opportunity to thoroughly consider the this effect of the Government's proposal.",53

I come now to the question of safeguards in respect of tins legislation, l t is well known that a number of newsinstance, papers are run on lines similar to those suggested.

523,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"A daily paper circulating in Bathurst, or, indeed, any newspaper, will, under the proposed scheme, have to pay £200 for cables to supply a populano tion of 18,000 or 20,000.",58
524,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,In the case of Bathurst the charge would be £ 5 0 per annum.,58
525,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"No , because the honorparty. able member for Macquarie says that Bathurst is one of the chief provincial cities.",58
526,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,The charge of £200 is the maximum.,58
527,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"But will not the maxiopposite mum be charged when this particular Association is deciding what other people are to pay? There is absolutely no check on the Association, ancl what is described the maximum may be claimed from every paper newspaper in Australia. Whilst Bathurst newspaper will pay £200 per annum to supply 20,000 people, the Sydney Daily Telegraph, with the opportunity of circulating throughout New South Wales, and especially amongst 580,000 people its immediate neighbourhood, will pay only £1,000. The larger newspaper will pay * only five times as much as the smaller one, whereas it ought to pay twenty-seven times sition. as much on a mere population basis, and, indeed, twice as much as that again, when we consider its infinite opportunities for circulating throughout the State as a whole.",58

530,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"My honourable friends opposite are always full of suspicion of capitalistic enterprise; and here we are dealing with an Association which will have absolute authority to charge anything it likes up to the maximum. According to remarks which honourable members opposite so often addressed to this Chamber, such an Association will charge a great deal more than the maximum if it has the opportunity, and, at any rate, according to them, proit is only human nature for them to charge up to the maximum.

The Government have declined to give permission to honourable members on this side to examine the evidence taken before a Select Committee, and to consider the motion in the light of the speech of the Minister; in fact, they have declined to extend the ordinary courtesies of debate in connection with this proposal above all others.

It is strange to me to find the Minister, who has always fought every effort to subsidize the Pacinc Cable, and to reduce its charges, particuthe larly its terminal charges over the land lines at this end, and who has, time and again, resisted any concession of the kind, showing a complete reversal of form by specially subsidizing the Pacific.

578,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am not getting my own way. I am getting the Government way, and, as usual, it is the wrong way. There is a right and a wrong way of going about all these matters, and my honourable friends, somehow or other, seem always to choose the wrong. Why have they departed so fully and radically from the agreement as suggested by the Committee of the Senate, of which Senator Pearce was the chairman, and the majority were Labour members? 1 do not know why this complete departure from the recommendations of that Committee has been made, but it seems to have been coincident with the advent of the party to power in such dominating numbers. wonders what influences have been at work to so seriously modify the report which appears over the signatures of Senator Pearce, Senator Givens, Senator Findley, and the other Labour senators who formed the majority of the Committee. The Committee, in the first place, recognised the precise suggestion made by my leader this afternoon that the subsidy should be conditioned by the collection of news relating solely to the Empire, and not be for general newspaper news, such as we are in the habit of getting over the cable. It is also suggested in the report that the High Commissioner's office should be utilized for, the collection and despatch to Australia of Empire news. That is practically the suggestion made this afternoon by the Leader of the Opposition.",61
579,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,It is very absurd.,61
580,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Whateve r may be the merits of the suggestion, it is made by the Committee, and yet when it was put forward again by the Leader of the Opposition today, the honourable member for Calare warned the Minister to beware of "" any suggestion coming from the other side."" That emanated not "" from the other side,"" but from the honourable member's own side. It. came from his present leaders, who put it forward as one of the conditions to be observed before any subsidy should be paid. Moreover, they, very rightly, before any subsidy or anything else is undertaken, approach the question of an efficient cable service. Their first recommendation is for the completion of the All-Red cable route by laying down the Atlantic cable section, ard the Canadian land line, the result of which, they say, would be to make possible a substantial reduction in the charges fol press cables. Here, again, the Government seem to be beginning at the wrong end in precisely the same way as they have done in connection with the Post Office charges. The primary requirement of the public in connection with all these Government functions is an efficient service. The very first thing asked for by the newspaper proprietors who first approached the Government and the Committee, was an efficient service. I have no time to deal with the report in extenso, but I should like to quote the remarks made by Mr Robert MCMillan, who went into the matter very thoroughly, as follows: We want a complete cable from Australia across Canada, across the Atlantic, and back One again to Australia by the Red Sea. If we are going to make it a commercial concern, we must have an alternative route. That is a strong point with the Eastern Extension Company today. They have an alternative route, so that if one breaks down they have the other. Imagine my depending upon the Pacific cable for my news! The Canadian-Pacific Route service comes over the Rocky Mountains, and in a terrible storm the cable might break down. I would then be left"" absolutely without messages, whereas the Eastern Extension Company have an alternative route, and can keep up the supply. In any discussion as to forming a cable service, there must be an alternative route, because as a newspaper proprietor with big interests, I should not be dependent upon a single line over the mountains. In another part of his evidence he reverts to the same proposal, and points out, as one objection to the Pacific Cable as at present constituted, that all its messages have to go through a cable run by private enterprise. He says The Pacific cable which was going to help us so much is nothing but a sham, because my cable message goes from here to Vancouver by that service, and then it is handed to the Canadian Pacific Railway, by whom it is handed to the Atlantic Cable Company. So that my message from this country is delivered in London by the Atlantic Cable Company, which is a private concern, whose interest it is lo damn any State-owned business. So that this Pacificcable is merely one link in the necessary chain. Vou gentlemen cannot do a thing that will help us pressmen so long as you have only one link in the Imperial cable service. That is clear and definite enough, and goes fo show that even if the Government give these newspapers this subsidy",61
581,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,No newspapers get any subsidy.,61
582,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I do not mind accepting that statement for what it is worth. Shall I say that an association is to get it?,61
583,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,An association may be a proprietary concern. It does not necessarily consist of newspapers.,61
584,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am referring to the Newspaper Press Agency, which is at the very bottom of this matter, and has argued it through from start to finish.",62
585,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,There are no newsdence. papers at all in one of the present associaquoted tions.,62
586,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,To which does the honourable member refer?,62
587,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,The Independent Press Cable Association.,62
588,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Every member of that Association is a newspaper propriehim tor or manager or editor. Every man upon suggest the granting of a subsidy. it or connected with it has something to with newspaper enterprise.,62
589,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"Yes , but there is to no subsidy to any newspaper.",62
590,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Then , shall say a subsidy for the benefit of newspapers, and to provide a cable service papers? What is the difference, so far as our purposes are concerned ? Is the honor- - be? able member going to subsidize an associaagainst tion if he should find that it does not provide another cable service at all? The very purpose of the motion is to get an additional cable route for certain newssays papers which are now supposed to be put of court by the monopoly which it is said the existing newspaper proprietors have. whole intention of the proposal is to break down the existing route, the vice, and the existing newspaper monopoly. Does the Minister deny that? think he will Or can, for he has said it itself ? himself, ancl every speaker on that side so far has said the same. I am merely pointbeen ing out that we are going to subsidize vice which, on the authority of those who are agitating for it, will be a great deal more money is spent on it. The witnesses point out that to make the dian Pacific service useful it would be necessary to expend another £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 the Canadian land line, and at least another £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 on the Atlantic section of the - cable. In other words, before it is worth anything to the newspapers as a reliable and independent source of information, you must spend a million more in completing the - service. According to the evidence of persons concerned, the proposed subsidy will not be worth much to them. They say that they could not rely on messages coming the Pacific Cable, and that £1,000,00 0 should be spent in making that line ancl secure, ancl providing an alternative route. I cannot find that a subsidy asked for.",62

604,Mr CARR,Unknown,Perhaps the honourable member is not aware of the mismanagement that is caused by the international rules by which the Pacific Cable is governed?,62
605,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I knew of it before the honourable member entered Parliament, and constantly pointed out what over was necessary to put matters right.",62
606,Mr CARR,Unknown,Then why does not the honsafe orable member admit the need for help?,62
607,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I do admit it . was But this is not the best way to assist the newspaper proprietors of Australia. I Mr CARR - The honourable member objected to it on the ground that it would assist the Pacific Cable. . Mr. JOSEPH COOK - No ; my only desire is to see the Pacific Cable a success. What is first needed is an efficient service. Some years ago I begged Sir Edmund Barton, who was then Leader of the Government, to modify the present terminal charge of 5c!. a word. A cable message is conveyed across the Pacific for a very small sum. ' Sir JOHN OUICK - Ninepenc e a word.",62
608,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I believe that the Atlantic Company gets sd.. a word, while the message is conveyed across the huge stretch of the Pacific for 2d. or 3d. a word, the Canadian land lines and the Canadian Government also being paid. At this end, we charge 5d. a word.",63
609,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"The way in which to assist both the Pacific Cable and the newspapers is to reduce the terminal charges. . Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Exactly . Our charges are exorbitant; - and, before proposing a huge subsidy, we should cheapen them. A terminal charge of i d . a word would be enough. That is all, or more than, the service is worth. If we reduced the total cost of cable messages by Ad. a word, no newspaper would need assistance.",63
610,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Is it practicable to make such a reduction under the agreement with the Eastern Extension Cable Company?,63
611,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I think so. If the same reduction had to be made in regard to messages transmitted by the Eastern Extension Company, the users of the cable service would benefit. This is the evidence of Mr MCMillan, when examined by Senator FindleyWhy do you say that 5d. a word charged by the Government of the Commonwealth is too exacting?-Why should they exact 5d. when i d . would pay? You have ""gone into this matter?-Yes . I cannot understand why the Government should charge sd. a word on every word coming to us. It is totally inconsistent. I say that it is totally inconsistent. Government, believing in the State-owning of cables, should impose these high chaiges. I speak warmly, because I had to fight this matter for years. In New South Wales, I strove to prevent the taking of the very foolish action which put the Pacific Cable on a non-paying basis, and has prevented it from overtaking its losses since. To-day the Government do particular nothing to make the cable a success and encourage its use by the public. Let me now quote from the evidence of Mr James Ryan, the President of the New South Wales Provincial Press Association. He says, referring to evidence by Mr Shakespeare, which I have not had time to readIn some portions of his evidence, Mr Shakespeare gave his individual opinion, while other portions represented the opinion of the Association?- I may say that the policy of the Association in recent years is embodied in resolutions that were passed at the Conferences held in 1908 at Melbourne, and in 1909 at Brisbane. I think you have copies of those resolutions. It is practically the completion of the All Red Route, and the reduction of press transmitting charges to one penny; also the present scheme of cabling Australian news to the Mother Country is expensive, and to permit of news of similar importance being cabled to London?-That was the resolution passed in Melbourne last year. The Association asked the Government, first of all, for the completion of a cable through to London which will be entirely State-owned and State-controlled. They also desired that the charges, in respect of land lines, I presume, should be reduced to i d . per word, and wished to have some further concessions, which are set out in this report. The Chairman asked thiswitnessThat is to say, the Commonwealth shouldcollect news in London, and transmit it to Australia for dissemination through the local press? - Yes . Would you suggest that should be done through the High Commissioner's office?-We have no High Commissioner yet. The resolution is not one which embodied a scheme. It. was merely an expression of opinion. The further question was put to himHave you any suggestion to make that theCommittee might recommend to Parliament, which would assist the press of Australia to get a better or more comprehensive service? Here was the President of the New South Wales Provincial Press Association invited' by the Committee to make suggestions, and his reply wasExcepting that Parliament could provide fora substantial cheapening of cables, I do not. No know of any other. Of course, the question of a subsidy is comparatively a new one, and. has only been raised quite recently. I doubt if Parliament would sanction a subsidy. That is my personal opinion. If a subsidy were granted, there is no doubt whatever it would be easy to start a second and independent service. Mr Ryan, who went to London some timeago and made special inquiries into this matter, was then questioned about: the cost of starting a new service. Findley askedI f your Association had a guarantee of subsidy for five years of j£2,ooo to ^3,000 year, would you, as President, be prepared to care. recommend your Association to accept it? His answer wasThat guarantee would enable the Association nothing more. at once to establish a supplementary service.",63
612,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Did he mean to say Ryanthat an expenditure of £2,000 or £3,000 was standing in the way 01 the united coungeneral try press ot Australia securing such vice?",64
613,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"As a matter of Speaking fact, he went on to say that at a cost of £2,000 or £3,000 they could get a plementary service to the present one which would give them from 200 to 300 words day. Therefore we are actually going give a subsidy to the extent of providing a free service of 200 br 300 words a day. might Mr Ryan said that that would be the cost for country of a supplementary service, but that a.comWhen pletely independent service would cost much more. He figured out the cost of a service, giving 300 words a day, at over £5,000 per annum on the basis of cable messages being transmitted at the rate of is. per word. Since then the rate has been reduced to 9d. per word, so that a purely indewith pendent service would now cost about £4,000 a year. In other words, we are asked-questio n 1540to give a subsidy equal to about 60 per cent, of the total cost of an independent another cable service. The Government are going to give a supplementary service to the tent of 200 or 300 words a day to the press reply wasof the Commonwealth, and the press are not asking for it. All they ask for, acscheme cording to his evidence, is an efficient Pacific Cable and reasonable land line shoulder charges.",64
614,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"It would cost a great deal more than £2,000 a year to give all for which they asked.",64
615,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"That may be; but the Government must remember that when they have granted the subsidy they will still have this further liability to The representatives of the country press distinctly say in their evidence before the Select Committee, that unless they can get an efficient service they cannot undertake the work. The Government will, therewith fore, be met with this additional charge over and above the subsidy they have contemplation. That is not the way to tion, saidhelp the Pacific Cable. I do not think that, as a National Parliament, we have 2d.,Although Senator any right to subsidize individuals without at the same time paying some attention a to the success or otherwise of the Pacific a Cable service. That ought to be our first If we make that efficient, then, on the authority of these representative men, who are well qualified to speak, they want At page 72 of the report we find that Senator Dobson asked Mr. Are you, then, in a position to say, from your knowledge, how the Cable Association a serwork their service on the whole? His reply wasfrom hearsay, so far as I am aware, there is no substantial grievance at present by supthe country papers of this State. That was the statement of the witness who a appeared before the Committee specially to to represent country newspapersOpinions will be expressed here and there, which are purely individual, that the service be improved, or that the cost is too high papers. before the Committee in his responsible position as President of the Association, Mr Ryan said that the country press had no substantial grievance. We come now to the question whether this scheme, which is intended to benefit the country newspapers of Australia, will come into operation the payment of this subsidy. Adverting to this question again, Senator Givens Do you think, without the establishment of daily in Sydney, the country press would have the means to pay that amount? exThat is, £5,560, less 25 per cent. The I think the only financial basis on which the could rest in lhat event would be for the proposed metropolitan paper, or papers, to the burden, and afterwards to dispose of the service to the various provincial papers as best they could. Here we have a suggestion that the new Association should do precisely what the old one is doing today. It is a suggestion that a daily newspaper should take upon its shoulders the whole of this business, and sell cables to the country' newsface. papers. That is really the complaint made by newspapers at the present time with respect to present arrangements. The witness was questioned further with regard to the figures at present obtaining in connection the Pacific cables, and he set out now the total amount is apportioned. Senator in Givens. commenting on a previous quesformerly the Commonwealth got Canada 2d., the Pacific Cable 3d., and the Atlantic line 5d., now the Commonwealth get i d . , Canada i d . , the Pacific Cable 2d., and the privately-owned line 5d. Those, of course, were the rates on press messages. Under those circumstances, do you think the Slate would be justified in reducing the price to 3d.? The answer of the witness wasI can see no comprehensive way of settling the whole question, except by the establishment of an Imperial cable right across the Atlantic, which concerns Australia as an important part of the Empire more than any other part, because of the distance intervening. 1 subscribe entirely to that doctrine. That is the point at which we ought to begin. Let us give, first of all, a complete, efficient service, and then reduce die terminal charges. If we did that, the newspaper proprietors would not ask for a fraction more, and we should have, at an early date, another independent competing service. It does seem to me that the Government are forcing tiiis subsidy on the people concerned, instead of doing what the people themselves suggest as an alternative. There are some turther references in the report with which I do not wish to weary the House; but L suggest that honourable members should caretully examine it. lf they do, they will find that the proposals of the Government set aside this report, which was framed by four of their own party. Why the change has come over the scene I do not know. I can only suggest that those in powei are now expected to do something iri teturn for the support they have received from newspapers outside the Association, and Labour papers in particular. Our cable services are not completely satisfactory. I am not here as an advocate for the present condition of affairs. It' might be improved. is nothing so important in these outposts of the Empire as a full and free circulation of news in relation to all that affects Imperial interests. I have before to-dny suggested that the Government might very well arrange for a column ot news concerning the doings of the Empire, to be sent every day over the Pacific Cable for dissemination in Australia. But whaf are the Government doing here? They are imposing no condition as to the kind of news that is to be transmitted. Are honourable members going to agree to a subsidy of £2,500 a year, and to the transmission of messages over the Pacific Cable practically free of charge for these newspapers, without our having some voice in determining the class of news that Mr Joseph Cook. is to be received? For instance, are we going to subsidize cable messages such as those relating to the Jack Johnson light, and other matters, to which the Leader of the Opposition has alluded today? The logical corollary to a proposal of this kind is that we should use the High Commissioner's office in London to supervise the news that is to be sent, and restrict messages to matters relating to the interests of the Empire in its world-wide relations and the interests of Australia in particular. If the Government do that, I shall be disposed to look with approval upon any such proposal.",64
616,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,A newspaper is a commercial venture.,65
617,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Of course it is, and so long as it pays for its own news in its own way, the matter has nothing to do with any one else. But it has to do with these newspapers when they find themselves confronted with Government charges, which, as I have said for many years, are extortionate, and ought not to be imposed. If we put down the terminal charges from 5d. to i d . or 2d. per word, we should have such an accession of business over the Pacific Cable portion of the line as would convert it from a nonpaying into a highly payable undertaking. We owe a duty to the Pacific Cable, irrespective altogether of the way in which the 'enterprises of newspaper people are going to be affected. I can find nothing in the evidence which suggests that a subsidy should be paid; but I find suggestion after suggestion that an efficient service should be given at a cheap rate, and then the newspapers will be able to "" gang their ain gait"" without special consideration. There Air. W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) [6.15] - I join with other honourable members in protesting against this motion, 01 new business of any kind, being sprung oa Opposition members without the slightest warning, while important measures, which we have been led to believe would be dealt with as nearly as possible in their order on the .business-paper, are set aside. We have a right to protest against thus being taken at a disadvantage, precluded, as we are, from giving any consideration to the proposal submitted. This motion has been flung nn the table, nohody knowing until this morning that it was to be submitted. The Government, after professing to be most anxious to proceed with measures of primary importance, have, without any request or desire on the part of the Opposition, voluntarily thrown these aside for the purpose of introducing proposals which are certainly not of an urgent character. Honourable members on this side are thus called upon to deal with questions at a moment's notice which they have had no opportunity of looking into. Of course, there is a reason for this course of action; hut that reason does not appear on the surface; it has not been mentioned by the Minister, or by any honourable members opposite, but has been carefully kept in the background, although it is well known. This motion is an absolute contradiction of all the professed principles of the Labour party, and is a flat negation of their Socialistic platform. It is a proposal for insuring against financial loss a private Capitalistic company engaged for its own profit in catering to supply a commodity for other private Capitalistic enterprises run also for their own profit; in short, the primary purpose is to insure that Capitalistic syndicate against loss in a new venture in opposition to an established venture. Here we have a professedly Socialistic Government, representing a Socialistic party, proposing to subsidize with public moneys a private Capitalistic syndicate which is being formed, or . has been formed, purely as a private profit-making speculation. This is further evidence of the inconsistency so characteristic of the Government since the 13th April last; but they, of course, will have to answer to their constituents. It cannot be alleged', on any ground of public necessity or policy, that a proposal of this kind is needed. only pretence in its favour is so farcical p.nd transparent as to deceive nobody. It is said that the object is to have cable news disseminated under a subsidy for the purpose of educating the public; but, as a matter of fact, the country press argument is a mere stalking horse. The real intention was disclosed first by an interjection from the able member for Calare, secondly, in a speech by the honourable member for Robertson, thirdly, in an extract which appeared in the Standard of Empire, to which I called attention in the form of a question some days ago, and, fourthly, by a statement in the evidence submitted to the Select Committee. All these point to one reason, and one reason only, why this proposal to subsidize a private venture is brought forward in this hurried way.",65
618,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"That is like the honnot orable member's statement about the Labut bcur party and the navy. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - That alleged statement was never made, and has no foundation in Fact, as the honourable member well knows, for it was contradicted as soon as it was published, and has been frequently contradicted since, and the Minister knows it. The interjection, which is entirely out of order, is only for the purpose of actual misrepresentation. I have had occasion to draw attention to an extract from the Standard of Empire in reference to "" Australia's new cable service,"" containing the following :The Commonwealth Government has definitely announced its decision to grant a subsidy of £6,000, extended over three years, to the recently created Independent Press Cable Association of Australia. This proposed Cable Association is a private Capitalistic business speculation, and it is most significant that, immediately this cable is sent Home, we have this proposal. Is this a public purpose? As a matter of fact, there is every reason to believe it is simply a proposal to use public money for party and political purposes, and nothing else. That is the only inference we cangather from the statements made today, from the evidence before the Select Committee, and from the report I am quoting. The paragraph goes on to sayThe subsidy is expected to begin from next monthThat is the reason for this sudden interruption of public business to rush a private subsidy through-it is that the subsidy may The begin at once. and is intended lo stimulate the cable service of news published mainly in the organs of the Labour party, and in various rural newspapers. Complaints had been made that the existing cable news service did nol cater sufficiently to Labour interests. When I - asked the, question the other day, honour the statement that such a cable had been sent was denied,' on the authority of a gentleman connected with the press. Mr BATCHELOR,- I read the exact cablegram today. Did the honourable member hear it? Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - No . Will the Minister deny that the Labour party is going to benefit by this service? It is all very well for the Minister to try to side-track us, but we all know what is underlying the proposal, which is nuv£e> in the interests of the country press, in the interests of starting a certain daily city Labour newspaper, more than in the interest of any other section of the community. Had such action been taken in the interests of any other party, honourable members opposite would bave been the first to denounce it as ""political jobbery."" I ask leave to continue my speech on a future occasion. Leave granted; debate adjourned. House adjourned at 6.30 p.m.",66
