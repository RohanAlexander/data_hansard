My first area of concern relates to the Great ergy white paper identified four sensitive offshore the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park as high priority discover this. I have expressed the view previously threaten the Great Barrier Reef, which is of known that an oil slick can travel for many outside the reef, given prevailing currents for the reef and the tourism industries which people visit the reef and it is at the heart 200,000 people owe their livelihoods. I have felt sufficiently strongly about this bill which would extend the Great Barrier Reef would have the effect of prohibiting mining government have not supported my private member's supported it, particularly as I now see in the basins and the oil-drilling proposal. If I read ploration in these areas is in Australia's interest I am very concerned about that, and I want to for the Environment and Heritage, first, about were dealing with when I introduced the private TGS-NOPEC to drill in the Townsville Trough. ruled this out? Secondly, what is the government's the Environment and Heritage's position, regarding that it is okay for us to have oil exploration would occur if there were a spill or an accident matter of extreme concern. The second issue I want to raise at this spending. In January last year there was greenhouse spending called ‘Missing the Target', would take to spend the alleged $1 billion dedicated standing that what is called GGAP Round 3 is Monday, 21 June 2004 ----took the chair at 5.31 p.m. APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 1) 2004-2005 Consideration in Detail Department of Environment and Heritage understand that there are informal consideration in detail of each appropriation.

Is their position in these areas, having regard to the damage which of some kind? I indicate that I regard this as a point concerns Australian government greenhouse a very good analysis of Australian government which talked about the amount of time it to greenhouse issues. It is now my underto be the final round, to the value of just $30 NA million, and that we will end up with the situation to GGAP but, after all three rounds, $178 million this figure itself may be revised downwards and/or fail to reach milestones. I also expressed concern about what the seen from the minister's press release of May abatement projection figures. I express concern ficult number to have confidence in and express less than what is being claimed, which is a Australians emit the highest per capita emissions more than either France or Italy in total, never the United Kingdom. So I raise that question secretary and also the question of oil exploration",157

The member for Wills asked Trough. I will take that on notice and get status of spending on the Australian GreenThe Australian government is very proud that that was looking at how to reduce greenhouse Australia-which has a very large greenhouse gas ways the Australian Greenhouse Office when it early initiatives like GGAP required quite a few to get up to speed to make best use of that grant discussion and there is no limit right now and no promised or put on the table. It is a case of applications that meet the criteria of this protargets that Australia has put upon itself and continue to be concerned that these areas for oil exploration. The Parliamentary Secretary talks about what the government has been NA doing in relation to the marine park, but things very much jeopardised and undermined by oil such a sensitive area. In relation to greenhouse spending, the advice has occurred in the Greenhouse Office budget-$136 2002-03; and $27 million in 2003-04. Further, 05 is $71 million, compared with the original would be a rate of $250 million a year. So around saying, ‘We're going to spend a hundred 100 years,' but the point is that spending delayed where the Greenhouse Gas Abatement Program dence that it is genuinely improving Australia's emissions. I want to move on-become of the shortness for a response regarding two other matters. The the Solomons.

I will the words from the next speaker. the time constraints. I would like to ask the the Environment and Heritage a few questions in NA relation to the PM's energy statement made tion to Sydney airport. Firstly, as for the geosequestration of carbon know how practical that is because I make the have to bury three tonnes of carbon dioxide. Hunter Valley consumes about 24,000 tonnes 72,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide per day, and derground. As you would be aware, carbon dioxide have to be compressed and piped to some remote been advised that it is not even a remote possibility, why not? To do all this, it will cost lots of a power station's output. If this is correct, what true that solar power stations are advancing coal without the added cost of burying the carbon dioxide? I have one question in relation to Sydney on notice. I understand that the phrasing of airport implicitly denies environmental impacts by the Airports Act 1996, and other environmental use and planning factors associated with works what action will the minister take to ensure if none, why not?",161

This particular fund will technologies across a whole spectrum of energy sources. This is just one of those opportunities. It yet on the table for us to have a full-blown geosequestration is one of the ways we can dioxide back into very stable strata where it before there is any likelihood of this carbon there.

As I partment of Foreign Affairs and Trade said berra started receiving these situation reports have been receiving these reports from sometime Canberra they were passed on from 24 November.

They are not dealing with quite specific matters which relate Red Cross and the role of the coalition authorities are most serious matters. The key questions taken and, if no action was taken, why was saying back in September that he had established these sorts of convention obligations were adhered to. The other thing I would like to touch on What I have dealt with so far is, firstly, what tive office in Baghdad; secondly, what information office and other sources to the Iraq legal task Trade in Canberra; and, thirdly, what actually parliament last September that he had established ensure that all obligations under the Geneva being met. What about the Minister for Foreign said in relation to his knowledge of the sorts photographs released on 28 April that his first came from January, referring to a press release There is a little problem which has now emerged Last week in question time in the House of Representatives he came into possession of this little document tional report of July 2003 entitled Memorandum will recall that I made some reference to that, part of the discussion between officials in Baghdad other officials and directly with Amnesty legal watch group in response to that situation rep which referred to ‘very serious allegations' Again, what was done in response to that? is often referred to as the Muggleton report, to detention issues and ‘makes some obin a broadbrush way on detention issues'. We understand it, that these matters were raised in Iraq legal watch group in Canberra, but we are the Iraq legal watch group once that information is the situation report of 2 May.

These that we seek answers to are: what action was it not taken? The minister was quite explicit in this Iraq legal watch group to ensure that is the question of the minister's own knowledge. information came to the Australian representacame from the Australian representative force and the Department of Foreign Affairs and went on to the minister-he who boasted in this thing called the Iraq legal task force to convention in relation to detained prisoners were Affairs himself?
