2,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"In view of the anxiety amongst cotton-growers for information as to the price to be paid for raw cotton next season, will the Prime Minister announce the decision of the Government on the question of the payment of a Commonwealth bounty on cotton asked for by Queensland cotton-growers?",14
3,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"The question of substituting a bounty on cotton for the present guaranteed payments to cotton-growers was, as the law required, submitted to the Tariff Board for consideration. The members of the board visited Queensland, took evidence there, and carried out. a full investigation. Its report was received by the Minister for Trade and Customs a few days ago, and will be dealt with by the Cabinet with a view to an early decision.

There is, therefore,, no necessity for an agenda paper. But, to assist the State Governments, they have been informed of the views of the Commonwealth Government on various aspects of it. We have sent to them a memorandum, of which all the Premiers now possess copies. Mr E. RILEY - When was it sent? M T. BRUCE - The Premiers received it yesterday, and will have an opportunity of considering the Commonwealth's proposals and of discussing them with - their Cabinets before attending the conference.

BRUCEThat the bill be now read a second time.",17
29,Mr CHARLTON,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,"Hunter ) [3.22] - The measure now before the chamber is very important, inasmuch as it deals with the future government and administration of the Northern Territory. It will be readily admitted that some action should be taken to expedite the development of the Northern Territory. That territory comprises a very large area, and this Parliament has the duty of developing it in such a way that it will absorb a large white population. The Territory was transferred to the Commonwealth by South Australia in 1911, but I regret to say that up to the present the Federal author it y bas made very little progress with its development. The problem is difficult, but if more attention were paid to the assistance of agriculture and mining, especially in connection with the expenditure of loan money for the promotion of immigration and land settlement, more useful results would follow than from the immigration and land settlement schemes undertaken in the different States. Although Ave have authoritative testimony that there is in the Territory l and ' which, if preperly opened up, would afford a comfortable living to many thousands of people, the Commonwealth has done practically nothing to settle it , apart from letting large areas on long leases - for pastoral purposes. The Commonwealth is committed to the borrowing of £35,000,000 for immigration to the various States. No properlydevised scheme has been evolved by the Commonwealth and States, but the I m perial, Federal, and State Governments have undertaken to share the responsibilit y for the interest on that money. The national debt is to be augmented by that amount, and I believe that that additional obligation would have more justification if the money were to be expended for the development and settlement ' of the Northern Territory instead of in promoting an influx of people to settle in the States and to engage in employments involving. in some cases, the further ing of an already over-stocked market. It is idle to complain backwardness of the Northern while we fail to evolve any sive scheme for its development. fact is well known that every new settler in New South ""Wales costs the Government between £2,000 and £3,000, and probably the expenditure per head would be sufficient to inducepeople to take up land in the Territory and engage in agriculture the raising of sheep and cattle. that the proposed commission will introduce a closer settlement have very wide powers, and will, in fact, practically govern the Northern tory, subject, of course, to control of the finances. charge of railway construction, telegraphs, telephones, boring for water, water conservation, ports and Therefore, it is necessary that the Government should appoint the best men available to serve on the The Commonwealth should make no further mistakes with the Territory; ward policy has been too long Por that I do not blame any government; all political equally at fault. Por poses of the commission ritory is to be divided parts. This means, creation of a new State. tralia will comprise all the land in the Territory north of the 20th parallel of latitude, and containing miles; and Central Australia land south of the 20th parallel, and containing 236,400 square miles. ment representatives will be stationed at .Darwin and at Alice Springs, visory committees will be appointed, to consist of four members, nominated and two to be elected the Commonwealth franchise. pleased that the bill makes provision for some of the members of these Councils to be elected, for it is right that the residents of the Territory, who are most concerned in its development, some voice in the selection of those who are to play an important part in its public affairs.

RILEY - Despit e the amount of should have money that has been expended there.",18
30,Mr CHARLTON,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,"Notwithstanding our expenditure, in a period of fifteen remunera- years the population has increased by only 355 persons. That is a very seriouswill be position, and an endeavour should be made to correct it . The Commonwealth Year-Book contains the following figures in regard to mineral production in the Territory:Year. Total value of 191920 - .. 80,101 192021 . . 19,003 192122 .. 9,959 192223 .. 10,612 192324 .. .. 18,856 So far the mineral production has been small, but if transport facilities were provided I believe that it would be considerably increased. The possibilities are great, and they require only development. A successful mining venture is frequently the means of making a country. The discovery of gold or any other mineral in payable quantities attracts a large population, which, when the mines begin to peter out, is often absorbed in other forms of production. That was the experience of Western Australia. In the early days in that State the gold-fields attracted excellent types of men and women from the eastern States. Many of those persons subsequently became engaged in agricultural production. We must see that opportunities are provided for carrying on mining and every other activity in the ""Territory. The following statement appears in the annual report of the Administrator for the year ended the 30th June, 1924: Mining returns show a distinct and welcome improvement, taken as a whole-this being especially so in the case of gold, the yield for 1923-4 having more than quadrupled in value that of 1922-3, but, unfortunately, a decrease in the production of tin ore caused the total yield from raining during 1923-4 to exceed that of 1922-3 by only £2,273 in value. But this is evidence of an upward tendency, and reasonable hopes are {entertained that it will continue. The Commonwealth Tear-Book discloses the following position in regard to live stock:Year. Horses. Cattle. Sheep. Pigs. 1910 24,509 513,383 - 57,240 990 1915 19,957 433,961 57,827 500 1921 39,565 568,031 6,349 452 1922 39,845 760,766 0,161 361 1923 44,603 843,718 4,728 647 Whilst horses and cattle have increased, the number of sheep has fallen f r o 57,240 to 4,728. Apparently the T e r r tory is of no use for the stocking of sheep. On the 28 th May last the honourable memto ber for the Northern Territory (Mr . son) urged the appointment of a committee to inquire into and report to the Government upon the best'means of developminerals. ing the Territory. I supported him in £ that suggestion, but it was not accepted. Subsequently Dr Stefansson traversed the Territory and furnished to the Government a report which contained some very interesting statements, one of which was the following: The Northern Territory, in my opinion, should have a permanent. Department of Geology with work following out a definite programme through a period of years. The first and chief man of the department should, in my opinion, bo a specialist in underground water supply. When the resources of the department grow, otlier men could .be added to concern themselves with oil, gold, coal, or other minerals. Dr Stefansson also statedI should judge that in the country covered by our actual visit and our inquiries, the number of cattle and of settlers could be multiplied by at least four over the present numbers if wells were found, and, as stated above, it seems likely that wells can be found at such distances from each otlier as to enable stockmen to occupy nearly, or quite, the entire area. 'Even more urgent than finding the stock wells to enable the increase of grazing is the providing of more numerous wells and bores to facilitate driving the stock to market. It seems evident that the number of wells, even on the chief route now in use, should be considerably increased, perhaps by a third or a half. That statement indicates that, given a better water supply, the population of the Territory could at once be multiplied by four. I trust that, if the commission is appointed, it will make the provision of additional wells one of its first duties. A f t e r all, it is of no use for us to build railways into the Northern Territory unless we make some provision for them to get freight. To be profitable, they must have business, and we must settle people in the Territory to give them Goats. Camels. business. Dr Stefansson also saidDoubtless much of - the land from the Macdonnell ranges north will eventually prove suitable for wheat, orchards, &c, but that still 19.385 494 leaves a vast area which, for the present at 18,086 470 least, seems to be stock country only. 25,647 579 That report is an endorsement of the view that I expressed earlier in this speech. m Seeing that there is land suitable for i - orchards and wheat-growing in the Northern Territory, it would be wiser for us spend some of the money that we proNelpose to borrow for immigration purposes in settling people there than to spend it all in the more settled states. The population in our settled areas will continue to increase without a great deal of governmental encouragement; but we must hold out some inducement to get people to settle in the Northern Territory. I believe that it would be worth our while to spend as much as a few thousand pounds a head in settling white people there. The duty rests upon us to populate this country as quickly, as we can. We cannot expect to hold it if we leave it vacant, and, as the work must be done,, we shall be well advised to take it in hand at once. While the States deserve what help we can give them, because their interests are identical with Our own, we nevertheless have a special interest in the Northern Territory. Another paragraph in Dr Stefansson's report readsThere is no doubt that practically every in central Australia - wants a railway badly, and it should be built if you have the means; but if you have not the means, you can, a comparatively small expenditure, neverthedated less, build up the country fairly rapidly, incidentally thereby providing business for railway whenever it is built. That valuable report should help, not only the Government, but also this proself-supporting, posed commission to face more confithe whole community. dently the problems that await settlement in the Northern Territory. Mr J . B . Cramsie, formerly president of the Australian Meat Council, has challenged this scheme of the Government. following paragraph is taken from a paper report of his remarks in that nexion :If over a Government had over-estito mated a proposition the present Federal the Northern Territory. Government are doing so. Every time an perimental scheme of development had been tried it had failed, and under the proposed bill there will be a repetition of that failure. I hope that Mr Cramsie's view is not rect. I trust to see the proposed mission do good work. I have no desire to offer any opposition to this measure. realise the urgent necessity to do someritory thing to populate the country. this is the best plan to adopt remains to seen; but at least the bill should lead better system of administration, in itself should encourage development. Unquestionably this Parliament is too removed from the Territory to give it attention it deserves. Until the honorproblems Mr Charlton. able member for Northern Territory (Mr . Nelson) entered this House a few years ago, very few of us realized the magnitude of the task that we are now facing. I wish to give Mr Nelson full credit for having opened our eyes to the nature of this problem. He directed our attention not only to the vastness of the area there that we control, but also to the sparse population there. He has rendered good service to his constituents in particular, and Australia in general, by pointing out, at every opportunity, the necessity for prompt action to develop the Territory. If he had not become a member of this Parliament I doubt very much whether we should have been as far ahead with developmental' projects there as we are. I do not know whether this scheme will meet with his approval, but I shall not oppose it , for I realise that we must do everything we possibly can to settle a one white and self-supporting population in the Territory. It is impossible for ns to go on year after year administering the with Northern Territory, Papua, and the ManTerritories, at a huge loss, for that the means that the people of the Commonwealth must be constantly finding money to meet the deficits. The sooner we can develop these territories, and make them the better it will be for",19
31,Mr NELSON,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,"Northern Territory ) [3.47] - I am glad that at last the Commonwealth Government is taking some deThe finite step to develop the Northern Terrinewstory. A movement such as this is has conbeen far too long delayed. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) referred the decrease in the number of sheep in That followed exthe decision of the proprietors of the Avon Downs station, in Queensland, to give up sheep and grow cattle, because of the comparative ease with which cattle corcan be transported, and the difficulty in comsending wool from the station to the market. It had nothing whatever to do I with the capacity of the Northern Terto carry sheep. In June, 1924, Mr . Whether Justice Powers visited the Northern Terbe ritory to inquire into the matter of an in to a dustrial dispute between the Nort h Ausand that tralia Industrialists Union and the Commonwealth Railways Commissioners. In far delivering his judgment, His Honour the made some interesting comments on the that have to be faced there. The following is a paragraph from his judgment :If the blacks, numbering some thousands, were not employed on the stations, the great majority would have to come into Darwin and be fed by the Government. It is admitted that they are entitled to employment in the country which has been taken from them because they did not make use of it. If Australia does not make use of the Territory, some other nation may make the same claim as we did. I consider that to be a logical statement. There is no doubt that we took the country from the blacks because they did nothing with it , and that we ourselves are doing nothing with it . If some unfriendly nation should dispute our right to hold the Northern Territory on the same ground that we disputed the right of the blacks to hold it , I do not see how we could logically defend ourselves. passing strange that on almost every occasion when a visit of honourable members of this Parliament to the Northern Territory has been suggested in order that they might become better qualified to deal with prospective legislation for it , the visit has been poned until after the proposed measures have been passed. That is a great mistake. It is impossible for honourable members who have not been to the Territory to visualize the conditions there. If a representative party of honourable members visited the Territory, they would be able to obtain first-hand evidence from settlers, and with the knowledge they would acquire would be able to refute many of the assertions made in this House. The bill indicates at least a desire on the part of the Government to do something, and to that extent I applaud it . The right honourable the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce), in the course of .his second-reading speech on this bill, stressed the defence and White Australia aspects of the question. I regard the defence aspect as very serious. Expenditure on the Territory ought to be regarded, not as a dole to the people there, but as expenditure for defence in any other part of Australia would be regarded. The Northern Territory, and the north-west of Western Australia have thousands of miles of undefended coastline. would be useless, or next to useless, to establish a few isolated garrisons there unless they were backed by a white, virile, and patriotic population. Until that is done, the national aspirations of Australia will remain in jeopardy. From a defence point of view alone expenditure on the development of the Territory is justified, and as a step towards the realization of the great national ideal of a White Australia, it cannot be challenged. The Prime Minister's speech was in striking contrast to the speeches made in another place, and it was gratifying to learn that he, at least, has the interests of Northern Australia at heart. He spoke of the early settlements in the Northern Territory. They were made a little over 100 years ago, and, like many that followed, failed. It is interesting to read the accounts of the early settlements!, for they show that in every case It is the settlers had no faul t to find with the productivity of the land. It was with, them, as it is with the settlers of today. So long as the same conditions apply the failures of 100 years ago will be repeated. The early settlers failed, not because they could not produce, and not because they post- could not live in the climate, but because of the cost of transport. Communication with the outside world was so difficult and costly that it was impossible for them to advance. I do not place the blame for the present condition of things particularly on the present Government; but, on the other hand, it is useless for this, or any other, Government to attempt to develop the Territory by the means that have been followed in the past. The chief, and, in fact, the only, cause of failure has been the cause that governments have consistently ignored. They have neglected to annly a fundamental principle of development, and 'have thus made development impossible. Until such time as railways, roads, water, ports, and other necessary utilities are supplied, all future attempts to develop the Territorv must be as futil e as the efforts of the past. The right honourable the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition both laid stress on the huge sums of money spent in the Territory. It is true that large sums have been expended, and it is also true that the exIt penditure has been barren of result; but that is accounted for by the fact that there is no transportation, and that governments have ignored a fundamental necessity of development. H a d successive governments concentrated on the fundamentals of development, I am satisfied that quite a different talc could be told today. The right honourable the Prime Minister also said that frequent ministerial changes were to a great extent responsible for lack of continuity in policy. I agree with that view, but I fail to see how the bill will provide a remedy. Want of continuity of policy, no doubt, has had a retarding effect on development, but the bill will still leave the onus of responsibility on a Minister. The commission"" will act merely as an advisory committee, and it will be competent for the Minister to accept or reject its advice; and thus we shall return to ;the condition of affairs which the Prime Minister said has been one of the causes of retrogression. He also said that the development of the Territory was a job for "" b i g "" men, with large capital, and that it was cruelty to send small men there. That is a statement about which I must cross swords with him. I do so because it is quite contrary to the facts. The small man, starting with no capital, is the man who is making good, and there are hundreds of such mien. They are engaged in mining and cattle-raising principally, but a number of them are raising sheep. Mr WEST,-What about maize?",21
32,Mr NELSON,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,"It is premature to talk about growing maize in the Northern Territory. When those men went into the Territory their only assets were their hands and the will to conquer; and they have conquered in a great many cases. There are men who went there penniless and are now in a good financial position. I , and no doubt some other honourable members, know of men who started by working on stations, received their wages in stock, later took up land, and in a few years became prosperous. All they, as cattle-raisers, ask of the Government is that it should assist them by providing adequate water supplies; and even for that they are willin g to pay. The cost of the service may be loaded on to the rent of their holdings, or recovered in any other way the Government chooses. If railways are provided, there are unquestionably huge areas of land that will be used for sheep. When the ex-Minister for Works and Railways (Mr . Stewart) went through the Territory, he called at a station covering 2,000 square miles. He questioned the owner on the possibility of raising sheep, and was informed that if the Government would provide transport facilities he would be prepared to select 20,000 acres of his land and put it under sheep, and that he would ""never look back."" We should disabuse our minds of the idea that the Northern Territory is a place only for big men with big capital. It is essentially a place for small men. W it h a little sympathetio assistance from the Government we might have numerous settlements of small men in the Territory. A f t e r all, . the real backbone of a country is its small settlers, and not big men with capital. In the Northern Territory there are many tracts of country 12,000, 14,000, and 20,000 square miles in extent with only five or six single men employed on them; but in the areas in which settlement by small men has taken place we have married couples with families. These are the settlers who are beneficial to a country. If we concentrate upon assisting to settle small men I am satisfied that, given adequate railway facilities, it will be found that there is no"" problem to solve in the development of the Northern Territory. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) drew attention to the fact that the expenditure of huge sums of money on immigration is proposed. I am satisfied that it would not take anything over £2,000 or £3,000 to settle a man in a small way in the Northern Territory, and with 500 sheep a settler of the class to be found there now could make good. The result of such settlement would soon be manifested in a great production of wool.",23
33,Mr MANNING,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,Does the honourable member say that a man could make good in the Northern Territory with 500 sheep ?,23
34,Mr NELSON,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,"Yes , I say so from experience. I know men who have made good there with 500 sheep. I do not suggest that a man going into the country with 500 sheep would make a good living straight away, . but under the system adopted there a man working for a settler shepherding sheep may be given a number of sheep in lieu of wages, and in a few years is able to stock a place for himself.",23
35,Mr MANNING,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,What part of the Northern Territory was visited by the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart) when Minister for Works and Railways ?,23
36,Mr NELSON,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,"Centra l Australia, as far as Barrow Creek. The Prime Minister, in support of - the statement concerning the lack cf a continuous policy in the past, mentioned that we have not yet. a geological survey of the Northern Territory. That is true, and very regrettable, because it has unlimited mineral possibilities, the development of which can scarcely be said to have yet been commenced. There are in Central Australia known deposits of mineral wealth that in any other part of Australia, having reasonable transport facilities, would be profitably developed. That is why I say that the mistake made in the past has been the total ignoring of the fundamental principles of development. If those principles are applied I am satisfied that the Northern Territory may be rapidly developed. should be said that the speech of the Prime Minister in introducing the bill was very encouraging from an Australian point of view. It showed that he had got away from parochialism and viewed the question with a broad national outlook. That is the way honourable members must face this question, because, after all, it is this Parliament that is responsible for the development, or lack of development, in the Northern Territory. It is unnecessary that I should enlarge upon the benefit which will accrue to the people of the Northern Territory, and the stability which will be given to Australia, by the application in the Northern Territory of the fundamental principles of settlement. I may say that in the recent drought Queensland lost something like 4,000,000 sheep, and they could all have been saved had the Northern Territory, been opened up by railways. Whilst I am prepared to admit that, in a manner of speaking, this bill is a demonstration of the goodw ill of the Government, I am definitely of opinion that in many cases Ministers have been very badly advised. I say this because of the many anomalies which the bill contains, which are due to lack of local knowledge. It is this ignorance of local conditions in the Northern Territory that accounts for the mistakes which' appear in the bill. As it stands, it will not be a panacea for the evils in the Territory. It will not lift it out of the slough of despond into which it has been plunged by successive governments; but, if intelligently administered, there is a germ of development in the measure. Tf the advice of the people who have battled along in the Northern Territory for 20 or 30 years, have overcome their difficulties, and understand its problems, were sought, I am satisfied that the Government could considerably improve the bill. When the Northern Territory Land Bill was before this chamber, I moved an amendment to the effect that its consideration should be deferred pending the visit of a select committee of this House to the Northern Territory, with a view to its reporting its conclusions after personal inspection of. the country. Unfortunately, that amendment was defeated; but I say it would be wise, even now, to send a committee of members of this House to the Northern Territory, that it It might advise as to whether the bill now under consideration represents a forward . or a retrogressive step. In dealing with important legislation of this character, it is right that honourable members should be conversant with the questions upon which they are asked to legislate. As they have not had an opportunity of visiting the Territory and knowing its conditions, I contend that we should draw upon the knowledge gained by the pioneers of the Northern Territory as the result of very great efforts. These people have rights which should be considered. I was very much struck with a report of a speech delivered by. the Prime' Minister at Ballarat, which appeared in the Age of 6th June, 1925, from which I make the following quotation;Since - Australia had claimed the right to sign the peace treaty as a separate nation, and to enter the League of Nations as a separate people, that national right had a great obligation. They should use their influence as a nation to establish the ideals for which the war was fought. The war waa fought for the protection of small nations and the peace of all nations, recognizing that a small community of people had rights ns 1 well as a large community. I say ""Hear, hear!"" to the Prime M in ister's statement that small communities have rights, ancl I claim that the small community in the Northern Territory has exceptional rights. The men who have blazed the track, done the spadework of development, pushed out from civilization into unknown parts of Australia, and torn from mother earth a livin g to prove to Australia and the world that the Northern Territoiy man's country, have very great Because they happen to be few in number, and do not make up a quota under our electoral law, they are given no rights whatever. In view of the special knowledge of the Northern Territory these people have acquired, it would be wise if provision were made they would be given the right to elect at least one of the members of the proposed commission. I am informed immediately this bill becomes law, the constitutional aspect of this will be challenged. I am not going to discuss that phase of the question, as I have no legal knowledge on the points involved. It would appear from the bill that only the northern part of the Territory is capable of wealth duction, aud that is a to which I take very strong tion. If the intention is to give Central Australia a fair go, there is nothing in this bill to indicate it. In my the laying down of a definite mental policy for Central Australia is as necessary as it is for North Australia. logical thing to do would be either to increase the number of members of the proposed commission, and have trative centres in both the north and south of the Territory, or give the southern section a small commission with the same powers as those proposed to be vested in the commission for the north. course were followed, it would ably augment the speedy development of the Northern Territory. It is of no use to say that Central Australia can be effectively administered from Melbourne, because experience over a number of years has proved the contrary. The people in the southern section of the Territory will labour under great disadvantages under this bill. Quite men in the southern section of the Territory were desirous of taking up land. land, was to be gazetted, and these men were awaiting developments. was gazetted in the Government in Darwin, but it was not until six weeks later that the people in Central knew that it was gazetted. The land was taken up long before they knew that it was gazetted for lease or otherwise. the northern commission is to administer the whole of the lands of the Mr Helton. is a white Northern Territory similar difficulties rights. will occur in the future. The contention that administrators in Melbourne are capable of looking after the southern section of the Northern Territory will not stand examination. which Land settlement is one of the principal mediums of development. Every applicawhereby tion for land in Central Australia would have to be sent to Melbourne, would then be referred to Darwin, and referred back that again to Melbourne. If a commission were appointed for Central Australia with legislation powers similar to those to be given to the northern commission there would be no necessity for such delays. The whole of the lands north and south of the 20th parallel of latitude could be administered separately. The people of Central pro- Australia, in being subjected to the conclusion inconveniences to which they will excep- have to submit under this bill, are not being given a fair deal. I agree with those who claim that the disopinion, tance of the southern portion of the Terdevelop- ritory from Darwin is too great to permit of its effective administration from A the north, but to a certain extent that disability could be overcome even if the powers of the commission, with its headadminis- quarters at Newcastle Waters, were enlarged to embrace the whole of the Territory. B y the application of modern means of transport, such as' aeroplanes, I think the disability would be considerably If that diminished. Certainly, mails which now consider- take weeks and weeks to convey could reach their destination in a day. . But, unfortunately, as it is not contemplated to make use of these modern means of transport, the distances of the Territory w i ll continue to be exceedingly great, rendering local autonomy necessary in its Northern various sections. If it is intended to cut the Territory into halves in order to recently expedite administration, in my opinion, all land matters south of the 20th parallel The of south latitude should be administered from Alice Springs, and separately The land from those of that portion of the TerriGazette tory north of the 20th parallel. This bill will not remove from the people of Australia Central Australia the disability of having a long drag t© Darwin in connection with the administration of justice, beIf cause all appeals from decisions of magistrates in the southern portion of the Territory must be heard at Darwin. The appointment of a circuit court judge to deal with these matters would overcome, many of the disabilities now suffered by the people of Central Australia. what I can see, the administration of this portion of the Territory will always be subservient to the commission. In my search for"" any provision setting out the powers of the administration of Central Australia. I could find nothing to guide me, except sub-clause 3 of clause 48, which providesThe Government Resident shall exercise and per (orai all power's and functions that belong to his office according to such instructions as are given to him by the Minister. Yet we are told that the ideal of the bill is to avoid lack of continuity of policy by the removal of the responsibility of the Minister. As a matter of fact, the effect will be just the opposite, so far as Central Australia is concerned. furthe r illustration of the disadvantages the residents of this portion of Australia are likely to suffer, let me read clause 29, which is as follows:- < (1) The revenue of the commission shall consist of the following moneys:(a) Charges for services; (6) Moneys received in pursuance of any by-law made under this act or any ordinance administered by the commission; (c) Moneys appropriated by the Parliament of the Commonwealth for the purposes of. the development of the Territory; (rf.) Fines recovered for any contravention of(i) Any by-law made under this (ii) Any ordinance administered by (e) Moneys borrowed by the commission in pursuance of this act; and (/) Any other moneys received by the commission. (2) All such moneys shall be carried to the credit of a fund to be called the "" North Australia Commission Fund."" (3) The North Australia Commission Fund shall be applied by the commission towards the payment of the salaries and expenses of members of the commission, and officers employed under this act, and of all other expenses necessarily incurred in carrying this .act into execution, and of doing and performing all acts and things which the commission js empowered or required to do or perform. It will be noticed that the commission situated in North Australia will practically control the whole of the revenue pf the Territory. Honourable . members will note particularly paragraph 3, which says. Moneys appropriated by the Parliament of From the Commonwealth for the purposes of the development of the Territory. In order to ascertain the meaning of "" Territory,"" Ave have to turn to clause 5, which provides the following definitions :In this act, unless the contrary appears""Central Australia"" means that part of the territory situated south of the 20th parallel of south latitude. ""North Australia"" means that part of the territory situated north of the 20th parallel of south latitude. '.'The Territory"" and ""the Northern Territory"" mean the Northern Territory of Australia. It is obvious that the "" T e r r it o r y "" referred to in paragraph c of clause 29 is the ""whole of the Territory,"" and with In the commission controlling the revenue derived from the whole of the Territory, and not, as I think the bill intends, from that portion only which lies north of the 20th parallel of south latitude, Central Australia will not get a fair deal. Clause 16, which sets out the powers of the commission, provides that its powers shall extend to(/) such other matters in relation to the development of the Territory as are specified in any regulation made under this act. I could understand the commission having this power in relation to a defined portion of the Territory, but the bill as it stands leaves it open to this body to actually dominate the whole of the Teract; or ritory. The people of Central Australia will have very little say in the shaping the commission. of the policy of the commission, and I think they are justified in the fear that . the administration of their portion of the Territory will be merely a farce. They are supported in this belief by clause 21 sub-clause 2, paragraph g. This clause relates to the procedure for the authorization of the construction of railways, and gives power to secure information relating to(<jt) Any other special advantages which are ikely to accrue to the Territory generally from the construction of the railway.",24
37,Mr YATES,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,This commission will have no control over the projected Alice Springs railway.,26
38,Mr NELSON,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,"Certainl y not; but I am pointing out the overlapping powers given by the bill. The commission will dominate the whole of the Territory, and the people of Central Australia will have no voice in the shaping of the policy inflicted on them. Clause 36 .emphasizes what I contend is the outstanding omission of the bill-the omission of the word "" prescribed."" This clause readsOn and after a date to 'be fixed by proclamation (in this act referred to as "" the proclaimed day"") that part of the Northern Territory which comprises north Australia, as defined in this act shall be administered separately from that part of the Northern Territory which comprises central Australia, as defined in this act By the omission of the word ""prescribed"" in the other clauses, the definition means that the commission will have control of the whole of the Territory. that is a typographical error, which will be rectified. Clause 60 also extends the powers of the commission. It readsThe Governor General may make regulations, not inconsistent with this act, prescribing all matters which by this act are required or permitted to be prescribed, or which are necessary or convenient to be prescribed, for carrying out or giving effect to this act, and in particular for the following(c) for specifying other matters in to the development of the Territory with respect to which the powers of the commission shall extend. The people of Central Australia are quite right in contending that the administration of that Territoiy, as proposed under the bill, will be nothing but a farce. They want, and are certainly entitled to, something more tangible. They are anxious and willing to participate in a constructive policy, and the knowledge that they have acquired during their long years of residence in that country would be of great advantage to the commission in arriving at its conclusions. So far as I can see, the object of the bill is to exploit the north of Australia only. Any one who has travelled through the Northern Territory knows that the possibilities of Central Australia are just as great as those of North Australia. If it is right to launch out on a policy of development for the north of Australia, it is equally right to adopt a similar policy for the development of Central Australia. though I stand second to none in my desire to assist the Government to develop the Northern Territory, yet I am responsible to my electors, and they expect me Ilr. Nelson. to put before this House their fears respecting the inefficacy of the present proposal. They have no wish to see a repetition of past dismal failures. The bill totally ignores the right of the people of the Northern Territory to have representation on the commission, despite the statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) at Ballarat that these people were entitled to direct representation on any board or commission formed to control the Northern Territory. It is true that, in the bill, there is provision for the appointment of an advisory council, but, unfortunately, its powers will be exceedingly limited. I was rather surprised that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton), when speaking on this phase of the bill, did not Probably refer to the limitation of the powers of the council. It may advise only on domestic matters, and will be called together twice a year for that purpose. It cannot advise on vital matters affecting the development of the Territory, such as the construction of roads and railways, and water and land facilities. The council will, in fact, be reduced to making suggestions relating to ordinances dealrelation ing with aborigines and other inconsequent matters. In reality, it will have no power whatever. Such a policy will not inspire confidence in the residents of the Northern Territory. They want to have some say in this all important question of the development of the Northern Territory, and they are certainly justified in demanding a greater representation than that proposed under the bill. At one time, Twas a member of an advisory council that represented the people of the Territory. The council met. for some eight or ten weeks, and dealt with matters of vital importance to the Territory. It was ultimately ascertained that none of the recommendations of that council had been submitted to the Ministry. The people, in indignation, withdrew their representation from the council, and the movement consequently collapsed. If this bill is put into effect in its present form, the advisory council will have no power whatever. If the Al- Commonwealth Government intended to co-operate with the people, it would be only fair and logical to consider their views respecting the' development of the Territory. But under the bill this cannot te done. The advisory council will deal with unimportant matters. We have heen told that it is to be a safety valve for popular opinion. The Minister for Home ancl Territories (Senator Pearce), i u another place, when questioned about this phase of the bill, said that it had been found that the best safety valve was lo let the people talk and blow off steam, provided that they kept with in reason. The advisory council will really be a medium through which the people will blow off steam. According to the M in ister, if the council .keeps within reason, and deals only with matters of no in terest and value to the Territory, everything will be all right. But if it suggests something essential to the development of the Territory, it will then be out or order. It is essential for every administration to have the co-operation of the people. Australians, in particular, readily respond to increased responsibility, and if some measure of responsibility is placed on the advisoiw council both of the north and of the south, great benefit will result. Certain inspired articles have been published in the Pastoral Review. The appointment of certain men, and also the violation of the White Australia policy, have been suggested. The following passage is taken from the issue of the Pastoral Review dated 16th December, 1925:The recent statement by the Minister for Home and Territories that his Northern Territory Bill will shortly be introduced, providing for the division of the north of Australia into Northern Australia and Central Australia, is all very nice, but everything will depend on the personnel and powers of the Commission to be established. The appointment should be for ten years, and it should be left to the body to add to their number or fill any vacancies if required. For instance, such men as Messrs. J. B. Cramsie, C. W. D. Conacher, It. C. Philp, and E. T. Belf, of Queensland, would be admirable, and these men should get a salary commensurate with the importance of the work. Mr Cramsie has control of immense holdings in the Northern Territory, and is therefore opposed to the successful development of the Territory. Conacher is the Australian representative of Lord Vestey, and has done a great deal to retard the progress of the Northern Territory. It is only fair to assume that the appointment of these men to the commission would be inimical to the interests  a late Premier of Queensland. I suggest that the men appointed to the commission should bave a practical knowledge of colonization, railway construction, and water conservation. Under the bill, a very costly commission is to be appointed. A fte r inquiry for twelve months or more, it will recommend to this House that, before development can take place in Central or Northern Australia, roads, railways, and water facilities must be provided. As we already know this, why the necessity for appointing the commission? In any case, the commissioners should at least have some interest in, . and some knowledge of, the territory which they are to administer. If that were obtained better results would accrue, because, after all, no policy that any commission can suggest to this Parliament will be effective if it ignores the fundamentals of development. Every Minister or member of Parliament - who has visited the Territory has declared that the country is all right, and that its most urgent need is improved means of transportation. If that fact is recognized the Government should defer the appointment of this commission and start at once upon providing the essentials of developmentroads, railways, and water. But if the Government is determined to proceed with the bill and appoint the commission, it would be well advised to strengthen the administration by utilizing the services of men having local knowledge. At the committee stage I shall propose several amendments, and I hope that the Minister will not regard them as emanating from one desiring to embarrass the Government. I know the thoughts of the people in the Territory and the things that are required for its development, and my object is only to assist to drag my constituency from the "" slough of despond"" into which successive administrations have plunged it throughout its history. The failure of the Northern Territory hitherto has been due, not to a lack of resources, but to a lack of those services which are essential to development. Mr.",26
39,Mr MANNING,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,"Macquarie) [4.471. - This bill represents a genuine effort on the part of the Government to improve conditions in the Northern Territory. In the past the country has been hampered, not by lack of continuity of policy, but by the lack of any policy at all. Things have been allowed to d r if t , and year year the position has become worse. bill provides maeninery for establishing commission that will take charge of Territory, and make representations the Minister which will eventually come before Parliament. The success of the scheme will depend wholly upon the perto sonnel of the commission. If men with the necessary breadth of vision and perience are appointed I expect a great must be imposed. improvement to follow. Many extraordinary statements have been made about the possibilities of the Territory, but last speaker capped them all by suggesting that it could be developed by men with whatever. flocks of 500 sheep. He described how those men could engage in other work while niggers shepherded their flocks.",28
40,Mr NELSON,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,Some men have done that.,29
41,Mr MANNING,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,"I do not say that that policy may not be a success in indirepudiated. vidual cases, but the suggestion that it represents a practical way of developing the Territory as a, whole is extremely absurd. A living cannot be made in the Territory by depasturing 500 sheep. Workmen with other jobs may be able to supplement their incomes by running few .sheep shepherded by niggers- a advertisement for White Australia !-bu the only effective means of developing territory is the encouragement of men with large capital. Unfortunately, in the past, governments have not proceeded upon right lines. The history of pioneering in Australia as a whole has been such as to make men with capital very dubious about investing their money in the velopment of big areas outback. pioneers lost the money they invested, the fruits of their labour were reaped the second, or even the thir d man, was able to carry on from the point which the pioneer failed. Men went Central Queensland with large amounts of capital, but how many of them are reaping the. benefit of the pioneering they did ? Many of them left their ings with practically nothing. To at and tract men with large capital to settle the Territory we must offer good condinot tions. I shall not be content to see handful of men with flocks of 500 sheep ekeing out a bare existence. I wish to see the vast areas of the Territory made full y productive. That can be done only by offering to men with capital lengthy after leases, but with adequate safeguards. This Some of the best development work in a New South Wales was done under the the improvement lease conditions, and sucto cessful settlement followed. Those conditions should be applied in the Northern Territory. If , as an inducement to men invest their capital in the Territory, they are given long leases, conditions reexlating to stocking and improvements",29

43,Mr MANNING,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,This bill proposes the appointment of a commission to recommend means of developing the Territory.,29

45,Mr MANNING,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,"Of course they cannot; but a large area of country is not leased, and even existing leases can be further extended, subject to improvement conditions. A large area of the Barkly Tableland will carry sheep, but it must a be subdivided, fenced as a protection great against dogs, and provided withwater. t Only by giving very good terms to men a with capital can development of that kind be achieved. To send to the Territory a man with £2,000 or £3,000 would certainly not be to do a kindness to him . Hitherto, the greatest block to the progress of the Territory has been the dewonderful opportunity in nearer and Most more-favoured parts for men with a and limited amount of capital to invest. Such by men are better advised to take up land who in the southern and more advanced at States than to go ill-equipped to the into Territory to engage in a pioneering battle. It is absolutelv necessary that the powers of the proposed commission work shall be limited. Some commissions have holdbeen appointed with unlimited powers, the results of their complete i m in munity from parliamentary control have been satisfactory. Parliament should a have an effective check upon the work cf the commissioners. But if they are men worth their salt, their recommendations will be carried out, and the Minister and Parliament will hesitate to act contrary to any proposals they may make.",29

A letter from Melbourne can'reach Alice Springs in a week, but as the honourable member pointed out, a letter from Alice Springs to Darwin may be six weeks in transit. I am very glad that this bill is being introduced, and I hope that the Government will apnoint the right men to the commission and that Parliament will support their proposals. During the present season a big loss of stock has occurred in Queensland, the whole of which could have been saved if a railway bad been built from the drought-stricken area to the Barkly Tableland, where the season was good. Railway construction is an essential preliminary to settlement. I have no that the commission will at once recommend a policy of railway construction, and I trust that this Parliament will find the money to give effect to it . The honourable member for the Northern Terri tory suggested that the consideration of this bill should be delayed u n t i l honourable members have had an onportunity to visit the Territory. Too much delay has occurred already. I would very much like to go there, but when honourable members considered the proposal we decided that a parliamentary oarty could not make the trip with advantage this year. If such a party goes to the Northern Territory next year it will not only gain a first-hand impression of the counthe try, but will be fortified by the reports and recommendations of the proposed commission. They will then be able to give the House the benefit of their experience. Unfortunately, it is only pos- . sible to travel through that portion of Australia at this time of the year. It was suggested that the party should start early in May. Those with an in t i mate knowledge of the country say that it would not be safe to do so. Only last week there were reports of heavy rains in Central Australia, indicating clearly that it would be unwise for any party to start, as early as the beginning of May. If. however, the party starts in June, those who undertake the trip will be away from the most important work of Parliament. The Government would be well advised, if this trip is to be made, to alter the time of the sitting of the House. Supply could be obtained for two or three months, and the House could adjourn during the winter months to enable honourable members to visit the Territory without neglecting their parliamentary duties.",30
52,Mr FOSTER,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,"Wakefield) [5.2] The Government is to be congratulated upon giving Parliament practically a clean sheet in connection with Northern Territory development. All that has been done hitherto has been practically wasted. The most unfortunate appointments have been made, and in many instances money expended on the Northern Territory, particularly in the earlier period of Commonwealth control, might just as well have been thrown into the sea. The most pressing need is railway communication.",30
53,Mr JACKSON,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,"There is no other problem. doubt Mr Foster - I agree with the hon- . orable member for Bass. Unfortunately, the most pressing appeals for railway construction have, until recent years, been disregarded, with the result that development has been seriously retarded. For this unsatisfactory state of affairs some blame must be attached to certain newspapers published in the eastern States. It is easier now to travel through the Northern. Territory than it was a few years ago. An enterprising company has begun what is intended to be a regular passenger service between Adelaide and Port Darwin, and the first journey, with 25 tourist passengers, left Adelaide this week, and hope to make a record run through the Territory.",30
54,Mr JACKSON,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,That is a pity.,30
55,Mr FOSTER,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,"It is. If their object is to learn something of the country they should meet the people at every point. Parliament is deeply indebted to those members of the Public Works sub-committee who, a few years ago, traversed Central Australia and took evidence from representative settlers in various parts of the Northern Territory. The report by that committee was easily the best that has been presented to this Parliament on Northern Territory affairs during the last ten or twelve years.",31
56,Mr YATES,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,The honourable member is now throwing bouquets at the honourable member for Bass.,31
57,Mr FOSTER,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,"And the honourable member for Bass well deserves every credit, because by lectures throughout Tasmania and in some of the other States, he has done a great deal in the interests of the Northern Territory. should like to emphasize that, whatever may be done in the future, it will be i m possible to manage the Northern Territory from Melbourne.",31
58,Mr WEST,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,What will the Age say tomorrow?,31
59,Mr FOSTER,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,"The Age cannot make a case against the Northern Territory now. The exploring party which this week will set out from Adelaide to Alice Springs will also visit the Tanami alluvial gold country, which has never been properly prospected. Some years ago hostile natives speared members of prospecting parties in that locality, and caused them to abandon their work. understand that the exploring party which leaves this week will penetrate portions of the Northern Territory that have never before been visited by white men, and that they will come out somewhere on the north-west of Western Australia - The party in question is equipped for five months entirely at the cost of a wealthy patriotic citizen of Sydney for scientific and national purposes, and will be led by Dr Basedow, of Adelaide. The north-south railway should be put through with the least possible delay. If any attempt is made to carry out construction from Melbourne, we shall have a repetition of the mistakes that occurred during the building of the east-west line, and will not get full value for money expended.",31
60,Mr HUGHES,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,"Hear , hear!",31
61,Mr FOSTER,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,"I am glad to have the endorsement of the ex-Prime Minister (Mr Hughes). He knows that what I am saying is true. We need not trouble much with the details of the Northern Territory development for some time to come. Our first concern should be to complete the railway. Then we may proceed with the work of development in a business-like way. Immense sums of money have been spent by the Government in putting down bores in various parts of the Territory. One-half of the cost of this work has been due to the heavy cost of transporting plant from one bore to another. Those who are f a m i l i a r with pastoral development in the Northern Territory know that it is almost i m possible for the industry to expand u n t i l there are improved transport facilities. I am sure that when the railway line has I been built we shall find sufficient men of the right type-me n experienced in the pastoral industry-eage r to take up land and carry on the business of development. About six years ago, two of our leading pastoralists-on e from the Western District of Victoria and another an experienced stockman from Melbourne-spen t six or seven weeks in the Alice Springs country, which, they declared, comprised some of the best pastoral areas-in Australia. The mining possibilities are also most important, but it is impossible to ' exploit the known mineral fields without railway facilities. We have it on the authority of eminent experts, as well as of well-known geologists, that the White I Range field in central Australia is one of the biggest low-grade propositions in the Commonwealth. Broken Hill people have expressed the opinion that with a railway it will be possible to erect machinery and work that immense mining field with profit for many generations. According to experts, Central Australia is teeming with minerals, but without modern means of transport they are not worth twopence. The recently discovered silver-lead deposit at Barrow Creek is believed to be as rich as ever Broken Hill was at the start. That is only one of many mining propositions. These valuable discoveries are not merely surface shows. Before he returned to England, Mr George Klugg was instructed by Messrs. Bewing,' Moreing, and Company to inspect in Adelaide a big haul of specimens that had been taken from the Barrow .Creek silver lead mine. When he had seen it , he said, "" It is one of the finest shows I have seen for years. richness that it promises comes to a count i y only once in a generation."" Commonwealth has been guilty of criminal neglect in allowing this great wealth to remain undeveloped. The opening up of mining fields leads to a considerable amount of settlement. T hope that when the railway is constructed it will be administered locally, and that six years will not be occupied in work that ought to be completed in between two and a half and three years. I trust that before another three years have elapsed the Territory will be showing the promise of a fine future. It will not be possible to show anything worthwhile in the way of development until the railway has been constructed. Everything will depend upon the commission that is appointed. If the commissioners are not men of the right type it will he a poor look-out for the Northern Territory.",31
62,Mr GULLETT,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,"Henty) [5.20] - In speaking to this measure I am under a disadvantage that is common to the majority of honourable members, in that I have not visited the Northern Territory, and I should not have taken part in the debate but for the fact that this is purely a machinery bill, and particular local knowledge of the Territory is not required to enable one to discuss certain of its proposals. It is gratifying to note that during the debate in this and another place it has not been suggested that the Northern Territory as a whole is not a white man's land, but that, on the contrary, there appears to be complete agreement in the belief that it is a country in which the white man can thrive. Its development obviously must present peculiar difficulties. have no doubt that had it not been for the difficult problems that have attended its development large portion of it would have been settled upon many years ago. The outstanding fact in regard to the administration by both South Australia and the Commonwealth is that a large expenditure has been incurred with very slight result. Notwithstanding the experience of successive failures, however, appears certain that a great deal more money will have to be spent in the future. It will, therefore, be necessary, for any government that is charged with the administration of the The Territory to make the developmental machinery as efficient and economical as posThe sible. I shall not attempt to criticize drastically the machinery that it is proposed to set up, but it appears to me to be excessively complicated and duplicated. I cannot see the necessity for a special development commission and a separate administrative authority. The bill provides for the appointment of three commissioners, who are to be charged not merely with the physical development of the Territory, but also with the maintenance of a number of its most important services They are to administer the railways and the ports and harbours, and they are to build and maintain roads. In addition, they will have full control of all lands. L it t le or nothing will remain to occupy the time of a purely administrative staff under the control of a Resident Governor. As I view the position, we propose to set up a civil service the size of which will be out of all proportion to the work it will have to perform.",32
63,Mr JACKSON,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,It is to be hoped that it will be no worse than it is at present.,32
64,Mr GULLETT,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,"It may not be worse than it is at present, but that will not be sufficient. We should endeavour to avoid the continuance of what, sO far , has been a scandal. It will be necessary to appoint a secretariat for the developmental commission. This will probably be composed of experts representing the various departments, such as roads, water, railways, ports, and harbours. I cannot see what the Resident Governor will have to do; but it is certain that he will have a secretariat and the nucleus of a departI mental staff. There may be a sound reason for that, but I have not been able to discover it . We appear to be heading in a the direction of a civil servants' paradise, the creation of which will bring great discredit to the administration in the years that are ahead. It is proposed to have an advisory council, partly elective and partly nominee. If it is thought necessary to obtain the services of men it who have spent their lives in the Terri tory and understand its needs, surely they could be used most advantageously on the developmental side! The activities of the commission could he extended to in clude the administration of the T e r r i as a whole, and thus do away with the necessity for having two distinct governing authorities. I have no doubt that the Government will appoint an able commission. In selecting a pastoral representative, I trust that it will choose a man who has strong closersettlement sympathies. The speech of the Minister for Home and Territories (Senator Pearce) in the other chamber, and that of the Prime Minister (Mr . Bruce) in this House, indicate a definite disposition to regard the Territor y as a big man's country for a long time to come. I do not know the country well enough to speak of its agricultural qualities, but, in regard to the pastoral industry, the position is misconceived if it is contended that pastoral settlement necessarily means settlement in large areas. The most i m pressive feature about land settlement in New South Wales and Queensland during the last 25 years has heen the multi plication of small pastoral holdings. Tn the western part of New South Wales, there are hundreds of men who are carrying, only a few thousand sheep - That is also the case in central Queensland. No other settlers have been so progressively prosperous in recent years as those who have carried only a few thousand sheep.",32
65,Mr FOSTER,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,The western division of New South Wales is now carrying a little more than a third of the number of sheep that it carried twelve years ago.,33
66,Mr GULLETT,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,"What happened when they were overstocked, and had to face the most calamitous drought that Australia has ever experienced? lost heavily. Since the areas have been small, and adequate provision has been made for water, the country has been almost perfectly safe.",33
67,Mr FOSTEB,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,Nonsense !,33
68,Mr GULLETT,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,"I do not know whether there is in the Northern Territory a considerable area of sheep country. It is contended that the Barkly Tablelands contain excellent sheep country. On the assumption that it will carry sheep, I trust that the Government, when providing railway communication, will adopt the policy of settling men on relatively small pastoral areas. It may be that a minimum area of as much.as 50,000 acres will be needed. But to iy if we are to spend money in developing the Northern Territory we should settle there the maximum possible number of experienced Australians. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton), expressed the opinion this afternoon that this Parliament and this Government would be better engaged in inducing people from overseas to settle in the Northern Territory than in expending large sums to bring migrants from Great Britain to settle in the various States. W it h that opinion I entirely disagree. We should court disaster, and increase the waste of money if we tried to settle inexperienced European migrants in the Northern Territory. Those who go there must be acclimatized, experienced Australians. Those portions of the Commonwealth which have the greatest actual and relative capacity for the profitable absorption of migrants from overseas are the States which are the most densely settled. That can be proved by reference to the migration statistics. Victoria, for instance, which has more population to the square mile than any of the other States, and whose secondary industries are relatively well developed, is absorbing the most migrants. I ain surprised and ' disappointed that the Government proposes to adopt the name "" No r t h Australia "" for the northern portion, and "" Central Australia "" for the southern portion of the Territor y for whose administration the bill provides. I do not suggest that those responsible for the measure are destitute of ideas, but they have apparently overlooked this matter of nomenclature. It is my intention to move in committee an amendment to give these areas other names. It is, I They think, lamentable that we should have such names . as South Australia, Western Australia, No r t h Australia, and Central Australia for various portions of this Commonwealth. This is an opportunity to immortalize such a man as Matthew Flinders by giving his name to the area which is called No r t h Australia in the bill. That great navigator's name could most appropriately be conferred on the northern part of Australia, because though not the first mariner to pass along its shores, he was the first Englishman to explore its seas, and he charted not only that part of our coastline, but practically the whole coastline of the continent. In place of Central Australia as the name of the southern portion of this territory, I suggest "" Sturt""-the boldest, and most heroic of our early explorers. It may be justifiable to distinguish the two portions of the continent of America as No r t h and South America; but there is no reason why in Australia we should use the points of the compass for the designation of our territorial divisions. The establishment of special staffs for Commonwealth territory is not proposed in the bill, but I think the time has arrived when the Commonwealth should deliberately undertake training of special staffs for the administration of the territories now under its control. As the mandated territory of - New Guinea, Papua, No r t h and Central Australia are now under the control of the Commonwealth, and later the northern portion of Western Australia may be also, the Government should consider the appointment of a specially trained staff for service in its territories. In speaking thus frankly of the administration of the Government in regard to the Northern Territory, I do not wish to appear a hostile critic of the measure; I have put these views forward merely in the hope that they may be of some little help.  subject of. the Northern Territory is one with which I have been familiar for many years. My late father, the Honourable J. Langdon Parsons, was for-three years the Minister controlling Northern Territory in a South Australian Government, and then was for six years the Government Resident in the Northern Territory; and for three years later he was one of the first members to represent the Territory in the South Australian Parliament. I lived in the Terri tory for some time, and can, therefore, claim to have an intimate knowledge of the country.' The history of the Northern Territory is very depressing to those who really believe in its possibilities. I can say, without fear of contradiction, that no man had greater f a it h in the potentialities of the Territory than my late father, and, perhaps, if he had not been so persistent in his belief in it , he and his family would have been better off in many ways, At the time the South Australian Government took over the Northern Territory, the trouble, which has continued since the Commonwealth has been in control, was that the Territory was administered by Parliaments who knew nothing whatever about it . It is a grave reflection upon the Commonwealth Parliament that it has not benefited by the mistakes made wben the Territory was under the control of the South Australian Government. Por instance, when it was proposed to construct a railway to. Oodnadatta, and another from Darwin to Pine Creek, the money for the work was the borrowed by the South Australian Parliament two or three years before it was needed, and consequently a large sum was involved in unnecessary interest. All along there has been an almost deliberate conspiracy to refuse to accept the advice of men on the spot. When a bill had been passed to authorize the construction of the Pine Creek railway, my father, who was appointed Government Resident in 1884, was sent to the Northern Territory to advise .the Government. Amongst other things, he recommended that the railway to Pine Creek should be built by Southern European labour, and upon its completion the men engaged on the work should be given grants of land along the"" route, in order to develop the country and provide traffic for the railway. The South Australian Government turned down the proposal, and employed Chinese coolies, who, when the work was completed, returned the to China with the money they bad earned. [Quorum formed.] The possibility of developing the Northern Territory by white labour was doubted by many who believed in its future, including my father; but I believe that, if he were alive today, he would think, as I do, that its development by white labour can be successfully undertaken. I was associated - with those who held ideas contrary to my own, but my opinion was confirmed during the construction of the Panama Canal, when it was shown what could be done in combating tropical diseases with the assistance of medical science. Medical and agricultural science will , I think, assist in solving the problem of developing the Northern Territory. One of the greatest difficulties in settling the Northern Territory with white people is, as I am sure the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr. will agree, the position in which and children are placed; but when the north-south railway is constructed, of the - inconveniences from they nOw suffer will be Under present conditions the women and children have a most trying time during the rainy season. The rain is often very heavy and the atmosphere humid; and neither women nor children can get away from the country except by sea, travelling through the tropics down to Sydney, or further south. have a particularly trying time in cases of approaching maternity, time they cannot take the risk of a long sea journey. I am in favour of this bill, because I believe that one of the first recommendations of the proposed commission will be that the north-south shall be completed. When that line is finished women and children will be able to get away from the humid north in the rainy season and spend that part of the year, which comes within the holiday season, at Sanatoriums, in Central Australia, where the climate is the finest in the world. A good deal has been said about the poor quality of the land in the Territory. Many years ago there were millions of acres of land in the United States of America that were deemed to be just as poor and unproductive as much of the land in the Northern Territory is said to be today; but when the American railways stretched across the continent derful developments followed in this so called useless land. I believe that the same thing will happen in the Territory when adequate railway facilities are provided. I can see no limit to development there. The advancement agricultural science has made wonderful developments in the States. A farm that was recently sold in South Australia for £29 17s. 6d. an acre is adjacent to land which, before the use of superphosphate, was not deemed to be worth £1 an acre. I know men who were unable to make a success of farming on it at £1 an acre. Advanced methods have improved the value of that land,' and I believe that they will improve the value of the land in the Northern Territory when reasonable marketing ties are available. The South Government years ago considered it a duty to the rest of Australia not to develop  the Northern Territory with black labour, Nelson) and incurred enormous losses there in conwomen sequence. Some honourable members have said that they find a difficulty in giving some proper consideration to Northern Terriwhich tory problems on account of having never removed. visited the country. I admit that, to a large extent, that is a difficulty. But one of the finest works on Indian life and scenery was written by Thomas Moore, extremely and he never saw India. I consider it to be our duty to read all we can of the writings of persons who have visited and lived in the Northern Territory, so that The women we may at least bring informed minds to bear on its problems. The honourable and at that member for Henty (Mr Gullett) questioned whether there was much sheep country in the Northern Territory. On that point I quote the following para- « graph from a pamphlet that was issued railway years ago when it was proposed to build a railway through the N orthern Territory on the land grant system: It has been often said that sheep will not thrive well north of Barrow Creek. This has Christmas certainly not been proved, but in roughly dividing the Northern Territory into portions most suitable for sheep and cattle, a line running cast and west from Barrow Creek has been adopted, somewhat in deference to that idea. Speaking quite approximately, the extent of the country south of this line indicated is 200,000 square miles, which, at an average of SO sheep per mile, gives a total of 10,000,000; and, reckoning the total area per mile south of BarrowCreek, this number would be increased one-third. The annual clip of wool at a low valuation, sav, of 5 lb. wool, worth 2s. per lb., would equai £5,000,000. To this must won- be added the value of the surplus sheep sold annually. Northern That is weighty evidence that there is good sheep country there; but it will be impossible to develop it u n t i l facilities are of provided for getting produce to market. possible Those figures were given by men who have southern lived in the Northern Territory, and knew its possibilities well. In considering the probability of agricultural development in the Northern Territory we must remember that there is a considerable area of land right along the coast, and for 80 to 100 miles inland, that is capable of agricultural growing every imaginable tropical crop. The Northern Territory has a coast-line of about 1,200 miles on the India n Ocean; numerous rivers, such as the Roper, the facili- Adelaide, the Daly, and the Victoria, Australian which are navigable for from 20 to 100 miles: and a harbour at Darwin which is said to be capable of berthing all the fleets of the world. I have cruised on that harbour, and I know what a great stretch of water it is. In 1885, when my father was Government Resident in the Northern Territory, he submitted to the Government a report which contained the following paragraph:It must be freely admitted that the north coast of Australia is distinctly tropical, but it can be affirmed that the climate of Palmerston is undeniably healthy. Children live under the verandahs in the open air, and grow and thrive. Dr Wood, who had had a wide experience of tropical countries said that for its latitude he knew of no place so healthy. In referring to the agricultural possibiliand ties of the Territory, the late Mr Maurice plorers, Holtze, who was for many years director of the botanic gardens at Darwin, ness and later at Adelaide, saidThere is enough suitable land in the northern extremity of the Northern Territory for very considerable cultivation, on the coast and along the rivers. This is only a very small ward p;art of the Northern Territory, enough to employ hundreds of thousands of people in tropical agriculture. Reference to the reports of Mr Holtze 1890, and to those of his son, Mr . Nicholas Holtze, who succeeded him, made in 1897, 1898, and up to 1901, show that the following crops have heen grown with success in the Northern Territory:maize; the following oil plants-peanuts chufa, sunflower, sesame, castor croton oil, benoil, jatropha o i l ; the them is prohibitive. African oil palm; the Chinese date; sago, and other palms; ramee, cotton, sheep cannot. kapok, manila hemp, bowstring hemp, and pita fibre; red and white arrowroot; cassava, which in good, friable soil grew as well as it could be grown anywhere; pepper, cinnamon; ginger; citronella, nutmegs, vanilla, and other millett, sorghum, broom corn, & c , all which grow most luxuriantly ; Madagasand car earth bean; fodder grasses of all scriptions; rice, cocoa, Liberian coffee, bacco, pineapples, sugar-cane, ginger, jute; and the following four kinds of "" Of india-rubber - Ceara, Hevea, Madagascar. Mx. Nicholas Holtze says in his 1901 reportI would particularly refer to the different starch plants-Turmeric , Patchouli; citronella oil plant, rice, cocoa, and the different fodder grasses, cassava, grasscloth (Rhea), and the various other fibre plants. It is extraordinary that, although the posTerritory sibility of growing all these plants had been demonstrated beyond question, wonderful Batchelor Experimental Farm, which was established by the Commonwealth Government after it took over the Territory from South Australia, and named after the late Hon. E . L . Batchelor, was able to produce only one trombone. It certainly was a bachelor in that respect. Mr Holtze had proved that all the tropical, plants I bave mentioned could be grown. My father also made the following report on the TerritoryDuring the three years I was Minister, and the six years I was Government Resident, I saw conversed with a large number of extravellers, drovers, and prospectors, and while their descriptions and opinions varied, and some were tinged with the dreariof disappointment, the great majority of them were to the effect that the Northern Territory generally is a good pastoral country, that large areas are very good, that the north coast is good cattle country, ond that southfrom the head waters of the Victoria but llarge there is fine sheep country. Soil examinations were made on all the principal river areas, and every one of for the reports showed the superior nature of the soil. I mention that because there is an impression, both inside and outside of Australia, that there is practically no good land in the Territory, and that the country is a wilderness. The only rea, son why sheep are not a payable proposioil, tion is that the cost of marketing Cattle can convey themselves to market, whereas The late Mr F l in t , who was at one time inspector of telegraphs at Alice Springs, said that he had .been ten years in the north. He had found Alice Springs an agreeable place to live in . At Barrow Creek, Tenspices; nant Creek, and Alice Springs, they grew of every kind of vegetable except asparagus celery. The late Mr W . Forrest, deof Western Australia, said there was topumping water to be found all over the tableland. Mr Chas. Chewings said:-the f e r t i l it y of the soil, there can be Assam, no doubt."" Mr Tenison Woods saidA slight examination convinces one that many of the reefs in the Territory contain rich metal, even though the prospector has peanuts, turned away from them. The appointment of a local commission for the development of the Northern is a step in the right direction. The' trouble in the past has been the misthe management of the Northern Territory by people livin g a great di.stance from I shall support this bill as it is an honest attempt to provide machinery for the development of the Northern Territory by persons on the spot. While I do not say that the measure is perfect, I shall not adversely criticize it at this stage. In the light of experience it may be necessary later to make modifications, but that is no reason for delaying the matter any longer. Because of the money invested in the Northern Territory, and for the sake of the good name of Australia, there should be no further delay. I am confident that the commission's first report will point out the necessity for the completion of the North-South railway. The first essential is the construction of a north and south railway.",33
69,Mr NELSON,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,"A line running east west should follow.  lack of railway communication has been the main cause of the Northern Territory remaining undeveloped. The construction of the North-South line is not a big undertaking for the Commonwealth. W it h a population of about 200,000 persons, South Australia, in 1884, commenced, the construction of a through line of railway. A length of approximately 600 miles of railway, terminating at Oodnadatta, was constructed, as well as a line 146 miles in length from Darwin to Pine Creek. South Australia also constructed the overland telegraph line. In the few years following 1884 more was done for the development of the Northern Territory than has been done since. But the building of a north-south railway will not solve the problems of the Northern Territory. That line should be constructed first, and it should be a line north and south. There should be no curvature of the spine so far as that railway is concerned. that north and south line constructed, other lines running east and west should follow Avithout undue delay, and it would not be long before the Northern Terri tory, instead of being a huge undeveloped tract of country, would be the most important part of this great Commonwealth. Although the problem before us is a big one, there is no need for pessimism. The problem only requires to be tackled in the right manner. We should not be a f r a id to spend money in the process. Railways cannot be built for nothing, but without it . them the Northern Territory will never be developed.",37
70,Mr JACKSON,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,"Bass) [ 6 . 5 ] - I desire to refer to some remarks made by the right honourable the Prime Minister (Mr . Bruce) when introducing this bill. He referred to the lack of a developmental policy for the Northern Territory, and said that each succeeding Minister had some bright idea regarding it which, on assuming office, he endeavoured to put into practice, at the same time discarding the ideas of his predecessors. He said further that he criticized no one and blamed no one for what had taken place in the past. W it h that statement. I entirely disagree. Some one is to blame. Let us examine the facts. In 1921 some of the members of the Public and Works Committee visited the Northern Territory, and on their return they submitted a report to the then Prime M i nister (Mr Hughes) containing suggestions, the chief of which I now find is embodied in this bill. The committee recommended a developmental policy for the Northern Territory, the work to be spread over a number of years. It was, therefore, incorrect for the Prime Minister to say that the developmental policy contained in this bill is entirely new. Four valuable years have been lost through the failure »f the Government to adopt the recommendations contained in that report. When introducing this bill in another place, Senator Pearce gave a brief historical sketch of the Northern Territory, but, unfortunately, the record was not complete. The honourable gentleman did not mention that a number of persons had cycled-and that others had walked-fro m Darwin to Adelaide, and vice versa. He told the Senate, as the Prime Minister told this House, that the With problem _ of the Northern Territory was one of transportation. If that be so, what is the necessity for theappointment .of the commission which this bill proposes? We should set to work to build roads, bridges, and railways without delay. Senator Pearce said that he doubted whether the sum of £200,000 has been spent on roads in the Northern Territory. That the Minister was far from right in mentioning that sum is shown by the fact that, since 1911, - the Commonwealth has expended on roads and bridges in the Northern Territory not more than £32,000.",37
71,Mr MASK,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,That sum represents the amount paid by the Government in subsidizing the work done by pastoralists.,38
72,Mr JACKSON,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,Why should the pastoralists of the Northern Territory be required to construct its roads?,38
73,Mr MARR,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,Why should the States be asked to expend money on road construction in their territory?,38
74,Mr JACKSON,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,"If the Government is serious in its desire to develop the Northern Territory, it will not ask the pastoralists, who do not own land there, and cannot under the present law own any, but merely lease it, to spend their money to develop a territory which belongs, not to them, but to the whole of the people of Australia. It stands to the discredit of this, and every previous Government, that the pastoralists in the Northern Territory have had to do most of the road construction there.",38

76,Mr JACKSON,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,"The honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr. Nelson), who has travelled along the Victoria River track, knows that were it not for the work done by Bovril Estates Limited and Vestey Limited, it would be impossible to travel along that track for four months of every year. If , as the Minister suggests, the pastoralists of the Northern Territory are to be asked to pay part of the cost of making roads there, I promise him that I shall strongly oppose any such proposal. Pearce, in his speech on the Northern Territory Crown Land Bill, in July, 1923, said I am convinced that the people of Australia do not realise what a splendid asset they have, and are not seized with the difficulties of the situation, or of its immensity. So far, this has been nobody's business. I claim that it has been the business of every Minister who has been in charge of the Home and Territories Department. Senator Pearce went on to sayNow it is our business, and if we take up a little extra time in its consideration, that will have been well spent. He concluded his speech by sayingUnder this Ordinance, and our general developmental policy, 1 feel sure that the Terri[85] tory will progress as other parts of the Commonwealth have done. Not until nearly three years after that speech was delivered did the Government introduce the Oodnadatta to Alice Springs Railway Bill, .a measure which has been promised since 1911. Other than that bill, the one now under consideration contains the first suggestion the Government has made for the development of the Northern Territory since Senator Pearce delivered the speech to which I have referred. We have been promised one railway, and now it is proposed to hand over to a number of private individuals-soo n to become public servants- a task in which every previous Government has failed. I regret that the Government deems it necessary to take from Parliament the control of the Northern Territory. It may be said that Parliament will still have control, because it will have to vote the money necessary for its development; but there bave been instances in the past of the control of expenditure having been taken from Parliament, and we have seen absolute failure as the result. Some years ago, I mentioned an incident in connection with the development of the Northern Territory which I think will bear repetition on this occasion. If the Minister in charge of the Home and Territories Department is sincere in his desire to people the Northern Territory, why was a certain police officer at Anthony's Lagoon forced to leave the police force when he got married because the Department would not provide him Senator with proper accommodation? His intended wife was waiting in Adelaide, but the Department said, in effect, "" If you get married you will have to leave."" The Northern Territory will not be developed if that policy is continued. Only within the last few months has anything been done to provide hospitals in that portion of the Northern Territory south of Marranboy, which is less than 250 miles south of Darwin. Until a month ago, one could travel south from Marranboy, a distance of 750 miles within the time Territory, without meeting a nurse or being able to obtain medical attention other than that possible with the small medicine kits at the various telegraph stations. There was so little concern for the health of the people there that, in 1921, when we went through the Territory, ment required the members of the staffs of the telegraph stations to pay for refills for the medicine chests. Ministers now say that they want to do something to develop the Territory. There are two ways in which that can be done The first is to complete the line right through to Darwin. should follow a route slightly east from Alice Springs, go> somewhere near Anthony's Lagoon, and join up with the line that must be built across the Tableland into the State of Queensland. It has been said over and over again that it is ridiculous to think that a territory of 500,000 square miles can be properly developed with only one railway the centre of it. I am hoping that the railway system of the Territory will some day be as well developed as the railway Victoria. I agree with the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr. that if the line had been constructed the Barkly Tableland through weal. many thousands of stock would have been saved during the recent drought in Queensland. 'Governments should build railway lines to develop their own territories, but the Commonwealth ments of the past seem to have considered the development of all territories but their own. A. railway line has been built to Western Australia. I approve of and the Commonwealth has. assisted several States in carrying out the Murray Waters scheme-I approve of that; but it stands to the discredit of the governments that have had charge of the finances of this great continent that they neglected so much of their own heritage, which the Commonwealth promised to develop, and across which it to build a railway. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) ferred to the decreasing of the Territory. Many settlers who went there in 1911 and afterwards, had the idea firmly fixed in their minds that something would be done, by providing roads and railways, to promote genuine development. been most bitterly disappointed. 1916 or 1917 no rails have been laid in the Territory, and the pitiable record to date is the construction of about 50 miles of line from Pine Creek ifr. Jackson. to the Katherine River. Certainly the the depart- construction of the Daly Waters line is now being proceeded with, and it is hoped that work on the Alice Springs section will soou be commenced. Now that the line will soon reach Daly Waters, it is time that the Parliament considered the effectively. question of its extension to Newcastle North-South Waters or Powell's Creek, and then east That line to Queensland. If honourable members will consult the report presented by the Public Works Committee in 1922, they will find that the comBarkly mittee, in recommending that that should be done, stated that the line to Daly Waters would be quite useless u n t i l it was extended across the Barkly Tableland. The prospect is even worse today through than it was then. This brings me to a second suggestion. I have been exercising Northern my mind for quite a long time on the question whether it is desirable to extend system of to the Territory the right of freehold for pastoral purposes. I have made a few inManning), quiries, and have tried to obtain inforinto mation about countries where the leaseCamoo- hold, system of land tenure has been tried. I have not, however, met with any success. Most of the Australian States have developed rapidly because the man who went on the land had the right to purchase the Govern- freehold of his property after he had proved his bona fides. The time has arrived when more consideration should be given to the question of granting freethat; holds in the Northern Territory. It is proposed that small freehold areas shall be provided for the purpose of agriculture, although the right honourable the Prime Minister, and every one else who speaks about the Northern Territory, have affirms that it is a pastoral proposition.",38
77,Mr GIBSON,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,"All new countries are pastoral propositions. undertook Mr JACKSON - Then why hold out this bait to a few small agriculturists? re- Why induce them to purchase land to population grow something they will, for the want of the of a market, be unable to sell? Why not give the right of freehold tenure to the pastoralist, who will actually open up the country? Nearly £50,000 has been spent during the last fifteen years on They have agricultural experiments. Perhaps not Since all of it has been wasted, for presumably something valuable must have been Government's learned; but much of it has been wasted. The Government is taking the wrong course in offering small areas to agriculturists while still retaining the leasehold system for the pastoralist. The right honourable the Prime Minister said that everything would depend upon getting the right men as commissioners. No one ever spoke truer words. I sincerely trust that this Government will be more fortunate that previous governments in its selection of men as administrators. I am reminded of one administrator who was there for a number of years, who, in his annual reports to the Government, wrote in glowing terms of the wonderful land in the Territory. suggested, among other things, that some of the land on the Daly River would be excellent for the repatriation of returned soldiers. Yet that gentleman wrote an article in Smith's Weekly not long ago under the heading, "" The Northern Territory. Workless. Hopeless. Useless."" That was the man who, wben he was Administrator, could not find words to express his admiration for the land that was available for agricultural settlement. Some of our administrators seem to go to Darwin with large ideas, which they retain for only a few months, after which they settle into arm chairs and allow affairs to d r if t .",39
78,Mr DUNCAN,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,HUGHES - Is not largely due to the lack of support from Melbourne ?,40
79,Mr JACKSON,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,"I believe the honour the able member is right. If an honourable ation and report to this House. member of this House spoke about this the Northern Territory four five years ago he was almost laughed at. To-day we find that every member of Parliament is alive to for the fact that the Territory is really worth developing. Perhaps that explains why would we are passing so much legislation f o Territory. It is very gratifying that honourable members who have not been there are expressing a desire to go there; but up to the present the Government not done much to facilitate their going. The money which the Minister for Home and Territories (Senator Pearce) said been spent on roads and bridges was, perhaps, £200,000. The actual amount is £32,000, and every penny of that spent in the northern part of the closer touch with the expenditure. Territory. If there is one part Territory that a visitor should not go first, it is the north of it . An entirely wrong impression is thus gained. problem of developing the Northern Territory, as I have said over and over again, can be solved only by tackling it from the south and east, and not from the north. The Labour Government of 1911 made a great mistake in sending an army of civil servants to dig themselves in at Darwin . In 1923-4, over £90,000 was spent on the administration of the Territory. Mr NELSON;-There will not be much of that to debit against Central Australia He when the reckoning is made.",40
80,Mr JACKSON,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,"The amount will be insignificant. Great care was taken that none of the money was spent south of the Barkly Tableland, except to provide an occasional well or bore, and that only in recent months. The administrative staff at D a r w in could be cut down by one-half with great advantage to the administration, and the £45,000 or £50,000 that would be thus saved would almost finance the construction of the line to Alice Springs.",40

82,Mr JACKSON,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,"Tber e is one provision of the bill upon which I must touch before I resume my seat. As honourable that members are aware, any proposed Commonwealth expenditure upon works in excess of £25,000 has to be referred to Public Works Committee for considerUnder bill such works in North and Central or Australia are to be dealt with directly by the proposed commission. Dealing with almost this matter in the Senate the Minister Home and Territories (Senator Pearce) said that considerable delay take place if these proposals for exr the penditure were referred to the Public Works Committee. Having had some experience on the Public Works Committee and of various commissions, I am of opinion that there would be no greater bas delay in referring these works to the Public Works Committee than in referring them to the proposed commission, had whilst if they were referred to the Public. Works Committee this House, which will have to provide the money was for them, would be kept in much It of the is strange that the Government which' t.n has allowed things to drag as they have done in the Northern Territory - should The now talk of a possible delay of a few months in the reference posed works to the Public Works mittee. The Government has delayed for many years the development Northern Territoiy, which it now seems so eager to carry into effect. Pearce, in his concluding references to this measure, made a rather statement. I quote his exact words: "" I hope that this experiment will be given a trial."" I direct the special attention of honourable members to the use of that word "" experiment."" Surely to goodness we have had enough experiments in the Northern Territoiy. I regret that the Ministry should regard this bill as a further experiment, after the scores, nay, hundreds of reports we have had upon every conceivable topic Northern Territory. Year after year we have had the advice of men who know, and reports' of their experience as the result of sometimes futile and sometimes successful experiments, and surely all this information should take this proposal_ out of the experimental class. I regret that the word ""experiment"" been used to describe this bill. A reference has been made to the delays that occur in the delivery of mails in the Northern Territory. We have been told that a letter from Melbourne addressed to Alice Springs, to go through the Administrator in Darwin, would take three months to get there. We cannot blame the people of the Northern Territory for this, rather is it the fault of the tration. The present service is run at aloss, and certainly a better service could and would be given by the Postal Department if the Home and Territories Department were prepared to pay an adequate subsidy for the purpose. wrong with establishing a motor bicycle mail service between the Katherine and Alice Springs if it should be necessary for the Administrator persons at Alice Springs ? We know that there is a telegraph line, and it is to be presumed that messages could be forwarded from Darwin to Alice within three hours if necessary. there is an efficient code in the Department. The statement that it three months to send a letter Melbourne to Alice Springs is rather a poor argument to put forward to supi»ort the necessity for the ment of the proposed commission. Government proposes, apparently, Mr Jackson. of pro- make available whatever money may be Com- asked for by the commission. The commission will probably be appointed of the within the next month or so, and the first thing it will want to Senator do will be to make a trip through the Northern Territory in order that its startling members may become acquainted with local conditions. The Government may be fortunate enough to appoint to the commission men who have already been there and know the conditions. I suggest that those appointed to the commission should be men with a first-hand knowledge of this vast territory, and not men who yet have to learn all there is to know about it . I believe that there are scores of very capable men who have an actual affecting the knowledge of living conditions, and have spent years in pastoral or in mining pursuits in the Territory who would be pret pared to take up the work. We are going to make money available to the commission, but I point out that this House has been in the temper for a long time past to give the Government much more money has than has been asked for to ensure the more speedy development of the Northern Territory. When the Commission is appointed there will be practically only three things which it can recommend. Itcan recommend railways, and these must of necessity be railways which the Public Works Committee has already recommended. It is not suggested that there are to be railways constructed through Adminis- the Northern Territory other than the North and South line, one from western Queensland across the Barkly Tableland, and possibly a third going across the Victoria River country to link up with the port of Broome in Western Australia. What is The commission will be able to suggest roads and bridges, but I submit that it River cannot suggest any (roads and bridges other than those which have from time to to write to time been advocated by members of this House. The commission will be able to suggest proposals for water conservation and boring. I have said before in this Springs House that it stands not to the credit, but Surely, greatly to the discredit of different Commonwealth Governments, that the only takes water conservation in the Northern Terfrom ritory is that which was carried out by a man named Verberg, who erected a weir across the Adelaide River. His work is appoint- truly wonderful, considering that he carThe ried it out practically single-handed. I to have said on many occasions that the Government would do well to take a leaf out of this man's book, and follow his example in other parts of the Northern Territory. Sir Sidney Kidman has said that there is no better sheep country in Australia than the Macdonnell Range country, and the facilities for water conservation there are second to hone in Australia. Yet not a single penny piece has been spent on the conservation of water there.",40
83,Mr NELSON,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,It will not be a costly job either.,42
84,Mr JACKSON,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,That is so. It is deplorable that there has been practically no expenditure whatever in that part of Australia which it is proposed to call tral Australia.,42
85,Mr GIBSON,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,What is the rainfall in that part of the Territory ?,42
86,Mr JACKSON,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,The average annual rainfall of the Macdonnell Range country over a period of 30 years was 11 inches.,42
87,Mr ABBOTT,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,What is the average on the Barkly Tableland?,42
88,Mr JACKSON,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,"-The rainfall of the Barkly Tableland is a minimum of 15 inches rising to 21 inches per annum. The honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart) when Minister for Works and Railways visited Alice Springs. He subsequently said in this House, and repeated the statement to me only the other day. "" I should like to take a hundred of my Mallee farmers to Alice Springs. We could show them how to grow wheat."" The Commonwealth Government spent something like £50,000 on agricultural experiments in the north of the Northern Territory, but it has not spent a penny piece upon such experiments in that part of the Territory in which they would be most likely to get good results. I have mentioned that the commission will be able to recommend railways, roads and bridges, and water conservation. Having built railways, roads, and bridges, the commission will have solved practically the whole of the problem of the Northern Territory, because the Prime Minister has told U3 that the problem is solely one of transportation. In regard to water conservation, whilst the Government has been busy now and again in passing an occasional £1,000,000 to aid the Murray Waters scheme, I find that it has spent only £161,000 on bores, tanks, and wells in the Northern Territory during the fifteen years in which it has had control of it. This represents a paltry expenditure of £10,000 a year in a territory comprising one-sixth of the total area of Australia. I have to support this bill not because I think it is necessary or because I want it, nor yet because I think that the people of the Northern Territory are clamouring' for it. They are clamouring for and expect the development of the Territory, but I do not think that they look for more speedy development from the proposed commission than they could secure if the Ministry itself Cen- grappled with the problem as it should. I support the bill because it appears that the Government has fallen down on its job of the development of the Northern Territory. It seems to me to wish to dodge its responsibility and throw it upon the proposed commission and upon .the members of this House. MT. YATES (Adelaide) [8.13] - I support the measure on much the same grounds as those referred to by the honourable member for Bass (Mr Jackson). I reiterate what he has said and what the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr. Poster) tried to impress upon the Government, and that is that it is railway construction that is necessary for the development of the Northern Territory. We may appoint a commission, but I can hardly see how it could make recommendations for roads and bridges and water conservation if means of transportation are not first provided. As stated by the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce), means of transportation is a primary factor in the development of Central Australia. I hope that the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Hill) is not going slow on his job, and that before the end of the year a contract will be let for the construction of the line to Alice Springs. The honourable member for Bass told us that the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr. Stewart) said that he would like to take 100 Mallee farmers to the Alice Springs country. That is the country which will be served by the proposed railway. Until railway facilities are provided I do not see what the commission can do. We haye already passed a land ordinance for the Northern Territory, and the Government has seen to it that whatever develop? ment takes place under that measure will be for the benefit of the big landed proprietors.",42
89,Mr NELSON,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,The commission is going to tell us what we already know.,43
90,Mr YATES,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,"That will be so, honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson) speaks with practical knowledge of the country. As the honourable member who has just resumed his seat has said, we must support the appointment of a commission, although we do not like it . I do not think the people in the Northern Territory will welcome it . In my opinion, there will be no cessation of the losses that annually fall upon the Commonwealth in its control of the Territory until the real saviour of that portion of Australia arrives in the shape of a railway. We have dallied with the problem for years and years, and this bill is the only solution the' Government can offer. Whether this particular egg contains a chicken that will prove of benefit to the Commonwealth, I know not, but it will certainly be one that will come home to roost, because it will involve us in further losses until the north-south railway is put through. My sole purpose in supporting this bill is to quicken the activities of the Works and Railways Department in the construction of this railway. There are reams and reams of printed matter to prove the potential wealth of the Territory. To claim that it is not a white man's country is again an indication of falling down on the job. The fact that the southern portions of Australia are more populated and developed is no indication that the north is a useless, barren waste. In my opinion, one great factor that will tend towards the development of the Northern Territory, and the north-western portion of Western Australia, which is a splendid country from all one can hear of it , is the necessity for giving the people in those parts a better opportunity to get in touch with civilization. It is a strenuous business to live in the northern portion of Australia, and one of the greatest drawbacks to the settlement of that country is the fact that, when one leaves to recuperate his health, he must be absent from home at least three months. By means of a railway any resident of the Northern Territory could reach any other part of Australia within a fortnight. This bill is before its time. The construction of the railway should have preceded it . W it h the railway built, the commissioners would have an opportunity to exercise their capacity to promote the settlement and the of the land and the development of the Territory with all the facilities railway communication provides. However, the Government is pledged to do something to develop the Territory, and I shall not stand in its way and say that this commission should not be appointed. Like the honourable member for Bass (Mr . Jackson) I accord the bill my support, because it makes some slight effort to undo some of the things that have been done in the north, and because it is at least an attempt to go a little further ahead on the road of progress.",43
91,Mr MARR,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,"Parkes-Honorar y Minister) [8.19] - The Government is pleased with the manner in which the House generally has accepted this bill. The committee stage will afford opportunity to discuss the clauses in detail, and the suggestions that have been put forward by honourable members will receive careful consideration from the Government, but several remarks have been made during the debate which call for immediate reply. It has been said that much money has been wasted in the Northern Territory.  that.",43
92,Mr MARR,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,"On e could say the same of every State in the Commonwealth and of every dominion in the British Empire. Money is always scarce in a new country awaiting development by a handful of people. Honourable members know that, quite, recently, States have approached the Commonwealth Government for financial assistance, to see them through their trying periods of development. The Commonwealth will always endeavour to help the weaker States to become as strong as the stronger and more developed States. We all know that the British Government, in the earlier stages of Australia's development, gave financial assistance to the colonies. The Northern Territory has been the baby of the Commonwealth for fourteen or fifteen years. It is wrong to say that the blame for its lack of progress rests entirely on the Commonwealth Government. South Australia had the territory for many years, and was very glad to hand it over to the Commonwealth, just as, at the present time, other States are anxious to unload their financial burdens on to the Commonwealth. It must also be remembered that during the fourteen years we have had control of this portion of Australia, operations had practically to be suspended for the period of the war, and that, not only during the war, but also since, the financial strain upon the Commonwealth revenues has been exceedingly great.",43
93,Mr JACKSON,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,Some honourable members have suggested that the money has been spent in the wrong way and at the wrong end of the territory.,44
94,Mr MARR,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,"That is purely a matter of opinion. When the Labour Government took over the control of the territory from South Australia, it set out upon a developmental policy which it believed would be in the best interests of the Commonwealth, and I think every honourable member in this House, no matter to what party he may belong, is keenly anxious to see the territory developed. As a matter of fact, honourable members of the Opposition have assisted the Government with this bill, not only in the Senate but also here. It is an indication of the keen desire of every one to help the territory and make it a better place than it is. In discussing the b i l the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson) declared that Central Australia would not benefit by the bill to the extent that No r t h Australia would, but he must recognize that, although the .former is more sparsely nonulated than the latter, it will have the same sort of advisory council as is provided for No r t h Australia. The honourable member denied the usefulness of j these councils, but where they have been instituted in other territories controlled by the Commonwealth they have proved most successful and helpful to the Government. ",44
95,Mr MARR,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,"In the mandated territories, for instance.",44
96,Mr NELSON,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,Hav e they not wider powers than are proposed in this bill ?,44
97,Mr MARR,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,"They have power to make suggestions. The honourable member claimed that these advisory councils would not meet more than twice a year. The bill provides that they must not meet less than twice a year. . They may meet more frequently. They will certainly not have the right to criticize the actions of the commission, but they will study the ordinances governing the Territory and make suggestions for its better administration. The honourable member also claimed that residents of the Territory should have direct representation on the commission. Practically every honourable member who has spoken has said that the success of the commission will depend entirely upon the calibre of the men selected. The responsibility for the selection will - rest upon the Government. I am pleased to say that the selection of the geutlemen who comprise the Canberra Commission has been a great success, and if we get as good men for the Northern Territory Commission we shall be pleased indeed. Reference has been made to the powers of the commission. The bill is very clear in defining those powers, but in committee I shall move amendments to increase the responsibility of Parliament by providing that the commission shall not, be beyond the control of Parliament in the expenditure of money. The honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett) referred to the bill as another example of the readiness of the Government to launch into new enterprises and creating huge departments costing many thousands of pounds. If honourable members l , will peruse the speech delivered by the Minister for Home and Territories (Senator Pearce) in moving the second reading of this bill in the Senate, they will learn of *the many ramifications of administration in the Territory, and of the huge cost involved.",44

99,Mr MARR,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,T be f a u l t rests on the parliaments of the past.,44
100,Mr JACKSON,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,Why not grapple with the matter instead of waiting for a commission to do it ?,44
101,Mr MARR,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,"We have all done our best. When the Labour party was in power it did its best, according to its ability, to develop the Territory along the lines it thought suitable. But when we find that the railways in the Territory, taxation matters, and public works are administered from. Melbourne, Customs and quarantine matters from Brisbane, and postal work from Adelaide, all but three state centres having a finger in .'the pie, can the honourable memb.er for Henty still contend that the creation of a commission to supervize all these services is bound to increase the cost of administration? The honourable member also said that if a commission were appointed there would be no need for an Administrator, because he would have nothing to administer. As a matter of fact, the commission will not deal with such matters as law and justice, police, education, mines, fisheries, aborigines, and many other minor services. The honourable member's suggestion that the Commonwealth should commence the training of a staff of young officers to administer its various territories has already been forestalled. Twelve months ago the Commonwealth commenced to train young lads from high schools by passing them through a university course, and giving them special training in the mandated territories. These youths will spend - several years in the territories, and it is Hoped that in this way we shall get within a few years a staff of young officers who will be able to render efficient public service in the administration of the territories. The honourable member's suggestion that instead of using the names ""North Australia"" and ""Central Australia,"" we should call the two subdivisions of the Territory, "" Plinders"" and "" Sturt,"" respectively, will receive the consideration of Cabinet. As a matter of fact, the Government is prepared, to give full and sympathetic consideration to every suggestion put forward. When the bill reaches the committee stage honourable members will be able to discuss it at greater length, and any suggestions that they may then offer will receive sympathetic consideration. By giving the bill a speedy passage, honourable members will assist the Government in its endeavour to develop the Northern Territory and to place it upon a good financial footing within the next two or three years. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In committee: Clauses 1 to 4 agreed to.

I appreciate very much the promise of the Minister in charge of the bill that the Government will treat the suggestion seriously. I have suggested that the northern area should be called Flinders, after Matthew Flinders, the navigator, and the southern area called Sturt.",45
103,Mr YATES,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,Why not Stuart?,45
104,Mr GULLETT,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,Not MCDouall Stuart.,45
105,Mr YATES,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,He crossed Australia.,45
106,Mr GULLETT,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,"He did so after Sturt and others had pioneered and broken the back of that work. I do not wish for one moment to impose upon honourable members any particular names that I might select. It is for them to decide what names should be chosen. There should be little or no objection to the selection of the name of Matthew Flinders for the northern area. We have here an opportunity to immortalize and to do honour to a great man, at the same time doing honour to ourselves. I should not dare to enter into any controversy respecting the merits of Sturt and MCDouall Stuart, but I do say that Sturt, following on Oxley's tracks, first discovered the Darling, and a year or two later, I think in 1829, followed the Murrumbidgee to its junction with the Murray, and traversed that river to its mouth. He subsequently made two most gallant attempts to reach the interior of the continent. Sturt's work and the lessons drawn from it made relatively easy and simple all subsequent exploration in the interior and dry areas of this country, just as, for instance, the initial work, first of Scott, and later of Shackleton, made relatively easy the journey of the great Amundsen to the South Pole. If the Government is disposed to consider the alteration of the names which I know have accidentally been put in the bill, and which are pitifully humdrum, it should take action now or as soon as possible by introducing a short amending bill during this session. If we delay too long, the names of North Australia and Central Australia will be printed on a thousand and one documents, making it exceedingly difficult and expensive to alter them.  gest that Central Australia should be named after Stuart, and not after Sturt, as suggested by the honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett). Stuart was the first to cross the continent. He left his mark on a tree when he and his party gazed upon the Indian Ocean. That tree was discovered by an expedition led by my father, and from it portions were taken back, and preserved for a number of years. Unfortunately, before an opportunity was afforded to make a permanent memorial, a fire that part of the country, and when subsequent expeditions went to the spot there was no trace whatever of the tree. Stuart undoubtedly crossed the continent. Central Mount Stuart is named after him. If any change is to be made in the name of Central Australia, I certainly suggest that Stuart, and not Sturt, should be selected.",45
107,Mr HUGHES,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,"No r t h Sydney) [8.40]. - This clause may need amendment if amendments are made in subsequent provisions. Take, for example, the A d visory Council. If we link up the Government Resident with the Advisory Oouncil, then the clause will have to be altered. We find that there is to be one Government Resident for North Australia and one for Central Australia. Evidently those areas are to be full , or nearly full , of Government Residents. I suggest to the Minister that any amendment of the clause such as suggested by the honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett) might very well stand over until we have dealt with the rest of the bill. That would give the Government an opportunity to consider the matter. When the immortalizing of the name of Sturt view or Stuart, as the case may be, by applyof ing it to Central Australia, and that Flinders, or some other equally eminent name, by substituting it for "" North Auspastoralists tralia, "" we must remember that this country in time to come will conas sist of many States. For at least 250 years after the founding of the colonies of North America all the country west of the Mississippi was terra incognita. No one knew anything about it. It was referred to vaguely as "" West."" But what were formerly terrigood. tories have attained the dignity of States. If half of the eloquent description of tral Australia by the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Foster) be true, and I have no doubt that the whole of it is, then States <will eventually be thickly scattered throughout that fertile and progressive area. There is method in the manner of the Government's drafting of the clause. The names "" North Australia "" and "" Central Australia "" are generic terms. In the fullness of time. I have no doubt that the country known as the Barkly Tablelands will be a. State. There will be a State, coastals in its nature, and including theswept tropical parts of the Northern Territory-perhap s two, or even more, States: will be carved out of that area. I am certain that in the future there will be a State in the centre of Australia, with climatic conditions not dissimilar to those of New Mexico and also of Arizona, in the United States of America. The Minister might very well postpone this clause, and if amendments are made in subsequent portions relating to the commission and the Government residents, the definitions can be altered accordingly, and further consideration given to the suggestion made by the honourable member for Henty.",46

Having discussed this matter with many in the Northern Territory, I have in mind the election of such a man the present Chief Stock Inspector and Veterinary Officer of the Territory, who has traversed the country from one end to the other, is thoroughly familiar with all phases of the pastoral industry, and would reflect the matured opinions of the those who have settled there and made. It is desirable that the commission should be reinforced with some local Cenknowledge. The country is most deceptive, and a newcomer might be apt to condemn land that an old resident knew to be valuable, and to see virtues in country which experienced people knew to be ""worthless. Only years of personal experience of the country fits a person to judge its capabilities. If at least one member of the commission were elected by adult franchise the Territory and Australia generally would be advantaged. Direct representation of the people would give to them more confidence. I am sure it is the desire of all parties that the commission shall have the co-operation of the pioneers, who may be depended upon to choose a capable and trustworthy representative.",46
110,Mr CHARLTON,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,"Hunter ) [8.51] I hope the Honorary Minister will favourably consider the amendment. It is only fair that the people in the Territory should have representation on a commission which is to be endowed with very wide powers. It will be practically the parliament of the Territory, and the people who are directly concerned in its doings, and will have to pay the taxation that is imposed, should have a voice in the election of at least one of its members. We need not doubt that they will elect a man full y qualified for such a responsible office. If the people most in timately concerned are not given a voice in the administration we may expect dissatisfaction to arise. People like to have a representative to whom, they can apply and who has a knowledge of their conditions and requirements. Such a man would be of considerable assistance to the Government nominees. A f t e r all, one man will not control the commission.",47
111,Mr JACKSON,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,"Is it suggested that the elected representative should have certain qualifications, or would anybody be eligible ? MT. CHARLTON - If the were allowed to exercise their judgment they would choose a man who, in their opinion, was qualified. A f t e r all, they should be the best judges of who is most fitted to represent them. Many people may say that some honourable - members of this chamber are not qualified to be in Parliament, but the people who sent us here think otherwise. If this commission is to function successfully the people must have some say in its administration. Today the residents of the Territory complain that they are so rar removed from (be seat of government that they cannot get their needs attended to. They say that this Parliament lacks knowledge of their conditions, and it is true that prior to their getting direct representation in this chamber we knew very little of their country. Our ignorance was unavoidable, because honourable members cannot spare the time to visit and make themselves familiar with that distant part of Australia. The commission would probably be concerned in the imposition of taxation and the raising of funds by other means, and there is an old axiom that there should be no taxation without representation. This is a non-partisan bill.; all honourable members desire to make it an efficient instrument for the development of the Territory. No draughtsman can produce a perfect bill, but by the collective wisdom of the committee defects are discovered and remedied. The amendment is a desirable improvement, and is worthy of the serious consideration of Ministers.",47
112,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,"Warringah) [8.57] - I strongly object to the amendment. The members of the commission must be men of standing, intelligence, commercial experience, and, if possible, experience of Northern Territory conditions.",47
113,Mr MAHONY,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,Would not the people of the Territory choose such a representative?,47
114,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,"No . Those people who have a stake in Northern Australia, and have borne the heat and burden of the day are out-numbered by the wharf labourers and lumpers at Darwin, and if an election were held the nominee of the latter would be returned .",47
115,Mr BLAKELEY,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,I suppose they are people human beings; they are not mere bricks and mortar.,47
116,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,"They are human beings, but they are not qualified to choose a member, of a commission to administer the affairs of the Territory. An election would not produce a commissioner who would be worthy of the great powers and responsibilities that would be entrusted to him .",47
117,Mr LAZZARINI,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,"Werriwa) [8.59] I support the amendment. The commission will be in the position of a government. Unlike commissioners in the more populous States, the North Australia commissioners will be far removed from .the control of the Government and the scrutiny of the people. No form of government can be successful unless it has the confidence of the people whose affairs it controls. 1 resent the remark of the honourable member for Warringah (Sir Granville Ryrie) concerning wharf labourers. According to him, the members of the pronosed commission must be men of known commercial experience. History teems with the records of dismal failures in administration by commercial magnates whenever they have turned their attention to the business of governing a country. The psychology of commercialism is founded on principles of personal profit, whereas the psychology of governing is based on service. If the people in the Northern Territory have an opportunity to elect at least one representative- I would prefer two-the y will have the satisfaction of knowing that one member of the commission, at all events, will have the real interests of the Northern Territory at heart, and they will naturally be disposed to appeal to him for a redress of grievances. The adoption of the amendment will make the bill more effective. The view of the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson) should be respected. He is the elected representative of the people there, and as such enioys their confidence. I hope, therefore, that the committee will carry the amendment. Mr E. RILEY (South Sydney) [9.4]. - I support the amendment. Hitherto the Administrators of the Northern Territory have been Government nominees, and we have been told that, up to the present, all attempts at successful administration have proved futile. If the Northern Territory is to be developed on sound lines, the people who live in that portion of Australia should be consulted concerning the personnel of the commission to be entrusted with this important duty. The honourable member for Warringah (Sir Granville Ryrie) stated that if the amendment is agreed to one of the members of the commission will be elected by wharf labourers at Darwin. I remind the committee that the people of the Territory have their elected representative in this chamber, and I believe we are all agreed that he is a man whose opinion is Tespected.",47
118,Mr NELSON,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,"And I was not elected on the wharf labourers' votes; I did not get one of them. Mr E . RILEY - No man in this Parliament knows more than the honourable member about the affairs of the Northern Territory. Therefore, there is no danger in accepting the amendment. Mr Turlev. who at one time adorned the presidential chair in the Senate, was once a wharf labourer; and I remind honourable members that Lincoln, one of the greatest Presidents of the United States of America, at one period of his life was engaged on the wharfs and river boats. Like many other great men, he came from the ranks of the workers. The right honourable member for North Sydney (MT . Hughes) also has had a good deal of experience with wharf labourers. We all know that they are able to elect a good man as their representative. We may assume that if the Prime Minister (Mr . Bruce) had his way, he would probably select the Government nominees on the commission from other walks in l if e possibly from the Melbourne Club or Flinders-lane. I doubt, however, if we are likely to get the best men in that way. We want, if possible, to ensure the appointment of pioneers-me n who understand the problems of the Northern Territory. I question if we are likely to find them in the suburbs of either Melbourne or Sydney. This amendment touches the principles of constitutional government, because it involves the representation of the people. If we adhere to the principle of nomination, the three men selected by the Government will not be under any obligation to please the people in the Northern Territory at all, as long as they satisfy the Government. If , however, members of the commission are elected by the people, they will be disposed to "" stir the possum,"" and get things done. The remarks of the honourable member for Warringah were really a serious reflection upon the great mass of the people, because 90 per cent, of Australians are workers and wealth Producers, and quite capable of electing their own representatives on any governing body. I realise, of course, that it is hardly fair to expect the Minister, without notice, to alter the whole basis of the bill , but I hope that if he is not disposed to accept the amendment he will agree to the postponement of the clause, so that the Government may consider this proposal. At the last election the Prime Minister declared that he was as good as any trade unionist. He now has an opportunity to prove it by agreeing to the principle of election by the people in connection with the appointment of the proposed commission.",48
119,Mr HUGHES,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,"No r t h Sydney) [9.10]. - A very difficult point has arisen. I have listened carefully to the arguments and have turned them over in my mind. It is admitted that the position in the Northern Territory today is due, in the main, to lack of understanding and experience on the part of the Government - of the day. Being an interested party, I remained silent while eulogies were being showered on the Governments of which I was a member. But all this is to be changed. It is the Government's declared policy to bring about a new and very much better state of affairs in the Northern Territory in the future. We are told that this is to be achieved by the appointment of the right kind of men to the proposed commission. It is admitted that everything turns upon their being the right kind of men. The amendment of the honourable member is intended to ensure that one member of the commission, at least, will be a man who knows the country. I am deeply obliged to my friend, the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr Riley) for his references to my association with waterside workers. I see no difference whatever between a wharf labourer and a member of the Union Club. There are good men to be found in every walk of life. I judge each on his merits. I am not one of those who believe that no good can come out of Nazareth. I know something of land boards in my State, particularly the western land boards of New South Wales, and I have noted that the men selected have usually come out of the west-ou t of the country. Therefore, unless we suppose that the people in the Northern Territory would elect the most incapable from amongst themselves, and that they would show such a lamentable lack of appreciation as to make every effort on our part in vain, I think that, theoretically at all events, a good case can be made out for the election of one member of the commission. On the other hand, I must say that I do not lean to that kind of government at all. I believe that the people are best governed when they elect their Parliament, and when that Parliament, in effect, elects a Ministry which takes full responsibility for the selection of individuals to carry out the work that devolves upon Parliament. Although selection is not always uninfluenced by personal prejudice and a natural tendency of men to appoint persons of their own colour, still, on the whole, British institutions work out pretty well. I feel that this measure will be prejudiced from the outset, if the Government does not appoint one man who is a resident of the Northern Territory. Apparently, because of the risks involved, the Government is not inclined to look with favour upon the amendment, but an assurance might be given that one of its nominees on the commission will be from the Northern Territory. If possible, all three commissioners should either be present residents of the Territory, or have had a long experience of conditions similar to those that are encountered in the Territory. A statement from the Government that at least one commissioner will be a resident of the Territory would clear the air; but if the Government not only opposes the amendment, but also remains silent regarding its intention in the choice of the three commissioners, the measure will be prejudiced from the outset..",49
120,Mr WEST,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,"East Sydney) [9.16] Those who pay taxation should have, a voice regarding its expenditure. The residents of the Northern Territory will be called upon to pay certain taxes. To protect their own interests, the Government proposes to have two nominees on the commission. That commission will have the power to borrow, subject to the Treasurer's approval. The interest on any loans.that are raised will have to be found by the residents of the Territory. The present-day tendency of the large trusts in America and England is to allow the employees to have a representative on the board of management. The day is approaching when a similar spirit will prevail in Australia. I cannot understand the reason for the Government's opposition to it . Nothing oan be said against the ability or the integrity of the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson), and, if the residents of the Territory were given an opportunity to elect a representative to this body, I feel sure that they would choose a man of his calibre. They would have more confidence in the commission, and pay greater respect to its decisions, if they were represented upon it . There is an old adage that the people will obey laws that are liberal, but will not obey those that are not liberal. No honourable member can deny that a person chosen by the people of the Northern Territory would be better acquainted with their requirements. During the last ten years this Parliament has belittled itself by delegating many of its powers to boards and commissions. Commission after commission has been appointed, with the result that Parliament is not now regarded with a great deal of respect. Under this bill the Government proposes that Parliament shall hand over to a commission the control of the public revenue of the Territory. It is the duty of Parliament to criticize expenditure and to suggest means for raising revenue. I hope the day of commissions is fast approaching its end. It cannot be expected that the Government will view this proposition favourably, because it is under the thumb of those who have not the welfare of the people at heart. I am sure that, upon reflection, the honourable member for Warringah (Sir Granville Ryrie) will admit that he made a mistake when he cast a slur upon those members of the community who are not so fortunately placed as he.",49
121,Dr EARLE PAGE,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,Does the honourable member suggest that only the taxpayers should be allowed to elect a representative?,50
122,Mr WEST,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,"I said that that representative should be elected by the people who will have to provide the money that will be required for the development of the Territory. A better feeling would exist between the railway employees and the departments in the various States if a representative of the employees assisted in the management of the railways. This measure will place another heavy burden upon the shoulders of the taxpayers of Australia. Honourable members must realise the wisdom of seeing that any boards that are appointed expend their funds to the best advantage. It is wise for the Government to be represented on the commission, but its interests could be watched equally as well by one as by two men. The honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson) voiced the opinion of his constituents when he moved the amendment. Because a man is not a member of the Union Club in Sydney or the Melbourne Club in this city, he should not be debarred from having a voice in the management of the affairs of the Northern Territory. We hope that this measure will instil in the hearts of the people of the Northern Territory a desire to see it progress. The amendment does not propose to give them anything that a free, educated, and enlightened democracy ought not to have. If a resident of the Northern Territory were appointed, he would be in a position to furnish the other commissioners with valuable information of a practical nature. I hope that the amendment will be carried. If it is, I feel sure that honourable members will not regret it .",50
123,Mr MARR,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,"Parkes-Honorar y Minister) [9.29] - The eloquence of the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr . West) was not sufficiently persuasive to convince the Government of the desirableness of embodying the amendment in this measure. I would remind the committee that the taxpayers in the Federal Territory are not represented on the Federal Capital Commission, and that the various territories under the Commonwealth control are administered by officers responsible only to the Minister. I welcome, however, the suggestion made by the honourable member. The Government is as anxious as are others that satisfaction shall be given the people in the Territory; they are the pioneers, and deserve consideration. As the right honourable member for No r t h Sydney (Mr Hughes) said, we are all looking forward to the time when the population wiU be large enough to enable the people there to return their representatives to Parliament, from whom a government is formed which is responsible to the electors. The Government, however, will be responsible for the appointment of the commission, and will endeavour to obtain the services of the best men available. . I know that honourable members opposite desire to do their best in the interests of the Territory, and I ask them to believe that the Government is just as keen to select the best men to act as commissioners. If we can appoint three who have lived or who have had experience in the Northern Territory, we shall be very pleased.",50
124,Mr FOSTER,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,It was always intended 10 give the people of the Northern Territory representation at theproper time.,51
125,Mr MARR,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,Yes . The Government thinks that they should have representation on the advisory council.,51
126,Mr HUGHES,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,"Unles s the members of the commission have had experience in the Northern Territory, or in similar country in Queensland or South Australia, they will be of no use - at all.",51
127,Mr MARR,MEMORANDU M PAPER SUPPLIED,"That is admitted. Tho Government is anxious to meet, not only the wishes of the right honourable member for North Sydney, but also those of every honourable member, and it we can obtain the services of capable men who have had practical experience in the Northern Territory such men will be appointed as commissioners and also as members of the advisory council. Whilst the Northern Territory is in its present undeveloped state, the advisory council will meet the requirements for the time being, but as it progresses a different form of control will doubtless be found desirable. After all, the Government is responsible for the expenditure of the money. It is quite true, as stated during the second-reading debate, that vast sums of money have been expended in the Northern Territory, and the Government is keenly desirous that a satisfactory return shall be obtained for every f l spent. The commission will advise Parliament, which is responsible to the people. On a later clause I shall explain how it is proposed to place further power in the bands of Parliament.
