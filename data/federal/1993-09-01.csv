1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Stephen Martin) took the chair at 10 a.m., and read prayers. NA NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.2) 1993 Second Reading Debate resumed from 18 August, on motion by Mr Tickner: That the bill be now read a second time.",11
2,Mr MACKELLAR,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"As stated by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) in his second reading speech on 18 August, most of the amendments contained in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill (No.2) 1993 flow from recommendations made by the commissioners of ATSIC in February 1993 following their review of the act. The coalition supports the thrust of these proposed changes. After all, they respond to a number of concerns expressed by the opposition parties in relation to the conduct and accountability of regional councils. They also broadly reflect sentiments· contained in the coalition's policy at the last federal election which, among other things, signalled the importance of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander participation in the decisions that affect their lives and determine their local priorities, and the intention to decentralise the ATSIC operations and devolve to the maximum extent possible its administrative decision making to the regions. The coalition's policy on ATSIC also expresses an absolute requirement for focus on tangible benefits on the ground as a result of programs rather than the present focus on timely distribution of funds. It also has a requirement for the decision making to be open and transparent for organisations receiving government money to provide services in an efficient and equitable manner, and accountability in all levels of service delivery. This amendment bill is the second in a three-part legislative package. The minister has advised that the third package of amendments will be introduced later in the sittings and will deal with arrangements for the Torres Strait and with streamlining the financial provisions of the principal act. It will also grant the Office of Evaluation and Audit powers to evaluate and audit regional councils, Aboriginal hostels, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation, and ATSIC funded corporations. While the cOlllition will certainly look to this third legislative package with a great deal of interest, I will be concentrating solely on the measures before us today. The principal act currently allows regional councils to establish advisory committees to provide advice in relation to the performance of their functions. Such an advisory committee may include members of the regional councils. The proposal will entitle future members of the advisory committees to receive remuneration and allowances for their services, and provides that such members will hold office on terms and conditions determined by ATSIC. The proposed amendment will also strengthen the obligations and guidelines for regional councillors. It will impose on regional councillors and advisory committee members the requirement for declaration of pecuniary interest in any matter that is being or about to be considered. Declarations of pecuniary interest must be recorded in the minutes of the meeting. Provisions add to the list of circumstances that make a person ineligible to stand for election or be elected as a member of a regional council. Again directly relating to regional council operations is the setting of a global limit on remuneration and allowances payable to members of the advisory committees, regional councils and other office holders under the ATSIC act. This move means that, once the amount paid in remuneration equals the set limit, no further remuneration will be payable during the period in which the limit applies. Such a tightening-up of funding arrangements is welcome by the coalition in light of the increased ability that it will afford regional councils to manage their budget and expenditure allocation. Changes in relation to electoral boundaries will enable the introduction of a ward system for regional council elections and allow for the reduced number of regional councils. The introduction of a system of electoral wards is, as I understand it, a measure in response to concerns that the reduction in the number of regional councils might lessen the opportunity for representation by minority groups. Such a system is not unlike the ward system for local government elections in operation in Australia today. On the matter of wards, the coalition particularly notes the minister's advice about the future establishment of an electoral review panel and a process to assess and review the operations of regional council and ward boundaries. The coalition will look to the results of this review to ensure that it is indeed delivering the degree of fair representation of minority groups it is intended to provide. Other provisions in the bill aJlow for the election of a part-time deputy chairperson and a part-time alternate to the deputy chairperson of regional councils; a clearer definition of suspension, removal and acting arrangements for councillors; and empower the minister to detennine what constitutes misbehaviour to ensure that councillors fully appreciate their responsibilities. Finally, there is provision this bill for the deferral of the 1993 regional council elections in the Torres Strait islands to bring them into line with elections due under Queensland's Community Services (Torres Strait) Act 1984. The coalition parties appreciate the necessity for the smooth passage of this bill to enable the institution of measures vital to the ATSIC elections to be held in early December 1993. We have considered all the measures which, as acknowledged earlier, respond to a number of concerns for accountability and effective monitoring of federal funding through ATSIC. It is recognised that these measures make provisions for increased accountability and strengthen the ability of ATSIC to monitor its own affairs. However, notwithstanding our recognition of these genuine moves to respond to accountability concerns in so far as ATSIC is concerned, there are further question marks which the coalition sees hanging over the $1 billion-plus annual funding now directed to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs; funding which aims to reverse the great disadvantage which currently besets the majority of indigenous Australians. We have to ask the question: what progress are we making? A recent report on maternal deaths in Australia in 1988-90 stated that the incidence of direct deaths amongst Aboriginal women was the highest since 1972. Today, 20 years on, the incidence of maternal death for Aboriginal women through pregnancy and childbirth is eight times higher than for nonAboriginal women. As recently as one month ago, the federal Minister for Health, Senator Richardson, was moved to state: Whatever we've been doing has been inadequate and we must do more and I intend, for my part to do more. . Just over a month ago, at a. tropical diseases conference in Darwin, Dr Christine Phillips highlighted research from central Australia in which 374 Aboriginal people with diagnosed diabetes were monitored between 1984 and· 1991. During that seven-year period, a staggering 130 of them-60 men and 70 women-had died. Another report, by Professor John Mathews, Director of the Menzies in School of Health Research in Darwin, told the same conference that nearly all rural Aboriginal infants at six weeks of age were permanently infected with hannful bacteria. The minister may well be able to sl,lbstantiate his claim, published in the budget related paper entitled Social justice for indigenous Australians 1993-94, that in the last 20 years there has been a reduction of 60 per cent in infant and maternal deaths and a reduction in the impact of many infectious diseases. We can claim that for the non-indigenous population also. the real bottom line in examining all these performance indicators is that, in relation to the rest of the Australian population, the figures for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians show them to be a seriously disadvantaged group. This is totally unacceptable. It is clear that federal funding allocated to address the abysmal living standards of a large number of Aboriginal people in Australia still is not hitting the mark. It is therefore as an expression of deep concern that I move, on behalf of the coalition, the following amendment to the motion for the second reading of this bill: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House notes the Government's own admission that Aboriginal well-being is not improving and therefore calls for an review of ATSIC to determine the measures necessary to ensure an improvement in its performance in order to significantly lift the living standards of the indigenous population Australia"". I must stress that this amendment is not introduced as an ATSIC bashing exercise, but as a move which ATSIC should welcome and support. The information which can flow from the independent and transparent review must surely provide us with some strong guideposts as to where we have come and where we are headed in this crucial area. The coalition is aware of the criticisms directed towards ATSIC; most notable is the recent expressions by Ms Pat O'Shane who said, 'On every social indicator the position of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders has deteriorated over the past decade in the lifetime of ATSIC'. This is not fair or balanced criticism on any count. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989 was proclaimed on 7 February 1990. ATSIC commenced operations on 5 March 1990, just 31/2 years ago. Ms O'Shane should check her facts. At that time, ATSIC's statement of purpose was that it would work towards the achievement of a situation of justice and equity in the longer term where Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders have sufficient economic and social status to enjoy fundamental civil, social, and economic rights. While appreciating the recognition in this statement of the long-term view, it has opened up a question as to whether vital areas such as health and housing should be the sole responsibility of ATSIC. This question has also been put to the shadow Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent), during his recent travels to various Aboriginal communities around Australia. Professor John Mathews, whom I quoted earlier, also made this point recently: 'We know that chronic bronchitis and damaged lungs in later life are a sequel to childhood infections that aren't treated properly. These bacterial infections undermine a person's health later in life. Death rates from pneumonia in people with damaged lungs are very high in middle age and that is probably a independent consequence of what's happened in childhood' . The yardstick by which one measures the 'effectiveness of programs, of particularly ht;:alth programs, is also significant. The 10 years offered as a yardstick by Ms O'Shane is, I believe, an unrealistic indicator. A further sad commentary on all this lies with Professor Mathews' two statements quoted previously. The prognosis for today's six-week-old rural Aboriginal infants who are permanently infected with harmful bacteria will be realised in their middl y age. This is a national shame, and it requires a national effort to combat it. The coalition welcomes the health minister's interest in becoming involved, and it has no reason to doubt that he is genuinely anxious to do something tangible about the poor living standards of indigenous people. Finally, I remind the House that the coalition's, policy on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders emphasises the need for clearly defined objectives for the achievement and improvement in Aboriginal health, in the provision of housing and infrastructure, in Aboriginal education, and in Aboriginal economic development. Benchmarks must be set for assessing these four practical and vital indicators of human well-being and quality of life. The coalition believes it is essential that an independent review be made of the ability of the ATSIC structure to realistically deal with the multifarious demands required to be met to reduce the disadvantages of Australia's indigenous peoples.",11
3,Mr SPEAKER,ISLANDER COMMISSION,Is the amendment seconded? Mr Atkinson-I second the amendment and I reserve my right to speak.,13
4,Mr GIBSON,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"I appreciate the' opportunity to participate this debate on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill (No.2) 1993. This legislation furthers the reform process of the ATSIC political structure, particularly as it applies in the regions. This legislation advances the effectiveness and integrity of this body, both within and outside the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community. ATSIC has built an impressive to record over its three years of operation. This legislation will enable the political and istrative arms of the commission to operate much more efficiently in achieving its and objectives. It is important for all honourable members to appreciate that this is very much an ing process of self-dete1ll1ination and selfover. management by the Aboriginal and Torres .Strait Islander people of Australia. When the original ATSIC legislation was enacted, concept of giving the power to Aboriginal Islander people to determine their own prioriand ties and manage their own affairs was a idea for non-indigenous Australia. Many (Quorum formed) thought it would not work. There was much scepticism and some fierce opposition from some sections of the Aboriginal community as well as others in the political spectrum. ATSIC had a very stormy gestation and its birth Was difficult. The decision by many boycott the first elections for regional councilbeen lors and commissioners did not cause stillbirth as some had hoped. Three years later we have a healthy developing organisation that grows stronger, wiser and more proficient with each passing day. There are of course many things still to learn and many improvements that be made to strengthen the decision making processes and to provide greater control funding decisions in regions. In using the analogy of the birth and growth of a child to describe the evolving developdetermine ment of ATSIC, I do not seek in any way to be patronising or paternalistic in my approach to the process of self-determination for riginal and Islander Australians. Far from I am strongly committed to advancing process of self-government for. indigenous people. Rather, I seekto emphasise that all of us-members of the parliament and the in government, workers in the bureaucracy both in ATSIC and in other departments, Aborigi. nal and Islander people and the rest of the Australian population-are on a sharp learning curve in shaping this new concept within our political and administrative structures. It is a radical new concept, untried anywhere else in the world in the fashion of our model, and all participants in the process need ti,ne grow with it and to reshape it as it evolves. ATSIC does have limitations. It has made adminsome mistakes over the past thfee years. There are still areas where improvements are aims required. Many Aboriginal and Islander people do get frustrated with some of the bureaucratic processes that are used. Many evolvwould like to have a lot more control now some of the national programs and over expenditure on Aboriginal needs done by other departments. But all of these issues will the be worked through and will be improved if and we keep our eye on the long-term objective do not allow ourselves to be sidetracked new or become short sighted or too desperate. I am disappointed that a quorum was called because I was just about to praise the opposition for the role it played in Aboriginal and Islander affairs. I might have to withdraw those words. In the last three years a hallmark to of Aboriginal and Islander administration has the spirit of cooperation between the government and the opposition. Unfortunately, that spirit of cooperation has not been demonstrated in the, House today through those opposite interrupting people who are trying to make some very important points on a very can important area of public administration. The task for ATSIC over the first three over years of its existence has been to shape a . political and bureaucratic structure which enables Aboriginal and Islander i people to their needs and priorities and to target resources to those needs with strategic programs that they are responsible for. That Abotask has been made much easier by the it. cooperation and support of the opposition in the this parliament. I acknowledge the very important role the former opposition spokesperson on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island- son. er affairs, the now Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), played in achieving this. I welcome the continuation of that policy under the wise counsel of my friend, who is absent, the current opposition spokesperson, the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent). Too often in the past, the administration of Aboriginal and Islander affairs has been used for cheap point scoring and very destructive political agendas. A great deal of hysteria had been built up among the nonAboriginal Australian community about allegations of gross mismanagement, corruption, excessive waste of resources and accusations that indigenous Australians were being given unfair advantages in the allocation of government support. These continuing allegations built up considerable tensions, caused significant disruption to the administration of Aboriginal needs and led to racism and abuses of the rights of many indigenous people. Those· processes have very much diminished in the past three years. We have been able to operate in .a much more cooperative and cohesive way in tackling the isolated examples of waste or mismanagement without the climate of hysteria and hatred that existed previously. The positive relationships between the Minister Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) and his opposition counterparts have been a significant factor in this achieve that ment. The other very important factor in achieving constructive reform in the administration of A:boriginal affairs has been the excellent leadership provided by the Chairperson of ATSIC, Ms Lois O'Donoghue. Lois is a woman of outstanding character, ability and compassion. She has overseen the establishment and development of the new commission with determination and intellectual rigour, and also with personal qualities of calmness, sincerity and understanding of the complexities of the needs of the individuals for whose welfare she is responsible. I do not believe ATSIC would have had the stature it has today without Lois's contribution as chairperIn my role as Chairperson of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs I have had the opportunity to meet numerous representatives of Aboriginal and Islander community organisations and members of a number of ATSIC regional councils around Australia. Their views and experiences have provided me and my committee colleagues with valuable insights into the workings of ATSIC, the issues of concern and the areas where further improvements are needed. Without wishing to pre-empt the final report of the standing committee in its current inquiry into the access and equity strategy, I would like to outline some of the ways in which Aboriginal and Islander people believe ATSIC needs to be further strengthened. The amendment moved by the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MACKellar) goes to the very essence of the problem ATSIC has. There is a misconception in the Australian community, within both the indigenous and non-indigenous populations, that ATSIC is responsible for the totality of Aboriginal affairs. That misconception is creating enormous problems for ATSIC and Aboriginal people. Many Aboriginal people tum up at ATSIC for regional offices expecting ATSIC to be able to help them with a whole host of areas that it does not have responsibility for. The fact is mainstream government departmentswhether we are talking about the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services, the Department of Employment, Education and Training or the CES; whatever department we might be talking about at the Commonwealth, state or local government level-have prime responsibility for delivering services to Aboriginal people as well as to other Australians. Unfortunately, I do not believe that those departments are delivering those services in the way they should. The problem we face is that many government departments and indigenous Australians think that ATSIC is responsible for everything. It is not, and it would not be able to achieve all of those things. There is a view and a wish amongst Aboriginalpeople on ATSIC's regional councils that they should· have a much greater say in the way in which .these other mainstream departments deliver their services, but that is not currently the case. They do not have a say in the way in which the Commonwealth Department of Health, Housing and Community Services delivers its services to Aboriginal people; they do not· have any say. in the way in which state housing commissions might allocate housing to Aboriginal and urban communities where Aboriginal people might live; they do not have a say in the way in which state health departments provide hospitals and other community health services to Aboriginal people as well as to other Australians. Those are the areas where we have great problems. It is a misconception to be blaming ATSIC for the fact that we have not been able to make significant inroads into health and education issues for Aboriginal people. ATSIC's responsibility is to complement mainstream government departments. It is there to top up. It is there to identify where there are some specific areas of neglect from those mainstream departments and to put some extra money into help those communities. It is not there to provide prime services. It is there to give a voice to Aboriginal and Islander people so that they can identify their needs in that area, and to say to those mainstream departments, 'This is what you should be doing. This is the major area of concern that we have in our atea, and we have real health problems'. That is clearly understood by the government and the opposition. There are incredibly poor health statistics for the Aboriginal and Islander .people in this country. But it is not ATSIC's responsibility to do the job alone. ATSIC's responsibility is to work with those government departments at state, Commonwealth and local government levels in order to identify strategic ways in which to tackle those primary health problems. Officers of government departments have a responsibility in this area and they should be talking to ATSIC and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander political leaders in the community. They should be asking, 'What strategies do we need to undertake together to achieve these improvements in health, education and housing needs?'. That is the real challenge. The proposed amendment, which calls for an inquiry into ATSIC, will not achieve that. We need to be talking about much greater levels of coordination and cooperation. We should be challenging the whole spectrum of government administration in this country and should appreciate· the responsibility it has to the indigenous people of this country. We should be working with the indigenous people to tackle those issues. We should not blame ATSIC for the fact that we have not had the capacity to tackle primary health, education or employment needs. ATSIC is working very hard to identify the areas of need and put in place programs that will achieve improvement. With the $800 million-odd that ATSIC has responsibility for spread across Australia, trying to tackle all of those needs is an impossible task. We have to start working together. The whole community has to appreciate the fact that ATSIC is now, and will be for quite a considerable time in the future, the political representative structure of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Everybody needs to recognise that and work with ATSIC. Let us stop the white-anting and the undermining of this structure. The Aboriginal and Islander people now have an effective voice .. We should start using that effective voice and should be working together to tackle those problems. I do not accept the opposition's proposed amendment. I do not believe that it is a f.air assessment to engage in some new study of whether ATSIC is effective or not, unless there is a determination by the opposition which says, 'All these other government departments should give all of the funding that they are given in their portfolio departments to ATSIC to administer'. I do not think that will happen, and I do not think it should happen. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are Australians. They deserve their share of mainstream government expenditure on their needs. ATSIC's responsibility is to coordinate that service delivery in its regions. Where there are pockets of need that are not being addressed, ATSIC has to ensure that it comes in with a specific program and assists the Aboriginal organisations to work in the communities. That is the challenge that we have as a government, and that is the area where I believe we should be working in an effort to strengthen ATSIC. The other problem that we have is that we still place much greater emphasis on accountability and examining where every single dollar is spent on Aboriginal affairs than we do on any other government department. Aboriginal expenditure is still put under the microscope much more closely than any other government expenditure. It is about time that we stopped this abuse of our responsibili- country. ty for accountability-targeting Aboriginal programs over and above the way in which we generally supervise administration. I am not saying that every dollar we spend on Aboriginal affairs should not be accounted for and that expenditure should not be supervised. I am a strong believer in accountability of government expenditure. But I do not believe that Aboriginal programs should be placed under more scrutiny-incredible scrutiny-than other government departments. We are spending an inordinate amount of time satisfying those accountability procedures and not spending sufficient time addressing the real needs-fixing up health problems, housing problems, giving people a real educational opportunity and giving people a job. That is where we want the money to go. We must identify that as our real challenge, instead of placing enormous microscopic scrutiny on every single dollar that is spent Aboriginal affairs. That accountability demand is placing enormous pressure on Aboriginal organisations. We do not give them the skills to satisfy those accountability procedures, but we demand that every cent be accounted for and that they go through an enormous bureaucratic process to satisfy government audit requirements. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill (No.2) is part of an evolutionary process for ATSIC. It is giving a bit more power to the regional councils. It is tidying up a few problems that have been identified in the last three years. It is part of an ongoing process that I think we are going to be going through for the next 20 or 30 years in this place: that .is, making minor amendments as needs emerge, as Aboriginal and Islander people raise with us their needs for further change in the political structure. This parliament and· the people of Australia have to recognise that ATSIC is here to stay. Our challenge is to make ATSIC a very strong and effective organisation and to give it the skills to work with all the other government departments to achieve its real objective. That will lead to a massive improvement in the quality of life for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in this",14
5,Mr KATTER,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"In rising to speak on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission' Amendment Bill (No.2), I do so with some deep grief and disappointment at what has happened in Queensland. Over 30 per cent of Australia's people of Aboriginal descent live in Queensland-arguably over 40 per cent of people of Aboriginal descent live in Queensland. In the history of Queensland there has only been one change of government in 100 years. For the first 60 of those 100 years the Australian Labor Party was in office. That was the party of socialism and humanity. Let us look at the record of the laws that existed in Queensland when the Liberal-National Party coalition took office in 1957. A person of Aboriginal descent who worked for a wage did not have his wage paid to him; it was paid to the Director of Native Affairs whose local officers were on the police officers. The Aboriginal worker had to go along and speak to the police officers and tell them what he wanted the money for and they would give him sufficient money to cover that particular need. I leave to the imagination of the members of the House how pleasant that function would be. When a mustering camp or droving trip finished, everyone went and drank some of their earnings at the hotel. But of course the black ringer could not, firstly,because he would not have any money; and, secondly, because black people in the state of Queensland were not alIowed to drink in hotels by law. So when a droving trip finished, the whites would go to the pub together as mates but the black people would be excluded. In each town in Queensland we had what were affectionately known as blacks' camps. They were a disgrace to the people of Australia, to the governments of Queensland and, most certainly, to the towns in which they existed-which was most of the towns in Queensland. The worse law of alI was the removal order. An officer of the Department of Native Affairs could simply pluck someone of Aboriginal or part-Aboriginal descent off the street-at the officer's whim and discretion, with no appeal system-and send that person to what was affectionately calIed a reserve. When a person went to a reserve, he was totalIy in the hands of and under the direction of the superintendent. 'Superintendent' was the word used in the act, and that same word was used in the act with respect to gaols in the state of Queensland. The superintendent on a reserve had powers similar to the superintendent of a gaol, except that the powers of the former were more extensive. He could give an order-the act did not specify what the order could be; it could be 'brush my shoes' or 'mow my lawn' or any order whatsoever-and if that order was disobeyed the person so ordered could be punished. In fact, the superintendent could punish that person in any event; he could, at his discretion and without any appeal, impose a punishment. Mr Dodd-When did you change alI that?",17
6,Mr KATTER,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"The honourable member for Leichhardt probably has more people of Aboriginal descent in his electorate than any of us-not that he would know about it, of course, because he does not come from Queensland. This great expert on Queensland Aboriginal affairs-who has been in Queensland for two minutes-has asked, 'When did we change it?'. I ask the honourable member to wait, because there is plenty more to come. The removal order allowed the superintendent to apply corporal punishment. I will cite a case. A gentleman who was not 50 years of age came to see me when I was state minister. He showed me the marks on his back from when he had been tied to a telephone pole at Cherbourg and belted with a strap. The whole community was ordered out to watch this occur. This man was less than 50 years of age-that is what he claimed, and he did not look more than that. That is what happened to him. One of my senior officers standing behind the man, and who was in fact from Cherbourg, nodded to me that this had actually occurred in our day and age. I am not talking about past history here. Mr Dodd-What did you do about it?",18
7,Mr KATTER,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"The honourable member, who has been in Queensland for two minutes and who is supposed to represent more black people than anyone else in Australia, has asked what we did. Every single one of those laws was wiped off the books within 3 1h years of our coming to office in Queensland. It took previous governments 60 years to reduce those people to the most dreadful conditions of any people living on earth. The party of the honourable member for Leichhardt did that; it was part of the White Australia policy. The attitudes of the honourable member's party were reflected in every single· aspect of the legislation in Queensland. I understand why the honourable member does not ,know about it-not only does he enjoy a reputation for being a bit lacking above the shoulders, but also he has only been in the state for two minutes. But the people of Cairns will of course be made aware of this in due course. Let me move on. Within 3 1h years, every single one of those pernicious, dreadful pieces of legislation was wiped off the books. That is a pretty good effort in 3 1h years-to tum around nearly 70 years of degradation imposed upon those people by the ALP in the state of Queensland. When we took government in Queensland I can remember that the local picture theatre had a steel bar. The black people sat behind the steel bar while the white people sat in front of it. That was Queensland when we took government. Mr Dodd interjecting",18
8,Mr KATTER,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"This Johnny-come-lately to Queensland does not understand what happened in the last six years. He has not been there long enough. In the last six years, we decided to take two initiatives which were unique in Australia. One initiative was to give the people on the reserve areas in Queensland ownership of the seven million acres of those reserve areas. It is not ownership as in the Northern Territory, where nothing can take place on 50 per cent of the land without the matter being referred to the government in Canberra for permission. This is absolutely, completely fee simple. Maybe as a lawyerand the honourable member for Leichhardt did not enjoy a very good reputation as a lawyer either, let me tell him-the honourable member would understand what fee simple means. It means freehold land. The only difference between title and freehold land is that land title could not be sold to outsiders. The land could be sold only to community residents. Those residents for the first time had ownership that enabled them to get a mortgage from the banks. Without loans from the banks, no community can grow-whether it be the Australian community or a community at Kowanyama. Our second initiative was to grant what the people call self-management-Iocal government, as most of us would know it. As with everything else, the ALP claimed it was not self-management. There was a case-the R. v. Smallwood case-involving a gentleman who was a member of the land council at Yarrabah. It was decided in that case that proper, complete local government powers had been handed.to the properly constituted Yarrabah community council. That is not quite true because far more extensive powers were granted to the councils. Those councils also had extensive control over the police force and various other activiaround'. ties. That was not because we were particularly in love with people of Aboriginal descent but because of the impossibility of properly administering places such as Kowanyama from 1,500 miles away in Brisbane-it was utterly impossible. One would get far better administration from the people on the ground in that place. That has been the great failure of ATSIC. Once again, we have government that is geographically and in every other way remote from the people. Problems of culture, education, language and communication skills have caused immense difficulties for the people of Aboriginal descent in Queensland. So we handed over the land and, when we wanted to bury the land ownership, the ACC gave us a direction: 'If you touch that then the sky will fall on you'. The Aboriginal people were so pleased with what they got that 4,000 people turned up at Yarra bah for the handing over of the deeds of grant. As reported on the front of the Cairns Post, the old men cried. They cried two years later after the ALP took half of the Yarrabah reserve away from them. The death of the chairman of the Yarrabah council, Peter Noble, can be laid right at the feet of the ALP. That man took seriously the capture, the theft, the world heritage listing of haliof the Yarrabah reserve. He came under such criticism that he found it difficult to cope. That, coupled with certain other matters, led Peter Noble to drive in such a reckless manner that all I can say to the members opposite is: 'Thank you for the death of Peter Noble'"" But that was not the end of the story of land ownership in Queensla'nd. The ALP won office. Black people in Queensland handed out how-to-vote cards, and they still do, because they have been deceived, as they have been for so much of their recent history. I do not get angry with them. I just feel terribly sad that these people are so deceived that they do not know what is going on. I will be very particular in talking about the electorate of the honourable member for Leichhardt because the last time. I was there Percy Neal said, 'G'day, mate. What are you doing in town?'. 1 said, 'You know, fooling He said, 'Come out and see us'. So we went out to the farm and I said, 'Do you understand what has happened with the land ownership?'. He said, 'We know. We own nothing now'. I said, 'Well, aren't you goinr; to do anything about it?'. He said, 'What's the use? Old dad fought for 72 years for land and we won the battle. Two years later they took half of it off us and then three after the .government that we stood in the sun and handed out. how-to-vote cards for took the rest of it off us. So what's the use?'. That is the situation in Queensland. seven million acres are no longer owned by the land councils or in private ownershipcase because the councils had the machinery to means to pass the land on to private ownerat ship. All of that seven million acres is now owned by the government. The absolute ism towering stupidity of the eight white officials that drafted the legislation has been such that the only way the black people can get at that difference. legislation is to prove tribal relationship. That is very helpful in Yarrabah because there only about 50 people in a town with a popuriginal lation of 2,000 to 3,000 that are of the origitrained nal tribe! At Cherbourg, there are about 12 from the original tribe. In fact, almost all the reserves in Queensland have virtually none of the original members of the tribe on the land. So the legislation has not only taken the land away from these people term but also ensures that the majority of the people living on the reserves can never have that land. Even in the short term and even if one is member of the original tribe, land ownership is still very difficult to prove because one to mount a campaign in the courts and through legal tribunals, which of course lines the pockets of the Aboriginal legal aid lawat yers who have parasited and bloodsucked off the people of Aboriginal descent in a most tralian. dreadful manner. The last legal aid lawyer in Mount Isa was being paid $72,000 a year, and I am told he could not get a job for $26,000 a year as an articled clerk in Melbourne. not know whether that is true but I am fairly certain it is, because he most certainly did do too well when he got out of the job. Mr Braithwaite-He didn't stay there long.",19
9,Mr KATTER,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"Yes, he did not stay there the too long afterwards either. He did not have much chance of making a quid in any other way. But we know how many parasites are this place. We also know that the Mabo case his was brought by the firm of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), years whose Queensland agents were Goss Downey hot and Carne-the firm of Wayne Goss. So we know who are getting their pockets lined by the great legalists of this place in Aboriginal The affairs in Australia. Let me move on because, unfortunately, the is much sadder than this. I tell this story the House because it needs telling-it cuts the· very heart of Aboriginal affairs and highlights the difference between the paternalof the socialists and the equal rights and responsibilities approach of our side of politics. This story graphically illustrates that We had a bloke trained up by my right are hand, the deputy in the Department of Aboaffairs, Eric Law. This young man was up to go in and take over as the shire clerk at Weipa South. He did such a brilliant of job that his efforts were brought to the attention of 60 Minutes, which ran a program because for the first time in Australian history a group of people had decided to work volunin the short tarily for the dole. What is now known as CDEP was in fact started by this shire clerk with the community council at Weipa. He was brilliantly gifted a and well trained for the job. 60 Minutes got more laudatory letters than it had ever had has before in its history-so much so that, for the only time in its history, 60 Minutes did a follow-up program on what had taken place Weipa because it set an example not only for black people in Australia but every AusSome three or four months after this, I went up to Weipa. The young man was most I do inhospitable and non-communicative towards me. I said, 'How are things going?'. He said, not 'Not much good'. I said, 'Let me tell you what has happened. The ALP government in . Canberra has sent up a white public servant too who has come in as a development officer and is undermining you and taking control of running of the council'. He said, 'How did you know that?'. I said, 'Because they've done it in every single community in Queensin land. Our efforts to put real power in the hands of the black people and to force them, even if they don't want to, to make the decisions themselves are being undermined by another group of white parasites, the so-called do-gooders. And I tell you what: my experience is that the do-gooders have done bloody well for themselves, bloody well'. Excuse my language, Mr Deputy Speaker. This young man, the white officer there, Darvel Long-this white parasite put in there by the ALP government, the socialists and the paternalists-started going to the shire chairman and saying, 'This particular person doesn't really understand some things. You could get yourself into trouble here. I think I'd better take over the running of this function or that function'. As he started taking over the running of all of these functions, the confidence of the council in its own shire clerk was undermined more and t:nore. Thanks to the degradation imposed upon these people by 70 years of ALP rule, these people do not have very high self-esteem. Naturally, the thinking was that, where administration was concerned, it would be better to get behind a white bloke than a black bloke. The end to this sad story is that when this particular person came back after a weekend he found that the computer code had been changed so that he could not access the computer for the shire council. His job became a farce and he resigned. That is the tragic end. That is the story of Aboriginal affairs throughout Australia. I hope that the people in ATSIC will fight to redress some of those wrongs because the existing structure is extremely poor when it comes to delivering the things that need to be delivered in this area. Our policy created a situation in which only six of the 28 councils in Queensland attracted any bad report ot comment from the Auditor General. This year, of the 28 councils, only six did not have a bad report from the Auditor-General. In other words, whereas previously almost every council was doing its job as well as any shire council in Queensland, we now have a situation in which virtually not one is doing so because the accountability provisions were removed. Ultimately, the people of Australia will not respect them if there are no accountability provisions. That is the first point. The second point is that we directed that all houses in Queensland be built exclusively by black labour. That created 400 to 500 jobs for the structurally unemployed in the state of Queensland. That has been reversed and we are back to building prefabricated, rubbishy houses built by outside, white contractors. Consequently, 400 to 500 black jobs have gone up in smoke, and that is quite apart from the building of remarkably inappropriate homes. Further, the people have no land. To be successful in modem society, people need the proper machinery-the modem machinery of government and economic enterprise. Collective ownership and cultural inheritance have been argued backwards and forwards by anthropologists until everyone's face was red. I think it is a moot point as to whether they have collective ownership. or not. Nevertheless; we are not talking about the past. If we are going to enable these people to have a future then we must give them the machinery that will work in the future. That machinery is private ownership and private enterprise, just as it exists in Cairns. If the same machinery went into Yarrabah that went into Cairns there would be the same success story as we have seen with the Neals, the Connollys and all the other people who have been so successful in business. They might see themselves as having had a bit of a battle but what small businessmen in Australia today do not have a battle? The remarkable success stories that we have seen are now reversing at a hundred miles an hour because of the hypocrisy of the government-a government that bit the hand that fed it in such a dreadful way. With so many Aboriginal legal aid lawyers employed by the government of Queensland and this government, where is the thanks for lining their pockets to the tune of $72,000 a year? As Neville Bonner said, the money allocated for blacks in Australia ends up in white pockets. One university study indicated that 60 per cent of that money ended up in white pockets. Under a government of socialists, 400 or 500 building jobs were removed and we are back to the situation of having white shire clerks in all the Aboriginal communities of Queensland. We are slowly moving back to the old days of paternalism that the socialists imposed upon these people over a period of 70 years, bringing them to the state that they are in today. (TIme expired)",20
10,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"Mr Jenkins)Order! During the remarks of the honourable member for Kennedy, he made some comments that may have implied improper motive to 'the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. Whilst the standing orders allow him to make comment about others, it would appear to be a transgression of the standing orders to imply improper motives to other members. I therefore ask the honourable member to withdraw those remarks. Mr Katter-'-I am quite happy to withdraw the remarks because I am not in any way trying to impugn the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding). What I am trying to impugn are the Aboriginal legal aid workers' Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-I thank the honourable member for his withdrawal, but he should do so without further comment.",22
11,Mr DODD,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"I commence my speech in this debate on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill by quoting these words: Isn't it reasonable to say that, prosperous and remarkably hannonious multicultural society in Australia, surely we can find just solutions to the problems which beset the first Australians, the people to whom the most injustice has been done. Those are the words of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on 10 December 1992 at Red,fern, at the opening of the International Year for the World's Indigenous People-his famous Redfern speech. In reply to the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter), I acknowledge that injustice has been done to all Aboriginal people by all governments prior to the enlightened period that started in the 1970s. That is what the Prime Minister said in his speech at Redfern, that all governmentsLabor, Liberal and National-stand condemned, but especially the National Party government that presided in Queensland for 20 years, in which time the honourable member for Kennedy was one of the ministers for Aboriginal affairs. I wish to praise the Prime Minister and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) for the support given to the Aboriginal, and Torres Strait Islander Commission and for their recognition of the necessity for social justice for indigenous Australians. I also praise the former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Gerry Hand, and another previous Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding). Since the election of the Hawke government in 1983 there has been a slow evolution towards the present position where ATSIC is the embodiment of self-government for Australia's indigenous people. Despite all the rhetoric, rambling and inconsistencies of the honourable member for Kennedy, he really did not address the question of ATSIC at all. If he really believed his rhetoric he would support this legislation and not the spurious amendment that has been put forward calling for some sort of review of ATSIC which is really an attack on ATSIC, its commissioners and thoSe people in the regional councils who work tirelessly and, prior to the introduction of this legislation, without any reward. In fact, it is an attack on the very Aboriginal people if we can build a who voted for him. I make these comments in relation to the speech of the honourable member for Kennedy and to the amendment itself, which he seems to support. (Quorum formed) I must say that, listening to his speech, I do not know whether he supports the bill or even whether he supports the amendment. Who knows what his position is. What I do know is that this bill further enhances self-determination for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia. The section 26 review which brought about the changes provides proof of this. I travel among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities more than most members of this House. The message that I get, which has been put by the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), is that there are problems with ATSIC; people do concede that. After all, as the honourable member for tives Moreton said, it is not an organisation has been with us for very long. When one asks Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, 'Okay, there are problems with critical ATSIC; do you want to go back to DAA days?', they say, 'Oh, no, we don't want that at all'. I think that is the nub of Mr Bevis interjecting",22
12,Mr DODD,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"That is exactly right. I thank the honourable member for Brisbane for his interjection-boiled lollies and beads was the response of previous governments in Queensland before the election of the current government. The primary focus of this bill is not neceson sarily on the commission itself but on the regional councils. I found it strange that honourable member for Kennedy would of choose to make a comment about people being governed from Brisbane, or even from Islander people. Canberra, when the very point of this legislation before the House is to devolve more power to the regional councils. The regional councils are, by definition, in the regions. That means that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in my electorate have decideclaration sions made not from Brisbane, but from the regional councils in Cairns, the peninsula the Torres Strait. Mr Katter- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The honourable Leichhardt said that I was opposed to regional - government. I in fact instituted regional government in Queensland. Mr DEP.UTY SPEAKER (Hon. N.B. ution Reid}--:-There is no point of order. That difference of opinion. The honourable memnever ber· has had the opportunity to express his view.",23
13,Mr DODD,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"Regional councils hold the key to the ·successful achievement of the principles of self-determination that underline the formation of ATSIC. ATSIC is structured so that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have a say in government decisions that affect their lives. The way in which commission gives Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people a voice, as we through the election of community representato the regional councils. ATSIC has only that been in operation since Monday, 5 March 1990; that is, just over three years. In that period, the regional councils have played a role in determining funding priorities the old and planning in local areas. Over the past three years, Aboriginal and it. Torres Strait Islander people have been able .to identify problems with the operation of regional councils and have come up with suggestions to rationalise the way regional councils work. So this second package of amendments, like those introduced earlier this year, flows from recommendations contained in the commission's report to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres - Strait Islander Affairs the operation of the act. The measures in this bill will further enhance the representathe tive nature of ATSIC and strengthen the role regional councils as the linchpin of empowerment for Aboriginal and Torres Strait As we have heard, the bill provides for reforms to enhance the role, effectiveness and accountability-and I emphasise accounfability-of regional councils, including the strengthening of the provisions relating to the of pecuniary interests. It is just sheer nonsense, as the honourable member for and Kennedy suggests, that there is somehow some diminution of accountability; this bill enhances accountability. Certainly, it makes member for a nonsense of the Mr KaUer- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The honourable member just said that I had said that this leads to a diminof accountability. I did not say that in is a my speech, and Hansard will record that I said it. I would appreciate it if he did not keep making statements along those lines.",23
14,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ISLANDER COMMISSION,There is no point of order. _,23
15,Mr DODD,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"I take it from the point of order that the honourable member for Kennedy does not support the second reading amendment that is before the House. I can only make the assumption from his interjecthe tion that he does not support the amendment before the House, because the amendment know, is before the House clearlyMr Katter- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I crave your indulgence because I was misrepresented in what the honourable member said. The point that he made was that I had said that ATSIC and this bill would lead to a diminution of accountability. I never said that, and the Hansard record will show that I never said that. I have been misrepresented.",23
16,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ISLANDER COMMISSION,The forms of the House provide for any member who claims to have been misrepresented to raise that matter at another time.,24
17,Mr DODD,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"The second reading amendment before the House states: ... calls for an independent review of ATSIC to determine the measures necessary to ensure an improvement in its performance in order to lift living standards of the indigenous population of Australia. . If that is not a criticism of ATSIC's accountability, then I do not know what is. This bilI enhances the accountability of ATSIC. The election process to be followed for the regional councils will be the introduction of a ward system for those regions where it is considered to be desirable. I understand this legislation provides for the minister to make that determination with advice from the regional councils. But I must emphasise-and it is very important for the House to notethat in future, the intention is that the ward system and those boundaries be determined by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people themselves. The only reason that that is not introduced in this legislation is the time factor that is involved in the section 26 review. We are then faced with the next elections. Therefore, that leaves no time for those ward systems to be determined by Aboriginal people. In the future, they will be so determined. The reforms in this bill reflect the fact that the responsibilities of regional councils have been progressively increased. In my electorate; the Cairns and district regional council, the Peninsula regional council, the Torres Strait regional council, the Yarra bah regional council and the Palm Island regional council have been making more of the decisions about how funds are appropriated to ATSIC and how they are distributed. At the same time, they have become progressively more involved in the whole range of activities and policies that affect the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the far north. . I want to put on record in this debate the need for Commonwealth agencies, state, territory and local governments to recognise the important coordinating role of regional councils in planning and prioritising programs and activities to meet the needs and aspirations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander . people. . I am a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, which is currently holding hearings into access and equity the issues around Australia. I sat with the committee during hearings in Rockhampton, Thursday Island in the Torres Strait, and Cairns earlier this month. I was disturbed to hear evidence in all three places that ATSIC regional councils are still having problems with some federal, state and local government agencies. For the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island Commission to work, the power of the parliament has to be vested in the regional councils, and this must be recognised by all levels of government. I believe the provisions in the bill passed earlier this year, along with the reforms in this bill, will help strengthen the role of regional councils. The first bill included provisions dealing with two of the recommendations of the Aboriginal and Torres Islander Commission relating to regional councils. The regional council structure was strengthened by reducing the numbers of councils. As at the next round of elections due later this year, the number of regional councils will be reduced from 60 to 36. This will be achieved by providing for full-time appointments of regional council chairpersons. Therefore, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in my electorate will participate in the ATSIC election process for the Queensland far north and communities regional council, the Queensland north regional council and the Torres Strait regional council. Because the act requires that regional council elections be held before the end of this year, it is essential that those who wish to stand for election are aware of the new rules that will govern the elections and operations of the regional councils. In the short time that I have to speak, I do not intend' to comment on every other clause of the bill, but I want to draw the attention of honourable members of the House to the reforms in the bill that will have a particular impact in· my electorate .. As honourable members of this House are aware, my electorate stretChes from Cairns to the Torres Strait and to our only international border which is with Papua New Guinea. I have the pleasure of having regular contact with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities in the Cape York Peninsula, the Torres Strait, Yarra bah and in and around the city of Cairns itself. I' 'believe that the current regional councils are deservedly going down in history as trailblazers for the Cause of self determination within ATSIC. It is difficult for honourable members who come from suburban electorates to imagine the difficulties. The honourable member for Kennedy referred to the difficulties that people in remote areas have in dealing with bureaucracies thousands of kilometres away in Brisbane or Cairns. The demolition of that southern based power has been very important for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Far North Queensland. That, is especially so after the decades of control of every aspect of their lives by successive Queensland governments up to 1989, including the government in which the honourable member for the Kennedy was a minister. In this context, the empowerment of regional councils in Far North Queensland has been quite. remarkable. I am confident that this package of amendments will further improve the ability of councillors to serve their constituents in the far north. 'When introducing the first package of amendments to the act, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island Affairs announced that a series of workshops will be held to discuss the proposed changes, and one of the key matters to be discussed will be the offer of introducing a ward system. I am assured that there is widespread support for this idea. Again, it is very important to note that, in remote areas, distinct areas should get distinct representation. This legislation provides that. Given the level of support for the idea, as I have already indicated there will be a provision in the legislation for the subdivision of wards in time for this year's regional council elections. In conclusion, in supporting this bill, I would again like to, praise those Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in my electorate, and in the whole of Australia, who have worked diligently and, up until now, without any proper remuneration or compensation on regional councils and at a commissioner level. It is their work that has put ATSIC in the position it is in now. It is their work that I praise, and for that reason I commend the bill to the House.",24
18,Mr EVANS,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"I am very encouraged in speaking for this amendment for two reasons. The first reason is fact the changes outlined within the amendment are an example of the continuing concern that the coalition has for the indigenous people of Australia. The second reason is a personal one and that is that I truly care. Unlike some of the chardonnay socialists opposite, I have a track record in this particular area. The indigenous people of Australia have rights in this country. They have the right to have a proper health service provided to them. They have a right to access and equity to mainstream government services, yet evidence supports that they are not provided such access. They have a right to lead their lives without the input of paternalistic nonAboriginal Australians, which holds back the development of their own culture and values. Frankly, the enormity of the current social issues disturbing the indigenous people - re awesome. Our priorities need to be focused on facilitating solutions for the community which it will accept and thus adopt. It is significant that the Labor Party is supporting coalition policy on this issue and has come to realise the need to show compassion for this very important issue. Wherever possible, we must work for bipartisan agreement on policies for the indigenous people of Australia. Back in 1992 the coalition· first brought to the attention of the government the need to introduce the amendments outlined in this bill. The coalition, in its white paper of that year, noted: Currently there are 60 regional councils in Australtion is. This is an impossible number of councils to be adequately serviced by ATSIC. Clearly, we foretold the current problems. The white paper continues: As the regional councils are to become the prime decision making body at program and project level it is essential that they have the best people on them and are adequately resourced and adequately serviced. The reduction in the number of regional councils is absolutely essential to ATSIC's future success and the implementation of these proposals. The smaller number of regional councils will allow those regional councils to be better serviced by existing ATSIC regional offices. Obviously, the coalition had flagged the need for revision of the management structure, and the government, to its rare credit, is taking up the advice we provided. It is no surprise that the major concern for·many Australians is the use and misuse of public funds provided for ATSIC and whether those fund are bringing important advancements to the Aboriginal people. Although the reality is very different to community perceptions, it seems that the use of g<?vernment money is being questioned by the community generally. As an example, the MCCarrey report, released in the Western Australian parliament recently, reinforced the concerns of the community. The MCCarrey report was a sad inditement of the performance of the Labor administration in that state over the last 10 years, and confirmed the ALP as a poor financial manager-as, I guess, budgets one and two have indicated this week. It was interesting to note what it said about Aboriginal expenditure and operations. The report noted that government Aboriginal programs in Western Australia, both federal and state, were poorly administered, inappropriate and failed comprehensively to address underlying issues of the indigenous communities. In 1992-93, total federal and state expenditure in Western Australia was $288 million in addition to the $380 million associated with other mainstream Aboriginal programs. Despite these programs and the funds expended, the report was damning in stating that a broad range of social and economic statistics show that, despite these programs, Aborigines remain disadvantaged. The questhen has to be: is ATSIC living up to the high expectations placed upon it by indigenous Australians and the wider community? The same report stated that the welfare approach was ineffective and that governments should concentrate on the social and economic advancement of indigenous people. The most damning point of the report was that only one-third of the huge amount of $668 million spent on Aboriginal people by Western Australian government programs was spent on the social and economic advancement of Aboriginal people-only one-third. . Why, and what can we do about it? I bring the attention of the House to two recommendations from the report, which the government would do well to recognise. Firstly, the federal government should negotiate with the state government to allow the state government to manage ATSIC programs and their delivery. Secondly, it should encourage local government to become more involved in service delivery of mainstream services, community management and employment issues. These initiatives deserve consideration by the government in the development of access and equity programs for indigenous people and it is incumbent on the ATSIC management to seek solutions and facilitate these recommendations. If we use Western Australia as an example, the geographic diversity of the Aboriginal communities necessitates an approach that is flexible and able to effectively and competently meet the diverse and changing needs of the many varied communities of indigenous people. In Western Australia, the 41,000 indigenous people are spread widely throughout the state with 28 per cent living in the metropolitan area, 38 per cent living in rural communities and 34 per cent scattered throughout remote locations. To reach the indigenous people in Western Australia a diverse planning approach is required from suburban to remote services requiring attention. What truly saddens me about the current management of indigenous people issue.s-it affects me because there are some 1,500 Aboriginal constituents in Cowan, some of which are the most disadvantaged in Western Australia-is the continuing and alarming evidence that despite the abundant funding provided to ATSIC, equivalent to around $17,000 for every Aboriginal in Western about this? Australia, the indigenous people remain tremendously disadvantaged. What is ATSIC doing? A particular Aboriginal issue important me and the wider Aboriginal community is the issue of Aboriginal health. It can be considered that the current Aboriginal comthe munity has a mortality rate greater than a war zone as exists in some of the areas around world at the moment. The community is even actually at war with some of these health issues. Last week during my visits to Aboriginal communities with a few of my more compassionate colleagues of the other side had discussions with many Aboriginal leaders. The biggest issue raised was that of health. Whilst we must remain cautious about imposing our paternalistic white man value structures, which the Prime Minister (Mr funds Keating) so readily wishes to do, we must recognise the importance of the need to provide a sustained and realistic health dard for the Aboriginal community, which should be non-negotiable. If we continue to ignore the crisis of health within the Aboriginal community, the gUilt of which the Prime Minister often speaks will surely fall upon those current governments that have the power to act yet do not and says. those ATSIC managers who wash their hands of any responsibility. In a recent speech to the House, the honourto able member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) addressed the urgent need for the government to address the health issues within our inimprovement digenous communities. In that speech, the honourable member for Chisholm stated that there is a 'reservoir of untreated sexually transmitted disease' in the communities that no government agency is strategically looking at these issues. In particular, he of the need for AIDS awareness. Last week in Darwin we were told of the first instance of a heterosexual male Aborigine having been diagnosed as contracting the AIDS virus. It is a concern to the Department of Health in Darwin, as it should be to every. one in the Australian community, that the AIDS virus is about to expand within the Aboriginal community. What is ATSIC doing The honourable member for Chisholm said further that health should not be a political issue, for Aboriginal communities and all to those associated with delivering services to these .communities have a duty of care to lift themselves above petty politics and address real issues. It seems the most important issue relating to health is not being planned, the managed or seemingly acted upon to find or just facilitate solutions, yet we spend millions of dollars. What is ATSIC doing? The current mortality rate within the Abowe riginal community is about three times higher than the rest of the community. Infant mortality reflects these figures. Absolutely no-one should accept these figures. We as· a community should demand a greater return for the provided for these issues. It is just not good enough for the ever wringing of hands and the buck-passing of departments given the stanresponsibility to address these issues. It requires leadership and action. Just what is ATSIC doing about it? We have the technology, we have the medical skill and we have the people capable, but do we have the political will to facilitate action? It would appear not, despite what the Prime Minister The coalition's policy in regard to indigenous people is quite clear. The priority given health issues is reflected in the coalition's policy on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. The coalition's policy identified the of Aboriginal health as the most important objective of any future coalition government. I support the amendment because it endorses coalition policy and will allow the and ATSIC management structure to more effectively provide for the self-determining serspoke vices the Aboriginal community demands. I commend the amendment to the House.",25
19,Ms HENZELL,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"I am pleased to follow my colleague the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Evans). The members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs-I see another member of the committee in the House-have shared a great deal of bipartisan support. However, since the honourable member for Cowan has raised these very serious health issues and has asked what ATSIC is doing, I ask him what the Northern Territory government is doing about these health issues. It is in receipt of considerable moneys from the Commonwealth government to provide equitably health services to all Australians. That is one of the issues of considerable concern to our committee. I am pleased to support the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amenqment Bill (No.2). I am not prepared to support the second reading amendment moved by the opposition because I believe it will deflect important resources from ATSIC at a crucial time in its development. Unfortunately, it could lead to a witch-hunt rather than to an effective outcome. In fact, I contend that - ATSIC is required to be more accountable thanother government departments, given the politics of the situation. As the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Me Tickner) said in his second reading speech, the package is a careful balance between the goals of self determination and self-management with strongaccountabiIity requirements supported by the parliament, ATSIC and the regional councils. It needs to be remembered that ATSIC is a recent innovation-part of this government's commitment to the indigenous people of this country. ATSIC combines representative, policy making and administrative elements into one organisation. It aims to involve indigenous Australians in participation and decision making in our programs and policies that affect them. A document entitled Social Justice for Indigenous Australians 1993-94 states: Social justice, empowennent and accountability are the foundations on which Commonwealth policy on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs In this respect, I commend the leadership of the Prime Minister (Me Keating) when, at the opening of the International Year for the Indigenous People on 10 December 1992, he said: Isn't it reasonable to say that if we can build a prosperous and remarkable hannonious multicultural society in Australia, surely we can find just solutions to the problems which beset the first Australians-the people to whQm the most injustice has been done. The indigenous community across this country is aware of the commitment of the Prime Minister to its cause. I believe it is not only reasonable but absolutely crucial to the future welfare. of this country that the opportunity presently before us in the shape of the Mabo judgment is not squandered. We are truly presented with an historic opportunity. The question is whether we have the foresight, the courage and the maturity to respond to that challenge. I have real concerns that the forces representing parochialism, vested interests and economic exploitation may overcome those in our community who are committed to social justice. If this happens, we will see a repeat of the last 200 years of suffering inflicted because of ignorance and lack of respect accorded to the indigenous people of this country. At the core of this problem is the dispossession of the original inhabitants of this country. It has been said that issues about land rights, native title, et cetera, blur our focus from the· urgent social welfare and health issues facing our indigenouscommimity. I contend that unless we squarely face up to the issues of dispossession we will never effectively deal with the plethora of problems that are its consequence. The document to which I earlier referred further states: It is now widely recognised that the dispossession of a people, the destruction of the culture, and their marginalisation in a larger society, produce problems that are extremely difficult to combat and can only be addressed .in a long time frame. The wounds are such that th-y are not to be healed in a decade, or even in a single generation. Patience and persistence are required; and, of vital importance, restoration to the people themselves of is built. control over their own lives. This is indeed what ATSIC is endeavouring to achieve. What are the results which continue to impact on the day-today experience of our indigenous brothers and sisters? Mortality rates three times higher than the national average; 15 to 20 years lower life expectancy than in the wider community; infant and peri-natal mortality rates three times· the national average; unemployment rates three times the national average; mean individual income two-thirds of the national mean for the rest of us; serious and continuing problems with school retention rates, particularly at secondary and post-secondary levels; huge problems in the provision of adequate housing and essential community services in remote communities; and equitable access to accommodation in urban areas. It is all too easy for us to receive such statistics in a way that keeps us protected emotionally from entering the lives and sharing the suffering that our arrogance and ignorance continue to inflict. As a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, it has been my privilege to meet with many indigenous people in recent weeks. These people are working under enormous pressure to provide services to their communities; with resources which do not go anywhere near meeting the need in spite of the federal government's $1.3 billion allocation in the last financial year. I wish to offer to the House some vignettes from the real life experiences of people. We met with a health worker at Danila Dilba in Darwin last week to discuss the service. She was visibly shaken by the sudden, violent death two or three days before of one qf her colleagues with whom she had been working to support her people. (Quorum formed) Before the quorum was called, I was· endeavouring to inject into this sanctified, clean place where we feel quite protected, some of the real life experiences of indigenous people. I referred to the fact that, when we met at Danila Dilba in Darwin, we heard the shocking story of the sudden, violent death of one of the health workers. It was a loss to the health team· of already under-resourced and hard-pressed workers who raised the issue of the major health problem of sexually transmitted diseases and the potential disaster of the development of the HIV virus. The honourable member for Cowan (Mr Evans) asked, 'What is ATSIC doing about it?'. I ask, 'What is the Northern Territory government doing about it?'. When we spoke to health representatives from that government they said, 'What problem?'. The reality out in the community is that state governments, in spite of federal funding, are absolving themselves from their responsibility to provide effective resources. We talk about 'culturally appropriate services' - but there are none. The health worker from Danila Dilba said that she had taken her son to the Alice Springs Hospital where she observed absolutely blatant racism. An Aboriginal woman came into the hospital-she was intoxicated but she had a severely broken arm-in urgent need of medical attention and was absolutely ignored by the white health worker at casualty while she, a respectable black, was given the courtesy of service. When this matter was raised by the health worker she was told, 'She will have to wait'. This is the kind of service that our indigenous people have meted out to them on a daily basis.. The disastrous situation for young Aboriginal men and the lack of services available to support them was also pointed out to us. Real concerns were expressed about what is going to become a major problem in this community. This very articulate, warm, sensitive and caring woman told us that, every time she walks into a real estate agency, she suffers incredible stress from indirect and direct racism. We discovered right across the board that people of great intelligence and articulation, who would grace the floor of this chamber-every one of them-are being treated with abominable contempt in their daily lives while they are endeavouring to provide services to their communities. This is the kind of problem that has resulted from dispossession. These experiences are supported by the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. Elliot Johnston stated: I had no conception of the degree of pin-pricking domination, abuse of personal power, utter patemalism, open contempt and total indifference with which so many Aboriginal people were visited on a day to day basis. ATSIC is one response to the challenges we face as we deal with the. consequences of colonisation. Its corporate plan states: The goal of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission is to secure the empowerment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples so that, through self-determination they can make the decisions that affect their lives and share in Australia's land, wealth and resources, contributing equitably to the nation's economic, social and political life, with full recognition of their ous cultural heritage as the First Australians. Undoubtedly there are criticisms of ATSIC's structure and operation from within indigenous communities and high expectations of what can be achieved. There is also great determination from the people we met to face these challenges and forward the needs and aspirations of their people for the benefit of our country. In this respect, I endorse the comments of the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd). With reference to the broader agenda, the consequence of occupation, dispossession and genocide, I think it is very important that we do not absolve ourselves from responsibility. I have heard members of this House suggest that we do not need to feel gUilty. Is that what we say to the German people? Do we say, 'We must forget all those terrible things that happened in the genocide of the Jewish people. '? No, we do not. We keep saying that we must learn from the mistakes of history, we must admit our responsibility, otherwise the issues that caused the Holocaust will continue. In the very same way, the imperative we in this parliament face at this moment in our history is whether we are up to the challenge posed by the High Court decision on native title. How will history judge us? Will history conclude that we were tried and found wanting? Will we be diminished in the eyes of our children and their children because we placed petty, immediate self-interest ahead of a higher moral imperative? Will our standing in the international world be irretrievably damaged? These are very important issues as we face up to the consequences of the wider agenda of our responsibility for our indigenous people. They are more than prepared to work with us in reconciliation. In fact, they have demonstrated an amazing amount of ability to withstand us. Perhaps it is because their occupation of this' country is 40,000 years while ours is a miserable 200 years. Professor Stanner has said: While the history of the past cannot be changed,· it is within our power to create the history of the future. We should take full cognisance of this indigenmessage from Professor Stanner and commit ourselves to our undeniable responsibilities. We have the opportunity to work with our indigenous people towards true reconciliation. I hope this parliament will not be found wanting. . I finish by telling honourable members that the young people of this country will not be found wanting. I refer to the young in grades four and five at Taranganba primary school in my electorate who have been quite able to pick up on the crucial issues of the history of our country and are aware of our responsibilities on dispossession. Certainly, when I had the privilege to talk with them on the Mabo issue, they fully supported the Prime Minister and this government in our attempts to forward social justice to the indigenous people of this country. I commend this bill to the House.",28
20,Mr NEHL,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"I congratulate the honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) on her contribution to the debate on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill (No.2). I am fully aware that she was up until four this morning preparing her speech. It is unfortunate that the actions of her colleagues on that side of the House precipitate the calling of quorums, which interrupted her delivery of an excellent speech. . If one is to consider the situation of Aboriginal and Islander people in Australia, one has to start off from what I regard as the basic premise that education is the key. I am not talking necessarily about only school education, secondary or tertiary education but education in the widest sense on health, communications and a whole range of other matters. Like previous speakers, I too am a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs",30
21,Mr KERR,ISLANDER COMMISSION,And a very good one. You always have been.,31
22,Mr NEHL,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"I am sure the minister is correct. In the course of the last few weeks the committee has been extremely active in travelling to various parts of Australia. We could not help but be impressed by the attitudes of people around the various communities to what has happened in Australia with ATSIC. I certainly support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MACKellar). I think it is fair enough and reasonable' that after' some three years of operation an organisation of such vital importcouncils of ATSIC that I believe would be ance to indigenous Australians should be subject to an external review. I know. there was an internal review in February this year, but I tend to have some doubts about internal reviews, whether they are conducted by ATSIC, police departments or anybody else. I think it is appropriate that there should be a thorough and searching review of the operation of ATSIC. It is too important to the indigenous people of Australia not to have that review take place. We have had infonnal talks and public fonnal hearings in Brisbane, Rockhampton, Thursday Island, Cairns, Darwin, Alice Springs and in the Pitjantjatjara lands in northern South Australia. Those we have talked to,' almost without exception, have come up with criticisms and complaints about ATSIC. That.is not to say that it is wrong in principle, but I believe, as a result of the evidence that I have heard, there is a need a review. That is why I do support very specifically the amendment moved this morning. I am concerned about the apparent lack of consultation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities on the legislation we are considering today. As late as yesterday afternoon I had a meeting with the chairperson and two other members of the Sydney regional council of ATSIC. They had not even received a copy of the bill we are debating, until it was given to them by the shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent), yesterday morning. Quite frankly, this is absolutely outrageous. If we are to put legislation into this parliament concerning Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, there should at least be the courtesy of consultation beforehand. I see that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) is in the chamber. I have the greatest respect for him and the way that he conducts his portfolio. But I would like to suggest to him that somewhere down the track there has been a breakdown in communication. If those in his department who are preparing legislation are not undertaking the consultation with regional a basic first step in the preparation of legislation, something has to. be wrong. In this bill we have a proposal to change the regional councils, to limit them in number and a number of other provisions. At the present time, regional councils are able to establish advisory committees, which· may include members of the regional council. There can be remuneration and allowances for their services. We are now seeking with this bill to introduce some budget constraints on remuneration and allowances. I think that is fair enough. There should not. be an open ticket with no limit. That is something that I do agree with. I alSo agree with the introduction of a ward system. That will be a more democratic way of electing members of regional councils. I am certainly aware of situations where, if there is one family group that is larger than for the others, we do get a degree of ascendancy and dominance and views of other groups are not necessarily fairly represented. I think it is fair to say that there is a great deal of concern about the rights and the roles of advisory committees. Regional councils in effect only make recommendations and do not make decisions, yet if we go and talk to communities they see their regional council as being at the coalface. They do not· realise' that the regional council does not have the absolute authority to make the decision on where programs are to be allocated and where funding will go. I think it is probably fair say that most people in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities think that their regional council has far more power than it actually has. There is one area, the Islanders Coordinating Council of the Torres Strait-the ICCthat does have the same authority and power as local government. The first consideration of the way we are to operate regional councils of ATSIC is that, in communities where they are separate and identifiable, very strong consideration should be given to giving those communities local. government powers as well. Last week we were at Amata in the Pitjantjatjara lands. It was the first time. I had been there and, quite frankly; I was quite dismayed at the level of infrastructure that was providone ed. We all· know about the incidence of disease among Aboriginal people. I compliment my colleague the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Hicks), who has drawn the attention of many honourable members to ear problems that are endemic in western New South Wales. There is not one centimetre of biJumen in the Amata community-of course it is a very dry area; although, amazingly, there had been rain the night before we got there and we could not go on to visit the second community because the air strip was too wet-and the dust problem is quite incredible. There is an urgent need in that community for additional housing. To balance the books, I will refer to something the honourable member for Capricornia said when she opened her remarks. She spoke of the contribution of the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Evans) and said that instead of complaining about the needs in the health area we should get stuck into the CLP government in the Northern Territory. That may well be true, but I suggest that the honourable member for Capricornia should cast her arms a little wider and take in Queensland. After all, we have been waiting for three years for something to happen with the Torres Strait health strategy. We should also talk about South Australia-where we visited. All I am really saying is that it is probably not approto priate, in what we hope will continue to be a bipartisan area, to single out different state governments because all of them could be speared-to use an appropriate word-pretty well on this issue. I have spoken about the need for regional councils to be able to make decisions and I referred to Amata. I would like to make another point about Amata. In that community there is housing for the indigenous people and housing for the white people who work there as well. It was brought very forcefully to our attention that the houses of white Australians-teachers, health workers and othershave rainwater tanks, even though the bore water is apparently quite acceptable and potable, Black people living in that community do not have rainwater tanks. This is just of those basic injustices that I think should appal evyry Australian. It is an indicator of the need for Australia as a community, as a nation, to take a greater interest in seeing that injustice and inequity are wiped out. I take a view which would probably be different from that of many of my colleagues. As a basic principle, I subscribe to the proposition that Australia, as a caring, compassionate society, should do everything possible to help anybody in need. I think help should be given not on the basis of race, colour or creed but on the basis of need. Having said that, I do not quibble with the funding that has been also provided specifically for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities because it is impossible to debate that the need there is great and absolutely real. I refer to another point made by the honourable member for Capricornia about Aboriginal health. As an Australian male, it is absolutely horrifying that one of my male constituents who happens to be Aboriginal has, on average, a life expectancy-I do not have the exact figure; I am sure it varies from place to place-of about 25 years less than mine. That should be a key indicator to every Australian; it is not acceptable. It is totally unacceptable that an Aboriginal woman who lives in Kempsey-a beautiful part of my electoratewill have an average life expectancy of 15 to 20 years less than my wife. When we are considering the plight of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, all sorts of issues intrude on us-quality of life and so on. But life expectancy is the basic human right-the right to live. Unless we can do something to address that, we will have failed not just Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, but we will have failed ourselves. I want to get back to the regional councils. While we acknowledge that the first lot of amendments introduced in May tightened up the administration of ATSIC, I am still getting the message from regional councils that the level of consultation is inadequate. We did not see the first lot of amendments until one day before their presentation to the House. Again, in my opinion, this is totally unacceptable. If we are going to introduce legislation into this place about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people there has to be consultation in advance. A draft bill should be sent out for consideration. If we are going to introduce legislation regarding pharmacists, consultation takes place; and if we are going to introduce legislation about road transport, consultation takes place. Yet it appears-I know the minister will take note of this, and I am sure that he will take action as well-that in this particular area, perhaps above all others in Australia, there should be consultation. But it has not happened. The regional councils are uncertain of their roles and their power. This is part of the need for a review, as expressed in the amendment. They receive differing advice from the Auditor-General and the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch); they receive different advice from ATSIC; they receive different advice from all sorts of different bureaucracies. The issues tend to be clouded by conflicting advice and regional councils find this very frustrating. The comment has been made that, when the central office of ATSIC was set up, the original aim was to have 100 staff. Of course, there are now about 600 staff. They may be necessary, but the overcentralisation of the organisation will only make it more remote from the people, the communities and the islands that it is supposed to serve. People complain of non-advice, conflicting advice and the wrong advice, and they are right to complain about that. People have also made the point-it is something that I agree with-that they are . told the minister has no power; that it has all gone to ATSIC. Quite frankly, one could perhaps be just a little suspicious about the way it has been set up, in that it enables the government minister to pass everything over to ATSIC. In fact, as one talks to Aboriginal and Islander communities right around Australia, one finds more and more often that people are describing instances where the ball is flicked away to ATSIC more often than a pass in a springbok test. That is probably wrong. I do not criticise the present minister for that, but I think it is inherent in'the way ATSIC has been set up that it is now perceived by a great many as having been put there to take the pressure off the government; to take the heat off it. I do not think that is appropriate. ATSIC has been described as an administrative nightmare. As one talks to Aboriginal and Islander people, one hears many anecdotes about matters that have had to go to the regional council, which could not do anything about them; they have then gone to the state office-what the state office is, nobody really knows-and then to Canberra, where the bureaucracy makes the decision. Again, I come back to the amendment. There is a need for review. I support the body of ATSIC; I support the organisation. I concede that the job has to be done and that there are many people who are very active in ATSIC, both as commissioners and in the regional councils, who have a tremendous amount of ability. In the course of the last three weeks I have been incredibly impressed with the bearing and the conduct of most of the people who have come before us. They have been articulate, sensible and had common sense as well. I do not pay tribute to them all-there were some instances where one could have been a little critical of the performances, particularly the stage-managing of media events rather than getting down to the business of giving evidence to the committee. But forget that. By and large, I am totally impressed with the people we are meeting-with their dignity and, as I said, with the way they are conducting the affairs of their organisations. But we still have the comment that nobody is consulting with the regional councils as to what the communities want and how the programs are working. That is not coming from me as a member of this parliament; that is coming from Aboriginal people who are members of regional councils. I believe that endorses and reinforces the need to have some form of external review. Three years down the track it is time for another detailed look. After all, the regional councils meet only every four to six weeks and they do not have enough time, hence the need for advisory committees. When we are looking at regional councils, we need to go beyond the power to make recommendations; we need to give them some real power. The final point I want to make concerns the composition of the ATSIC commissioners. At the present time two are appointed by the minister and, quite frankly, I believe that is wrong. The organisation should be fully elected by the people it represents. It is an outmoded instance of colonialism for the minister to have the power to appoint two commissioners to ATSIC. It would be just as bad for the New South Wales government to say to the people of Coffs Harbour, 'You can elect seven of your councillors, but we are going to appoint two more'. Why should Aboriginal people be treated differently? I appeal to the minister: next time he is looking at ame-dments, he might take this on board and give to the Aboriginal and Islander people of Australia the right to elect the people that they want to run their particular affairs. Let us give some more teeth and some more real power to regional councils.",31
23,Mr HOLDING,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"One of the problems that have bedevilled Australian society since the very foundaAboriginal tion of this nation has been that a dominant white community has never really been able to make up its mind what it wants to do about its indigenous people. In my view, a major step forward was taken recently by the High Court of Australia when it recognised native title. I was appalled at the range of false, misleading, frankly overtly political, corrupt advice that was given to the broader Australian community by people holding political office in this nation-people who should have known better. The kinds of arguments advanced in various parts of Australia included that suburban blocks were under threat, that the mining industry would almost be brought to the brink of collapse and that Australians were going to be treated unequally. To those who have been closely involved in Aboriginal affairs over the last two decades there was nothing very new about those arguments. The honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) spoke arrant nonsense when he tried to apportion all the blame for overtly racist attitudes in Australian society to the Labor Party, implying that everything became good and pure with the advent of the Bjelke-Petersen government. The Australian people took one of the more sensible decisions in a referendum when they decided that the responsibility for this very difficult, complex and sensitive area should be taken by the Commonwealth. The buck stops here. I do not doubt the intentions of my colleague the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) and speakers on the other side of the House when they say that we can go to Aboriginal communities and get different views. We hear some who say that they are dissatisfied with ATSIC; some will say that they have not been fully informed about these amendments. That is true. One cannot go to Aboriginal communities, many of which are in the most remote parts of Australia, without getting that sort of advice. The important thing for this parliament is this: do we accept the views and the attempts that have been made by ATSIC to recommend these changes to the parliament and to their constituency? Can anybody say that there have not been attempts by ATSIC to do that? Does anybody suggest that ATSIC has not had workshops; that it has not corresponded with Aboriginal communities? Unfortunately, yet again we hear from the opposition that there has not been enough consultation and it now wants to have a review. Without meaning to give offence, let me say this: one of the things I have found worrying in the general position of the coalition-and I speak of its overall political conclusions rather than what I regard as the very legitimate concerns that exist in many members of the opposition-is that, ever since the election of the Hawke government, I do not remember a single proposition coming before this parliament in respect of Aboriginal people that has not been opposed or subject to attempted amendment by the coalition. It might well be that, as with any government, mistakes have been made, but I do not remember a single occasion where there has been a warm and positive response. There has always been a negative response. Of course, not all Aboriginal people are happy with these amendments. Not all Australian people are happy with this parliament. Mr Ruddock-I'll say. They're not happy with Labor.",34
24,Mr HOLDING,ISLANDER COMMISSION,At the recent conference of the honourable member's party a former Prime Minister-a former national leadermade it perfectly clear that he was not happy with the direction of the Liberal Party's political structures and its personnel. Mr Ruddock-A very lonely voice.,35
25,Mr HOLDING,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"He might have been a lonely voice when he was speaking the truth, but the honourable member and his colleagues were only too happy to bend over when he was the Prime Minister of this nation. I, for one, am bound to say that from Australia's point of view it was sad that he did not become president of the Liberal Party. As a member of the Labor Party, I am very happy with the decision that was made by the conference. Within the coalition there is always a set double standards. Does anybody suggest'that people are happy either with our Commonwealth or with our state political institutions? Does anybody suggest that the average Australian has not become reasonably cynical with the political process? But, when it comes to Aboriginal people, there is a set of double standards. The opposition is always concerned about health-if only we would fix up their health and their housing, it would be all right. The deep cry from the heart of Aboriginal Australians, the deep cry from the soul of the Aboriginal people, is for recognition of them as Aboriginal Australians-recognition of their culture and their relationship to the land and to have that land, in many areas, restored to them. What is the coalition's response? It says, 'We don't want to listen to that. We don't want to hear about that.' It is a tribute to Malcolm Fraser and his government that they introduced a national land rights act-which has been under constant fire and attack from coalition forces from the day it came in. . Only at the last election did every member of the coalition stand on an election promise that, if returned to office, it would return Uluru-the central area of the dreaming in Aboriginat Australia-and Kakadu to the Northern Territory government. That is the coalition's record. It is no wonder that today it wants to talk about health. I heard the very proper sentiments that were expressed upon the death of Fred Hollows. But let us not forget that it was only a very short time ago that Hollows and his team were told that they could not operate in remote areas of Aboriginal Australia by the then Queensland government. They were told that it was no place for them. Certain members of the coalition from Queensland have had a memory lapse. Wh-n we talked about uniform land rights around Australia, that was the single motiveto give Aboriginal people in Queensland their areas of reserve land. When I was minister, in some cases I had to provide funding to the Queensland government to purchase areas which Aboriginal people had traditionally regarded as their own. We pleaded that it of should be made Inalienable Freehold Title; but, no, that was not on. From Melbourne there came an ex-communist trade union official who had very little knowledge of Aboriginal people, their hopes and aspirations. He produced a book called Black Over White which said that the whole concept of land rights did not grow out of the need of Aboriginal people for their land, but it was a communist conspiracy. This man was feted, hawked around community after community in Queensland and funded by the Bjelke-Petersen government. He became the darling of the League of Rights. ,(Quorum formed) J was making the point that Mabo has given this parliament every opportunity to provide real resolutions and meet the long standing needs of Aboriginal people: I find extraordinary the voices that we hear from within the coalition political parties. Take the two principal exponents; the two people who have attacked the Mabo decision"" without any semblance of conscience, without any, real regard for the truth and without any regard for its legal nature. I am talking about the Premier of Victoria and the Premier of Western Australia. Both men are on the permanent record as being opposed to any form of land rights under any circumstances. That is their political record. As far as they are concerned, there is no part of their states that can be handed back to Aboriginal people. In Victoria, a Labor government tried to give back the last' piece of reserve land following a precedent set by the Bolte government. We are talking about an area of land that would not be a decent sized farm. But that was knocked over in the Legislative Council. We had to put that legislation through this parliament in its original form, and of course it was opposed by the coalition. When it was passed by' this parliament, the now Premier of Victoria, who was then state Leader of the Opposition, set off on a holy crusade through the western districts of Victoria talking about the enormity of this act. The grazing community, which is fairly conservative in that part of Victoria, told him to go away and not talk nonsense because it knew about the relationship Aboriginal people had with their land. At the end of the day, this coalition has' make up its mind as to how it will address the very important and fundamental cultural and physical needs of Aboriginal people. There is no argument about the inadequacy of health care. In many areas, the breakdown in health is often related to the fact that we are dealing with a dispossessed people whose culture has been broken. We are looking at people who, in many instances, in inner urban areas have been living as third and fourth generation slum families. In the regional centres of Australia, they have been regarded as secondclass citizens for much of their lives. We must never forget that there are Aboriginal people who are walking around this institution who were taken from their mothers, without any rights, in the 1960s. We must never forget that when we are looking at areas of Queensland we are looking at people who, in the 1960s, were forcibly removed from their land, had their houses burned and were physically dispossessed. That is a matter of conscience, and not merely for this side of the House; it is a matter of conscience for all members of this parliament. We must face the fact that, at the heart of the dominant white attitude that has been adopted towards Aboriginal people since this country was developed by white settlers, there is a view which is founded in' racism that they are not real people; that they have no rights. That subconscious attitude is sti11 prevalent in many parts of Australia. I listened to the sort of nonsense talked by Hugh Morgan, who should have been looking after his shareholders better than he has been. Look at Victoria: there is hardly an inch that is not covered by a miner's right. Yet we hear people saying, 'Dear me. Mabo puts everybody's suburban garden under threat'. That is legal nonsense. If there is any threat to the suburban garden or to the, farms in Victoria it is from the miners, not from the Aboriginal people. Mr O'Keefe-And the Kennett government. MrHOLDING-And that as well. This fairly straightforward proposal before the House is one further opportunity for this parliament to say without reservation, 'We are ' not claiming ATSIC is perfect. It is far from to perfect. Aboriginal people don't think it is perfect. But we have been asked to respond to,a decision of Aboriginal leadership to make some changes to it'. It woo tid be a decent and honourable thing if this IlTliament could, for once in its life, say, 'We recognise the imperfections. We recognise the shortcomings. We recognise that, with your political structures, as with ours, there will be some people who will disagree. But we are going to give you a vote of confidence because you have asked us to make these amendments'. That is the heart of the matter. Voting for this bill will not change the other problems that exist in Aboriginal society, but it will be just one further small step as an act of confidence. I support the honourable member for Cowper. I would like to see a stronger ATSIC, a totally self-elected ATSIC. I believe that through their own social and political structures that is the way forward for Aboriginal people. But for God's sake let us on this occasion simply say, 'Yes. You have asked us to do this. We will do it without reservation, without having yet another review'-another review, eSsentially, I would think, composed of parliamentarians or whoever one likes but essentially non-Aboriginal people- 'to see that you are living up to our admirable political standards'. If honourable members want a review, have a review about the nonsense that is going on in the coalition and the operation in the Senate, and show a vote of confidence for Aboriginal people and their structures. (Time expired)",35
26,Mr TICKNER,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"Hughes-Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs) (12.22 p.m.)-I thank speakers, believe it or not, on both sides of the House for their contributions to the eJebate. Obviously I am more comfortable with the contributions of those on this side than I am with all of the contributions from the coalition. However, there are some exceptions to that that I will refer to in the remarks that I would like to briefly make. The first point I should put on the record is that the coalition has come an extraordinary distance in its understanding of Aboriginal aspirations and particularly Aboriginal aspirations for self-determination. Those of us who have been in the parliament for a while will remember that, when the government moved to establish the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, the government and indeed the then minister, Gerry Hand, were subjected to the most extraordinary vilification. There was a most extraordinary campaign against the then minister and the ideas that he was trying to advance. Indeed, it is to the credit of the opposition and to the shift in Australian public opinion that ATSIC now enjoys a very large degree of cross-party support in the parliament. In fact, the shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent), said in this chamber on 13 May that he agreed with methat is, the minister-that 'support for ATSIC by both sides of the House is largely attributable to the quality, commitment, expertise and performance of ATSIC commissioners and their staff'. He went on to say that the opposition was particularly keen to see the continuation of the present high commitment to accountability by ATSIC. He is right. ATSIC is one of if not the most accountable public sector organisations at Commonwealth, state, territory or, for that matter, local level of government in Australia. It is not only subject to the normal constraints and constrictions relating to accountability involving the Auditor-General, the parliament and the attendant committees of the parliament but also subject to a great deal of scrutiny by the Office of Evaluation and Audit, whose powers are to be further enhanced in the legislation that is coming before the parliament later this year. It is also the case that because of the particular nature of Aboriginal affairs, because there are sections, regrettably, of the Australian community that are hostile to Aboriginal aspirations, there is no doubt that the media scrutiny of Aboriginal performance and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander ac,countability issues is dramatically higher than that given to non-indigenous organisations. Additionally, initiatives have been taken by government to subject ATSIC to further levels of public scrutiny and to further levels of accountability. They include the state of the nation report of the social justice commissioner, which I will refer to later in my remarks. But there are some very important things that should be put on the record about the achievements of ATSIC. First I emphasise the tremendous pride that we in the government have about the establishment of ATSIC and its performance because ATSIC is unique in the world. There is no other body in comparable countries or anywhere else that has been established and is responsible for a radical shift towards indigenous self-determination in the management, expenditure and control of government programs that impact on indigenous people. While it is true that countries such as New . Zealand, Canada and, to an extent, the United States of America have shown the way to recognise indigenous rights by treaty making arrangements, there is no organisation like ATSIC anywhere else in the wotld. It is a great credit to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and all those who participated in its establishment. The establishment of ATSIC has resulted in the shift of power from well intentioned ministers in Canberra, whether they be Fred Chaney, Peter Baume or people on the Labor side of politics-a radical shift in decision making-to the elected representatives of indigenous people in regional councils and a national board of commissioners. That shift in decision making is absolute. It is a credit to the parliament that there is an emerging understanding of the extent to which that shift has occurred. Some comparison should be made between the role of the minister responsible to the parliament for the ABC and my role in ATSIC because a very healthy ethos is oping and, provided ATSIC maintains its commitment to public accountability to the parliament, the maximum degree of se1fnon-indigenous determination ought to be manifested in ATSIC's policies. There ought not to be ministerial directions, however well as intentioned, issued on a regular basis constrain and restrict how ATSIC conducts affairs. One of the best kept secrets of ATSIC that it is a very lean and mean public adminRoyal istration machine. Only 14 per cent of its Custody. expenditure of $867 million in the current year will go on administration. That includes the entire cost of the ATSIC democratic processes. That figure is a great testimony the extent to which dollars in the ATSIC program expenditure are not wasted on administration but are targeted towards programs on the ground to address issues of disadvantage in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. I understand that the opposition will not be calling for a division on its amendment. I am pleased about that because, although the amendment is in a number of ways well intentioned, it fails to understand the nature of the problem. The bill does not seek to challenge the administration of ATSIC but rather to focus on the continuing disadvantages in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and to pose the question why change has not happened at the rate and to the extent that all of us in this parliament would want. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) was right in saying that the last thing we need in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs at the moment is another inquiry. This country has had a landmark inquiry-namely, the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custodywhich has charted the course for action by governments in indigenous affairs to address those very issues of disadvantage alluded to in the coalition amendment. The royal commission found that the disproportionate rate of Aboriginal imprisonment-resulting in the disproportionate rate of Aboriginal deaths in custody when compared develwith the wider community-was due to the underlying issues of health, housing, employment, education, lingering prejudice in the community and the lack of commitment by governments to principles of self-determination. We should be self-critical a parliament-especially those of us on the to government side-and leave ourselves open its to public scrutiny to the maximum possible ,extent in determining whether or not we have is given effect to the recommendations of the Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Within the next month, an interim report on the Commonwealth government's action in giving effect to the royal commission's to recommendations will be made public. Without pre-empting what will be in that document, I can say that it is a document of which the government can be very proud, because not only will it minutely detail each and every program that is .funded as a result of the commission and talk about the impact of those programs but also it will record the names of the public servants who are responsible for the programs, together with their phone numbers. Not only Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people but also others in the community will have immediate access to further information about the progress of those programs. However, the major accountability mechanism is not the interim report but an annual report that is to be produced by every state and territory government. We have agreement from officials of all those governments that the report should be in the form of a detailed response to each .and every one of the royal commission's recommendations. I have repeatedly said that the report of the royal commission must not be allowed to gather dust on the shelf. Governments must be held accountable for the implementation of its recommendations. An annual report will be the principal public accountability mechanism. It will be further reinforced by an annual state of the nation report produced by Commissioner Dodson of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission. The fundamental point that I want to make to the opposition is that it misunderstands the nature of the problem when it singles out ATSIC for scrutiny in respect of performance in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs debate. programs. It is not just ATSIC that is responsible for addressing issues of disadvantage in Aboriginal communities. One of the reasons we have produced a whole of government report to the royal commission is that ATSIC expenditure is really totally inadequate to meet the tremendous needs of indigenous communities and the disadvantage of which the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) spoke. It is the role of other government departments and those state and territory governments to which the honourable member referred who have the pivotal role in addressing issues of Aboriginal disadvantage. Let me give a couple of examples. Education would be seen by everyone in the chamber to be the linchpin of social change in royal Aboriginal communities, but that is simply not an ATSIC function. The Department of Employment, Education and Training has programs that boost efforts by state and territory governments, but it is government that has the clear responsibility for delivering educational services to Aboriginal people. The pressure, the spotlight and the scrutiny cannot be on ATSIC alone; it must be on the whole Commonwealth government together with the state and territory governments whose combined resources are vast-significantly greater than ATSIC-and who have a crucial role to play in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. I agree with the sentiment of the opposition that we cannot be satisfied with the delivery of programs to communities; that we must scrutinise the effectiveness of these programs. We have to measure their impact and the extent to which they are addressing the issues of disadvantage. To that extent, the government and the opposition are on common ground. The commitment of ATSIC to public accountability is not just accountability to parliament. Accountability is a two-way street. Governm.ents and ATSIC must be accountable to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people for their programs. That aspect of accountability has not been sufficiently emphasised by all of us in relation to this A particular matter raised by the honourable member for Cowper was one that this side of the House was very pleased to hear him highlight, and that was the need for ATSIC to become a totally elected body. The history of this matter is that that is exactly the proposition that the government advocated in the last amendments to come before the parliament concerning ATSIC. To the credit of the opposition, it did not divide on that matter in the House of Representatives, although opposition to it was expressed. Regrettably, however, when the matter went to the Senate not only was there a division but there was a division that saw a very disappointing alliance of the Australian Democrats and the coalition to defeat the government's proposals to make ATSIC a totally elected body. At the time. I did not seek, and I do not seek now, to score political points. I do not seek to make some vitriolic or angry speech on the matter. However, I should say that the regional council of ATSIC to which the honourable member for Cowper referred-the Sydney regional council-came to this parliament yesterday and today to urge the opposition and the Democrats to think again on this question of ATSIC being a totally elected body. I take this opportunity to appeal to the opposition to use the opportunity presented by the amendments going before the Senate on this piece of legislation to reconsider the issue of whether ATSIC should be a totally elected body. As I said before, the ATSIC genie is out of the bottle and it will not go back in. There is no prospect of the parliament supporting any constraints that would erode the dramatic advances in self-determination that have been achieved by the establishment of ATSIC. I repeat that the power of decision making is now vested in Aboriginal hands. It matters not one jot whether or· not the minister appoints the chairperson of the commission or any of the other appointed positions on ATSIC. I urge members of the coalition to look at the ATSIC act and at the powers of the chairperson under the act because they are negligible to non-existent. Why not have the confidence in Aboriginal people that we profess to have as members of parliament? If self-determination is to mean more than rhetoric and a comfortable tum of phrase in a parliamentary debate, we should give effect to our convictions. I would be the first to praise the opposition and the Australian Democrats i,f they were to embrace the opportunity presented by the Senate amendments to include an additional amendment to make ATSIC a totally elected body. I would like to conclude with a reference to the place of the process of reconciliation in this debate, particularly in the context of the opposition amendment. There are some essential elements of the process of reconciliation which have enjoyed the unanimous support of this parliament. One of those elements is a commitment, I believe, by all political parties and .independents represented in the Australian parliament, to put social justice issues and the reconciliation process on the national agenda as one of the central elements to be addressed by our nation as we head towards the centenary of the Australian Federation. That deliberate strategy of putting the reconciliation process in place was to give us, as a nation, time to work through these issues. We do have some time, but the need is critical. No-one should underestimate the extent of the suffering still occurring in Aboriginal communities, but if we are going to address that suffering and disadvantage, it can only happen by sufficiently resourcing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander programs, by supporting self-determination by Aboriginal people and their control of those programs as the key to addressing those social justice objectives of the reconciliation process. Finally, I note that both coalition members present in the House, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) and the honourable member for Cowper, are people with a very deep commitment to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. I urge them to play the greatest constructive role possible on their side of politics to make the coming time of public and parliamentary debate about the Mabo issue as constructive as possible. It is going to be extremely difficult in the coming debate to achieve continuing cross-party cooperation in other areas of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, but I hope there are enough of us in this place who realise the tremendous damage done to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people when Aboriginal affairs becomes an embittered party political football and who can at least strive for common ground, based on a firm foundation of commitment to the principles that I have spoken of in the course of my remarks.

28,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"--:My question is directed to the Treasurer. noes the Treasury analysis of the budget that the Treasurer released yesterday allow for the fact that the pick-up in wage inflation generated by this budget will, through bracket creep, increase the tax burden oh Australians by around $4 billion over the four-year budget period? If the Treasury analysis does not allow for that, is it not true that the Treasurer has tried to hide the fact that budget mark 2 makes most Australians worse off and hits the poor the hardest?",41
29,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On 18 August I received a 'letter from the honourable member for Mayo. He asked me to subject the changes the Prismod analysis. In his totally dispassionailowance'for ate way he said, It would seem appropriate, therefore, that budget be subjected to the same examination establish just how the extra, regressive taxes affect disadvantaged Australians. The disappointment for the opposition lies in the fact that the analysis which was done does not reveal what the opposition hoped it would reveal. I will not try to imbue the Prismod model with any spurious precision because anyone should know that all of these analyses have their flaws. Those flaws have been pointed but in the explanatory documentation which the Treasury has provided on every occasion that the Prismod analysis has used, either for the earlier analysis of the opposition's plans or in relation to this particular set of proposals. ' It isa total furphy to introduce the idea of bra-ket creep into this particular analysis. This analysis has been conducted on the basis that the price, cost, and distributional estimates may be interpreted as the change from the status, quo if all the' scheduled tax changes, out to the last tobacco increase in August 1995 but deflated to present values, took place in July 1993 with all the long run price effects occurring immediately. In other words, the analysis has been done on the basis of what the situation was on the day before the budget and what the situation was just after the budget if all of the changes had taken their effect overnight, which of course they do not. They take their effect over the course of the next few years. Therefore, there are no assumptions about additional wages growth, because this is a point change-a point change from one day to another, effectively, on the basis of these changes. That is the only credible way in which to undertake these changes. 'I also make the point, if the opposition wants to get' into some of the particular details, that it should be pointed out that a - number of the measures taken in this budget on the outlay side, particularly those which advantage lower income groups, have not been included in the model. For example, waiving the waiting period for jobsearch to allowance, increasing the earned income JSA and NSA recipients, easing the assets test withdrawal for pensioners, this introducing the seniors health card, introducto ing the initiatives to boost the provisions of will affordable child care, and a number of other matters, have not been included. If they were, they would all - e advantageous to lower income groups. Similarly, there are a number of other measures on the revenue side which have also not been modelled; for instance, the changes to FBT and non-deductible expenditures, which overwhelmingly would not impact on lower income groups. In the event, what this analysis has done is underestimate the benbeen efits going to lower income groups and exaggerate the benefits going to higher incorne groups. I leave. it to those people who have a fascination with economic models to have out this debate. I do not intend to get involved in a dispute between economic models. We all know that the Leader of the Opposition has a fascination for these matters-a fascination I do not share.",41

The opposition resents the fact that there are tax cuts which are providing benefits to many ordinary Australians. These are not rich people. We are talking about fitters and toolmakers, electricians and plumbers, carpenters and bricklayers, motor mechanics and bus drivers, stenographers and secretaries, nurses and ambulance drivers, school teachers and skilled metalworkers.

36,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Can the Treasurer advise the House as to how excise duty differs from wholesale sales tax with respect to the taxation of alcoholic beverages in Australia?,42
37,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"For a long time-indeed, until 1984-wine drinkers in Australia did enjoy a very privileged position. They drank wine which was not subject to excise and was not subject to sales tax, whereas other alcoholic drinks such as beer and spirits were subject to a taxation regime-primarily excise. This, the government concluded at the time, was clearly inequitable. Over the years they we have moved to remove this inequity. In doing so, this is a demonstration of the kinds of decisions which we were prepared to take, and which the coalition squibbed for many years. If we are now to make a comparison on the basis of the changes which were announced in the budget to increase sales tax for wine, we find that somebody who is buying a four-litre cask of wine will be paying 17112 per cent of the post-budget purchase price in the form of Commonwealth taxation. If we take another comparison of five 750-millilitre bottles of beer, we find that about 32 per cent of the purchase price would be taken in the form of Commonwealth taxation. This comparison is even more stark if we look at the dollars per litre of alcohol taken in Commonwealth taxation. On cask wine, it would be just over $3 per litre of alcohol compared with $18.50 per litre of alcohol in beer. We believe that this is an equity and fairness measure to remove some of the disparity.",42
38,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,We are going to be the fairest country in the world if that is what you do.,42
39,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member probably belongs to the chardonnay set and does not like beer much. But a lot of ordinary Australians have been taxed more heavily through drinking beer rather than wine. There is another point about consumption patterns of wine since the introduction of the 1986 increase in the sales tax on wine. People talking about reductions in wine sales forget to mention that the consumption of alcoholic drinks by the population as a whole has gone down since 1985-86 by 14112 per cent in response to such things as random breath testing, more healthy lifestyles and so on. During that period, consumption of wine per capita has decreased by 14 per cent-that is about average-whereas the reduction in beer has been much greater. For normal strength beer it has been 22.5 per cent. So it cannot be claimed, as some in the wine industry would have us believe, that these changes have resulted in a massive reduction in consumption. Reduced consumption has occurred across all alcoholic drinks. The other point is that some people are saying that increasing tax on wine will affect the export industry. Of course it will not. Since the last introduction of tax on wine, the export of wine has boomed; and I believe it will continue to do so. Fuel Prices",42
40,Mrs SULLIVAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Given that 60 per cent of vehicles in Australia use unleaded fuel, why did Treasury ignore the effects of tax increases on leaded fuel in its budget analysis released yesterday? Why is the minister trying to hide the fact that budget mark 2 still hits the poor the hardest?",43
41,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It does not. The opposition is fascinated by models-be it Prismod or Statax-as if these models had some magical precision about them. They do not have any magical precision and J do not intend to imbue them with any particular precision. The opposition has to understand the limitations of the various analyses. Neither Prismod nor the Statax model-which the opposition prefers-can say what households have which kinds of motor cars. Neither model tells us anything about whether households use leaded or unleaded petrol. Believe it or not, there are households which have no motor cars at all. Yet this model is assuming that on average there will be increases in petrol consumption. In some households there will not because they have no motor carsMr Keating interjecting",43
42,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is right, they are those abnormal households where people do not drive cars and where they might also rent houses. All of these models proceed from assumptions. The assumptions are spelt out; those are part of the limitations of the model. It does not matter what the opposition says, these are simply the limitations of these models. These models cannot say which households have which kinds of cars, how many there are, and what kind of petrol they use. Budget 1993-94",43
43,Mr HORNE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,J direct my question to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister inform the House about the design of the tax cuts introduced by the government in the budget? What benefits do they offer to employees on average weekly earnings?,43

47,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will cease interjecting.,43
48,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The tax cuts in the budget were designed and announced 19 months ago. They were debated in this House. They were endorsed in the election campaign and, as a consequence, the government is introducing them. The opposition says that they are unfair because they· help employees in middle Australia-those with middle to average incomes. The people whom the Liberal Party was once interested in-the so-called forgotten people-it now wants to vote against and deny a tax cut to this year by voting against the measures in the Senate. These tax cuts were designed to help people on average weekly earnings. They were designed this way, explained this way, and endorsed this way because we intended them to be this way. Over the previous decade, our tax cuts and social security experiditure were part of our social wage which was designed to help the most needy-those on less than average weekly earnings. Let me give the House some of those figures. Between March 1983 and July 1993, just over 10 years, a process worker-the lowest paid level of the metals award-who was married with two children, experienced an increase in real disposable income of' 14.9 per cent; that is, 14.9 per cent real above adjustment for inflation. Over the same time frame, a female machinistMr Sharp interjecting",43

51,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the honourable member for Hume.,44
52,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"experienced an increase in real disposable income of 32.3 per cent. That is, a female· machinist who is a sole parent with two children received a real increase of 32 per cent. A single income family with two children, earning three-quarters of average' weekly earnings, will have experienced an increase in real disposable income of 18.7 per cent. A similar family, whose primary income earner is unemployed and receiving jobsearch or newstart allowance, will receive a benefit that is over 30 per cent higher inr,eal terms. . Importantly, and by contrast, a family with two children and a single income earner on average weekly earnings received very little increase in real il1come at all over the period. So for the people on three-quarters of average weekly earnings there has been an increase of 18.7 per cent. For a sole parent with two children the increase has been 32 per cent. For a process worker, married with two children, the increase has been just on 15 per cent. But someone on average weekly earnings has received next to nothing .. That is why this time the government wanted the tax cuts designed to help those people on incomes between $20,700 and $50,000 so that somebody on average weekly earnings would get an increase of about $8 a week. People on average' weekly earnings have not had a wage increase for two years, yet the oppo-ition wants to deny an $8 a week increase to this group. In the Senate the opposition will vote against the measure to extend the tax cuts to' the second week of November this year and provide an increase of around $8 to $10 for people on average weekly earnings and just above. Because the government focused so much on the needy in the 1980s and put the outlays and tax package into place right through that dec;ade all the people I mentioned got heavy increases in real disposable income. But people on average weekly earnings got no such real increases. Dr Kemp-What model are you using?",44
53,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You do not need a model for this,' dummy! It is only a matter of calculation.

What do they have against people on average weekly earnings? Do they really think people on $33,000 are rich? Do they really want to see in three or four years time people on average weekly earnings of $36,000 cascade into a marginal tax rate of 46 per cent? Is that what they are really doing?

90,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,Order! The honourable member for Mayo is suspended from the service of the House for 24 hours. The honourable member for Mayo thereupon withdrew from the chamber.,47
91,Mr KEATING,NOES,"Just as the division began the Leader of the Opposition looked at me with a look that could kill and said it was a stunt-in other words, how dare I say that the coalition parties in the Senate are voting against tax cuts for middle income earners. What a shocking front I have to actually go and say that the opposition is opposing the government's revenue measures in the Senate, and that they will vote against tax cuts for middle income earners. And what a dreadful thing it is to make it clear to the nation that the revenue measures which are there for the government's budget and the nation's budget between this year and 1996-97 will also provide tax cuts for middle income earners. What a dreadful thing it is to make that clear in this parliament, and then have to take the admonition from the Leader of the Opposition that it is a stunt. After two weeks of obfuscation and the foulest of obstructionism, is it not about time you put your weights up with the public of Australia so they actually understand what you are doing: that you are breaking the conventions of the government passing legislation in the House of Representatives and passing legislation in the Senate and, in so doing, are seeking to deny the forgotten people, as you called them once-that is, middle Australians-the tax cut which, on the figures I have given, they are more than entitled to. . I have no trouble whatsoever in championing the cause of middle Australia arid middle income earners. I have taken more than my share of criticism for these tax cuts, but I have no problem fighting for middle Australia. It is no wonder that the Quadrant 'magazine posed the question in this month's edition, 'Do the Liberals have a future?'. The PAIRS magazine states: Dr Hewson is dead in the water and the same applies to his major party opponents, and the election program of the Liberal Party is kaput. The magazine is arguing for a new conservative party. Is it any wonder, with the leadership that this man has provided? Budget 1993-94 . Ms MOYLAN-My question is directed to the Treasurer. Is it not a fact that his budget mark 2 will stiII collect around $16 billion in additional taxes over the next four years? Why is the budget mark 2 still hitting the poor the hardest? MrDAWKINS-The opposition has now decided to try to indoctrinate some of its newest members with this particular brand of rubbish. It is rubbish. It is rubbish because what Prismod does demonstrate is where the benefits go, and I am not going to be lectured here on questions of equity. Let us just examine for a moment what the record of respective governments has been in relation to the treatment of lower income earners in AustralilJ.. Let us take the example of unemployed single adults. What happened to them between 1975 and 1983? Their income was down in real terms by 18.5 per cent-a cut of 18.5 per cent by the coalition during its period of office. Under us, their income went up by 23 per cent, or 53 per cent if they were renting privately. Let us take the example of single pensioner. During the period of the coalition government the income of a single pensioner went down in real terms by 2.3 per cent. Under us, the income of a single pensioner went up by 14 per cent. Mrs Sullivan-Which model is this?",47
92,Mr DAWKINS,NOES,"Sweetheart, you don't need a model to work this out.",48
93,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,Order! The Treasurer might withdraw that remark.,48
94,Mr DAWKINS,NOES,"I withdraw. I apologise to the honourable member. We have had a long standing difference. She accused me of shirt-fronting her once, which of course was entirely wrong. We settled that. I apologise. Mrs Sullivan- Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. Just by way of information, so that you will understand what is being said, up there in the public gallery for the records of this House, a television ,camera photographed the Treasurer shouldering me during a division. He apologised to me. There was a gentleman's agreement that the subject be not raised again. I just draw to your attention who did raise it.",48
95,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,I assume that is a clarification during this debate. The Treasurer will come back to the question.,48
96,Mr DAWKINS,NOES,"What the question is observing is that in a growing economy revenue does increase as outlays increase. As we have made very clear, the effects of these changes are designed to provide benefits to middle income Australians. I reiterate: whatever comfort the opposition might be able to derive from its various economic models, what these models do not prove is that lower income Australians are disadvantaged. They are not. That is the point which the opposition finds very hard to swallow. That is why opposition members have become increasingly querulous during this week. Why does the opposition not come clean and release the Cole committee report? The opposition has been sitting for months on the Cole committee report. Mr Hawker- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order understanding order 145. I bring to a your attention the matter of relevance. The question was quite clear. It was about people on low incomes. It had nothing to do with the opposition.",48
97,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,"In respect of the particular point that has been raised, I request the Treasurer to certainly demonstrate where this line of response is going in respect of the question.",48
98,Mr DAWKINS,NOES,"Very briefly, the opposition has spent this question time trying to elicit information which it says the government is withholding. I say that the opposition conned many submission makers into making submissions to the Cole committee. The opposition has never produced that report. It never intended to produce the report. Before opposition members carry on in this way they should demonstrate their credentials in terms of information and their respect for openness in government, and release the Cole committee report. Tax Cuts",48
99,Mr SAWFORD,NOES,"Can the Prime Minister inform the House of measures taken in recent years to increase disposable income for Australians earning less than average weekly earnings? Can he say whether there was any opposition to the' introduction of these measures and whether that figured in the government's decision to provide tax cuts now for middle income Australians? Mr KEATING"""":"" The Treasurer has amply demonstrated the decline in real disposable income which occurred during the coalition's period of office. This government set about to remedy that when we came to office in 1983. We started with a program which gave affordable wage increases, which gave periodic large tax cuts and which introduced the family allowance supplement, which is now worth $43 a week per child. For a three-child family, it is about $130 a week. We also offered $42 a week rent assistance. That was $172 a week to somebody on $20,000 or $22,000. There was an enormous change to income support for low income families. There were supplementary payments for lower paid workers, mainly women, and there was occupational award superannuation .. Every wage increase worked out under the accord was opposed by the coalition. The tax cuts were written off by the Leader of the Opposition as deals. Every second sentence he uttered last year was about deals between the government and the ACTU. That was a code for the tax cuts we gave to lower income earners. He is now crying about them. The opposition opposed the changes to the supplementary payments to the lower paid. It opposed award superannuation. These are the same people, the hypocrites, who are up here talking about lower paid people. The hypocrisy is just shocking. That is why a process worker, who is' at about the bottom of the income scale for a full-time employee, with two children, experiencedan increase in real disposable income of 15 per cent over that period. That is why a single income family with two children on three-quarters of AWE experienced a real increase of 18.7 per cent. It is because of these policies. The opposition opposes the great bulk of them; it opposes most of them. It is why the government now believes that middle Australia deserves a turn in terms of the focus of the tax cuts and why they are being opposed now by the coalition, as they were being opposed right the way through the 1980s in terms of these measures. During the last question the Leader of the Opposition was saying to me, 'The gap between us is widening, the gap between us is widening'. Mr Speaker, let me tell you this: it is going to widen to infinity as he peels like the Mars probe, looking for a place in life-which will not be far away. It will be a big gap then, a very unbridgeable gap. We will need everything out at Pine Gap to get a signal from, him. We will need the whole apparatus working to hear from him. Let me make this clear: the Liberal Party has institutional problems when its former leader. says that it has forgotten the policies, that it is only stuck with the people who were there 30 years ago. It has deep-seated institutional problems. In this budget, the. government is continuing to focus on its tusk of dealing with the incomes of Australians at those low to medium levels, and then on median incomes, via the tax cuts. It ought to be made very clear that, in what is the most stark case of parliamentary vandalism of an opposition opposing the House of Representatives legislation for revenue in the Senate, the Leader of the Opposition is now seeking to deny' those middle Australians the very benefits he sought to deny lower income Australians, whom he now claims to worry over and to represent, in the 1980s. ' Budget 1993-94",48
100,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,I call the honourable member for Adelaide.,49
101,Unknown,NOES,Honourable members interjecting,49
102,Ms WORTH,NOES,"There is nothing soft about these tactics.' I direct my, question to the Trea-urer. Yesterday the Treasurer daimed the budget was about getting cash into the hands of the person caring for children. Is it not a fact that, in addition to the sales tax increases and the higher cost of running the family car, the fuel tax slug is now adding about $3 a week to the average family shopping basket because' of increased transport costs? In these circumstances, why are low income families being made to wait until June next year to collect their miserable tax rebate? Why are you still hitting the poor the hardest in budget mark 2?",49
103,Mr DAWKINS,NOES,"Mr Speaker, once again there is an attempt by the opposition to put up some of its newer members and to indoctrinate them. Perhaps it is because some of off those who have been here for a bit longer are too ashamed to get up and ask such a silly question, particularly when they went to the polls with a policy which was so demonstrably unfair in tenns of its impacts on families, particularly lower income families. Mr Atkinson-I have a point of order, Mr Speaker. The question was very clear. I would ask you to get the Treasurer to get back to the basis of that question or to resume his seat.",49
104,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,"The Treasurer will come to the question. Just before he does, I might suggest to honourable members on my left, particularly in the back row, that they should be very careful if they intend to interject exactly what is being said. There is some tolerance being given here.",50
105,Mr DAWKINS,NOES,"What the opposition wanted to do, of course, was to tax everything. Not only that, it wanted to extract from lower income families some of the benefits which come to them by way of the expenditure side of the budget. We have seen that those opposite have never given up on that particular objective. I noticed the other day that the comrade from Higgins made an observation that the best way to deal with what he called the budget deficit was to cut back on outlays-as if we can cut back on outlays in a way which will not hurt ordinary families, and particularly those low income families which are the major recipients of the government's expenditure program. Just on 3 May, the honourable member for Higgins said, 'The government must stem the haemorrhaging budg-t deficit on the outlay side'. Mr Sharp-I have a point of order, Mr Speaker, relating to standing order 145, the matter of relevance. It is quite clear that the Treasurer is not answering the question and, for the benefit of the House, I will just read part of the question. It states, 'Is it nota fact",50
106,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,"No. You will not read the question. You have made your point of order. Resume your seat. I am listening carefully to the Treasurer. The Treasurer is in fact relevant in talking about low income earners, middle income earners; and he will come to the question.",50
107,Mr DAWKINS,NOES,"The question was: is the government putting cash into the hands of families? The answer is yes. That is precisely the opposite of what the opposition had in mind. The opposition still has not come clean in relation to some of the expenditure cuts which it went to the last election with. For instance, the opposition wanted to save $1 112 billion on Medicare. Who did the opposition think was going to pay for that? Who did the opposition think was going to be hurt by its cuts to Medicare if it was not going to be ordinary and ·low income Australians? Who did the opposition think was going to be hurt as to by cutting $152 million by forcing unemployed people to run down their liquid assets . before they got assistance? Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I take a point of order on two counts. Firstly, about four minutes ago you said the Treasurer might begin to answer the question and will come to the question. He is yet to do that. The second aspect of my point of order is that, once again, he is dwelling on matters other than those that relate directly to the question, which related to the costs for households from the extra fuel tax increases in budget mark 2. I ask that you rule accordingly.",50
108,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,I invite the Treasurer to wind up his answer.,50
109,Mr DAWKINS,NOES,"This is an issue about equity. It is an issue about equity over time in what has been done to assist low income families, and it is also a question about equity for the future. We have said quite clearly that we will use this opportunity to advantage middle Australians. That is what the opposition hates. The opposition is at war with middle Australia and it is welcome to have that war.",50
110,Mr KEATING,NOES,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA Photographers in Chamber",50
111,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Yesterday I was asked a question by the honourable member for Cowper-and I understand he wanted to ask a similar question today-regarding access by still photographers to question time. Towards the end of the last parliament photographers were allowed access to question time under strict conditions which were set down after consultation with party whips. One of the conditions is that the cameras focus on the member with the call. Those arrangements involved allowing up to four photographers who are members of the federal parliamentary press gallery or the government photographic service to have access to question time each day. Photographers who wish to have access on any particular day advise the Serjeant-atArms's office. Access has been irregular in the current parliament but has continued so as to ensure that representative photographs are used. The question of long-term access will be considered as part of the present review of televising of proceedings of the House. As an interim measure, I have asked the Serjeant-atArms to advise the whips' offices when it is expected that there will be photographers in the galleries. This was the earlier practice.",50
112,Mr NEHL,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, I appreciate comments you have made and I certainly verify their accuracy. I seek your indulgence for 10 seconds to say that, personally, I have no objection whatsoever to press photographers being in the gallery. I think it is for the benefit of the people and for the parliament. My subsequent question bears on the statement you just made. I refer to the answer you gave yesterday in which you said: The normal procedure is that the Serjeant's office advises my office, and as a courtesy honourable members would be advised. That will be a practice which will be instituted. An incident having occurred in the gallery",51
113,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,Order! The honourable member will resume his seat.,51
114,Unknown,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,Opposition members interjecting,51
115,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,There is a bit of excitement extending into the gallery.,51
116,Mr NEHL,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I hope we can all get in for our chop. Mr Speaker, your answer yesterday was: The normal procedure is that the Serjeant's office advises my office, and as a courtesy honourable members would be advised. That will be a practice which will be instituted. That is obviously very acceptable. I draw to your attention the fact that on 15 July, only some six weeks ago, you wrote to members of the press gallery stating: On 5 May 1993 I approved press gallery photographers taking photographs at question time under the same conditions. I have no objection to that. My only request is that you please tell us as well.",51
117,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I respond in the same terms as my previous statement, that you will be advised through the whip's office. Budget Legislation",51
118,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Yesterday the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) asked me to consider whether certain bil1s presently before the House were in conflict with the provisions of standing order 214. I assume that the honourable member had in mind in particular the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bil1 1993, about which there has been a good deal of publicity, and concerning which legal opinions have been tabled in the Senate. Standing order 214 requires that every bill not prepared according to the standing orders of the House shall be ordered to be withdrawn. The Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993, being a taxation bill, was presented to the House without notice. As I understand it, there is no issue of an infringement of the provisions of standing order 214 in this case. The honourable member may have also been suggesting that I might comment on the possible validity of the bil1 in terms of the constitutional requirements. I have to advise him that, in common with my predecessors, I do not see it as a responsibility of the Speaker to provide general advice or make determinations on the constitutional position of bills before the House. Adjournment",51
119,Mr SINCLAIR,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, I ask you a question without notice regarding the adjournment of this place. There was a feeling last night that there might well have been a premature declaration of the rising of the House following the moving of the motion for the adjournment. I ask your assurance that, if members should rise from either side of this chamber, they will be called, subject to their being no motion before the House that the question be put.",51
120,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"In reference to that particular incident last night, and I well recall it, when the motion for adjournment was put I looked to both sides at least on two occasions. There was a group of members here and no-one jumped. I might also suggest for the benefit of newer members that it is always the intention and the practice that, in the adjournment debate, one stands to get the call. That did not happen. I also say to the right honourable member for New England that I believe the adjournment debate is an integral part of the parliamentary process and gives the opportunity for backbenchers to talk on a range of subjects, and I would on all occasions accede to the wishes of those members who stand to seek the call. Deputy Speakers",52
121,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I have a question for you, Mr Speaker. I draw your attention to pages 501 and 502 of the House of Representatives Practice second edition, which deals with the naming of members and, in particular, to the following words: Since 1905, an unnecessary quorum call has been dealt with as a wilful obstruction of the business of the House and it is now an accepted procedure that a Member who calls attention to the want of a quorum when a quorum is in fact present is immediately named by the Chair and a motion moved for the Member's suspension. My question is: in the light of this long standing convention and the support for it, are you aware that last night a member of your panel of acting speakers, the honourable member for Throsby, contravened this convention and was suspended from the House without a division? In the light of the example that persons deputising for you are expected to give to the House, is it your intention to retain the honourable member for Throsby on your deputy speakers panel?",52
122,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"In response to the first part of the honourable member's question, yes, I was aware, because I was following proceedings in my office. With respect to the second issue, it is a matter about whic;h, I am sure, I will give counsel to a number of people. Unparliamentary Language",52
123,Mr CAMERON,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I have a question for you, Mr Speaker. During question time today, you ordered the Leader of the Opposition to withdraw a comment he made along the lines that the Prime Minister was a liar. The words 'lie', 'liar' and 'lying' should not be unparliamentary in cases where it is clear that one has lied. I ask: would you consider allowing the use of these words when they are more than appropriate, given the performance of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer since the election?",52
124,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Order! That is an issue which has been ruled on by previous Speakers and, indeed, covered by a statement which I made to this House previously. I do not think dressing it up in a particular way makes it any more acceptable. NA",52
125,Mr JOHNS,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS," Mr Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.",52
126,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,52
127,Mr JOHNS,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Yes, I do.",52
128,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Please proceed.,52
129,Mr JOHNS,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,There was an article in the Australian yesterday morning by Lenore Taylor which attributed certain statements to me that I was supposed to have made at a private meeting of the Labor Party yesterday. I did not make those statements. I have even discussed that with the person concerned. Those statements are quite inaccurate and they should be taken from the record. NA NA Annual Report,52

NA First Reading Bill presented by Mr Willis, and read a first time. Second Reading",53
132,Mr WILLIS,QANTAS SALE AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Qantas Sale Act 1992 received royal assent on 21 December 1992. At that time, it was expected that the sale of the Commonwealth's entire equity interest in Qantas would be completed in October-November 1993. In line with this expectation, and the requirement that all legislation should be proclaimed within a reasonable period after its passage by parliament, the Qantas Sale Act contained provision for any of its unproc1aimed sections to be automatically repealed if they had not been enacted by 31 December 1993. The government's recent announcement that the proposed initial public offering of shares in Qantas would be deferred until 1994-95 means therefore that, in the absence of any legislation to remedy this situation, the provisions intended to commence on the dates on which 50 per cent and 100 per cent of the airline are sold will, in fact, lapse on 31 December 1993. Of most concern to the government in this regard, naturally, are the papers: employee related provisions of the Qantas Sale Act-which are planned to come into effect on the day on which 50 per cent of the airline is sold. These provisions either 'save', post-sale, certain existing employee entitlements and rights arising from presale service, or else they remove airline employees from the ambit of legislation applying only to employees of entities that are owned or controlled by the Commonwealth. The premature removal of airline employees from the ambit of such Commonwealth legislation while the Qantas group remains 75 per cent owned by the Commonwealth, and the failure to put amending legislation in place to retain those employees' already accrued benefits gained presale, would clearly be inequitable and could not be supported by the government. It is imperative that these provisions not be 1993 allowed to lapse. To prevent any such inadvertent removal of the rightful entitlements of the airline employees concerned, I propose that the date of automatic repeal in the Qantas Sale Act be altered to accord with the rescheduled timing for the sale of the remainder of the Commonwealth's shares in Qantas in 199495. Accordingly, the bill before the House amends the date of the automatic repeal of the un proclaimed sections of the Qantas Sale Act from 31 December 1993 to 30 June 1995. The opportunity is also being taken in this to make a minor amendment to the Qantas Sale Act to remove any doubt about the intended operation of section 37 of that act. I commend the bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Costello) adjourned. STATES GRANTS (GENERAL PURPOSES) BILL 1993 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Gear, and read a first time. Second Reading",53
133,Mr GEAR,QANTAS SALE AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to put arrangements in place for the provision of general purpose assistance to the states, Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory in 1993-94, consistent with the decisions taken at the Premiers Conference and Loan Council meeting on 5 July 1993. The bill will replace the State Grants (General Purposes) Act 1992 and its provisions closely follow those of that act. The current estimate of general purpose funding for the states and the Northern Territory under the bill amounts to $14.7 billion, or about 13 per cent of estimated Commonwealth budget outlays in 1993-94. As such, these payments constitute a major element of the Commonwealth's budget. In combination· with the Loan Council allocations agreed at the Loan Council meeting, they also have a major bearing on the spending and borrowing of the public sector and in particular state governments. At the 1993 Premiers Conference, the Commonwealth, states and territories recognised that the economy is continuing to expand but the generally subdued growth of the international economy is hampering a more rapid domestic recovery. While recognising that 1993-94 is not the year to cut dramatically into budget deficits, the National Fiscal Outlook report identified that signifibill cant structural repair of both Commonwealth and state budgets is needed in order to lift national savings over the medium-term. Indeed, the government's medium-term budgetary objective is to reduce the Commonwealth's deficit to around one per cent of GDP by 1996-97, and the states will need to adopt a medium-term strategy of deficit restraint if the public sector is to make a significant contribution to savings. Most of the assistance to be provided under this bill is in the form of general revenue grants, which are currently estimated to be $14.4 billion in 1993-94. The level of financial assistance grants in 1993-94 has been set so as to fulfil the Commonwealth's three-year real terms guarantee that was agreed at the 1990 Premiers Conference. The distribution of these grants is essentially determined by the Medicare adjusted relativities recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission in its 1993 report, including a further adjustment for the alternative treatment of stamp duty revenues from corporate reconstructions. The Northern Territory and the ACT will receive special revenue assistance funded from the pool of financial assistance grants of $30 million and $20 million respectively in recognition of the adjustments they face in moving to state-like funding levels. The use of the commission's Medicare adjusted relativities reflects understanding reached with the states as part ·of the new Medicare agreements. The health funding arrangements under the new Medicare agreement took account of a number of health factors which were also addressed by the commission's methodology. Therefore, to implement the new agreement without also amending the commission methodology to exclude these factors would have involved a significant element of double counting. The impact of the new arrangements on the interstate distribution of Medicare funding was to increase significantly funding to the smaller states at the expense of New South Wales and Victoria. The adjustments to the commission's methodology were expected to have the opposite effect; that is, to redistribute financial assistance grants from the smaller states to New South Wales and Victoria. New South Wales and Victoria were given guarantees that this redistribution of financial assistance grants would benefit them by $131 million and $112 million respectively. In the event, New South Wales benefited from the new relativities, but by significantly less than expected, while Victoria actually lost. At the same time, the smaller states and Northern Territory lost significantly less from the Medicare adjustment to the financial assistance grants distribution than was expected. Against this background, it was decided at the Premiers Conference that the cost of the Medicare guarantee payments to New South Wales and Victoria would be shared between the Commonwealth and the states. The contribution from the smaller states is achieved by funding payments totalling $216.6 million-to New South Wales $72.5 million and Victoria $144.1 million-out of the financial assistance grants and hospital funding grants pool. These payments are funded by each .state according to its share of the financial assistance grants and hospital funding grants pool. Consequently, funding the payments out of the pool costs New South Wales $62.8 million, 29 per cent of $216.6 million, and Victoria $45.5 million, 21 per cent of $216.6 million. The Commonwealth will make payments of these amounts to New South Wales and Victoria totalling $108.3 million, thus ensuring that the net benefit to New South Wales and Victoria will be $72.5 million and $144.1 million respectively. The gross payments to New South Wales and Victoria are therefore $135 million and $190 million respectively .. In 1993-94 these arrangements ensure that the Commonwealth bears approximately half the cost of these guarantee payments and the smaller states the remainder. From 1994-95 until the end of the agreements, the Commonwealth share of the cost of these guarantees will be halved and the remainder borne by the smaller states. For the first time, state-like funding for the ACT will be incorporated into this bill. In previous years the general revenue grants to the ACT have been funded directly by the Commonwealth rather than through the financial assistance grants pool. State-like funding for the ACT will be incorporated into the financial assistance grants pool for 199394 and the size of the pool has been increased to reflect that change in funding. Special revenue assistance to the ACT of $20 million in 1993-94 will also be funded from the financial assistance grants pool and is included in this bill. Other payments to the ACT, including transitional allowances and special fiscal needs totalling $64 million as well as a further $20 million special revenue assistance, will be paid directly by the Commonwealth' under the annual appropriation bills. As noted earlier, the Northern Territory is to be provided with special revenue assistance in 1993-94 of $30 million. In general, the relativities recommended by the commission take account of the particular circumstances facing individual states and territories. The high per capita relativity recommended for the Northern Territory recognises the higher costs it faces in providing government services to its population. In the medium term this level of funding should be sufficient to enable the Northern Territory to provide the same level of services to its population as are enjoyed by people in other states. The purpose of the special revenue assistance is to allow the Northern Territory to adjust to this level of funding from the more generous levels provided in earlier years. It compares with special revenue assistance of around $40 million provided for this purpose in 1992-93 and similar assistance having been provided each year to the Northern Territory since its inclusion in the pool of general· revenue assistance for the states. Consistent with arrangements in previous years, financial assistance grants and .special revenue assistance will all be adjusted for the difference between the actual increase in the consumer price index in the year to the March quarter 1994 and the forecast at the time of the Premiers Conference so that the real level of assistance agreed at the Premie.rs Conference is maintained. In accordance with its priorities and policies in the health education area, the government decided that, from 1985, nurse education should be progressively transferred from hospitals to higher education institutions. This move has helped to provide a better educated and more flexible nursing work force and to increase the educational and employment opportunities in the nursing profession, particularly for women. The transfer will be completed this year and from 1 January 1994 the Commonwealth will take over full responsibility for funding of nurse education. This bill gives legislative effect to the reduction in general purpose payments to the states reflecting this transfer in funding responsibility. In addition, from 1 January 1994, the Commonwealth will untie annual funding of $350 million of Commonwealth road funding for arterial roads. In 1993-94, payment will be $175 million, distributed on the average of the arterial roads allocation for the three years to 1992 inclusive. In 1995-96 and 1996-97, the aggregate level of funds will be indexed to the movements in financial assistance grants. In 1997-98, the funds will be absorbed into financial assistance grants. The bill also provides for the payment of $330.3 million for capital grants to the states and territories. The bill includes one additional feature to the act it replaces. This bill includes a clause helping to protect the right of higher education institutions to decide the most appropriate range and level of services and amenities for their students. Student organisations provide a wide range of services and amenities for their members; for example counselling, sport, health and careers services. These are funded mainly by a services and amenities fee collected from students by institutions on behalf of organisations representing the interest of students generally. The Western Australian state parliament recently legislated to interfere with the rights of institutions in that state to make their own decisions about imposing or collecting these fees. This bill, in conjunction with the Higher Education Funding Act 1988, provides an avenue for the Commonwealth to make up any shortfall in revenue experienced by an institution as a result of such state actions and to recover this money from the states. This bill is an integral part of the Commonwealth's financial relations with the state governments and of the budget. I present the explanatory memorandum which contains more detailed explanations of the provisions of the bill. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Ruddock) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1993 First Reading  first time. Second Reading  Secretary to the Minister for Defence)(3.22 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Defence Legislation Amendment Bill makes various amendments to a number of provisions: firstly, modify a provision which has been used to cover productivity superannuation determinations, to reflect the fact that they are no longer 'interim'; secondly, modify the right of appeal from conscientious objection tribunals to reflect more accurately the role of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal; thirdly, streamline procedures covering command and discipline where forces of Australia and other countries are serving together; fourthly, enable trustees of four welfare funds to be appointed by a minister rather than by the Governor General; fifthly, remove an unintended double benefit for a small number of members of the Defence Force who have transferred to the new military superannuation and benefits scheme; and sixthly, provide a special home loans benefit for members of the Defence Force allotted to warlike service. Before dealing in more detail with the last two matters, which are of greater significance, I would like to make a few observations on the other amendments. The superannuation determination amendments are simply to ensure that there is proper authority for determinations dealing with ongoing superannuation benefits for members of the Defence Force. The conscientious objection amendments would m-dify a right of appeal. Where a conscientious objection tribunal has determined an application, there is a right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, AAT, then to the Federal Court. At present, the Federal Court could hear a conscientious objection appeal from the AAT on a question of law and, with the leave of the court, on any other ground. The amendments would eliminate the right of appeal on grounds other than questions of law, to accord with current administrative law policy whereby the AAT provides final merits review. I should add that, although these amendments are necessary to reflect administrative law policy, they are not expected to have any practical effect. This is because questions of conscientious objection arise only in the context of conscription, and there could be no conscription unless Australia was under direct threat of attack. The amendments to streamline command and discipline procedures where forces of Australia and other countries serve together will avoid the requirement for a series of formal declarations where ongoing cooperation could be anticipated. A standing declararemove tion, to cover a particular country, would invoke mutual powers of command and discipline whenever the forces of that country were serving together with ours. Of course, this facility would be used only for close allies where we could anticipate ongoing international cooperation, for example, in peacekeeping activities. The amendments to enable a minister instead of the Governor General to appoint trustees of welfare trust funds are part of an ongoing process of relieving the Governor General from involvement in the detail of Defence Force administration. The trusts in question administer welfare funds for each service of the Defence Force and retirement units for ex-air force personnel. I now tum to the two more significant matters in the bill. The amendments to remove a double benefit for a small number of members of the Defence Force who have transferred to the new military superannuation and benefits scheme will correct a drafting omission. The error would allow some members who elected to transfer from the Defence Force retirement and death benefits scheme to the military superannuation and benefits scheme to receive a double benefit. The amendments have retrospective effect to the commencement of the new scheme on 1 October 1991 to remove the liability for the double benefit for members who have retired since then. Recent changes to the military superannuation and benefits rules have removed the problem for affected members who retire after 21 April 1993. There are two groups of members eligible to receive double benefits: Defence Force retirement and death benefits scheme members who had retired with a pension; and members who had separated from the Defence Force and transferred their benefits to another superannuation scheme. Where a member of either group re-entered the Defence Force and then transferred to the military superannuation and benefits scheme, the drafting error would allow the member to retain the benefit derived from contributions paid in the first period of service and also to be paid those contributions again with interest. The amendments would the entitlement to the unintended double benefit. Forty-three former members are affected. They have been advised in writing that any payment of the double benefit would be recoverable but, as no additional monies have been paid to date, it is hoped to avoid the need for recovery action. On a more positive note, I come to the amendments to provide a special home loans benefit for mem bers of the Defence Force who have been allotted to warlike service. In May of this year the government agreed to a framework for conditions of service where members of the Defence Force are deployed overseas. The government's aim is to ensure that members who are deployed overseas will be assured of consistent and timely benefits. An important element of the agreed conditions is an enhanced home loans benefit for personnel allotted to service declared as 'warlike'. This benefit will apply to members involved in the recent operational service in Cambodia, Somalia and the former Yugoslavia. The same benefit will be available for members allotted for service in any future overseas operation of a comparable nature. The additional benefit comprises waiver of the requirement for a qualifying period of six years service together with an additional subsidy period ranging from two to five years, depending on the length of warlike service. For example, members who have completed operational service in Somalia wi11 now qualify for waiver of the six-year qualifying period and an additional subsidy period of three years. The maximum subsidy period is also increased from 20 to 25 years. As I have indicated, the.<;e benefits will be also to all personnel allotted for future service declared as warlike and represent an ongoing commitmentby the government to see overseas service by Defence Force personnel appropriately recognised. The kinds of operation in question are an essential element of Australia's determination to play a fitting role as a good international citizen. As the burden of that role often falls on members of the Defence Force who are deployed in extremely difficult circumstances, I am sure the House will support the government's measures to establish a suitable framework for the associated conditions of service. I commend the bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.  journed. NA Public Works Committee Reference",54
134,Mr LEE,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) representing the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services, I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: RAAF Williams Rationalisation Project at Laverton, Victoria. RAAF Williams, which comprises Point Cook and Laverton bases, is located 20 kilometres west of the Melbourne central business district and five kilometres from the township of Werribee. The Defence Force structure review rationalised the disposition and functions of all defence units and, subsequently, in May 1991 the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) announced that the airfields at Laverton and Point Cook were to be closed or sold. As a result of this announcement, a consultative committee, under the able chairmanship of the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), examined the impact that the closures at Laverton and Point Cook available would have on local communities. The proposal consists of three major items, minor adjusting works and engineering services. The major items are: firstly, the refurbishment of the School of Radio building at Laverton to accommodate RAAF Headquarters Logistic Command, which will vacate rented premises in the Melbourne CBD; secondly, refurbishment of existing facilities at Laverton to house all elements of the RAAF publishing unit; and, thirdly, construction of purpose built facilities for the RAAF Institute of Aviation Medicine, which will be relocated from Point Cook base to RAAF base Edinburgh in South Australia. The estimated total cost of the works is $19.8 million at August 1993 prices. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction work on the site is expected to commence in early 1994 and be completed by mid-1995. I table selected drawings of the project. I commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.2) 1993 Second Reading Debate resumed from 19 August, on motion by Mr Sciacca: That the bill be now read a second time.",58
135,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Berowra) (3.32 p.m.)The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1993, which we are debating, deals with five separate matters: first, to take into account certain employer fringe benefits in the income test for family payment and the parental income test for jobsearch al10wance and sickness al10wance recipients of claimants under 18 years of age; second, to take foreign .income into account in the income test for the family payment; third, to introduce the government's election promise in relation to establishing a seniors health card; fourth, to make the foreign currency provisions in the Social Security Act more responsive to market exchange rates; and, final1y, to extend the period for payment of the advance pharmaceutical al1owance. The seniors card was an election commitment. The matters relating to employer provided fringe benefits were the subject of comment in the 1992-93 budget. The other three items are new initiatives. At this point, let me make it clear that, while I wi11 be moving a second reading amendment, these are measures that we do not intend at this stage-I underline at this stage-to oppose. I make that point because certain matters will be referred to a Senate committee for further examination and inquiry, and that may give rise to possible amendments at a later stage on the issue of the employer provided fringe benefits. I wi11 come to that in a moment. I make it very clear in the first instance this is important legislation. It obviously has certain financial implications for the government. As far as the opposition is concerned, the family al1owance, as it is known, and the supplementary benefits are important programs. In fact, it was the Menzies government which in 1941 introduced the initiative known as child endowment. Members of parliament from this side of the chamber take a great deal of pride in the initiatives that enabled those who had families to be advanced in the costs that they have to meet and to assist in family formation through the assistance original1y of the child endowment. Mr Sciacca-It took about 40 years. MrRUDDOCK-Forty years. It is an outstanding initiative by our predecessor Liberal governments. It is not an important welfare initiative by Labor, but an initiative of non-Labor parties. I take great pride in that. In 1976 the Fraser government brought in the family al10wance arrangements to replace the child endowment and ensured that that payment could be made to al1 families. It was not subject to any income or assets test and it was to assist with family formation . Members of the Labor Party may say with great pride, 'We were the people who then started to limit it so that some families would not be able to be eligible for that support for family formation'. If they want to remind us that they were the first people to introduce assets lests in relation to the benefits that limit family support, let them do it. But I was not proposing to remind people that they were the niggardly folk who introduced those sorts of limitations on the access to those important benefits. Mr Sciacca-Don't let me bait you",58
136,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Do not let me bait you? I can never be baited in relation to these matters. It is important to look at the steps that the government took to introduce a form of income and assets testing of eligibility for family assistance. If we are to have a schema which is designed to limit payments in that way-it has been part of the government's philosophy to pursue that approach-then it needs to be effective. It is one of the matters that that we noted in Fightback. This government had al10wed a situation to arise where family payments could be limited to those who had a family income of up to about $65,000 and those beyond it would be excluded. But it al10wed situations to persist where people . might have had notional incomes of many hundreds of thousands of dol1ars. Some people were known to be taking their benefits in forms other than salary. We made it very clear in Fightback that, if one was pledged to this sort of targeted approach, it needed to be effective. We believe the system in that sense-as the government al10wed it to develop-had become inequitable and badly targeted. People with very substantial additional fringe benefits were obtaining access to family al1owance. When others with smal1er incomes-and only one source of income-were excluded it created serious problems of inequity. We highlighted that and the government, very properly, after giving it a good deal of thought, has come forward with a package that, in the end result, seems to us to be severely flawed. That is the result of the government's period of deliberation. I draw to the attention of the House the manner in which these provisions are flawed. The package was designed to take into account a family's total income rather than just its taxable income. It was designed to include very ,specific benefits for health insurance payments by an employer; the provision of a car by an employer; school fees, if they might have been paid by an employer; certain subsidised loans; and housing fringe benefits. Housing fringe benefits were intended to gamer up those situations in which people might be established in a fairly substantial residerice, where they either paid nothing for it or paid a rental that,was considerably below market value. In endeavouring to put provisions of that sort in place, the government's proposals run very much further than one might have thought. The government tries to exclude relatively minor additional and supplementary payments. It excludes union fees where they might be paid by an employer. They might run to cover a whole lot of been suggested to me that some unions even I include payments of health benefits as part their fee to enable people to escape the salary provisions of the fringe benefits tax. They able to run it through union fees. such rorts in place, it is obviously of concern to me that this legislation is deficient in running to cover those matters. The government drew the rental subsidy such a way as to cover its own employees and also the defence forces. It drew it in such way as to cover those people who may be living in rental accommodation in more went on to say: remote parts of Australia, sometimes in The situations where the provision of housing might be a very important condition of the very service that people have to give. The way in which the provisions are to operate provides some flexibility in terms of what will actually be deemed to be a market rent, so the subsidies may not necessarily be a real test in that sense. Nevertheless, it is clear that people who have very small incomes-and where there are fairly marginal benefits in the form of rental subsidies-could be affected by these proposals in relation to their supplementary benefits. Or, in the case of the defence forces, those people at officer level might perhaps be excluded from eligibility for family allowances in circumstances where they suffer a very considerable disadvantage in other senses. These are some of the matters that we believe ought to be looked at by a parliamentary committee. We think it is important to establish whether the concerns that have been raised with us-by the RSL, some defence families in particular, and also by other people who are required to serve in remote places, such as police, teachers, and fairly low-paid public servants-about these provisions to assess rental subsidies may in fact be so unconscionable as to warrant reconsideration of the proposals. I want to take up the issue of the rental subsidy. It was drawn to my attention in a letter from a member of the defence forces that there have been certain policy statements by the government which might have some implications in this area. This lady wrote in other things. It has her letter: believe that the inclusion of ADF rental subsidy of ,as income is wrong. It is not part of the ADF package. That is shown by the fact that the are subsidy ceases when a member has his own home If there are in the posting locality. So it was not part of the salary package; it not was not paid to everybody who was living in that particular situation. When people own in their own homes in that locality the subsidy is not paid. That would suggest that it is not a a fringe benefit in the sense that we normally regard these matters as fringe benefits. She rental subsidy is compensation for the housing disadvantages suffered by ADF members through being moved frequently. You may recall a Task Force looked at ADF housing in 1984-85 and out of its study some Government policy goals for employee housing were adopted. She attached a copy of those goals. I had not seen them before, but I think it would be worthwhile for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) to look at them. It does suggest that other factors were taken into account in establishing this form of benefit. In other words, it was not seen as a salary substitute or as supplementing people's income; it was seen as a compensation for the particular service that they are rendering to the nation. I will quote the basic goal of the government's policy in relation to housing for the Australian Public Service and the Defence Force because it said that it needed to be fair and cost effective. Within that basic goal, the specific goals were: (i) compensate personnel for housing-related disabilities consequent upon frequent re-location where this is required as a condition of service; (ii) provide adequate accommodation for personnel required in the course of duty where suitable alternative accommodation is not available, or required for essential operational reasons to reside at Defence Force or APS premises; (iii) minimise financial disabilities, of personnel required to re-locate frequently, which are due to inter-regional differences in housing costs; (iv) provide that an APS or Defence Force member not be out of pocket from reasonable expenses incurred in changing houses ... (v) facilitate tenn transfers, by APS officers for administrative or staff development purposes; (vi) minimise housing-related detriment to morale of personnel and families when personnel are required to re-locate fre{!uently ... These were not seen as fringe benefits;· they were seen as quite separate matters. We think it appropriate that these matters be the subject of further inquiry and report. It is for that reason that I move this amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House: (1) condemns the Government for not protecting the interests of low income families, the elderly and the disadvantaged; and (2) calls on the Government to review its proposal to include as employer provided fringe benefits in the enhanced income test for family payments, those benefits which are provided as a condition of service or employment in non-metropolitan and special areas in particular, having particular to the circumstances faced by members of the defence forces and their families"". I am sure that amendment will be willingly seconded by my colleague the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor), who will speak later on this matter. When the matter goes to the Senate, we will be seeking to have it referred to the Standing Committee on Community Affairs for report on whether this bill was intended to include defence benefits and allowances, whether conditions of service are intended to make up for disadvantages and difficulties inherent in service life, and the wider implications of employers providing fringe benefits as part of conditions of service to compensate for remoteness and other employment related difficulties. This is a major question that needs to be looked at into reside in locations this context. I welcome the fact that in relation to the testing for family payments the government now intends to take into account foreign income. My colleague Senator Calvert was one of the first to draw attention to the fact that people who had been resident in Australia were able to move overseas and draw very considerable incomes overseas, leaving their wives and children at home and continuing to receive benefits. These people were in a position to remit to their families very substantial income that was not taken into account for assessment under the income test. Having drawn attention to that, we believe that this is an appropriate response. I raise also the issue of making foreign currency provisions more responsive to market exchange fluctuations. I recently had the opportunity to visit Western Australia. I know the Department of Social Security is familiar with the case. A lady there had had what is often referred to as a 'complex assessment' of the pension benefits that she was eligible to receive. This lady was subjected to review because she had a small amount of overseas income, some shares and some annuities, but not so large as to exclude her from eligibility for a pension. What the department did in her circumstances was remarkable. The first advice date was 19 November 1991, effective from 29 regard August, and there was a change in the payment of pension. There was a further advice date effective at 5 December 1991, one at 9 December 1991, one at 22 January 1992, one at 7 February 1992, one at 27 February 1992, one at 12 March 1992, one at 26 March 1992, one at 7 May 1992, one at 18 June, one at 2 July, one at 13 August, one at 29 September one at 8 October, one at 19 November, one at 3 December, one at 28 January, one at 11 March, two at 25 March, two at 8 April, one at 6 May, one at 20 May and one at 3 June. What will the government do when it starts adjusting pension eligibility more frequently for currency fluctuations? And the government expects its departmental officials to be able to manage those sorts of cases! Recently, I read a report of the Auditor General which commented on complex assessments and the difficulty officers were having in managing those matters. It also pointed out the large number of errors that were occurring. It did not quantify the extent of those errors-a matter that I would like to see clarified by the estimates committee-but it is obviously a matter of concern when there are such frequent variations that adjustments are required as often as I have indicated. The other matter to which I wish to draw attention, and the reason I have proposed this amendment, is the impact that the government's budget is having on the most vulnerable people in Australia, the people generally reliant upon welfare for their support. While there has been a lot of discussion to date about the government's budget and its regressive nature, yesterday the Treasury tabled a model which illustrated the number of people affected by the government's budget measures, particularly with relation to taxation changes. It is a very interesting table and it clearly establishes that pensioners are the most vulnerable of all those affected. Dr Neil Warren, an economist at the University of New South Wales, substantially criticised the model because of the extent to which the data was flawed and because matters affecting the most vulnerable were ignored. Even if one accepts those criticisms, as I do, the model discloses that the lowest income quintile-pensioners-are the third most disadvantaged group. The second quintile, married pensioners, are the second most disadvantaged group. The income effect upon them is negative, as it is for those in the fourth quintile, who, as the government's own analysis establishes, are the most disadvantaged of any group. Dr Warren also criticises the Treasury analysis for not taking the following into account: the extent to which people might be using leaded fuel-the model assumes that all petrol used is unleaded fuel; the impact on the cost of cars-people.in disadvantaged situations very often need to use motor vehicles; and the extent to which even pensioners can have supplementary income which might be taxed. We all know about taxation and pensioners receiving supplementary income. It had been government policy to exclude pensioners from the taxation system, but, as a result of the Treasurer's announcement, they still have to pay tax even though they are in receipt of pensions. They are also affected by bracket creep, which is another matter not taken into account. The budget changes are regressive because those on higher incomes are the real net beneficiaries of the government's budget. In other words, the government gave tax cuts to those who are well off but not to those who are most in need. One of the points that need to be made is that the government has introduced very significant increases in indirect taxation which will impact very significantly on the most disadvantaged people in the community, particularly those with little or no supplementary income and who are reliant on welfare. On the other hand, the opposition proposed a broadly based consumption tax which would have provided an eight per cent increase in the pension level and a six per cent increase for all other beneficiaries against a gross impact on their cost of living of around two per cent. In the main, they would have been between four and six per cent better off. That was the compensation package that the opposition proposed. This goveniment proposes no compensation package at all to those people reliant on welfare. I want to make some very simple points particularly in relation to the sales tax issue. The way in which the government's sales tax changes have been structured affect the most vulnerable. How does that occur? It occurs in this way: the government increases all rates of sales tax by one per cent. If a· person is paying 10 per cent wholesales sales tax on products he might be consuming, then a 10 per cent tax increase has occurred. If it is a 20 per cent wholesale sales taxed item, a one per cent increase in fact is a five per cent increase in the tax payable on those products. If it is at the 30 per cent rate, the one per rise is only a 3.3 per cent increase. It is very important that we understand those differences. If we then go and look at what items are taxed at 10 per cent, what do we find they are? They include biscuits, snack foods, icecream, iceblocks, confectionery, fruit juice, non-alcoholic wines and beverages, cordial, flavoured milk; a number of homeware items such as garbage cans and bags, compost bins, incinerators, brooms-very basic itemsbuckets, doormatsMs Crawford-Oh!",59
137,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"The honourable member for Forde scoffs. It is the very basic items that are taxed at 10 per cent, but it is a 10 per cent increase in cost that everybody will have to bear. If we look at the 30 per cent items, what do we find they are? On what items do we get the 3.3 per cent increase? Colour television sets, video recorders, radios, clock radios, compact disc players, video disc players, photographic items, cameras, sport and leisure items, binoculars, poker machines, pinball machines, video machines-how many people buy those sorts of items for survival? There is only a 3.3 per cent increase on these items. What about jewellery, wristwatches, clocks-the fetish of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)? The tax increase on these items is only 3.3 per cent. Mr Sciacca-You were going to throw them out and put in a 15 per cent tax.",63
138,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"The parliamentary secretary feels somewhat sensitive in relation to these items-and well he might, because the fact is that the items that attract a 10 per cent tax, the basic products, obtain a 10 per cent increase. The so-called luxuries are the ones that only go up by 3.3 per cent. That is the fact of the matter. Then we come to the petrol tax. This is the area that ought to embarrass the government. I heard the Treasurer today saying, 'Look, we couldn't take this into account in our model, nobody's got any figures'. The fact is that the Sydney Morning Herald seemed to find some figures. It published figures from the New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority showing the impact of this tax in Sydney. I guess the same figures would be available for cent every capital city in Australia in relation to where vehicles that use unleaded fuel are registered as against those that use leaded fuel. What do we find in relation to Sydney? If we divide Sydney up in political terms, or in socio-economic terms, what do we find? In Woollahra, leaded vehicles comprise 43 per cent of those registered and unleaded vehicles comprise 52 per cent; in North Sydney, the figures are 33 per cent and 59 per cent; in Willoughby, 35 per cent and 61 per cent; in Lane Cove, 42 per cent and 53 per cent; and in Kuring-gai, 42 per cent and 54 per cent. If we look at all the Labor electorates, where the people who are in the lower socio-economic groups liveMs Crawford-Not always.",63
139,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"No, not always, I accept that. I am going to advise those people in my electorate, who are affected by these proposals, of the extent to which the government has let them down too. But the fact is that in Blacktown, we find vehicles using unleaded fuel are 31 per cent of those registered while those using leaded fuel are 59 per cent. In Liverpool the vehicles using leaded petrol are 58 per cent and 32 per cent use unleaded; in Campbelltown it is 61 per cent leaded and 32 per cent unleaded; in Canterbury it is 62 per cent leaded and 31 per cent unleaded; and in Bankstown, the electorate of the Prime Minister, it is 50 per cent leaded as against 37 per cent unleaded. That shows that the government's constituency is the one which will suffer most as a result of these changes. The fuel increase impacts upon poorer and older people generally-I acknowledge that. But in terms of the government's constituency, the people who vote for it, the people who are described as true believers, they are the ones who have been hit to leg, and that is the reason we propose this amendment. If Labor Party members opposite are really serious about where they stand, if they want to get out of the caucus room and demonstrate to their constituents where they stand on these matters, they can cross the floor and vote with us on this amendment. Mr Sciacca-Never.",63
140,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"The parliamentary secretary says, 'Never'. I can understand that because government members do not care; they have no conscience. They want to get in the privacy of a economics committee room and slap the Prime Minister around a bit. But they really do not want their own people to know where they stand on these matters. We will give them the opportunity to vote on this matter. They can either come over on our side and vote with us, or they can stand up in their electorates and justify why they have refused to support an amendment that condemns them for leaving the elderly and the disadvantaged in this most dreadful predicament. It is a very real opportunity for honourable members opposite. (Time expired)",64
141,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,I take it that the honourable member for Groom is seconding the amendment and reserves his right to speak. Mr Taylor-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,64
142,Ms CRAWFORD,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Forde) (4.02 p.m.)The Social Security Amendment Bill (No.2) brings about one election promise of 1993in particular, the seniors health card. I am interested to note that the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) is not the slightest bit interested in health cards. The opposition is much more involved in the whole issue of private health care. What does the health care card mean? It means that 200,000 Australians will have a health care card which will enable them to have access to doctors, to pharmaceutical benefits, to hearing benefits, and later the dentistry benefits. What is important in this is the range of benefits. It is particularly important for us, as Australians, to look at that whole issue of hearing benefits. No other country has the kind of hearing testing facilities that we have in Australia at the National Acoustics Laboratory. Australians are very well served by that particular agency. It is important as people age that they have access to those services without having problems in relation to money. . The extension of the seniors health card is a delivery of an election promise. It also means that people now have access to a whole range of services for which previously they had to pay. The 200,000 people include a whole range of people who because of assets or their residency requirements have traditionally been precluded from receiving benefits. The government is delivering on this election promise for these people. When we hear honourable members opposite talking about the poor, talking about people on low incomes, we should remember that they somehow forget the range of services that are available and the kinds of factors which make up the social wage. They have very little understanding of what a social wage is. We understand that that is important. The same can also be said about the family payments and the whole issue of wages verses income. As a government, we believe in prior right. It is a prior right of people who are most in need and who are most deserving. How do you say to someone who earns wages and who is on pay as you earn, 'I am terribly sorry you can't have the family income supplement, but the person next door who is living in subsidised housing, who is driving a subsidised car, who is having subsidised holidays, and a whole range of other subsidised services is entitled because technically that is not wages'. It is a nonsense, and it cannot be allowed to continue. Mr Ruddock-You have let it happen.",64
143,Ms CRAWFORD,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"The honourable member is suggesting that there should be no upper limit on family income payments. He has said that we were miserly and niggardly to for suggesting that families with an income of $60,000 should not be entitled to family payments. That is in fact the case. Under this budget those families which have an income of $60,000 will not be eligible for family allowance payments. More importantly, families which have a whole range of fringe benefits which are not classified as wages will levels? now have to declare them. I am very interested to hear the concerns the honourable members opposite on a range of factors when they look at the issue of wholesales sales tax. I remind honourable members opposite that Australians own more colour televisions per person and more video recorders than any other country yet they are most found in lower socio-economic groupings within Australia. One may ask: why is this so? Why? Because the area where they live, as the honourable member for Berowra has so clearly designated, has very few services. The whole issue and question of access to those services are at the very heart of disadvantage-disadvantages certainly on a level of income but also on a level of accessibility. When we look at a whole range of products which are available, the people in our community who find those things very useful and, in particular, a very important part of their life, think that those products are much more important than, perhaps, biscuits or ice-cream, which the honourable member for Berowra seems to find necessary. When we look at the whole issue of unleaded and leaded petrol, it is certainly true many of our people do have cars that use leaded petrol. But why? I can cite an example from my very own electorate of Forde-a city of 160,000 people with the worse public transport in Australia which is recognised and acknowledged in a national report. That is why people have to have cars-cars that they find difficult to own. The local council there has failed to take up the challenge, and it failed to address the needs of the people. I say to honourable members opposite that it is not a Labor council. Why should our children be subjected to a lead content in the air which is worse than parts of Sydney where we have heard that lead emissions are less? Why should children who come from poorer socio-economic areas live in an environment where the lead content is heavier and, therefore, damage to their health is stronger? We have to ask the honourable member for Berowra: is this what he wants? Does he want all those people who live in lower socio-economic areas to have their children subjected to higher lead - am remind- of when I was a very young of chIld and a chIld down the road was dying from eating paint off the railings of a house because leaded paint was used. The same kinds of arguments were used then against a change from leaded to unleaded paint in that the poor were unable to afford to repaint their houses so their children could die because they had leaded paint. The same is true now. Are we saying now that the children of those people who are poor can continue to live in an atm?sphere where lead content is unacceptably hIgh and where their children are in danger? The target for this matter must be the delivery of public transport to those areas to ensure that people, who often do not want to own cars but who find through necessity that they own cars, are at a total disadvantage. That is one of the areas which we must address and look at. We must also look at ways in which people's lives can be made more meaningful. I was interested to hear from the honourable member for Berowra about the whole issue of families, family payments and women and children in relation, to the budget. We did not hear one word of support or encouragement that for this government which delivered to the women and children of Australia. I find it quite extraordinary. We acknowledge that families are - ntit1ed to expect high quality, affordable chIld care and to receive support for their decisions on balancing work and family responsibilities. (Quorum formed) It is quite extraordinary that when we talk has about child care and women's health issues the members of the opposition never want to hear. Why? Because this government has a record in child care that is unparalleled. We have delivered since 1983, when there were a mere 46,000 places in child care. Now there are 208,000 places, with an expected growth this year of 29,000 places. This government acknowledges that it is the the right of people to make choices and to take the opportunities that are available. We have a range of child care available: long day care, occasional child care, outside hours school care and family day care. This range of child care is offered to people in the work force, people in training, people who may have particular needs, children with disability and a whole range of others. There are 230,000 families, with 358,000 children, currently not receiving rebates or money for child care. The honourable member for Berowra pretends that that situation does not exist. As part of a response to the demands and needs of the women of Australia, on consultation this government decided to provide a cash rebate of $28.20 per week. The honourable member for Berowra finds this a difficulty. We do not because we acknowledge that child care is an integral part of costs of education, training and work. It is important. We are also interested in an emergency care program for sick children. The opposition has discussed interminably the demands and the needs of the woman who chooses to remain at home and look after her family. This government has now done something about that. Yet the opposition is still carping. We will have a home child-care allowance of $60 per fortnight for those women who choose to stay at home. This is addressing the needs of women who have very particular needs and who want to be able to make a choice. The kind of hypocrisy demonstrated by honourable members opposite is extraordinary. We have heard them talk about the demands of the women who wish to make a choice about staying at home. This government has responded to those needs and demands by acting in a certain way and still the opposition is unhappy. The opposition talks about demands for an expansion of child care but still they are unhappy. We have also heard discussions recently on the whole question of women's health and health needs. Through this budget we intend to expand the national women's health program by $30 million. This very clearly is a commitment by this government to the needs of women in Australia. To ensure that those needs are better met, we are looking at a longitudinal study of women's health which will guide planning for future health services for women. I mentioned earlier the seniors card giving access to the emergency dental scheme and the general dental scheme which will apply. We are looking at a whole range of services in which health is the focus and in which people's opportunity to make choices is important. It is also important that we provide a way in which people can have access to those services through the health card, through a range of child-care programs, through women's health centres or through the dental program. In the same way we concern ourselves with the needs and demands of those families who are looking at wages versus incomes, which we have already discussed here. I find the whole concern for low income families somewhat paradoxical coming from a, group who were prepared to tax these people at a rate of 15 per cent on everything they bought and wore and owned, who would deny them access to a whole range of Medicare services and who would expect child-care arrangements to be taxed at 15 per cent. This government, listening to the people in the community, has remained committed to a range of targeted programs. I suppose that is what particularly galls the honourable member for Berowra. The budget highlights the fact that we are listening to the 'women and children in our community and responding to their needs. There can be no question of that. This government asked the women of Australia what they wanted. They told us their main concerns were child care, women's health and violence against women. This budget delivers on all of those issues. On the very important issue of violence against women, this government has contributed $56 million towards women's refuges and shelters, to counselling services and to services for young women. We will continue to proceed along that path. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) stood up and said that violence against women in our society was not acceptable. We must all stand up and say the same thing. More importantly, as a government, we have to emphasise that women's equality and participation in Australian society must not have the obstacles of violence. It is not acceptable for one in four of our families to suffer from domestic violence. We must provide structures through counselling, other services and different sorts of programs to ensure that won'len are able to participate equal1y in Australian society. At the very heart of this requirement are services which ensure that people have access to child care and health services. The family income supplement and family allowance ensure that they can make a choice about staying at home or going out to work. They can access education services which they may need for training or retraining to enter the labour market. This society is very much about structural change and our differing roles in the community. As a government, it is imperative that we constantly ensure that the choices, opportunities and chances which we offer to everybody are enhanced. An article only yesterday in a local Brisbane newspaper welcomed a new principal to a girls school in Brisbane. The principal was shown in a photograph with some of the young women there who are very competent and clever in the computer area. The article made the comment that it was only 100 years ago that most women in our community were unable to read and write or access schooling. Looking back on this century, we can see the sorts of opportunities and choices women have been able to make about whether they will stay at home or remain in the workplace. We can see whether they have had access to child care, health and the other programs which are an integral part of this government's commitment to the creation of a fairer society. I commend the bill to the House.",64
144,Mr TAYLOR,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Groom) (4.22 p.m.}-I support the second reading amendment moved by the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock). The honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford) commented on the views of this side of the House on a social conscience, a social wage and social awareness. How can she possibly make those sorts of comments after this bad budget? How can she look at herself in the mirror and say that this is not a budget of betrayal and deceit in relation to low income people? They are exactly the sorts of people she is accusing this side of the in three or one House of neglecting. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca), who has now left the chamber, in his second reading speech on the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) said: The government remains committed to protecting and enhancing the interests of families. However, it is important that this be achieved equitably and targeted towards those people who are most in need. The government is concerned that the use of taxable income alone might not be a reliable basis upon which to determine entitlement to certain social security payments. I say to the parliamentary secretary and to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services (Dr Theophanous), who is in the House at the moment, that this side of the House has no difficulty with that as a general objective and that under that social security umbrel1a there are irregularities and rorts-I am reluctant to use the word 'rorts'-in some of the allowances that this legislation seeks to overcome and redress, particularly in the fringe benefits area. As the honourable member for Berowra said in his speech, there are differences between fringe benefits and specific conditions· of service. That is the area on which I want to concentrate in my contribution to this debate. Let us look at what has been said about fringe benefits. I refer the House to a comment made in this place in 1986 by the then Treasurer, now-surprise, surprise-the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). On 2 May he said in part: There has over the years been a very strong movement towards the remuneration of employees especially higher income' earners-by fringe benefits packages which allowed income tax to be avoided on substantial parts of the overall remuneration. So-called tax-free perks came to dominate salary package negotiations and packages were openly advertised in the market place. In his usual, even-handed and objective way he finished by saying that fringe benefits are 'the most rutted-in tax shelter and the most untouchable income of all'. We have to look at this legislation in light of what the present Prime Minister had to say about seven years ago at one end of the spectrum and relate that to the impact of this legislation, if we accept it as it has been drafted, in certain areasparticularly the Australian Defence Force, the police forces and, in some circumstances, certain public servants and so on. I remind the House of subparagraph (2) of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Berowra. In part it says: . . . calls on the Government to review its proposal to include as employer provided fringe benefits in the enhanced income test for family payments, thoSe benefits, which are provided as a condition of service . .. having particular regard to the circumstances faced by members of the defence forces and their families. It is very important to draw the line between fringe benefits and conditions of service and to highlight that differential. I refer the House to a very well-received and respectable report into personnel wastage in the Australian Defence Force, the 1989 Cross report, named after a previous honourable member for the seat of Brisbane. In part it said: Conditions of servicehe is talking about the Defence Forceare the elements of ADF remuneration that recognise in a tangible way, that the profession of arms is a unique profession. Specialist allowances recognise special skills, and other allowances make up for the disadvantages or difficulties inherent in service life, most of them clustered around the operational need for postings. It went on to say: Conditions of service thus should encompass not only pay and al10wances but also a comprehensive range of compensations relating to family and social issues, superannuation, hours of work, housing and organisational privileges. Many of those fundamental conditions of service are under threat if the legislation unamended is approved in this parliament. Conditions of service within the Defence Force are compensation for those unique demands. Whilst the sharpness of that sort of comment might lose some of its thrust in a time of peace, it is very important that we not lose sight of the fact that those conditions are there to attract and retain unifonned people in the Defence Force. That same report went on to talk about the unique nature of the military and, in part, it said: Defence Force members are required to serve, when, where and as required, often in the most hazardous circumstances. They must fol1ow without question the directions of government, while at the same time den:lOnstrating initiative and originality of thought in the execution of their duties. Hours can be long and irregular. There is no recourse to industrial action, and compensation for overtime is limited to a smal1' fixed-sum 'disability' allowance. Family moves are regular, sometimes seemingly random and frequently stressful. Demands made on members of the ADF are not limited to the contribution the Force makes to regional stability, the law and order of the nation and the maintenance of national prosperity and trade. It finished by saying: During emergencies such as bushfires, cyclones and similar national disasters, it is the ADF to whom the community turns for a vital proportion of the support effort. The ethos of serviceI emphasise thisremains paramount. I think it is important that we highlight that in the context of this debate. I noticed a message that the then Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, now the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney), put out at his personal direction in June last year which said: Subsidised rent through DHA will therefore continue to be a very attractive condition of service to individual ADF members. Surely that in itself is telling as to what we mean by conditions of service as distinct from the fringe benefit consideration which is implicit and explicit within this legislation. I turn specifically to this legislation. As a result of that, on 27 August a general message went out within the military which said: The government announced in the context of the 1992 budget that, from I Jan 94, the income test for family payment, additional family payment, job search allowance for those under 18 years, childcare assistance and Austudy/Abstudy will include the value of some employer provided fringe benefits. The implications of these decisions for ADF condition; of service were taken up at ministerial level. The basis of the approach was that ADF conditions of service are a recognition of the nature of employment and the requirement for personnel to move at the employer's initiative frequently, and often at short notice. It went on to say: After giving the matter special consideration, cabinet decided that ADF members should not be exempt from arrangements affecting the wider Australian community. It went on to say: The decision regarding additional family payment is anticipated to have a wide impact on ADF members. Until the various quanta for the benefits are determined, particularly that relating to housing subsidy, it is not possible to indicate salary that might still qualify for AFP. It would appear that all but trainees might be affected. The full implications of these new provisions are being examined. We will be seeking urgent talks with the Department of Social Security to clarify arrangements as there are many practical aspects Surely there are two things that stick out as a result of that message that went out to the Defence Force. The first is confusion. The second, which is of very deep concern, is what is actually happening to conditions of service which have been established over many years and, as I said before, are there not only to attract but to retain people. A lot of people do not seem to want to understand that the Defence Force environment is unique. People who receive those payments do not seek to have them paid. They receive them as recompense for their regular movements and the way they are moved around this country and overseas. They are a couple of points in the context of this legislation that I think need to be made very strongly to the Minister for Communications (Mr Beddall), who is at the table, and I hope to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security and, indeed, to the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) and the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Senator Faulkner). I hope that they will be taking notice of what is said and of what the RSL and the Armed Forces Federation of Australia have said and are continuing to say on this very vexing question of what might be seen, and is being seen increasingly, as a very serious infringement of conditions of service. Mr Garland, the National President of the RSL, has addressed these issues in some depth in comments to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin), other ministers and, indeed, some senators. He made a couple of points which, in the brief period I have available to me, I would like to read into the public record. In part, he said this: The RSL is concerned for the welfare of the families of young Service personnel. We have been advised that a plan was launched to include some Service entitlements when calculating income for the purpose of Social Security benefits, particularly levels ""Additional Family Payment"". We have not been advised of the results of the objections to this plan, so we earnestly request that you clearly reject this unfair and unprincipled scheme. The entitlements considered apparently include ... He went on to explore some of the things that the honourable member for Berowra and other members have mentioned here this afternoon. Mr Garland went on to say: This scheme being considered also flies in the acknowledged Government position that the people of the Defence Force are unique. He also talked about the area of rent subsidy and we have heard something of that from the honourable member for Berowra. He continued: ... and education allowanceswhich are paid to a small number because of their movement around the countryare paid to Defence personnel not as a means of income supplementation, wage packaging or tax avoidance; they are disability entitlements. They are provided to assist in overcoming the problems arising from the unique nature of Defence service. He finished by saying: Sailors, Soldiers or Airmen have no right to reject a direction to move to or from a location . . . There is no choice, the Defence Force discipline code takes away these rights which are prized by others. In fact, the Defence Force is the guardian of these freedoms, while sacrificing those rights for themselves. Having extracted some of those comments from a number of people and organisations, I make three points. Firstly, conditions of service as I have just defined them in relation to this legislation were never given by a government of whatever complexion as any sort of tax shelter; they area form of compensation. Secondly, a great majority of people who will be affected by the inclusion of these conditions of service as fringe benefits. for purpose of this legislation are not higher income earners. Thirdly, Defence Force personnel clearly do not negotiate their salary packages; they are somewhat hostages to fortune. I fully support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Berowra. There is, however, another dimension to the problem that concerns me which I place on the public record. I was informed yesterday that certain directions within the defence hierarchy have told people to use the phrase 'clam up on these issues within the Department of Defence'. In fact, I am also told that a particular article in a service newspaper was directed to be withdrawn. So, surely, those relatively small occurrences in themselves are an indictment of what this government is trying to do. We should be working towards some sort of amendment in terms of the definitional side of this legislation, whether it be to exclude the Defence Force, the police and others. As the honourable member for Berowra has said, that is the objective of referring it to an appropriate Senate committee to explore the ramifications of this legislation in a lot more detail. The honourable member for Forde talked about the increase in the fuel tax - nd criticised the opposition. I mentioned betrayal and deceit. I will give another example of that. Twelve months ago in Toowoomba I addressed about 1,000 people who were objecting very strongly to the possibility of old cars being put off the road as a result of some of the policies of this federal government. That was in August. It took me until December to get the minister for the environment and the then minister for land transport to make a joint statement. Categorically, they said that this was a beat-up, that people need not worry and, specifically, that there would not be a differential in terms of petrol pricing. What do we find? Of course there is a differential. Why? Because this government is strapped for money. This is nothing but a crass revenue raising exercise without any regard for the social conscience and social awareness which those on the other side of the House think the they have the reserve on. That is not so. This government should stand condemned and stands condemned.",67
145,Mrs EASSON,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) is a further step along this government's road to greater social justice in Australia. It is a concrete example of the care and commitment that the Keating government has for those Australians who are in need. This bill is the second part of a two-pronged policy of the government. Legislation has already been passed which will improve the position of low income retirees by easing the pensions asset test. This benefit takes effect from 20 September 1993. The bill that we are considering today is the second prong in our policy of easing the lot of low income retirees. It is to introduce a seniors health card, effective from 1 April 1994. The principal help which this card will give is that it will provide for certain older, low income, non-pensioner retirees to· have access to concessional pharmaceutical benefits and hearing aid concessions. Even if they are entitled to only $1 of pension, they will be able to get this seniors card. The department estimates that this initiative will help approximately 200,000 people. This measure is part of a mosaic of assistance to Australian families that has been a central part of the Labor Party's philosophy for over 100 years. This pursuit of social justice has been a central theme for every Labor government-state and federal-since 1891. Indeed, at its most recent federal conference in 1991 the Australian Labor Party reaffirmed this commitment in its platform resolution and rules: Social justice is the ALP's reason for existence. It is a common goal that unites all Party members. Through its objectives, policies and programs, the ALP works to create a fairer society for all. This view of people, and Australia as a community, is not shared by the coalition conservatives opposite. The coalition's concept of social justice places emphasis almost solely on the notion of opportunity. This ideal of individual opportunity appears attractive, but the hidden advantages of some amount to a complete negation of opportunity being free competition for all. Is there anyone in this chamber who would attest that the freedom of individual opportunity applies equally to the son of a judge and an Aboriginal girl? Of course there is no equality of opportunity. This lack of equality, brought about by economic and social structures, is exactly what motivates the ALP in public life. The coalition conservatives opposite are not concerned at all with this lack of equality. That is exactly what motivates them in public life. Advocates of the coalition conservatives' position view wealth and power as ultimately individual in character. They advocate that society should be organised in such a way as to give individuals the maximum amount of choice and licence in attaining it. In their view, the best way to achieve social justice under such a model is to let an unrestrained - arket have its way with resources and with people's lives. The fole of government in such a set-up is very small. That is the view of the coalition conservatives opposite, and especially that of their most effective campaigner, Senator Bronwyn Bishop. In Australia this approach to life and society is given support by certain media and academic circles. Their insistence that Australia follow a path of ever decreasing concern for real people in pursuit of the mythical land of the world-beating economy was rejected by the people of Australia on 13 March. An economic system that actively promotes a widening gap between the rich and the poor is one that verges on barbarism. This government will not follow this course. There is no doubt that had the coalition conservatives won the last election we would not now be debating this measure. To its credit, the coalition never disguised its hostile intentions towards those in Australia less fortunate than itself. Had it won, the 200,000 Australians who benefit from this measure would not be getting this access to pharmaceutical benefits and hearing aid concessions. Soon we will be presented with a health bill which will also incorporate the dental changes for senior citizens, making this a very worthwhile card. The coalition's hostile framework is the very opposite to the social norm that prevails in Australia today. Legislation, such as this bill, is expected and appreciated by Australians. We want a cooperative Australia where the weak are not victimised by their circumstances and the strong. The coalition wants an Australia where the weak, the less well placed and the poor are all flesh for the Frankenstein monster of its ideology. People in the community, outside of parliament, should be constantly aware of the serious differences that exist between this Labor government and the conservative coalition opposite. These differences are not the ordinary day-today political ups and downs. I mean the major differences that affect all Australians who see the need for a restraining hand to be used towards those who abuse their wealth or position and a helping hand to be used to help those who are in genuine need. I am sure that each and every one of the 200,000 Australians who will benefit from this seniors health card will be delighted to receive it. Yet I am also sure that many of those people are voters for the conservative coalition. These people will enjoy the use of this card, see it as a right and a proper measure of good government activity, and yet in 1996 perhaps go out and vote for a conservative coalition which will take this away from them at the first opportunity. This lack of clarity in seeing the true colours of the coalition conservatives is a very dangerous situation for these people to put themselves into. How much better for Australians to look carefully at the real differences between this government and the conservative coalition opposite and then decide whether they want an Australia which is divided in competition or an Australia which is united in cooperation. In making this decision, people should remember that the rich and powerful always win every competition. Those who are not rich and powerful always do well out of social cooperation. Besides the seniors health card, this legislapreviously tion seeks to remove an anomaly associated with a smaIl number of families receiving income from overseas in foreign currency. The purpose of these particular amendments is to ensure that families with a foreign income are not unfairly advantaged compared with other families with a similar level of income. Social justice requires that the government be constantly looking to see that its resources, which help the needy, do reach the needy. This biII will not affect families receiving income support payments because such payments are not subject to the family payment income test. (Quorum formed) It is very important at this point to be clear about a very necessary distinction. There are two vital social security groupings: income assistance payment and income support payment. Assistance payments are given to help parents and others meet the cost of raising children. The family payment is the principal example of an assistance payment. Support payment, on the other hand, is generaIly a person's sole source of income. The pension is the principal example of a support payment. Due to reasons of administrative practicality, taxable income has been the traditional method for determining family payment income testing. Thus, payment of this assistance money has been subject to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. Due to anomalies, some foreign income is not assessable as 'income' for the purposes of the 1936 act. Thus, this biII seeks to take into account this foreign money in assessing what· assistance money can be paid to families in Australia. No-one in this House would be keen to see the government misuse its resources to spend money where it is not needed. This biII empowers the department to target more accurately the real needs of the community. This targeting is entirely consistent with the Labor Party philosophy of social justice and equity. This bill seeks to extend to 31 December 1994 the advance payments of the pharmaceutical allowance. This payment was introduced in November 1990 to offset the introduction of a charge for pharmaceutical benefits for people who have received prescriptions free under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. At that time, as an interim measure, advance payments of the aIlowance were introduced to assist pensioners of limited means, with high pharmaceutical requirements, to adjust to the changes in the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Those pensioners eligible were then able to receive lump sum advances of the pharmaceutical aIlowance, rather than receive it fortnightly with their pension. This compassionate arrangement will now continue until 31 December 1994. I said at the outset that the Keating government was one of 'care and commitment'. This truth was accepted during the last election, and is the guiding truth which leads this government. We are all aware of the many problems, social and economic, which affect our country, and the problems of other countries with which we can reasonably compare ourselves. In the face of these problems, the Australian people can be confident that we in the Labor Party will not panic and will not throw the nation onto a social scrap heap in pursuit of a phoney economic solution. In the final analysis, we are a society of living and breathing human beings. We are not things; we are not mere resources. We have lives, and we have hopes for our future. The Australian people expect to be treated with care, commitment and respect by their government. Whilst the Labor Party provides that government, they will receive, in full measure, care, commitment and respect. I commend the bill to the House.",70
146,Mr BRADFORD,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"The honourable member for Lowe (Mrs Easson) is crying crocodile tears for the people that her government has affected. The other day, when she was speaking on the effect of unrealised capital gains on pensioners' share portfolios, she indicated her concern, but when she had the opportunity to stand up and be counted she would not cross the 1100r. If she is concerned about the poor and disadvantaged people in our society, I challenge her to show that she is a person of integrity when we vote on the opposition's amendment later this afternoon. The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) has some commendable features. As the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) has said, the opposition is not opposed to the general thrust of the bill. However, we have moved an amendment which I will strongly support. I emphasise that the opposition is quite happy about the fact that the government is taking some fringe benefits into account in the income test for family payments, the parental income test for jobsearch allowance, and sickness allowance claimants under the age of 18. As our amendment indicates, there are some people who are particularly adversely affected by these changes, and we are asking the government to review those particular aspects. On a number of occasions I have encountered difficulties where taxable income has not been adequate in determining the eligibility for a number of benefits-Austudy is one that comes to mind-because of the various opportunities that particularly self-employed people have of circumventing that r-quire­ ment by taking income in fringe benefits. It is a positive step to take foreign income into account in the income tests for family payments. The opposition supports the introduction of the sen,iors card as proposed in this legislation. I strongly support the making of foreign currency provisions in the Social Security Act more responsive to market exchange rates. I have had many pensioners who are getting benefits from overseas, and who have been adversely affected by the way those calculations are. done. I applaud the initiative that has been taken to make them more responsive to market exchange rates. Although the opposition has not been opposed to this, I am not personally convinced of the restrictions that are being placed on the family payment. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) in his second reading speech stated: The bill provides that on I January 1994, the income ceiling limit for basic family payment for families with one child will be reduced from $64,938 to $60,000. The additional amount allowed for each extra child will be reduced ... Mr Ruddock-That would be in another bill. It is not in this bill.",72
147,Mr BRADFORD,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"It is not in this bill. The parliamentary secretary did foreshadow that. I am not particularly happy about that. It might sound like a lot of money, but it is not. What concerns me about this continual tightening up of eligibility for family allowance is that it really underlines how far this sort of assistance has moved away from its original purpose. The family payment is now regarded as welfare. It was never intended to be welfare. When child endowment was introduced, which is what it was originally called, it was a recognition of the importance of children to our society. It was an encouragement for people to have children. It was a recognition of how much it cost to bring up children. Somebody told me the other day that it cost about $500,000 to raise a child from birth to maturity. I did not want to think too much about it as I have three young children. That is a horrifying thought to anyone, especially to those with young children. The point is that it does cost a lot of money. As originally implemented, child endowment was a recognition of that fact. It seems that the government has totally lost sight of that fact. The family payment is now being regarded as welfare and, in that sense, targeted on the same criterion as welfare is, and ought to be, targeted. I believe that we are losing sight of what family assistance really ought to be about. As the amendment points out, we are not declining to support this bill at its second reading stage, but we condemn the government for not protecting the interests of low income families, the elderly and the disadvantaged. There is no doubt in my mind when we talk about families-low income families in particular-that the Australian Labor Party has progressively destroyed families. When we look back over the last 10 years we see a constant and consistent anti-family bias in almost all the legislation that has come through this parliament. When I talk of families-in a moment I will come to what the Labor Party thinks a family is-I tend to think of traditional families. I am prepared to accept that there are variations on that theme these days. Many are quite acceptable variations, in my view. Single parent families are a fact of life for many reasons. It is regrettable that there are so many single parent families. Mr Ruddock-Widows, widowers.",73
148,Mr BRADFORD,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Widows, widowers. They are unavoidably single parent families. It ought to be a matter of great regret that - h,?ost. one million child.ren these days are hvmg m a one-parent famIly. That is not ideal and ought to be discouraged. The tax system, and all the other laws we implement, ought to be aimed at supporting families and keeping traditional families together. That is not overlooking the fact that there are single parent families. Whether that has occurred inadvertently or unfortunately, they all need recognition. I am not sure how far the Labor Party intends to go with its definition of families. The vast majority of families are traditional families-a man, a wife and one, two or three children or 2.25 children whatever it happens to be at the moment. ' It has all been downhill. The previous Labor government really set the whole thing in train with the Family Law Act. The late Lionel Murphy created many problems for us as a result of that. I am not advocating here, or anywhere else, a return to pre-1975 per se, but I do not think members in this place woul- not have constantly encountered, when back m their electorates, concern from either a husband or a wife about the fact that divorce has become so easy that it has led to a breakdown in families. The divorce rate has skyrocketed. We are all aware of the statistics regarding the increase in the divorce rate in this country. That need not be so. We should get back to the causes. We should recognise financial hardship as a cause of marital disharmony. Governments can do something about that. They can develop policies and laws and introduce tax systems which make life easier for traditional families rather than more difficult. I am homing in on the issue of child support. I believe that the tax system should be used to support families. We should recognise that children are worthwhile. They are not chattels, they are not things; they are intrinsically worthwhile and have benefits for our society. We ought to encourage people to have children in traditional relationships. In my view we ought to encourage people to get married in the first place. It has been recognised that the spate of violent child murders and the amount of violence that generally exists almost all occur in the context of de facto relationships or in the broader context of a dysfun-tional family. The connection is so obvious that it probably does not need to be stated, but it is a fact, and we need to recognise it. This government should be recognising it. When we look back over the last 10 years and view what has happened to traditional families, we can see that society has continued to degenerate-one step at a time. It is about time the government started to look at family impact statements in respect of every still piece of legislation. We have environmental impact statements and financial implication statements. I believe we ought to get to the bottom line with every piece of legislation that comes before the parliament and ask the fundamental question: what effect will this have on the family? There could not be"" a more important question asked about any piece of legislation. I strongly support our amendment. It condemns the government for not protecting the interests of low income families in particular. That debate has been going on and continued in question time today with the government trying to circumvent the truth. Under this budget-whether it be mark 1,2 or 3, which are yet to come-the government cannot deny that low income families are adversely affected at almost every tum, whether it be in the price of fuel or the increase in the wholesale sales tax. There is no compensation for low income families other than a very meagre figure of $150, or whatever it happens to be. lt is of no use the government talking about what it is doing for middle income families. Today the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) trotted out figures for people on or about average weekly earnings-something over $30,000, or $600 per week now. Mr Bruce Scott-Rich mates.",74
149,Mr BRADFORD,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"They may not be rich, but they are certainly better off than somebody on $20,000 per year. People on that sort of income level are very much worse off under this budget. If any honourable member on the government side can bring out some figures to show otherwise, I for one would be very happy to listen. We have all been inundated with letters condemning the government. The majority of letters I am getting in my electorate are from people who voted Labor at the last election. Fortunately, the majority of people in my electorate did not vote Labor at the last election, I hasten to add. The vast majority of people in my electorate voted for me at the last election. I bring to the attention of the House a letter from a constituent of mine at Kirra on the Gold Coast, which says it better than I can: I am most indignant with the about face perfonnance of our Labour Government led by Prime Minister Keating. This Government was returned to power by rubbishing the need for G.S.T and for the impost of additional taxes. At the same time it also pledged tax cuts ... These are the l-a-w tax cuts. Mr Bruce Scott-L-i-e.",74
150,Mr BRADFORD,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"As we know, those tax cuts turned out to be a l-i-e. The letter continues: At the same time it /!lso pledged tax cuts which were to be fully funded by the improving ? economy. These tax cuts would not require the imposition of additional taxes etc. This person does not tell me how old he or she is. I am having a little difficulty with the writing, so I gather this letter has been written by a fairly elderly person. A lot of people in my electorate are retired. But this is the crunch: Four months later they increase taxes (petrol, tax etc)and did a few other things which I need not go intoThey won Government on false pretences and lies. The government certainly did that, and there is no doubt about it in the electorate at large. My constituent signs: Yours (with anger) A Truewhich has been crossed out and replaced withNon Believer. I think that says it pretty well. All honourable members would have received letters like this from their constituents. Dozens of such letters have been coming in and they are mostly from people who were true believers-low income people, disadvantaged people and the elderly. Mr Bruce Scott-Good election material for us.",75
151,Mr BRADFORD,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"It is excellent. In fact, we might use this at the next election. We will get some of these people to come out and tell us how, prior to the 1993 election, they were true believers and now they have become non-believers because of the way that this government has treated them. These people-the elderly in particular-have been conned. Look at the amount of broken promises with which they have been confronted. I do not know how government members can stand up and face these people. When the Minister for Communications (Mr Beddall) goes back to his Brisbane based electorate and walks down the street in Inala or wherever, what will he say when, for example, an elderly person comes up to him and says, 'What about when you said that I, as a pensioner, would not have to pay any tax beyond 1995' or 'What about the extension of dental care that I was promised'? Mr Beddall-They are going to get it.",75
152,Mr BRADFORD,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"The government promised it at a point in time and then put it back. All of these people were conned into voting for the government, and they are now telling us that they very much regret that they were sales conned. I have spoken enough in this place about the pensioner shares fiasco. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security is not here and I do not want to go over the argument again. But at least there is a glimmer of light, although it is only a glimmer, because we have the beginning of a backdown by the government, which has now said that it will undertake a review of that particular legislation. That does not help pensioners. It probably makes things more difficult for them in a way because many have already sold their shares because of what was in the offing. Other pensioners do not know whether to sell their shares before 23 September. They may well be caught subsequently and lose their pension because of the government's absolutely obnoxious intention to take account of unrealised or notional gains on their share portfolios. That is just another slap in the face pensioners with shares. This matter has been debated in this place on six occasions that I can remember and now the government backs down a little and says, 'We are going to review it'. That might sound hopeful, but I am not sure that it will be terribly helpful in the end. In fact, it may end up confusing the pensioners who have shares. The governinent has created a society of haves and have-nots all the way down the line. Government members get l,lP here and trumpet their concerns about equity, social justice and all of these little catchphrases we love to hear from the Labor Party. But when it comes to action, we see exactly the opposite. We now have in Australia-more than at any time in our history and totally contrary to what the government tries to hold out-the haves and the have-nots. That is most evident these days in those who have a job and those who do not have a job-the million or so unemployed. What hope has the government held out for them? Our amendment condemns the government on its treatment of the disadvantaged. Who could be more disadvantaged than those million or so unemployedparticularly the 300,000 who have been unemployed for more than 12 months, or the many tens of thousands who have been unemployed for so long that they will never get a job again? The union movement, of course, does not care about the unemployed. It is still living in a totally unreal world, going into bat for wages and conditions for those who have jobs but in practice showing no concern at all for those who do not have jobs. The union q10vement does not care one jot about them. It will continue to fight for unrealistic pay increases for those who have jobs and could not care less about those - ho do not I strongly support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Berowra. We condemn the government for not protecting the interests of low income families, the elderly and the disadvantaged. Although there are not many government members present, I invite them, if they have the opportunity for later, to vote in favour of this amendment and at least show their constituents that they are prepared to stand up because those members must be under a lot of pressure. Indeed, I will be interested to hear what the honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) has to say. What are her constituents saying to her well about this budget? I cannot wait to hear. (Time expired)",75
153,Ms HENZELL,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Cl;lpricornia) (5.16 p.m.)I rise to support the second reading of the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill and to speak most strongly against the amendment moved by the opposition. I have been that absolutely fascinated to hear the comments of the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford). I will certainly be delighted to tell him what my constituents have been saying. The honourable member talks about that wonderful halcyon time-which he may still be cocooned in-of the nuclear family: a man, his wife and two kids, with everyone sitting at home and the wife washing the socks, doing the shopping and looking after the children. This is a dream and an illusion. It is fairly important for the honourable member to take note that the world has moved on in the last 20 years. I am one of those terribly conservative, traditional people who are still in that nuclear family unit of a man, a wife and two children-somewhat radicalised by my move into this place. But the fact of the matter is that what we might consider a family structure is no longer typical. The notion that somehow the government is to blame for these changes is an absolute nonsense. In the last 25 years we have had nothing short of a social revolution. Women's expectations have changed irreversibly. Women have voted with their feet away from the sort of scenario that, the honourable member is clinging onto. That is one of the reasons why women voted for the Australian Labor Party at the last election. We put forward a total package that supported women in their various attempts to achieve independence. If the opposition wishes to regain anything like that constituency, it will have to revolutionise thinking, otherwise it will be trapped in a time warp of the 1950s. We have shown that we are prepared to develop a flexible approach. We have moved with the times and, in this time of extremely difficult social change, we have provided an awareness of and a response to what women are looking for. My colleagues the honourable member for Lowe (Mrs Easson) and the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford) have also highlighted the fact that women are clearly concerned about women's health, violence against women and support for families. The Labor government has the runs on the board for women and support for families. There is no way that we can support the opposition's amendment. If the honourable member for MCPherson wishes to be re-elected next time around, he will have to grasp the nettle",76
154,Mr SLIPPER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,Haven't you seen his margin? It is getting bigger and bigger.,77
155,Ms HENZELL,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"If he continues to have these incredibly conservative, traditionalist, head-in-the-sand views about family life while the rest of us are marching towards the next century, then women will desert him in droves. It is terribly important that the ourable member for MCPherson catches up with what has happened in the last 25 years. Effectively, the opposition has no policy position. Its policies have been jettisoned and it is fluffing around trying to find new ones. The problem for us in dealing with the opposition is that all it can do is be negative and vandalise the parliamentary process. The opposition was not happy 'with our budget, but when we showed that we are flexible and prepared to be responsive to the concerns of the community, that was not good enough for it. Members of the opposition are amazingly good at holding up pieces of paper and waving them in the air. (Quorum formed) As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted, members of the opposition are very good at waving things around in this chamber. We have seen them waving faxes. We saw the honourable member for MCPherson with a letter that he was waving around. Every its question time they wave bits of paper. They are very good at that. The other evening, the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) was waving the front page of my local newspaper, the Rockhampton Morning Bulletin, with a picture of me on it. In the previous day's issue, the Leader of the National Party was on the front page. While I cannot wave that around-I would not do that to the House-believe me, it was a sight. He was photographed riding a bicycle-I should add that he was wearing a helmet, and I thought that was excellent-but it seems that the only way that the Leader of the National Party can make the front page is to ride a bicycle. The Leader of the National Party was swanning in and out of my electorate during the election campaign, telling the constituents in Capricornia how his candidate was going to win that seat. He was wrong about that, just as he is wrong about many things. I imagine his future will inevitably lie in swanning around the country, riding bikes in Capricornia, getting on planes, but being totally irrelevant. The Leader of the National Party only read the headline from the piece of paper that he hon- was waving in the House the other evening, which read 'Under Siege'. However, in the body of the article, it was reported that I had had the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) come up to the electorate to discuss the budget, and there followed a very effective appraisal of the visit. For all the concern and distress that the. opposition tells us about, let me assure honourable members that there was no insurrection in the streets of Capricornia. A number of people came along to discuss the budget, and they were very pleased to have the opportunity to consult with members of the government and to express their point of view. I am delighted to see that some of their concerns have been addressed by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins). A lot of this has been a beat-up by the media. As we all know, a week is a long time in politics but at the end of the day",77
156,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,Mr Newell)Order! I ask the honourable member for Capricornia to address her remarks to the bill.,78
157,Ms HENZELL,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"This bill provides effective targeting of social security payments and the very important extension of the seniors health card to non-pensioner retirees. It is an example of the kind of integrated package of social welfare measures for which our government has a great and proud record. This one small bill is just part of a huge social justice package. The honourable member for MCPherson bagged the idea of social justice but we could say that members of the opposition have suddenly become born-again bleeding hearts. The opposition has found a social conscience, which is absolutely astonishing for a would be government that was going to slash Medicare, slash funding right across the board, and give us the GST that we had to have. But the electorate did not want that and will not want it in the future. The opposition needs to find itself some policies, otherwise its vandalism of the government's legislative program will become clear to the electorate. Basically, the electorate wants good economic management and a good government, and for that reason we will shortly find that the furore over the budget will die down. This particular bill is part of an integrated package which includes a number of measures which are important to our social justice initiatives. They include a $3 a week increase in the newstart allowance, which will impact on 285,000 single adults; the home care child allowance, which will provide income support for 840,000 families; improved rent assistance; and 500,000 places in labour market programs at a cost of $1.3 billion. Another important measure is the community activity programs designed to encourage people to have better work experience. We know that there are difficulties with unemployment. We have not walked away from that. We are attempting to provide for the long-tenn unemployed and, at the same time, social security provides a safety net for families experiencing these difficulties. This government is not walking away from these issues and we will not be deflected from our social justice initiatives. We are providing 1,650 new places in NElS for unemployed people to set up their own businesses. We are contributing $141 million to provide help for people whose first language is not English. The list is endless. There is the extension of the dental programs, and I am delighted to see that the optometry program has been reintegrated into our package. One of the many reasons why women voteMr Bruce Scott-That is called a double backflip. Mr Ruddock-With pike.",78
158,Ms HENZELL,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,It is calledMs Crawford-Listening.,78
159,Ms HENZELL,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,Listening and being responsive to the electorate. Mr Ruddock-It is called knee-jerk.,78
160,Ms HENZELL,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"There are many physical analogies. I have yet to see the honourable member for Berowra doing any sort of physical jerks, but anyway, we will have to wait and see.",78
161,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,Mr Newell)Order! The honourable member will not respond to interjections.,78
162,Ms HENZELL,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"One of the important issues is the child-care initiatives that women have voted for. The importance for women to have child care is absolutely crucial to their opportunities to work and participate fully in the community. Obviously, the need is still not being met, but the government has made a huge commitment to this issue and is fulfilling its commitment. The nonsense that we are not keeping to our promises is exactly that: a nonsense. The seniors health card, which is the particular issue dealt with in this bill, which will be introduced from 1 July 1994, will give 200,000 people access to phannaceutical benefits, hearing aids, dental care and optometry services under Medicare. We are prepared to support families, children and our older retired citizens. It is an integrated package, it is an important package and we are very proud of it. When the difficulties that we are experiencing in the media and the vandalising by the opposition of our legislative program are overcome, I believe the electorate is going to see that we do have a sound program and an economically responsible budget that will ultimately be to the benefit of the electorate. When that becomes clear, that will be indicated in the polls and we will see that this government will hold its nerve and get on with the job of good government in spite of the difficulties being put before it by the house of review-the Senate-where, we have to say absolutely and clearly, the opposition is providing the difficulty. Those opposite do not want to get on with the business of government because they do not have any policies to offer the electorate. All they can do is be destructive. That is what we are going to see from them and, unfortunately, that is going to be Mr Ruddock-This no policy line won't wash. What people did know is that we had policies.",78
163,Ms HENZELL,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"The problem, unfortunately,is that the electorate did not like the policies. I respectfully suggest to the honourable member for Berowra that he do some rethinking and provide some alternatives. Those opposite should not just be vandals to the legislative program of the duly elected government. I believe that, when our legislation is allowed to pass through this chamber and the Senate-as it undoubtedly will, because spoilers in the end are not popular people-we will be able to get on with the business of good government. I think that we have a long way to go. This government is going to forge ahead with its election commitments. We have delivered on the tax cuts. We have delivered over our 10 years in government and also in this legislative program to low income earners, to families in particular, and to women and children. I hope that the previous speaker, the honourable member for MCPherson, will go out and look at this government's social justice initiatives on women and educate himself on these vital issues, otherwise he is going to be lost in the rush. Women have voted with their feet, they are out there in the work force, they are challenging all the old assumptions about what their place is. In relation to this, I am delighted to see in the House new women members representing both sides of the political spectrum most effectively. I commended the honourable member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) last night on her maiden speech. I also take the opportunity to commend her on the question she asked in the House today. I think it is clear that the electorate is very keen about and responsive to the idea of women members in the federal parliament. That is an issue that will not be put aside and I am delighted to see my colleagues on both sides of the House showing their commitment to social justice. I would like to commend the members on this side who have spoken, the honourable member for Lowe and the honourable member for Forde, in this respect.",79
164,Mr FILING,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"The honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) mentioned the honourable member for Lowe (Mrs Easson). The honourable member for Lowe came into this chamber and indicated that she had concerns about the changes to the social security legislation that would bring about the deeming of unrealised capital gain on shares owned by pensioners for the purposes of the income test. Yet, did she cross the floor? ,Did she follow her conscience? Of course she did not. In the end, she did not have the strength of purpose to cross the floor and support the amendments proposed by the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) which would have effectively withdrawn those provisions that are so badly affecting those people who find that, after niaking sacrifices during their working lives to save for retirement-being in the position of owning shares and also receiving a pension income-the unrealised capital gain on their shares is being assessed for the purposes of the income test for the age pension. My understanding is that that is one of the first times we have ever seen an unrealised capital gain being assessed as being of value for the purpose of reducing the age pension. The honourable member for Capricornia, who has left the· chamber, mentioned the polls. I was tempted by the provocative way in which she mentioned the polls to rush out and get a copy of the Bulletin. If one looks at the AGB MCNair poll in today's Bulletin, one sees that the coalition has risen in the polls 46 per cent as opposed to the Labor government's 39 per cent. In fact, the positions of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) as preferred Prime Minister are more or less the same. To my way of thinking, if that is not an indication of the great change that has occurred as a result of this ad hoc budget making on the run, then I do not know what is. The honourable member for Capricomia talked about the polls reflecting what has been occurring. If she were to look at her copy of today's Bulletin which would have arrived in her office, she would know only too well that in fact these polls indicate very clearly the problems that have been associated with the Labor government's lack of policy direction. The increase in the standing of the coalition reflects the enormous concern in the community about the apparent lack of policy direction of the Labor government. She also talked about NElS, the new enterprise incentive scheme. I campaigned very vigorously in Western Australia to have NElS enlarged because of the enormous concern being felt by those participants in the new enterprise incentive scheme conducted in Western Australia. Many of those participants were proposing to take out quite substantial loans and make substantial commitments to those business ideas that they were using as part of the new enterprise incentive scheme. At that stage, all the indications were that the number of places available under NElS was going to be reduced. It was thanks to the vigorous campaign that was undertaken by those people in the new enterprise scheme in Western Australia-and, I might add, the state Liberal government that supported them-that the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley) obviously managed to find those extra places and provide for an increase in places. But this was achieved with some changes to the assessment of the business programs that are to be submitted by those participating in the new enterprise scheme. I tum to the legislation and the amendment which we are debating this afternoon, and I to would like to commend once again the honourable member for Berowra for taking a very vigorous opposition stand in relation to the bill. His amendment is quite clear. It states: ... whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House: (1) condemns the government for not protecting the interests of low income families, the elderly and the disadvantaged; and (2) calls on the government to review its proposal to include as employer provided fringe benefits in the enhanced income test for family payments, those benefits, which are provided as a condition of service or employment in non-metropolitan and special areas in particular, having particular regard to the circumstances faced by members of the defence forces and their families. As a person who comes from the largest state in the Commonwealth, I have very serious concerns about those changes and the likely effects on the eligibility for the family additional payment. This concern relates to those people who are in remote areas and to those people who are employed as personnel in the Australian Defence Force whether they reside in my electorate, or throughout Western Australia and elsewhere in the Commonwealth. I bring to the attention of the House the changes that are likely to be brought about by this legislation. The opposition's concerns about this legislation relate to whether the bill was intended to include defence benefits and allowances; whether the conditions of service are intended to make up for the difficulties or disadvantages inherent in service life; and the wider implications of employers providing fringe benefits as part of conditions of service to compensate for remoteness and other employment related difficulties. The income is to include non-monetary income, such as employer-provided, low interest loans and subsidised health insurance. If rental subsidy is included in the test, it will effectively push most lower income Defence Force families over the income tax threshold. It is my sincere belief that rental subsidies should not be seen as part of the Defence Force salary package. This subsidy of course ceases when members obtain their own house in the posting locality. It has long been realised that Defence Force families suffer disabilities because of their residential mobility. Rental subsidies should not be seen as hidden income but as compensation where frequent relocation is a required condition of service. As somebody who grew up in a service family, I know only too well of the problems of this constant relocation and the mobility required of those members and their families of the Australian Defence Force. Of course, whether or not it was intended, the threat to the family additional payment to those members of the ADF who may be affected is a matter of serious concern, because the geographic mobility required in Defence Force employment can have significant effects on family life. The most notable of those is that children may be forced to change schools regularly. Spouses who are also employed may have difficulty gaining transfers or finding alternative employment. I will give an example of a posting cycle that is mentioned in the case of a major in the ADF. At one stage, he had lived in 11 houses in 16 years. One of his children in seven years had attended five primary schools in five states as well as in PNG, and the second child had attended four schools in four states in five years. As I have mentioned, from my experience as a member of an ADF family, that is a serious concern for those members of the ADF. There are very substantial sacrifices required on the of ADF members as part of their duties, which of course include being able to be deployed throughout the Commonwealth and throughout those areas where the ADF is in fact stationed. The Cross report, entitled Personnel wastage in the Australian Defence Force, found: ADF salaries must remain fiercely competitive the all-volunteer force is to attract and retain suitable personnel. But the measure being proposed by the government would substantially affect the remuneration which ADF members receive. What must be realised in this case is the specialisation of military employment. There is the need to be on call at all times and to work long and irregular hours; the need to live and work in uncomfortable conditions, short of those situations for which separate provision has been made; and the general turbulence in postings to the extent that such disruptions are not compensated in current allowance. I refer to a letter that was published by the National President of the Returned Services League of Australia. The RSL said that it was concerned for the welfare of the families of young service personnel. The letter states: We have been advised that a plan was launched to include some Service entitlements when calculating income for the purpose of Social Security benefits, particularly"" Additional Family Payment"". The letter went on to say: The Government already recoups from the Department of Defence Fringe Benefits Tax on Rental and Home Purchase assistance allowances; the scheme would be unfair ""double dipping"". Any change to housing loans could be a reduction of entitlements from War Service. Allowances to assist in the education of children of Defence personnel are also apparently being considered. These allowances should not be considered as income in calculating"" Additional family Payments"" (AFP). The president concluded in the penultimate paragraph: This scheme being considered also flies in the acknowledged Government position that the people of the Defence Force are unique. 1 must say that, as a person who has a number of defence ADF personnel resident in my part electorate, I take great exception to any provisions in the legislation that may reduce what are already acknowledged as being pretty paltry conditions of salaryasa result of service in the ADF. As part of the opposition's approach to this particular legislation, it is going to move in the Senate that the matter be referred to the if Standing Committee on Community Affairs for inquiry and report. The terms of reference state: 'All aspects of the Social Security Legislation Bill (No.2) 1993 taking certain employer provided fringe benefits into account in the income test for family payment and the parental income test for job search allowance and sickness allowance recipients of claimants under 18, and in particular: whether the Bill was intended to benefits and allowances; whether conditions of service are intended to make up for the disadvantages or difficulties inherent in service life; the wider implications of employers providing fringe benefits as part of conditions of service to compensate for remoteness and other employment related difficulties. I commend that particular action as being a quite sensible way of looking at the implications of this abhorrent legislation. As I have mentioned earlier, as someone who has a number of ADF personnel resident in my electorate, this would give the opportunity for those who are affected to have their say. It will make sure that those ADF personnel likely to be affected by the extent of this legislation are in fact given a reprieve. Much has been said, both in the community and elsewhere, about the regressive elements of the federal budget. I think that we have to compare what has occurred within this parliament in recent days with the preparation, the research and the development that the coalition put into its policies for government at the federal election in March this year. It is ironic, indeed, that we were criticised at the time for having perhaps too substantial a policy to present to the community and that our policy perhaps should have been much more generalised or been a statement of principles. I can recall criticism on many occasions in this chamber of the Leader of the Opposition-in many cases, it was made in a sneering and condescending way-for being honest. I can recall his being criticised at one stage for being innexible. Then we have the ultimate humiliation of a Prime Minister and a Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) seeing their budget knocked and buffeted around by the innuences in various parts of the spectrum of politics to the extent where they have virtually had to have a budget on the run, subject to negotia.tion on a daily basis. At one stage Senator Richardson commented on that very enlightening program Labor in Power on the ABC that the Prime Minister was now the most powerful Prime Minister in Labor history; that he was highly powerful as a result of the circumstances that include Defence brought him into power.",79
165,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,Mr Newell)Order! I ask the honourable member for Moore to bring his comments to the issue under debate.,82
166,Mr FILING,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Mr Deputy Speaker, my comments are strictly relevant to the bill because the principal criticism of the legislation that has been presented to us is this ad hoc nature of policy making on the part of the government. I am trying to show in my remarks relating to Senator Richardson's comments that, far from being in a position of having a proper program of legislation, as one would expect from this so-called all powerful Prime Minister as indicated by Senator Richardson, we find ourselves faced day after day with the ad hoc policy making and, as I mentioned earlier, the budget on the run being subject to changes daily. Mr Lieberman-Which budget?",82
167,Mr FILING,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Which budget, as my colleague quite rightly points out. This is a regressive budget as the biggest gains go to the highest income earners. Single income families in the top 10 per cent of earners without a child gain $20.68 per week. Single income families in the bottom 20 per cent of earners with a child gain only $1.36 a week. I refer to the comments of Dr Neil Warren on yesterday'S PM program. He was very critical of the Treasury assumptions which we have been debating in recent times. We also had questions relating to this in question time today. The Treasury model assumes that all petrol is unleaded petrol and that there is no impact on the cost of cars. It has not taken into account, as it should have, bracket creep, especially after all the budget measures have been taken into account.",82
168,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"For the second time, I ask the honourable member for Moore to bring his comments back to the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill.",82
169,Mr FILING,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,lam speaking to the amendment that was moved by the honourable member for Berowra.,82
170,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,I am aware of that.,83
171,Mr FILING,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"If you refer to the first part of the amendment, it condemns the government for not protecting the interests of low income families, the elderly and the disadvantaged. To be honest with you, I cannot see that the comments I have made are irrelevant. The overall impact of the budget provisions clearly disadvantage low income earners, particularly families, the elderly and the disadvantaged. The budget changes are regressive because those on higher incomes are the net beneficiaries of the budget. Having a large number of families in my electorate, and having listened very intently to the oft repeated dribble from honourable members on the other side of the chamber about how much they consider themselves to be the guardians of the conscience of the working class, I find it very difficult to understand how they can support legislation which effectively militates against the interests of the most vulnerable section of the community-the elderly, the pensioners, the disadvantaged and low income earners with families. It is a truth that since 1983 a single income family with children has effectively had its tax burden doubled. On the demographic information recently released from the Bureau of Statistics, my electorate would have to have the highest concentration of fa-i1ies with children. I find the budget provisions not only abhorrent but immoral. If it is not the role of this parliament to protect the interests of low income earners with families, those who are raising children at a substantial financial disadvantage in many cases, then I do not know what our role is. In my duty as a legislator, as a member of this chamber, having to listen day after day to honourable members opposite, including the honourable member for Capricornia who spoke before me, I find it galling that somehow they still believe they are representing the interests of those people in the most vulnerable section of our community. Those are the very people who require the protection of the members of this chamber and of the Senate. If this is what Labor represents in the 1990s, if this is the light on the hill in the 1990s-the opinion poll results bear this out to a certain extent-it is high time that the Australian community looked away from those people who have misled them, who have mistreated them, who have had their hands in their pockets for so long and who have betrayed them so badly in this latest provision of the Budget.",83
172,Mr LIEBERMAN,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I support the second reading amendment argued so ably by the shadow minister, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), and the previous speaker, the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing), to the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1993. Last week I visited two of the Army bases in my electorate of Indi-Bandiana and Bonegilla-and spoke with many serving army personnel. On any other visit, or in my association with the defence forces throughout Australia over many years, I have never seen or witnessed such concern, anguish and anger from the members of the Defence Force as a result of the budget and the way in which the economy has been adversely affecting them. They told me there was an incredible and increasing number of members of the defence forces who were relying more and more on social security support. That is a matter that has to be evaluated. I think it bears scrutiny. As a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, it is a matter that I intend to pursue in the interests of good government in Australia. It is remarkable that people who take up careers in the defence forces of this nation are becoming increasingly reliant on social security to make ends meet, to provide for their families and to try to mi\ke up to their families for the substantial disruption that occurs because of the nature of their careers. Many of the members have to undertake shifts throughout Australia and other parts of the world. It is not uncommon to find an ordinary soldier who has already had 13 or 14 shifts with his family and may have another four or five before he leaves the army. The disruption to families is substantial and has a huge impact. There are many hidden factors that are not recognised. In these enlightened days of people being treated equally and without discrimination in employment and other important elements of our society, if a spouse of a permanent member of the Defence Force applies for a job in Albury-Wodonga and she is as equally qualified as other applicants, when it is discovered that the spouse belongs to a member of the defence forces it is more likely than not that that person will not get the job. It is not that the person is not suitable or well qualified; it is simply that the employer knows that the nature of the job assumes that the family might be moving on in three or four years time, sometimes less. I guess it is human nature that an employer who is looking for someone to fit into the organisation, perhaps to undergo training and take part in the enterprise, will give an edge to someone who is more likely to remain in the community for a longer period. That is just one example of the sorts of problems Defence Force families have. This legislation is an attempt to impose fringe benefits tax on some of the small but very important incentive payments available to Defence Force personnel. So rent subsidies that help families cope with transfers from one part of Australia to another or to overseas postings will attract the vigour of this legislation. I have grave concerns about the government's lack of recognition of the problems of Defence Force people and their families. I ask the government to embrace the principles of the amendment and review the proposal that the shadow minister for social security, the honourable member for Berowra, so ably put forward: ... to include as employer provided fringe benefits in the enhanced income test for family payments, those benefits, which are provided as a condition of service ... in non-metropolitan and special areas in particular. . . regard to the circumstances by members of the defence forces and their families. I am quite confident that if all those factors are properly evaluated and if Defence Force families are consulted, the government will have no difficulty in accepting the thrust and message of the shadow minister's amendment. When I visited the army bases and talked with Defence Force personnel, they were shocked and angered to think that their accrued lorig service leave and annual leave were going to be subject to retrospective taxation under the so-called great budget of the Keating government. Defence Force people are pretty discip'lined, as they have to be,' but that was an experience that I do not want to repeat; to witness the depth of anger, disappointment, hurt and revulsion towards this governmentand towards the way the budget would retrospectively affect them. Many of the families in defence serviceMr Sciacca-They would like us now, wouldn't they?",83
173,Mr LIEBERMAN,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"-'-If - the parI iamentary secretary wants me to tell him what they think of him now, I will need an extension of time-because it is not good. I will take him there and try to arrange as courteous a reception as possible but they will soon fill him in",84
174,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,Order! I ask the honourable member for Indi to bring his comments back to the bill or the amendment.,84
175,Mr LIEBERMAN,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"On the amendment dealing with the effect on low income families-as I have explained, many Defence Force people have low incomes-for them to have their. accrued long service leave and annual leave subjeCt to marginal rates of tax retrospectively from the time",84
176,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,Order! I ask the honourable member for Indi to bring his comments back to the bill or the amendment. His comments are outside the legislation we are debating at the moment.,84
177,Mr LIEBERMAN,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"With respect; the amendment expresses concern at the effects on low income families. I thinkit is clear that the content of my contribution establishes that faced there are low income families in the Defence Force. The government is attacking low income families-not protecting them at all. I am illustrating the fact that the retrospective grab at accrued long service and annual leave of defence service personnel is immoral and not acceptable. The government has had to back off partially, as a result of doing a deal with the Australian Democrats. This has arisen only because the coalition has shown the courage to reject those sorts of taxes the Senate. The battle is not yet over. Anyone who thinks it is over has another think coming. understand that a couple of senators from Democrats, and perhaps the Greens, are totally considering voting with the coalition's 36 senators to block the four taxes that are affecting low income families-the petrol tax, the retrospective tax that I just spoke about, the wine tax and the wholesale sales tax. Blocking those measures requires 38 senators; we have 36.' Those senators who are not privileged at the moment to be members of the coalition team-but I am sure in their hearts they would wish to be-will have their phones ringing across Australia. I also want to point out that the legislation providing benefits to pensioners and other families is not opposed by the coalition. the amendment has clearly stated, we wish have these additional items considered in the context of the legislation. I remind the that the government has still not resolved question of attacking pensioners who happen to own a few shares. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has created more confusion than he has done with Mabo by allowing the crats to indicate that there will be a review. What the Prime Minister and his colleagues have failed to understand is that pensioners who have a few shares have been going through a lot of anguish for many months now. They have to make decisions that affect their security and savings before the trigger date for the legislation in September. This shows that the Prime Minister is totally out touch when he says in a vague and uncertain way that he is reviewing the legislation in respect of pensioners' shares when he ought to know damned well that the pensioners have to make decisions well before the trigger date targeted. this month as to what they will do with their shares. In conclusion, I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca), who is at the table, will be able to exert his influence on his colleagues in the cabinet. I am sure the caucus room would be available tonight for another emergency caucus meeting. The coalition would accomin modate the parliamentary secretary if he wanted to defer discussion on this debate whilst we awaited the outcome of another I caucus meeting. It is not a matter of the the government being further humiliated; it is humiliated now. It is simply a matter of trying to get something out of the tatters of its fiscal mismanagement and the shocking budget that we are now trying to deal with. I hope honourable members will support the amendment. We can then get on with trying to rectify the havoc being caused to people due to this government's mismanagement.",84
178,Mr SCIACCA,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Bowman-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (6.08 p.m.)-I thank the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford), the honourable member for Lowe (Mrs Easson) and the honourable member for Capricornia (Ms As Henzell) for their excellent contributions. to These members are all women. They know a little about families, how people live and what House they need and do not need. They know the something about social justice and equity. I also want to thank the other honourable members who have contributed to this debate. I have listened on many occasions to the Demohonourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) put forward in many cases quite reasoned arguments in this place. He was a professional lawyer before he came into this House. Today's speech was probably one of his very ordinary ones because he did not have much zest. The reason is that he looked at the bill and found that everything we were doing involved very good measures, and in of some cases measures those opposite would have included in their Fightback document. That document said that a lot of people were getting social security benefits who w,ere not in need, and that the system was not properly The honourable member went back to 1941-over 50 years ago-to find something which the Liberal Party of Australia had done for social justice. He talked about Menzies : introducing child endowment in 1941. If we , look through the opposition's record over all the years it was in government then we would probably have to go back 50 years to find an instance of it doing something equitable and looking after people in some way. The honourable member for Berowra did not tell this House that in Fightback those opposite talked about reducing outlays in social security by $1 billion. There is no question whatsoever that had those opposite achieved government at the March election, they would have taken this measure themselves-there is no doubt about that. It would have been the same with a number of other measures that we have taken. Naturally, those opposite have to find something wrong with the legislation, so they have brought out this position with respect to the defence forces. There is no question whatsoever that there is concern amongst the Australian Defence Force with respect to this measure. But I do not know whether the members of the Defence Force have looked at it and seen just how few of them will be affected. If we look first at the income test for the basic family payment and then the additional family payment, we find that, as of now-1993before one loses entitlement to some form of basic family payment, the cut-off point is $64,938 per year. That is quite a high salary. In 1994 it is proposed by another legislation, which I introduced yesterday, to reduce that cut-off point to $60,000. At the moment, in order to get the basic family payment a one-child family needs to be earning $64,938 a year. On top of that, family can have its own home plus $600,000 worth of assets-I think that is what it is at the moment-before it loses entitlement under the income test for the basic family payment. As of now-and on top of the $64,938-the family can earn $3,249 for each additional child. I put it to the opposition that a person the Australian Defence Force would have to be of fairly high rank to be earning more than that. We must be talking here of somebody of the rank of general; possibly higher ranks than majors. Those opposite are crying crocodile tears. They are trying to find some excuse to criticise the bill because they know it is not that bad a measure and it is one which they would have taken had they been the government. Under the 1993 income test, a family can get the maximum rate of additional family payment if its income is below $20,950. The cut-out rate is about $25,494.80. I have not checked the figures, but I wonder how many of our Defence Force personnel would be on that sort of salary or less. I do not think that many of our Defence Force personnel would be earning a sufficiently low salary for them to be eligible for the additional family payment now. Having said that, I want to make a few other points. I certainly have a concern for the Australian Defence Force. The cabinet did give special consideration to this matter. I understand that it talked about it at length and looked at the concerns that were expressed. The rationale for the change is that taxable income does not indicate fully the need for government assistance-at the moment, it is based on taxable income. Employees who receive non-taxable benefits from an employer are better off than those on the same taxable income who receive no extra benefits. The government did consider separately the situation of families of Defence Force personnel and the impact on them of the inclusion of fringe benefits in income testing for government assistance. On equity grounds, however, the government affirmed the decision to apply to these families the same the provisions as are to apply to the community generally. Clearly, this initiative may affect some families on relatively low taxable incomes who currently receive a housing allowance or subsidy from an employer. In this regard, Defence Force personnel are not placed differently from employees in local government, in the mining industry, and education and railway authorities that also provide accommodation to staff in rural and remote areas or in recognition that mobility is a condition of employment. Similarly, employees of organisations other than the defence forces may be compensated for mobility through the provision of allowances to assist in meeting the cost of maintaining continuity of their children's schooling in a particular education system where the family so decides. The honourable member for Berowra expressed an interest in those living in nonmetropolitan and remote areas. The approach taken in this bill to the assessing of the value of housing in country and remote areas is designed to avoid disadvantaging families who live in these areas. The maximum value Which will be assigned to a three-bedroom house in a non-metropolitan area is $100 a week. In remote areas the maximum value of such a house is $80 a week. In metropolitan areas it is $140 a week. Only the difference between these maximum values and any lesser amount of rent paid is considered as an assessable fringe benefit. Then the first $1,000 of the fringe benefit value is disregarded. I will give honourable members an example. A corporal living at Albury-Wodonga, which is classified as a country area, and contributing $65 a week-which I undlfrstand is about the usual amount-toward the rental of his or her three-bedroom house, would have a fringe benefit value of $1,820. The first $1,000 would be disregarded, so only $820 would be included as income. The maximum reduction in family payment would be about $7.50 a week. We are saying we understand that a number of people in the Australian Defence Force will be affected by the additional family payment that they might lose-and I question the number of people so affected. But it is no different from the position of other members of the community-railway workers, teachers and so on-who are living in remote areas. And the bill provides that the first $1,000 is disregarded. I can understand, again, why the opposition is bringing up this matter. It is obviously for political reasons: it is trying to create some concern in the community. But on this occasion, once the measures are properly explained and when people look at the generous income limits for the basic family payment, I do not think there will be too' many in the Defence Force, apart from those who really do not need to come to the social security system-those earning more than $64,000-odd a year; I would say, the fairly high ranking officers-who will suffer. I do not think the Australian taxpayers really expect the government to be paying family allowance, or the basic family payment as it is now called, to people on those sorts of salaries. !think that is a reasonable proposition. Do not forget that the test adds another $3,249 for each additional child. On the question of fringe benefits, I conclude by saying that I do not really think the opposition has much of a leg to stand on. As much as I know that people in the Defence Force who will be affected by this measure will be disappointed, we are not singling them out. It is not an attack on the defence forces-quite the contrary. It would have been wrong for the government to have excluded the defence forces from this measure and at the same· time include, as I said. before, teachers, 'railway workers and others who have to go out into the country and get special benefits as a result of that. Do not forget that we are not trying in any way to take those benefits away from people. We are talking about those fringe benefits which are given to people in the context of accessing the social security system. I think that is the main point we need to look at. I want to go through a couple of other measures that we are introducing because I think they are very important-in fact, I am very pleased that I am a member of a government that is prepared to look at these things. During the last term I spent a fair bit of time with the Association of Independent Retirees and self-funded retiree organisations. I admit that they have got stuck into me on many occasions. The first thing I say to them is that I have a thick skin so they can go for their life. In some cases, they have put up fairly good arguments as to why some of them, who are asset rich but income poor, do not get any assistance. So what have we done? First of all, we have brought in-not by way of this bill but by way of another bill which has already been passed by this House-the assets withdrawal rate. We have eased that. That was the first measure. That was as a result of many of my colleagues and me receiving representations from self-funded retiree organisations-many of them, Mr Deputy Speaker, live in your electorate-who have said to us, 'Sure we have assets, but because of the way interest rates have gone down and so forth we are not getting as much income as we were getting'. We are now introducing a seniors health card. Those opposite know just how much value our senior citizen community places on these sorts of fringe benefits. They want security and they want to be able to know that if they get sick they can get reasonable, cheap medical assistance. By introducing the seniors health card, we pick up 200,000 senior citizens who at the moment, because of the assets test, cannot access it. That is, in my ·view, an enormous measure and I am glad members of the opposition are not voting against it. They are supporting it, and so they should. The honourable member for Berowra says in his amendment: ... condemns the Government for not protecting the interests of low income families, the the disadvantaged ... Who brought in the family allowance supplement? Who brought in things such as the seniors health card? Who has been indexing social security payments? It certainly was not the opposition; it was us. So how the opposition condemns us I will never know. One of the other measures is to ensure that the income test for family payments takes account of foreign income. At the moment there are people who earn income from overseas sources. For instance, an airline pilot could be a resident of Australia but could be working for, say, Cathay Pacific in Hong Kong and earning fairly good money, which would normally bring him or her over and above the income test. The point is that we have now included that foreign income in the income test for family payment. Mr Ruddock-You could have fixed this up years ago.",85
179,Mr SCIACCA,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"The honourable member for Berowra says that we could have fixed this up years ago. We are trying to fix things up all the time, but we are always being hassled by those opposite who hold up the legislation because of something else. The fact is that we are doing something about it. I think it is equitable, and I am glad the honourable member for Berowra agrees that it is equitable. The next thing we are doing is making foreign currency provisions in the Social Security Act more responsive to market exchange rate fluctuations. I would like a dollar for every letter that I receive, every ministerial that I get, from people-even those in my electorate-who are concerned about the exchange rate differential and the method of assessing moneys that come in, particularly for the United Kingdom pension. I get a lot of letters from people who say, 'The English pound was different at that time. We had a system before which was not responsive to week to week fluctuations'. Now we are doing it. We were criticised in the contribution by the honourable member for Berowra, but at least his friend-and my friend too-the elderly and honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) made it clear in his contribution that this was the right thing to do and fully supported it. I want to thank the honourable member for MCPherson for agreeing with me and the government. It is not often that he agrees with the government, but on this occasion he did. By extending the period for payment of the advanced pharmaceutical allowance, we allowed people who had chronic illnesses to, under certain conditions, ask for that money up-front. Mr Ruddock-Do you know how many did it?",88
180,Mr SCIACCA,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,It does not matter how many did it. The fact is that some did it. Mr Ruddock-How many?,88
181,Mr SCIACCA,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I cannot remember. It was not a lot, but it was certainly some. It was about 100, if I remember correctly, but it does not matter. The fact is that those 100 people needed it and the facility was there for them to claim it. We have extended this to 31 December 1994. Naturally, the government does not agree to the second reading amendment. Frankly, all opposition members are doing is again trying to make some political capital out of this bill and trying to somehow connect it with the recent budget, et cetera. They are crying crocodile tears. They found 'it very difficult to find anything wrong' with this bill. All they could come up with was to try to make people out there think that this would affect them in some big way when, as I said, I doubt whether that will be the case. I commend the original bill to the House. I reject the second reading amendment moved by the honourable member for Berowra.

183,Mr WILLIAMS,RELIGION OR BELIEF,"Tangney) (8.01 p.m.}-I move: That this House: (a) recognising. that everyone should have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; (b) recognising that it is essential to promote understanding, tolerance and respect in relating to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; (c) noting that on 8 February 1993 the Attorney General declared under subsection 47(1) of the Human Rights ;lnd Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 that the Declaration on the Eliminl\tion of All Forms of Intolerance Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief proclaimed by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 25 November 1981 (resolution 36/55) is an international instrument relating to human rights and freedoms for the purposes of that act; and (d) noting that it is desirable that there be priate opportunities for public consideration and parliamentary debate of the declarationdisallows the declaration by the Attorney-General. As is evident from its terms, this motion relates to a declaration made by the former Attorney-General, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy), under section 47(1) of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act-the HREOC Act-with respect to the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance ·and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief. The effect of the ministerial declaration was, subject to it not being disallowed by the Senate or this House, to bring the rights and freedoms recognised in the UN declaration within the definition of human. rights in the HREOC Act and the general functions of the commission with respect to human rights. Let me state at the outset that the general objectives of the UN declaration are laudable. They recognise that everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, and'that no-one should be subject to discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief. However, the action of the former Attorney General has given rise to grave concerns among a wide range of religious groups and members of the public. Those who have written to honourable members and senators include archbishops and bishops and representatives of a range of Christian and non-Christian groups. The ,main concern expressed is that the effect of incorporation of the UN declaration into the definition of human rights in the HREOC Act will be not to. protect religio,:!s free90m in Australia but to limit it. The opposition accepts that the ministerial matters declaration does not of itself make the UN declaration part of Australia's domestic law. The UN declaration does not impose obligations on citizens as a statute does. The opposition also recognises that the powers of the Human Rights Commissioner contained in the and of HREOC Act in relation to investigating conduct that constitutes a breach of human rights are, in practical terms, confined to the actions of the Commonwealth and its agencies. Accordingly, it is accepted that some of the more extreme fears that have been voiced, approand in particular those which suggest that the UN declaration operates to curtail the religious freedom of individuals, are difficult to sustain. Nonetheless, there are compelling reasons why the former Attorney-General's declaration should be disallowed. The UN declaration must be seen in context. On 7 December 1962 the General Assembly of the United Nations initiated the preparation of a draft declaration and a draft convention on the elimination of all forms of religious intolerance. However, it was not until 1981, after 19 years of tortuous drafting and negotiation, that the declaration was finally adopted. In UN practice, a declaration by the General Assembly is usually a step in the process of settling a convention or treaty. The convention on the elimination of all forms of religious intolerance has yet to be finalised, even though it is now almost 31 years since its drafting was initiated. The delay in finalising the declaration and the apparent inability of the United Nations to agree upon the terms of a convention reflect not only political struggles within the United Nations but also the controversy inherent in the subject matter. Let us look at the circumstances under which the former Attorney-General put his signature to his declaration under the HREOC Act. The UN declaration was adopted by a resolution of the General Assembly of the United Nations on 25 November 1981. Although Australia supported the resolution in 1981, it was not unti11993, nearly 12 years later, that the former Attorney-General declared it under the HREOC Act. The actual date on which he did so is also significant: it was 8 February this year, the day after the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announced the federal election. Some months before, the former· Attorney-General had consulted state governments. Attorney-General Hannaford of New South Wales advised that the New South Wales Liberal government opposed the incorporation of the UN declaration in the HREOC Act. So did Attorney General Berinson QC of the Western Australian Labor government. The question must be asked: what prompted the former Attorney-General to sign his declaration 10 years after the matter had come before his government and on the day after a federal election was announced, an election which the government was generally expected to lose? In looking at the incorporation of the UN declaration in the HREOC Act, the first point to be made is that the UN deClaration is not a treaty. Australia is not bound at internawhich tional law to comply with the terms of the UN declaration, nor is it bound to incorporate its provisions into Australian domestic law. Its adoption in 1981 means little more than that the principles sought to be stated in the declaration were accepted by Australia as a step in the process of endeavouring to reach a formal international consensus on the subject of religious intolerance and discrimination. The next point to be made is that' within existing definition of human rights in the HREOC Act; the commission· has ample power to promote the concept of religious freedom and to investigate infringements of that freedom by the Commonwealth or its agencies. There are significant statements about the right to freedom of religion and belief in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which is already incorporated into the definition of human rights in the HREOC Act. Article 18(1), (2) and (3) of the international covenant state that everyone shall have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and belief and the right to manifest that religion or belief and that no-one shall be subject to coercion which would impair those freedoms. This is virtually identical to article 1 of the UN declaration. If the definition of human rights in the HREOC Act in relation to religious freedom does need extending, no justification for such extension has been offered by the government at any time. If a case were to be made, then the legislation effecting the extension should be done in the most clear and readily comprehensible language. The UN declaration does not have those qualities, as I will endeavour to demonstrate. The UN declaration is a document in which clarity of meaning has been sacrificed for the sake of compromise. The result is a series of vague, ambiguous and potentially contradictory provisions. The declaration contains general provisions that state that everyone shall have the right to freedom of religion or belief and to manifest that religion or belief in worship, observance, practice and teaching and that no-one shall be subject to coercion would impair his or her freedom to have a religion or belief of his or her choice. The declaration goes further and in article 6 expressly states what those freedoms include. I will quote a few of these: One freedom is to establish and maintain appropriate charitable or humanitarian institutions. What coristitutes 'appropriate charitable institutions'? Another function is to make, acquire and use to an adequate extent the necessary articles and material related to the rites or the customs of a religion or belief. What is 'an adequate extent' and what, indeed, are necessary articles and materials as opposed to unnecessary ones? One could suggest a sacrificial dagger is, according to some rites, a necessary article. Article 6 specifies a right to write, issue and disseminate relevant publications in these areas and to teach a religion or belief in places suitable for these purposes. What are 'relevant publications' in this context and what constitutes a 'suitable place' in which a religion or belief may be taught? Another purported right is to train, appoint, elect or designate by succession appropriate leaders called for by the requirements and standards of any religion or belief. Who constitutes an 'appropriate leader'? We have seen recent examples of totally inappropriate leaders. These provisions are an attempt to codify to some degree religious rights and freedoms, but they give rise to a multitude of questions of interpretation. It is difficult to see how the commission could fulfil its functions of promoting understanding and acceptance of these alleged human rights. To give any meaning or content to them, the commission would have to engage in value judgments in respect of which the UN declaration offers no guidance. As well as being ambiguous and unclear, the provisions of the declaration probably conflict with the provisions of instruments already incorporated into the HREOC Act. There is probably also internal conflict between provisions of the UN declaration itself. An example is provided by provisions dealing with the religious education of children. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights requires that the state parties to the covenant undertake to have respect for the liberty of parents and legal guardians to ensure the religious and moral education of their children in conformity with their own convictions. That is article 18(4). There is a similar principle stated in the Declaration of the Rights of the Child which is also incorporated in the HREOC Act in principle 10. In a similar vein, article 5(1) of the UN declaration provides that the parents and legal guardians of children have the right to organise the life within the family in accordance with their religion or belief and bearing in mind the moral education in which they believe the child should be brought up. However, article 5(3) of the UN declaration provides that the child shall be brought up in a spirit' of understanding, tolerance, friendship among peoples, peace and universal brotherhood, respect for freedom of religion or belief of others and in full consciousness that his energy and talents should be, devoted to the servi-e of his fellow man. A parent concerned to educate his or her child in accordance with the parent's religious commitments could well find that the tenets of his or her religion are not in conformity with these requirements. In fact, article 5(3) of the UN declaration itself is almost an expression of a form 'of religious belief. The apparently absolute rights given to parents to ensure the religious and moral education of their children is in conformity with their own convictions in the international covenant are also inconsistent with article 5(2) of the UN declaration. The latter states that whilst every child shall enjoy the right to have access to education in the matter of religion or belief in acc,ordance with the wishes of his parents or legal guardian and shall not be compelled to receive teaching in religion or belief against their wishes, the best interests of the child are the guiding principle. It may be suggested that the use of the term 'the best interests of the child' opens the door for the' overriding of parental wishes in relation to the religious education of their children. Apart from its specific terms, the declaration also raises the broader issue of governments legislating with respect to religious freedom. Many of the most noble acts in history have been done in pursuit of an article of faith or a religious ideal. On the other hand, some of the most ghastly and inhuman' chapters of mankind's history, even very recent history, have also been the result of uncompromising beliefs of a religious nature. It is also a fact that there are many religious practices and beliefs which are not acceptable to the vast majority in Australian society. In this respect, I do not refer to matters of diet, dress or hygiene. Some religions promote unacceptable practices involving mutilation of the body. In societies observing other religions, females are accorded inferior status and rights. Indeed, religious beliefs and practices which effectivenecessary. ly make women and children second-class citizens almost certainly connict with existing equal opportunity and sex discrimination legislation. Internationally, I suggest, the connict between freedom of religion, on the one hand, and freedom from discrimination, on the other, is likely to become very contentious in the future. Any proposal for domestic legislation seeking to protect or promote religious freedom must be looked at with the greatest care. It should be absolutely clear that such legislation does not condone religious practices or beliefs which are incompatible with other significant human rights and freedoms. Such legislation should not be enacted by the uncritical acceptance of a second-rate, informal international document. Such legislation should certainly not be enacted by an executive act without the prior opportunity for extensive public discussion and parliamentary debate. In addition to the problems with the terms of the UN declaration itself, the ministerial declaration under the HREOC Act highlights fundamental flaws in the procedures under that act. That is a subject. I will say more about on another occasion. The final point I make is that the hundreds of submissions received by opposition members and senators in relation to the UN declaration and the Attorney-General's declaration under the HREOC Act have disclosed a total lack of understanding among members of the public about the impact of Australia adopting United Nations declarations and the means by which UN declarations and conventions become part of the domestic law of Australia. Of even greater concern is that they have also disclosed an alarming lack of knowledge about the role and powers of the commission, a body which, under the proposed budgetthe first version-has been allocated funds of over $17.7 million this financial year. In summary, the _coalition opposes the former Attorney-General's declaration for several reasons. The HREOC Act already incorporates significant statements on the issue of religious freedom. Another is unFurther, the history of the UN religious declaration demonstrates the difficulties inherent in its subject matter. As a result of these difficulties, the UN declaration is a vague, internally inconsistent document, the impact of which is unclear. It probably also connicts with other instruments already incorporated under the HREOC Act, highlighting a flaw in the HREOC Act itself. It is not clear that it would not effectively condone religious beliefs and practices which the Australian community would find abhorrent. The government should amend the HREOC Act to allow for examination of international instruments prior to their being declared in relation to the other functions of the commission. The government should also undertake to educate the people of Australia about the United Nations, its role in Australia and the impact of its instruments on Australian law. The government should also seek to educate Australians about the functions of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The government, through failing to keep the people of Australia informed about these matters, is responsible for causing widespread concern in the community about this United Nations declaration and the effect of the ministerial declatation under the HREOC Act. This motion recognises that, whilst seeking to ensure religious freedom is in general terms a commendable pursuit, it is an area which requires the most careful and detailed consideration. The indisputable fact is that the goverIiment has not given the matter careful or detailed consideration at all. I urge honourable members to agree to the motion.",90
184,Mr SPEAKER,RELIGION OR BELIEF,Is the motion seconded? Mr MCGauran-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,93
185,Mr LAVARCH,RELIGION OR BELIEF,"Firstly, I acknowledge the spirit in which the motion has been moved by the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams). He wishes there to be an opportunity, and I acknowledge that, for the parliament to be able to - debate this particular instrument. It is certainly an important instrument which has been adopted by the government and which is now added to the armoury, if you like, of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. It is appropriate that it be debated. Indeed,. the very mechanism of this process allows a disallowance motion to occur. The first point which the honourable member raised implied that there is something a little sinister about it all, that it was signed in the last days of the previous government at a time when it was widely believed that the government may not be returned. Hence the implication no doubt is that it would be a bit of a shoofty, that we could slip it in early, and that it would be imposed on the incoming government. The fact that we are debating this matter tonight and that it may be disallowed by this House, or disallowed later by the Senatewhere I understand a similar disallowance motion has been put-rather puts the lie to the argument. Obviously it was not imposed on an incoming government. Had the coalition won government it could easily have disposed of this particular instrument, if it was of a mind to, and the House will vote on it tonight. The honourable member then went on to ask where all this came from and why, after such a long period of time, it was picked up by the government and added again to the HREOC armoury. Initial support for this declaration occurred in 1981 and came from the Fraser government, not a Labor government. The declaration was picked up in recent times because of a request by the President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, Sir Ronald Wilson, who would be well known to honourable members of this House as a very distinguished Australian. He is a former justice of the High Court and a man who, I believe, would not be prone to embarking on enterprises which would somehow limit the rights and enjoyment of religious freedom in this country. He is also a man who has some knowledge of the law, both internationally and domestically, the operation of the United Nations and the impact a declaration such as the one we are debating will have on Australian law. Obviously, Sir Ronald Wilson did not see the evil which the honourable member for Tangney believes could be incorporated in this particular measure. When the request for the declaration was made, Australia and in fact the world was going through the Gulf War, when some concern was being directed in the Australian community at those of the Muslim faith. That up was one of the major reasons that motivated the request from the human rights commission to the government to go down this path. The honourable member also raised the question of consultation, implying that the whole thing was a bit rushed. He suggested that the Attorney-General of New South Wales, Mr Hannaford, and the then Attorney General of Western Australia had expressed some concerns about the declaration and, as a result, we should have stepped back and said, 'We should not proceed with it'. Of course, the honourable member did not go on to mention that that consultation was not confined to the Attorneys-General of New South Wales and Western Australia. Consultation occurred through all Attorneys""General and no objection at all was raised to the declaration by the other states. The more substantive objection was raised by Attorney-General Hannaford and was based on a belief that this declaration may have an impact on some of the exemptions provided in New South Wales anti-discrimination laws to particular religious practices. Indeed, as the honourable member mentioned, it was a broader measure which means that at some time we will have to sit down and resolve the potential connict between declarations of religious freedom like this one and anti-discrimination provisions where the actual religious belief may be discriminatory in some way. That is a matter which we should be particularly concerned about because, on the face of it, there could be connict. They are matters of judgment and balance. But the particular point which the Attorney-General of New South Wales raised simply was not valid in that this declaration will have no impact on the laws of New South Wales. As the honourable member said, this declaration will empower the human rights commission to certainly examine the actions and practices of Commonwealth and promote broad understanding and education in areas of religious freedom. It is certainly not an instrument which of itself can invalidate the laws of any state or any discrimination laws in New South Wales. I think that point was even acknowledged by the Attorney-General of Western Australia in his objection. I stress that the other states did not object to the declaration at that time. Also, the human rights commission undertook wide consultations. As honourable members may know, Sir Ronald Wilson is well known as a senior official I think in the Uniting Church. He is also well known amongst churches generally. Obviously, in talking about things which touch on religious freedom, a first port of call must be church and religious groups in the country to get a view on the situation. I am certainly advised that the position related by Sir Ronald back to the government was that there is widespread support for the declaration amongst churches. That is not to say there has not been a certain amount of misinformation and misunderstanding about this declaration. Like opposition members and senators, before the election, as a backbench member, I also received letters about this matter expressing a whole range of concerns. It was similar to the campaign which was run regarding the rights of the child, and no doubt we will discuss that a little later tonight. was also similar to a campaign which is often run about the United Nations. I do not deny that many right-minded people become concerned with the information or misinformation given to them and write in good faith to their members of parliament to express that concern. But I have also no doubt that a lot of this misinformation does come from some quite extreme and fringe groups in the community, from my experience at least within my home state. Often the League of Rights or kin organisations are rather prone to getting themselves involved with this issue, based on the idea that Australia is losing its sovereignty and that we are moving to a one world government. It is all tied up with the direction of the the High Court in the dams case, the destruction of the legal system as we know it and Australia being brought to its knees. It used to have a communist undertone but with the collapse in Russia and eastern Europe, that undertone seems to have dropped out of the most recent letters I have seen. Nonetheless, the one-world conspiracy theory is often there. I also accept a couple of points the honourable member raised: there is a great deal of ignorance in the Australian community about the United Nations. There is also a deal of ignorance about the operation of the human rights commission not only in this area but in regard to a whole lot of its responsibilities. Inasmuch as it is a government failure that this misunderstanding exists in the community, I have to accept the blame for. that. Nonetheless, these sorts of campaigns are run from time to time and do generate large volumes of mail coming into the offices of honourable members. People do have to take it for what it is. It is often driven by people believing these great conspiracy theories. One has to weigh up this sort of campaign in light of that. I have seen it in my six years in the parliament. It was very evident during the 1988 referendums and I know how very successful such campaigns can be in whipping up a lot of public fear and concern. That should not distract us from looking at the issue on its merits. I do not believe that It this declaration will harm us or hinder us in any way. With this instrument, HREOC has a more modem statement of basic religious rights and freedoms than that contained in the underlying document, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which also canvasses political freedoms. It enables the body to go out and promote the idea of religious freedom. I do not think that it will be trying to strike down anti-discrimination laws or questioning thingsMr Bruce Scott-Can you give an undertaking on that?",93
186,Mr LAVARCH,RELIGION OR BELIEF,"I can pretty much guarantee that it will not be doing that, and while HREOC is responsible to me as AttomeyGeneral it will not be embarking on any such campaigns. I invite the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) to point to any time in the history of the commission-or its predecessor-when it has embarked on any sort of idea of social engineering or has tried to push a particular view or social philosophy on the Australian people. There is no evidence of that at all. The almost sinister beliefs that people promote about this agency do not stand up to any sane scrutiny of how the commission operates, the power that it has and the role that it has played. On the whole, the commission has had bipartisan support across the parliament. I hope that continues and that honourable members discount some of the more lunatic fringe elements that try to ascribe all sorts of sinister motives to it. We will be concerned with the position of the churches and their beliefs in relation to this declaration. J have in front of me a very recent letter from the Conference of Churches of Western Australia, which might be of interest to the honourable member. It says in the foreword: The Heads of Churches felt that the matters raisedthis was a concern about the declaration. . . required additional reflection. As a consequence, a special meeting was arranged on 11 th August at which we had as a guest, Sir Roland Wilson, a former Justice of the High Court and currently President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. All present felt that there had been value in the move to disallow the ... declaration because it was held in that context, and that is why I do not dispute the right to move that motion or to debate it. It went on: However, after considering all the issues, the of Churches were of a mind that it was important that religious tolerance be affirmed, in that if the Declaration were not adopted by Australia, there could eventually be a development of an attitude of religious intolerance. It was equally affirmed that international covenant does not impede on the rights of an individual nation state and in the Australian context there would be no punitive act proposed in law which would impede the rights of churches. I therefore ask the House not to disallow the declaration. (TIme expired)",95
187,Mr MCGAURAN,RELIGION OR BELIEF," Mr Speaker, the opposition moves to disallow the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief, just as it has also moved to disallow the United Nations Declaration on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The National and Liberal parties have chosen this course of action because the two declarations are an insult to the Australian community, and an insult to the legal and constitutional traditions through which we conduct our affairs as an independent nation. 1\velve years ago, it was deemed-I suspect for reason of diplomatic nicety-to endorse a set of abstract principles regarding the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief. This was hardly perceived to be a problem as the principles were of no more significance than that, and they were quite some considerable distance from intruding into the domestic legal system. That is where they should have stayed. Under the current government we have seen an effort to give these principles some teeth; to pull them into the life of the community and allow them greater force in determining the shape of our own institutions. Effectively, what the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) has done in respect of the declaration is to bring it within the ambit of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. In other words, the ministerial declaration gazetted on 24 February this year, and tabled in both Houses in May, had the effect of drawing principles espoused in the original declaration, its variously phrased freedoms and rights in respect of religious activities, within the Heads functions of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. This is a bewildering course of action, especially as the government has already transferred the principles contained within the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights into the commission's act. I know that the government finds it exciting to trump up its little bureaucracies and flatter its political constituencies, but this really was an action akin to ministerial overkill, and it is a unnecessary course to take. The declaration is a vague and imprecise instrument. It is the product of Geneva based committees and teams of UN bureaucrats with little more on their plates than to spend time confusing the obvious and needlessly interfering in the domestic affairs of nations whose observance of the principles they espo-se is hardly in question. If we hand over a document like the Declaration of Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief to the human rights commission, we really are creating a rod for our o-n backs. We well know what that commission will do with an instrument like this. It will interpret it widely· and raise a host of international legal concerns and unleash a whole new era of litigation upon the community. I know that the commission has no punitive powers in this instance-its powers are more declaratory than legally binding-but it does have the authority to open up a wholly new and needless bureaucracy in conciliating between parties who feel that they have been aggrieved in some way which runs counter to the spirit or intention of the declaration. We know that this will eventually open up a new and rich arena of activity for the legal profesits sion, and gradually the international covenants and declarations, such as those under debate, will seep into the political and legal systems. Next we will have the courts bogged down with case loads laying claim to infringements of articles derived from UN instruments of all kinds. From documents such as this spring all kinds of implied rights and privileges which were overlooked at the time of adoption. No doubt, before long we will find the current government - sing the declaration as a precedent to obtain some legislative end that it could obtain anyway through recourse to our own legal and legislative channels. This is not simply a cynical suspicion. We all know where these seemingly harmless documents take us. It is a suspicion that a wide sway of the community shares all too well. It is not just a concern that the declarafreedom tion, which is the subject of this disallowance motion, is an unnecessary encumbrance on the wholly community. The matter goes a long way further than that. The matter goes to the heart of the respect the community has for its own institutions and traditions. The community does not appreciate the preparedness of this government to endorse international protocols, declarations and covenants in a manner which rides roughshod over the parliament and, therefore, the electorate's own will. The government might like to laugh this off-as the Attorney-General did during his contribution-and claim that this is a concern borne of ignorance or overreaction, but there is a very large slice of the community that believes that new instruments, such as this declaration, which can affect the established, legal and political and social traditions of the nation should be fully debated and reviewed and not left up to brief parliamentary debate or ministerial fiat or discretion. This alone is one reason why the opposition parties have moved to disallow the declaration, because before the government enters into international agreements of this kind, or proposes to do so, it should not proceed without a fu,ll and open debate which elicits the cross-section of community feeling. At present, the government can reserve for own prerogative the important right of introducing alien legal conventions into the legal and political process without seeking prior consent or consultation. If this government is addicted to endorsing international principles such as that one contained in the declaration, then it might like to stand by this one for once: the principle of prior consultation of the parliament made up of elected representatives accountable to the community at large. We have seen in the budget process the total disdain the government has for honesty and consultation. Now we are seeing those very same tendencies creep into the conduct of the legal system. The reasons for the coalition's disallowance motion go even deeper than this. The declaration has as its key principles such concerns as guarantees of of thought, conscience and religion, the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion or belief, the right of parents to organise their family lives around religious principles, the freedom for individuals to worship as they are so inclined, and the right of individuals and groups to manifest their faiths through attending churches, organising charitable institutions and so on. I wonder why the federal government has suddenly found it necessary to embrace all of these principles. I would have thought we enjoyed a strong western European tradition flowing especially from the 17th to the 19th and 20th centuries which embodied these very principles which have influenced our legal system and have set the very cultural traditions which make us an independent nation. My point is that if the Attorney-General finds it necessary to reimpose these principles in the fonn of a foreign instrument on Australia, he should first tell the community in what way its existing conduct is deficient or defective or in what way our legal processes or prevailing customs have failed to the extent that they need to be buttressed by a contrived statement by a group of anonymous United Nations bureaucrats. I, of course, do not pretend that our conduct as a community has reached a point where we are free of blemishes of conduct on matters such as racial discrimination and so forth. But if there is a problem in the community which is of such severity that it requires recourse extraterritorial laws, I am sure the public want to know what precisely the extent of this problem might be and what are its sources. Indeed, even if there were a problem of the magnitude which required legislative action in some fonn, why would it not be possible to address this problem from within our own indigenous legal and social institutions instead of running off to employ an international instrument? Does the Attorney-General really believe Australia needs and requires an artificial, borrowed, derivative statement of religious freedoms in this country in order to ensure these freedoms are observed? When contentious issues arise, be they religious in nature or concerning other civil and human rights, they should be addressed here in Australia and resolved here in Australia with recourse to our own domestic courts and traditions. There is no need, practical or otherwise, to impose a bureaucratic overlay on the local, legal and political systems. For a government that pretends so much to value domestic political independence and mocks any evidence of dependence on other nations, the fact that the government through these declarations is actively seeking to adopt this very course of action is untenable and inconsistent and it reveals the fundamental hypocrisies which underlie so many of its public positions on national affairs. Here we have a government parading its nationalist credentials while simultaneously eroding the integrity of Australian's own institutions. I would add that there is more than a little of the old Australian cringe mentality at work in all of this. The local product is obviously not good enough for the government and, in this case, the product is nothing less than the basic institutional life of our nation. For many in the community, that is what this whole issue of the government's recourse to international covenants and declarations is about. It is nothing more than an attack on the nation's sovereignty and an undermining of the electorate's ultimate authority in the political system. This is not the lament of the extremist; this is a simple fear held by many to people who no longer trust anything this government does and rightly sees in its every action duplicity and guile. I make one closing comment on this disallowance motion. I am perturbed, as are others in this parliament and in the wider community, that we are becoming increasingly preoccupied with finding solutions to alleged problems through legal recourse or remedies. We are becoming a society of litigants Whose conduct is observed by way of contract. That is, the essential traditions and character of the nation are increasingly falling into the hands of bureaucrats and lawyers who arbitrate and conciliate on alJ manner of concerns. The capacity of the community to regulate its own conduct, to set its own standards and be guided by the leadership of public figures is waning as a result. That says a great deal about a lot of forces operating across society. But it also says a great deal about the role of this parliament in national life and the decline of public leadership in setting the temper of the times. Rather than using declarations such as that we are debating tonight to pursue some internationalist dogma which has always been pumping away within the Labor movement since its formation, if this governmen.t were genuinely seriqus about reaffirming the basic qualities of citizenship in this country, then should firstly and propedy look to its own standards of conduct and leadership.",96
188,Mr MELHAM,RELIGION OR BELIEF,"I rise to oppose the motion for disallowance. It is very interesting, Mr Speaker. They say that ignorance breeds fear and conservatism. We have seen that here tonight; we have witnessed it from the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran)-a throwback to the 1950s. The only thingMr FiIing- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The speaker opposite is reflecting on another member in. a direct way which I believe contravenes the standing orders. I ask you to ask him to withdraw those latter remarks.",99
189,Mr SPEAKER,RELIGION OR BELIEF,"If the member indeed was reflecting on an individual within this place by name, then he,knows that that is in contravention of the standing orders. In listening to what the honourable member said, I thought it was a general term and he would know to proceed accordingly.",99
190,Mr MELHAM,RELIGION OR BELIEF,"I think there need to be a few factsMr Nehl- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Following on from the point of order raised by the honourable member for Moore, I would like to add that the honourable member for Banks did refer to the honourable member for Gippsland as a throwback and that does have a pejorative and nugatQry sense. I think he should withdraw it. The honourable member for Gippsland is not a throwback.",99
191,Mr MELHAM,RELIGION OR BELIEF,"Mr Speaker, I am happy to withdraw if people take that as a reflection. I think a few facts need to be brought into this debate. I had a number of letters written to me both before and after the election. I represent a fairly conservative Labor electorate. A high percentage of people in that electorate are from a Christian background. There are a number of conservative churches in that electorate and they wrote to me becau'se this campaign was running hot at the time. I made some inquiries of the AttomeyGeneral's Department and checked out a few facts. I wrote a letter to each of the constituit ents involved and I have not had a follow-up letter from them yet. What do the facts reveal? The;! facts reveal the following: that the original declaration was adopted and proclaimed unanimously by the United Nations General Assembly on 25 November 1981. I would have thought that if there were any division or prevarication, there would have been opposition to it; there was not. The information I have received is that it was adopted unanimously. The international community is firmly behind the implementation of the religious declaration. The information I have obtained again reveals that at this year's meeting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, under its agenda item on the implementation of the declaration, a resolution was passed calling on states to ensure that their' legal systems provide adequate guarantees of freedom of thought, conscience, religion, and to take all appropriate' measures to combat hatred, intolerance and acts of violence, including those motivated by religious extremism, and to encourage understanding, tolerance and respect in matters relating to freedom of religion or belief. What happened? The resolution was cosponsored by 38 countries and adopted without a vote. Those co-sponsors included Australia, Canada, Ireland-which introduced the resolution-France, Italy, Poland, the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland, as well as the United States of America. The facts speak for themselves. Who introduced the resolution? It was Ireland. There are not many reds under the bed in Ireland. What are we to believe from the honourable member for Gippsland? Are we to believe that Australia is such an isolated nation that we should ,put up the barriers? Let us erect the barricades-an eight-foot brick fence all around Australia. Is that the opposition's solution to unemployment? Let us have a look at the history of how this resolution came into being. Where did it originate? Where did the government's action come from? The proposal to declare the religion declaration was initiated by--uess who?- Sir Ronald Wilson when he wrote a letter to the then Attorney-General on 4 March 1991. He wrote following the passage of a unanimous resolution of a meeting at the world conference for religion and peace consultation which took place in Melbourne in 1991. Guess what? It took place shortly after the Gulf War. That is significant because it was the conduct of some individuals within this country during the Gulf War that prompted Sir Ronald Wilson to write. He says: There was an interesting sequel to the presentation of my paper on human rights from a religious viewpoint. During question time. I was asked from the floor whether I thought it might be possible the Commonwealth Government to give consideration to include the 1981 UN Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and, of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief in the Commission's jurisdiction by making a declaration under section 47 of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986. I answered in the affirmative, whereupon there was spontaneous applause. The meeting then resolved unanimously to that effect and I was asked to bring the suggestion to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. What did Sir Ronald Wilson do? He wrote off to the then Attorney-General, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy). The then Attorney-General, after obviously giving Sir Ronald Wilson's proposal serious consideration, then commenced the consultation processes specified under the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act. He consulted with state ministers before signing the declaration. The level of consultation was obviously appropriate having regard to the commission's responsibilities. In March 1992-this is how long it lay on the table-he wrote to all state and territory attorneys-general informing them of his intention to declare the religion declaration and invited them to raise any issues concerning the intended declaration. The attorneysgeneral for South Australia, ACT, Northern Territory-it appears that people from the Northern Territory are more progressive than some of the honourable members on the 'other side of' the House-Queensland, Tasmania, and, Victoria either supported the declaration or had no issues to raise. The attorneys-general of Western Australian and New South' Wales raised a number of concerns. The Western Australian Attorney General was concerned about the effect of the declaration on the Western Australian Equal Opportunity Act 1984 and the exemptions provided for in that act-in particular, the exemptions granted to religious bodies in section 72. However,' he recognised that this would not pose a legal problem unless the religion declaration itself was enacted by the Commonwealth. There is no intention' to do this. The New South Wales Attorney-General was of the opinion that the law and practice of New South Wales did not currently comply for with the requirements of the religion declaration. However, the issue of any inconsistency between state legislation and"" the religion declaration does not arise in the context, of making the declaration under the HREOC Act. Obviously, the objections raised during the consultation period to making that declaration lacked substance. Giveri th- attitude of the majority of state attorneys--eneral, I understand that the then Attorney-General decided to proceed with the decla-ation. Then we have this letter writing campaign. What does a declaration allow the HREOC to do? It allows the commission to promote the understanding, acceptance and public discussion of the rights described in the UN declaration. The HREOC will also be able to inquire into acts, or practices of the Commonwealth which are inconsistent with the rights contained in the UN declaration. What is wrong with that? Does the opposition want us to withdraw from the UN? Does it want us to be one out in the world? Why are we in the UN? The HREOC will also be able to examine Commonwealth legislation to determine whether it is consistent with the rights in the UN declaration, and it can report to the Commo Iwealth Attorney-General on action that should be taken by the Commonwealth on matters relating to the human rights. That is part of the answer that I gave to my constituents. I also said-and this is important because this is where there is a misinfonnation that people are feeding off-that the reality is that the more they inquire or the more that it is explained to them, they will find that there is no substance to the fear or to the misinformation. The UN declaration does not restrict or limit Christians or members of other religions in the practice of their religion. The declaration and the rights recognised in it are aimed at ensuring the protection of freedom of religion. This intention is clearly reflected in two paragraphs in the preamble which states in part: ... Considering that religion or belief for anyone who professes either is one of the fundamental elements of his conception of life and that freedom of religion or belief should be fully respected and guaranteed. i would have thought that that would have been motherhood stuff, even for the opposition. It continued: ... concerned by manifestations of intolerance and by the existence of discrimination in matters of religion or belief still in evidence in some areas of the world. Again, what is the objection with that? Article 1 of the UN declaration says: Everyone shall have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. It says further: No one shall be subject to coercion which would impair his freedom to have a religion or belief of his choice ... That is written there. It is a manifesto that we should be abiding by. The ALP has a manifesto; it has beliefs that we work to. I would have thought that the Liberal Party and the National Party also have beliefs and manifestos that they work and aspire to. The interesting thing is that those who should and do know at each stage of the process at the United Nations have let the matters go through unanimously; no votes were recorded against it. But what happens here? The politicians have to be involved, arguing the politics of the matter. They think that there might be something in it for them, that there is something else behind it. The reality is that there is nothing behind it. The declaration itself is motherhood stuff. Mr Charles-Conspiracy theory.",99
192,Mr MELHAM,RELIGION OR BELIEF,"There are always conspiracy theories. There are always reds under the bed. The reality is that the Australian electorate woke up to the opposition a long time ago. We are going to knock the opposition for six next time around as well. I have no problems with this matter being debated. On Monday of this week Sir Ronald Wilson attended a seminar conducted by the Australian Human Rights Council, which looked at human rights complaints mechanisms; why use them and how to use them. In the course of answering questions from the audience he made reference to the current disallowance motions by the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) and he urged members of the audience to write to both the Attorney-General and the shadow AttomeyGeneral protesting the disallowance.",101
193,Mr FILING,RELIGION OR BELIEF,He's entitled to his opinion but he is wrong.,101
194,Mr MELHAM,RELIGION OR BELIEF,"He is entitled to his view. Sir Ronald Wilson is hardly a red under the bed. He is hardly someone who could be impugned with the apparent motives that members of the opposition would like to run away with. With each of the inquiries in my electorate-this is the telling point-after I had an opportunity to write to them. I did not receive one follow up co-plaint, because they accepted what was being said. That is all this needs to be about. (TIme expired)",101
195,Mr LIEBERMAN,RELIGION OR BELIEF,I think it is a shame that the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) has regarded the comments from people on this side of the House as being a result of the reds under the bed syndrome-that these comments are being made by psychotic people. I think that degenerates debate and lowers its importance. I respect his right to express his view and will obviously fight as steadfastly as I can for his right to continue to express his viewMr Knott-But not for freedom of religion.,101
196,Mr LIEBERMAN,RELIGION OR BELIEF,"In connection with the motion of disallowance, I have felt the sting of prejudice and discrimination in my life. I know what it is like. I very strongly believe in the freedom of individuals. That is why I am involved in doing what I am doing and why I chose to be a member of the Liberal Party. I want government members to know that I am not a person that imagines a red under the bed but I am a person who has had the opportunity and the privilege of working with many people in the community. I have been brought up to take the view that we should consult widely on important issues like this and that we should take account of the views of people even if we do not necessarily always regard their views as being right. It is an issue which the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) himself says is going to have no legal effect at all but which is designed to act as an educational tool that is to shape the minds and the attitudes of people in the future-and that means future parliamentarians, future policy makers, future legislators, future members of tribunals appointed, for example, for the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in the states and the Commonwealth. It is designed to influence the thoughts and the attitudes of Austr\llians, both this present generation and future decision makers. In that context, I know from my experience in state parliament, as a minister and shadow minister, and now as a member of the House of Representatives that once people have had their attitudes moulded, shaped and educated, if they are given the opportunity to influence laws they naturally put into the formation of the laws the views that they have developed. Whilst of course I agree with Sir Ronald Wilson-I know of his eminence and respect him very much-I must say that I do not believe Sir Ronald would ever want anyone to think that he is saying to Australians and to this parliament that what we decide tonight .in respect of what should become an educational tool could not at any time influence the shape and the formation of the law in the future. Of course he would not want to be associated with that because education is part of the shaping of policy makers and law makers. Obviously it influences the people who are in the courts, the judges and the magistrates. I think that we ought to have a look at this motion of disallowance by taking a different view from that which has been advanced, unfortunately, by the honourable member for Banks. I have approached this with an open mind, and decided that I would consult with people in my electorate to get their views. I wrote to all of the church groups in Indi and surrounding areas, and I am glad to say I received quite a few replies. Some people said they did not see anything wrong with it; others had quite strong views and felt that it unwittingly-not deliberately-transgressed on something that they felt was pretty important. As an example of that, I received a letter dated 9 July 1993-a copy of which I am happy to make available to members-from Bishop Daly, the Bishop of Sandhurst, who is very highly respected in Australia. After the introduction,he said: I like other constituents have concerns regarding the above Declaration, and I forward the following brief comments for your perusal. Article One (2) No one shall be subject to coercion which would impair his/her freedom to have a religion or belief of his/her choice. Non Catholic Students attend Catholic Schools, and under this article they could maintain that their Religious beliefs are not catered for, also they could maintain that they will not abide by that Schools regulations with regard to Christian principles, and could maintain they are being coerced. (3) Freedom to manifest one's religion or belief may be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary to protect public safety, order, health or morals or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others. This article allows for Governments (secular persons) to intervene on Religious matters and arbitrate for the individual, which might not necessarily be to the benefit of the community as a whole. Minority religious groups could claim discrimination by larger Religious Groups e.g. Government Assistance by way of grants etc. It is a very important point. He continued: Article 1\vo (1) Religious Schools generally will employ people with Christian values, for the most part having the same beliefs. This article will cause concern to the Principals, parents and students of religious schools, given that currently under the Equal Opportunity Act an exemption for religious bodies under the Act (section 38) implies religious schools can find a person unsuitable because he/she leads an obvious lifestyle or has publicly held beliefs which are in conflict 'with the Religious Teachings of said religious schools. (2) Religious Schools will not be able to say who attends their schools, be it teachers/students regardless of their beliefs. This article could eventuallyI emphasise 'eventually'have religion banned as part of the curriculum given that minority teacher/students believe they can be coerced by weight of numbers into conforming to the Religious teachings of said school. Article Four All States shall take effective measures to prevent and eliminate discrimination on the grounds of religion. Effectively Governments could make State/Church education systems one-with no religion taught in schools. Possible reason given that no one religion covers all beliefs. Rel,igion therefore has no place in school's curriculum. For the most part Catholic Schools have been built by the donations of Catholics believing that their children's education will not be complete unless christian values are taught at the school level as well as in the home. Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this Declaration. Yours sincerely, Bishop Daly Bishop of Sandhurst. His comments and the comments on my file from the Wodonga District Baptist Church, the Wangaratta Baptist Church, the Wodonga Ministers Fraternal, St Cuthbert's Rectory at Yarrawonga, the Assemblies of God in Australia, the Grace Presbyterian Church in Wodonga, the Salvation Army Benalla Corps, the Wangaratta Church of Christ and the Wangaratta parish of the Uniting Church have also, in various ways, expressed concern about the wording of the declaration. Members of the Beechworth 'Community Church, Our Lady's Parish Wangaratta and Glenrowan, the Uniting Church of Benalla, the Anglican Church of All Saints in Bright, the Uniting Church in Wangaratta and the Anglican Church of Yackandandah have told me that they have no problem with the declaration. I am trying to be even-handed. The Attorney-General says, 'Relax, it will not have the effect of law; do not worry about it'. I am quite sure that he is sincere in what he is saying. Equally, it is important to say, 'Why do we not accept the disallowance motion of the shadow Attorney-General and allow further consultation and allow such groups to be brought into discuss the matter and perhaps make some changes?'. That is the basis on which I support the motion of the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams). It is worthy of further discussion and we have to take account of these views.",102
197,Mr WILLIAMS,RELIGION OR BELIEF,"in reply-I will reply briefly to comments by the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) and by the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch). The honourable member for Banks seems to think that, if he replies to a letter from a constituent rejecting what the constituent has asserted, the constituent accepts it because the constituent does not do anything more about it. That is not a reason for suggesting that the concerns of those people who write letters to honourable members and senators on this subject are not genuine. The honourable member for Banks pointed to the fact that the original declaration was adopted unanimously in the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1981. He neglected to point out that the negotiation and drafting of that document by then had taken 19 years. The similarity between that and the current budget proposal, with its tortuous negotiation and flexible terms; is apparent. The honourable member for Banks also mentioned the original request from Sir Ronald Wilson regarding the, declaration. For the record, his correct name is Sir Ronald Wilson, not Sir Roland Wilson, as he has been called tonight on a number of occasions. One would not doubt his integrity or intentions in making his request. The dramatic circumstances which prompted him to make that request for the declaration highlight that the push for this declaration does not come from within Australia. He was responding to the request of a world congress for religion and peace. Internationally, there is justification for an inadequate document being promoted for the purposes for which it is used. Within Australia, there is no similar need. We do not have a problem with child prostitution or child slavery as there is in some other countries. An international request for domestic law can be responded to only by reference to domestic requirements. The honourable member for Banks read passages from the declaration as if they constituted an argument in favour of the incorporation of the declaration in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act. The passages he read, except for the preamble, are in identical terms in the ICCPR. They are not the passages to which I have objected in my comments. Turning to the comments of the Attorney General, the reason for the former Attorney General, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy), signing the declaration to enable its operation under the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act was identified as being the circumstances at the time of the\ Gulf War. At that time incidents were report-, ed of individuals of non-Muslim faith interfering with women, particularly of Muslim faith, wearing purdah, the Muslim dress. The' promulgation of the declaration under the HREOC Act has no effect on that. That is one of the points made by the Attorney-General himself. In order to meet the express need, all we need to do is rely on the provisions of the ICCPR which promote religious tolerance in general terms. We do not need t6 go to the further detail, because it has no relevance. The ICCPR gives HREOC as much as it needs to promote an acceptance and understanding in general terms of religious tolerance. We do not need provisions about necessary materials for appropriate rights to an adequate extent and other verbiage contained in the rest of the declaration. The Attorney-General mentioned that the declaration had no impact on the laws of New South Wales, as addressed by Attorney General Hannaford and the then Western Australian Attorney-General, Mr Berinson. It is not asserted by us that it does. But it has to be remembered that two functions .of the commission are relevant: the promotion of an acceptance and understanding of human rights and a function of investigating complaints of breaches or infringements of human rights by Commonwealth authorities and agencies. If the Commonwealth, through its agency, the commission, is to promote an understanding and acceptance of human rights and religious freedom and tolerance in particular, it should not be doing it in a way that gives rise to a conflict with state legislation. That is the point made by the two Attorneys-General. That point has not been answered in any way by the Attorney-General. The Attorney-General mentioned, as I did not, that there has been a lot of misinformation from extreme and fringe groups. That is accepted. But the argument does not rely upon arguments put by those groups in the community. The arguments are based on substance and not on fear. The Attorney-General also suggested that under the declaration the commission will not be pushing onto people social philosophy of its own invention. But the point must be made , again that one of the functions of the commisi sion is to promote an acceptance and understanding of religious tolerance and freedom. It does that by reference to whatever instruments are declared under the act. Prior to the declaration on 8 February, it did it by reference to the ICCPR; now it does it by reference to the declaration. What is being promoted is not the commission's version of social philosophy but that which is set out in the declaration. That is why it is so important to have regard to the terms of the declaration. The Attorney-General passed off as if it were of no moment that there may be conflicts between the instruments already declared under the act. The opposition's view is that that should be resolved before a declaration is made. It would be a simple matter if the government did its job rather than wait to let the commission do the job by promoting inconsistent policies within the Australian community. In nothing that has been said by the government is there an answer to the arguments put by the· opposition in favour of this motion. Question put: That the motion (Mr Williams's) be The House divided. [9.20 p.m.] (Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - Mr H.A. Jenkins) Ayes ............... Noes. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Majority .........

NA NA Mr WILLIAMS'(Tangney) (9.30 p-m.)-I move: That this House: (a) recognising that: (i) everyone is entitled to fundamental rights and freedoms without distinction such as based on race, sex, religion or nationality; and "" (ii) the child by reason of physical and mental immaturity needs special safeguards and care; and ' (b) noting that: (i) on 20 November 1989 the UN General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Rights of the Child (Resolution 44/25); (ii) on' 7 November 1990 the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs advised the Senate .that it would be surprising if, when Australia ratified the 'Convention, a reservation was not made acknowledging the preeminent role of the family so that in effect the Articles of the Convention would be interpreted in a way that safeguarded the primary and inalienable rights of parents; (iii) when, on 17 December 1990, the Government ratified the Convention, it made no such reservation; , (iv) on 22 December 1990 the Attorney-General declared under subsection 47(1) of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 that the Convention is an international instrument relating human rights and freedoms for the purposes of that Act; and (v) in the circumstances, there has been spread concern in the community about the potential effect of the Convention on the family in Au-traliadisallows the declaration by the Attorney-General. Like the previous motion, this motion relates to a declaration made by the former Attorney General, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy), under subsection 47(1) of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act, the HREOC Act, in this case with respect to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The effect of this declaration was to bring the rights and freedoms recognised in the UN convention within the definition of 'human rights' for the purposes of that act and the general functions of the commission with respect to human rights. At the outset, I wish to make it clear that the coalition is not opposed to the convention itself. This has always been the case. In this regard, I refer to the speech made by the  cock) in this House on 21 February 1991, just after ratification of the convention by Australia. In that speech it was made clear that the coalition, had it been in government, would have ratified the convention, but would have done so with reservations to particular articles of the convention so as to make its interpretation crystal clear. The coalition, therefore, in bringing this motion is not attacking the convention, but is rather questioning its incorporation into the HREOC Act in light of its ratification by Australia without any reservations as to its interpretation. It should also be understood that the coalition is not seeking by this motion to criticise the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The origins of the convention can be traced back to the Declaration of Geneva on the rights of the child, which was adopted by the Le-gue of Nations in 1924 in response to the needs of children after World War I. That declaration contained five principles which were general but to the point. For example, one was that children should be the first to receive relief in an emergency. The United Nations adopted its own Declato ration of the Rights of the Child in 1959, which enunciates 10 principles to guide parents, governments and voluntary organisawide- tions in their treatment of children. These principles include: non-discrimination on grounds of race, colour, sex, language, religion or political opinion; enjoyment of special treatment under the law; entitlement to a name and nationality at birth; enjoyment of social security benefits; provision of education; and protection against neglect, cruelty and exploitation. In 1979 the United Nations Human Rights Committee commenced drafting a convention dealing with children's rights. The resulting convention on the rights of the child was unanimously \ldopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 20 November 1989 and came into force internationally upon receiving its 20th ratification on 2 September 1990. Prior to the ratification of this convention by Australia, there was great concern in Australia about the potential effect of the convention on family life in this country. There was particular concern about its potential to undermine parental rights and responsibilities, particularly in so far as these rights concern education, religion, association with others and privacy. The articles in the convention relevant to these issues, being articles 12 to 16 inclusive and article 28, contain no express recognition of the primary rights and responsibilities of parents, but appear to give absolute rights to the child. The Holy See, when it ratified the convention, made a reservation to the effect that it would interpret the articles of the convention in a way that safeguards the primary and inalienable rights of parents. On 7 November 1990, prior to ratification of the convention by Australia, the then Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Tate, referring to the reservations to the convention made by the Holy See, advised the Senate: When the Australian Government ratifies the convention, should it do so, one would find that those same understandings as to the pre-eminent role of the family would be acknowledged. It would be surprising were that not the case . . . Contrary to this statement, on 17 December 1990 the government ratified the convention with no such reservation. I note that ratification took place whilst there was a motion on the Notice Paper to be moved by the honourable member for Kooyong calling on the government to undertake that, in the event that the convention was ratified by Australia, reservations would be lodged to protect the inalienable rights of the parents. The actions of the government in ratifying the treaty prior to that motion being debated ensured that there was no discussion of the convention in this House prior to its ratification. It was simply presented as a fait accompli. Concerns regarding those key articles of the convention and how they affect parental rights have resurfaced with the incorporation of the convention into the HREOC Act. Prior to ratification of the convention by Australia, Senator Evans responded to those concerns by dismissing them as 'lunatic misapprehensions'. This did absolutely nothing to set the minds of the public at rest. The only concession to these concerns in this House were references by government representatives to the preamble and article 5 of the convention and to the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which sets out rules for the interpretation of international treaties. The preamble contains a general statement about the family, stating that, as the fundamental group of society and the natural environment for the growth and well-being of all its members and particularly children, it should be afforded the necessary protection and assis,tance so that it can fully assume its responsibilities within the community. Article 5 states that the parties to the convention respect the responsibilities, rights and duties of parents or persons legally responsible for the child to provide, in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of the child, appropriate direction and guidance in' the exercise by the child of the rights recognised in the convention. However, these provisions fall short of providing the clear-cut interpretation of the convention that an express reservation as to the rights of parents would have provided. What appear to be absolute rights of children set out in articles 12 to 16 and 28 are arguably not sufficiently qualified by the vague reference to the family in the preamble. Nor are they by article 5, which recognises the rights of parents to guide their children in the exercise of the rights recognised under the convention but does not, in its terms, qualify the rights themselves. Lawyers special-sing in international law in the Attorney-General's Department may be aware of, and' have access to, the Vienna convention. But the simple fact is that those in the community who will be looking at the convention and attempting to interpret it, such as social workers, law enforcement officers and parents, ate likely never to have heard of the Vienna convention, much less to have the skills required to interpret it and apply it to the convention on the rights of the child. As a result of ratification, Australia is now bound at international law by the terms of this convention. The convention on the rights of the child obliges Australia to 'respect and ensure' the rights recognised in the convention and to do so 'without discrimination of any kind'. Specifically article 4 requires that states 'undertake all appropriate legislative, administrative, and other measures for the implementation of the rights recognised'. Unlike the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief, the subject matter of the convention on the rights of the child is already the subject of wide-ranging legislation in Australia. According to an April 1989 paper prepared by a working group on behalf of the Australian Council of Social Service, existing governshall ment law and policies appeared generally consistent with the articles of the convention. That report also pointed out that, because there is no specification of what is meant by terms such as social security, nor any detailing of other requirements, it is difficult to determine clearly the question of compliance in relation to particular issues. In November 1989, Justice Elizabeth Evatt of the Australian Law Reform' Commission indicated that in order to bring Australian laws into basic conformity with the convention it 'might be necessary for legislative action to be taken in many areas, including family law, marriage, children's legal services, social security and adoption. Despite these observations; ratification of the convention took place without the passage of enabling legislation either at the state or territory level or the Commonwealth level. When questioned by Senator Dura.ck On 22 November 1989 as towhe.ther t-e government had examined state child welfare laws in relation to many of the matters covered by the convention and made any judgm-nt about their adequacy to protect the rights of Australian children, the Minister for, Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) stated .that in the government's jQdgment no Australian law was in contravention of t}le provisions of the convention. At the time of announcing ratification of the convention, Senator Gareth Evans and the Attorney-General again confidentially :stated that state and territory laws alrea.dy enable Australia to m-et all the obligations that the convention would. impose"" subject to one exception which was the subject of areserva tion,namely that. child and adult <{riminal offenders be imprisoned separately. It seems that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and the Australian. Council of Social Service were not convinced. In 1991 they engaged the Public Interest Advocacy Centre. to conduct· a six-month review into the implications of the convention for. Australian law and practice relating to children. I understand that this reviewha!i yet to be finished and has been put on,the backburner for the time being, reflecting ,the ,difficulties involved in actually interpreting the convention. The government has therefore bound Australia to a convention where it is unclear whether Australian laws comply with it or what legislative changes are needed to enable Australia to comply with it at Commonwealth, state and territory levels. These are issues which should have been fully explored prior to ratification. No-one should argue with the general objectives of the UN convention, namely, to prevent the exploitation of children and to ensure their rights are recognised. The convention is directed towards preventing such dreadful practices as child prostitution' and slavery and towards ensuring adequate representation of children in legal proceedings and for other desirable objectives. However,given the lack of clarity, of the terms of the convention and, the acknowledged difficulties in interpreting it, given the government's failure to make an e-press reservation at the time of ratification that would have clarified the meaning of crucial articles of the convention, and given the widespread cC)flcern that this has generated in the community, its Wholesale incorporation into the HREOC Act is highly undesirable. As with the UN religious declaration, the incorporation of the convention under the HREOC Act also illustrates the unsatisfactory structure of the HREOC Act alluded to earlier this evening. The functions of the commission are set out in . section 11 of that act and include the examination of a relevant international instrument in order to ascertain whether there are any inconsistencies between that instrument and any other international instruments already incorporated into the definition of human rights in that act. Relevant international instruments are defined to be those declared under section 47 of the act. In so declaring an instrument under the act, it also brings the rights and freedoms recognised in the instrument within the other functions of the commission. Those functions include inquiring into any act or practice' of the Commonwelllth or its agencies which may be contrary to the rights and freedoms recognised in the instlJlment, promoting an understanding an- acceptance of those rights in Australia and reporting to the minister as to what laws should be made by the Commonwealth or action that should be taken by the Commonwealth in, relation to those rights. Thus, by declaring an instrument under the HREOC Act, the commission is given the function of promoting rights and freedoms which may-and on my analysis almost certainly do:-conflict with rights in other instruments already under the act. The anomaly is that the act creates a situation where the commission does not have the power to examine an international instrument to see whether it is inconsistent with an instrument already incorporated in the act unless the commission is put in the position of having to promote both instruments. Given the uncertainty that presently exists as to whether Australian laws are in compliance with the convention, the commission may be obliged to promote rights and freedoms recognised in the convention which are in fact inconsistent with existing Australian laws-a ludicrous situation. As with the United Nations religious declaration, the submissions received by the opposition in relation to this convention have revealed a serious lack of understanding amongst hundreds of members of the public about the impact of Australia ratifying United Nations conventions, the means by which they become part of the domestic law of Australia, the role and powers of the commission and the effect of declaring international instruments under the HREOC Act. The government has failed to educate and inform the community about how the convention will impact upon family life in Australia and is consequently responsible for causing deep and widespread concern in the community. What should occur is that the ministerial declaration under the HREOC Act should be disallowed pursuant to this motion. The government should then do what it should have done years ago. It should carefully review the convention and ascertain whether Australian laws-Commonwealth, state or territory-are consistent with its provisions when correctly interpreted. It should enact any legislation required pursuant to that review and request the states or territories to do the same. The Attorney General (Mr Lavarch) should give careful consideration to whether, in light of the relevant legislation, any declaration under the HREOC Act is necessary. If the prior steps are appropriately implemented, he should be able to conclude that such a declaration is necessary. The government should support this motion and then do its job properly.",103
198,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,THE CHILD,Is the motion seconded? Mr Charles-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,109
199,Mr LAVARCH,THE CHILD,"While I was not at all critical of the honourable member for Tangney, the shadow Attorney-General (Mr Williams), for bringing forward the previous disallowance motion, I am not so forthcoming in my attitude in relation to this particular motion. This particular matter has been well canvassed and well debated by this parliament on quite a number of occasions. Mr Bradford-When?",109
200,Mr LAVARCH,THE CHILD,"It has been debated in this House, it has been debated in the Senate and it has been before Senate estimates committees. Mr Bradford-It has never been debated in this House.",109
201,Mr LAVARCH,THE CHILD,"The honourable member for MCPherson is quite mistaken. If he had been listening to the shadow Attorney General, he would have heard him refer to a debate in this chamber. In fact, it was a speech by the honourable member for Koo ber should not contradict his own spokesman on the matter. It has been debated in this House, it has been debated in the Senate and it has been debated in Senate estimates committees at some length. In fact, it was raised at Senate estimates committees quite recently. That does not mean that it should not be debated, but I do not believe that at this stage we should be trying to disallow the whole instrument. The honourable member for Tangney has stated as a starting point that, firstly, the coalition does not oppose the convention but does oppose certain aspects of it-most particularly the fact that there is not a reservation to a number of the articles. The idea of a reservation would be to make it clear that the rights of the children canvassed unin these particular articles .must be read in light of the pre-eminence to be given to the family in the role of parents. Two lines were advanced in support of this argument. The first line was .that former Senator Tate, when questioned about this matter in the Senate, basically gave an undertaking that there would be such a reservation and that reservation was not made. The honourable member quoted Senator Tate, but he did not finish the quote-in fact he finished halfway through the sentence. The honourable member quoted Senator Tate as saying, 'It would be surprising were that not the case' - implying that there was a full stop. In fact, that was a comma. Senator Tate then went on to say: . . . given the fact that Australia meaning that for the first time in the international community a document was open to ratification which recognised that pre-eminent role of the family, parents or legal guardians in giving guidance and direction to children in accordance with their evolving capacities. Senator Tate was saying that the government recognised the pre-eminent importance of parents in the family. Indeed, Australia was instrumental in inserting article 5, which inserted this requirement into the convention in the first place, and it would be surprising if Australia were not completely and totally supportive of it. I think it is a little bit misleading to attribute that to former Senator Tate. If we go on from that point, the next line of argument was that the Holy See had made such a reservation and this was evidence that Australia should likewise have had such a reservation. As much as I have been able to ascertain from the checks my department has been able to do-I do not pretend that this may be absolutely gospel-no other country has made a reservation along the lines being proposed by the honourable member tonight and by the coalition over the last couple of years. The Holy See has, but none of the well over 100 or so countries which have ratified this convention has made a similar reservation. Despite the honourable member saying it was only arguable whether the convention has to be interpreted in light of the preamble in article 5, no-one else seems to have the same difficulty in interpreting the preamble. Let us not be so timid and meek about the ability of the human rights commission or governments-or courts, if it came down to that-to actually interpret this document properly. It is quite clear that the document has to be read as a whole, and that article 5 does mean that those specific articles referring to education, religion, privacy and what-haveyou, as the honourable member mentioned, are to be read in accordance with that particular article. As best as I have been able to determine, other countries have not considered it necessary to put such a motion. I have enough confidence in Australians, in our institutions and in the human rights commission to believe also that such a reservation is inserted article 5, not necessary. The other line of argument that the honourable member advanced was that the correct procedure which should be followed with ratifications and when adding instruments to . the armoury of the human rights commission is to undergo a check to see whether all Australian laws comply with the test which will be set down by this particular convention. Only if all the laws did in fact comply would we then add the convention to the human rights commission's armoury. In saying that, the honourable member skirted rather quickly· around the fact that Australia is a federation. Obviously the Commonwealth has control over its own laws and actions, but it has far less control-nor should it have control-over the laws and actions of state governments. While it may well be sound practice for an examination to be undertaken of the existing law of the country to check whether the convention is complied with, I do not believe it is any argument at all to say that we think a law in Tasmania or a law operating in Queensland may not comply and therefore we will not ratify or take any further action on this convention until the parliament of that state amends its laws accordingly. If that were the case, honestly, the Commonwealth would never do anything. Time and time again we have found in this country that it is somewhat difficult to get all the states to agree on a particular course of action at any particular time. Surely that is the very reason why we have a body like the human rights commission, with the power to undertake broad investigations and examinations of the state of Australian laws, so that such deficiencies which may exist can· be identified and brought to public attention and so that scrutiny can be brought to bear on laws when they are inadequate. Surely that is one of the reasons why the commission is there in the first place. For us, at this stage, to go down the path which is being proposed tonight I believe would subject this country to some ridicule. I have to say that that is not just my opinion. I would like to read to the House a letter I received today from the Law Council of Australia-a body with which the shadow Attorney-General would be quite familiar and, I have no doubt, for which he has high regard and respect. This letter reads: Dear Attorney-General You will be aware of the notice of motion-which I understand is to be debated later today-given by the Shadow Attorney-General, Mr Williams, calling for disallowance of a declaration by the Attorney General that the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child is an international instrument relating to human rights and freedoms for the purposes of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act. The Law Council is concerned that the motion, if adopted, may prevent the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission from fully carrying out its responsibilities under the Convention, or at least may limit the Commission's role in relation to the . Convention. The Law Council believes adoption of the motion would be embarrassing to Australia. Further, it would cut across and undermine much of what was achieved and agreed upon at the recent World Congress on Family Law and Children's Rights, held in Sydney, which the Law Council and LAWASIA sponsored. The Congress called upon all governments which have not yet done so to give immediate and serious consideration to the ratification and implementation of the Convention. It also called on all governments to establish, develop and support at the national, regional and international levels effective, independent machinery to monitor compliance with the rights prescribed in the Convention, and to provide adequate resources to enable that machinery to operate. For Australia to take the step contemplated in Mr Williams' motion would, the Law Council believes, be most unfortunate and would be likely to hold Australia up to ridicule in the international community. We believe the Convention sets out the rights of children in a proper and commendable way, and we do not believe it holds any threat to the rights of parents to fulfil their obligations to their children, or any threat to the family, as alleged in the motion. Indeed, in several specific provisions particular weight is given to the central role of parents in guiding and supporting children in the exercise and protection of those rights. We understand that the Convention is supported by a wide range of organisations in Australia, including the Uniting Church Social Responsibility Committee, the Australian Early Childhood Association, the Youth Affairs Council, and others. With best wishes John Mansfield John Mansfield QC is the Acting President of the Law Council. I commend the views of the Law Council to the House. This is an important convention. The actions of the government have been appropriate. Indeed, a response is currently being prepared, as the honourable member alluded to, in terms of Australia's compliance with the convention. It has not, as the honourable member suggested, been placed on the backburner or been found to be too hard due to problems of interpretation or anything of the sort. The government's response is currently with state governments in order that the response be a truly representative response of the governments of this nation. Other responses have been prepared, one by non-government organisations. Indeed, some laws have been identified that--""in the views of some of these nongovernment organisations-need to be changed. Those laws I think relate in particular to provisions dealing with wards of the state, care and control orders which come under. state laws and, indeed, the actions of governments-state .governments in particular-in protecting and enhancing the rights of children. I do not deny the honourable member's genuine belief that the document may be imprecisely drafted in some way, or interpreted in contrast with some other instruments also before HREOC. But, for goodness sake, I do not believe that is a ground for saying that we should disallow the instrument and go down the path which the honourable member is suggesting. I do not believe that is a practical course for us to be adopting. The convention is an important one. It is important that HREOC play a role in it. I commend the views of the Law Council of Australia to the House, and I ask honourable members to think seriously about this before casting their votes. I think it is very straightforward. This disallowance motion should not be supported.",109
202,Mr STEELE HALL,THE CHILD,"I do not support the motion for the disallowance of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child because, obviously, I support the inclusion of the definition of 'human rights' concerning the declaration· of the rights of the child in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act. I do so because it is very important indeed that we have the right signals in relation to the protection of children both inside and outside Australia. We should join the international community in sending those signals. In opposing this motion I refer to a reservation that the originator of the motion said might have been contemplated when the treaty was ratified by the Australian government. He said: ... a reservationwas not made acknowledging the pre-eminent role of the family so that Articles of the Convention would be interpreted in a way that safeguarded the primary and inalienable rights of parents; A very significant change was made and included in article 5 at the request of the Australian government. However, I go back to the definition of what would be the 'primary and inalienable rights of parents'. I suppose we could come to some sort of broad definition of 'primary' but what would be 'inalienable'? Parents have rights that are not inalienable. A parent may not deny a child an education; a parent may not injure a child. If a parent does either of those things, those children can be taken away by the state. It is not an inalienable right to injure children, and so it would be very difficult to insert those definitions. What has the Human Rights Commissioner said? I quote from a communication that he sent to members in the latter part of last month: Clearly, the family generally provides the best protection for the rights of children. However, families often need assistance to help them fulfil their responsibilities. Tragically, tens of thousands of children in Australia lack the protection of a family at all. For these reasons this Commission strongly supports the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Why would he do that? We should read the convention if we ask that question. From the preamble to the convention I selected this paragraph: Recognising that the child, for the full and harmonious development of his or her personality, should grow up in a family environment, in an atmosphere of happiness, love and understanding. Another paragraph says: Recognising that, in all countries in the world, there are children living in exceptionally difficult conditions, and that such children need special consideration. Article 2 says: States Parties shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that the child is protected against all forms of discrimination or punishment on the basis of the status, activities, expressed opinions, or beliefs of the child's parents, legal guardians, or family members. However, article 5 covers the question of a in effect the reservation. It says: States Parties shall respect the responsibilities, rights and duties of parents or, where applicable, the members of the extended family or community as provided for by local custom, legal guardians or other persons legally responsible for the child, to provide, in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of the child, appropriate direction and guidance in the exercise by the child of the rights recognised in the present Convention. That is as clear a definition of family responsibility for children as one can consistently and sensibly put in there. I obtained from the library a research paper which goes through the various aspects applying the convention to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. It is worth reading this matter into Hansard because it simplifies something which has been very much complicated by members of the public-often out of fear and at the instigation of people who know nothing of what they write in protest-and by some members of parliament. The research paper says: TheSe words 'human rights' are used in the Act in order to define the functions of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission ... they include the function of examining enactments or bills for the purposes of ascertaining whether they are inconsistent with any human right, and inquiring into and endeavouring to conciliate complaints where the Commission considers that an act or practice may be inconsistent with any human right. The Commission. may report to the Minister upon any action which the Commission considers needs to be taken by Australia in order to comply with the provisions of any 'international instrument' it may prepare and publish guidelines for the avoidance o- acts or practices which are inc.onsistent with or contrary to any human right. The Commission is also granted educative, research and promo-ional functions in relation to human rights, and the right, with the leave of the couit; to intervene in any proceedings that involve human rights issues. It must be sttessed that the declaration of the Convention on the Rights of the Child or the Declaration on Religious Discrimination as 'international instruments' for the purposes of ,the Act does not make them part of Australian domestic lawI repeat that: . "" . does not make them part of Australian domestic law ... The only redress that - n individual may have for the breach of his or her human rights flS identified in these documents is to complain to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. So we are not dealing with iaw as passed by this parliament. Any action to be taken - nce this is included in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity .Commission Act will have to be taken by Australian legislators in this place. What are we talking about? From where has this fog generated? Why has it been generat\!d? We have had long, wide, constructive public argQment about the dangers of this measure. What we are talking about is future action to be taken by this House. The human rights commission has an educative and interventionist role-an educative and safeguarding role. It has no power to incarcerate Australians because they do not agree with this convention. That would be nonsense. As with so many matters creating change, therare always people who will oppose it. I read, With interest section 116 of the constitution. I wonder what hell of a job it would be to· put. that section in there now. It says: The Commonwealth shall not make any law for establishing any religion or for imposing any religious observance or for prohibiting the free exerci&e of any religion, and no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office of public trust under the Commonwealth. I dare. anyone to get' that in the constitution today because of the odd, diso-ganised and befuddled arguments which are generated and amorigthe public against these sorts of changes. There isa need for a convention, and there has been no greateriJIustration of that fact than an article published in, the Adelaide Advertiser on 21 August this year. It started off emotionally by saying: . . For years, centuries, they have been the forgotten children. Bruised, burned and battered, they have hidden their scars behind respectable suburban doors until a friend or neighbour has notified the authorities or until their tiny bodies can take no more. The violent deaths of six children in the past (our weeks have brutally exposed the hidden shame of a society that has neglected its young: Mr Bradford interjecting",112
203,Mr STEELE HALL,THE CHILD,"It goes on-and this will interest the honourable member for MCPherson-to present these figures: More than 20,800 substantiated cases of child abuse were reported in 1991. The State by State figures an-: Victoria (2427 cases)And so it goes through the various states, showing the objectionable ratio of one to the other. There were 20,800 substantiated cases of child abuse. How many others went unre"" ported? The figures demonstrate that the legislators are not doing enough to help these children who are tortured within our community, let alone the millions of children around the world for whom this convention expresses the desire to protect-be they working in the brick kilns of India or the rug-making factories· of the Orient. We could go around the world and find this objectionable .factor-the intolerance and torture of children. We also find it right here in Australia. So why would we not express opinions or investigate these matters? As I said, we are not doing enough, but there are signs of· encouragement. The New South Wales government is acting on the.matter of unsatisfactory restraining orders. The most horrifying crimes have been committed in recent months by people who have supposedly been removed from a threatening situation in their families. The restraining order has not Cleary, P. R. been good enough. To its credit, the New South Wales government is moving in that direction. We have to move to protect further the children of Australia. We have to be aware of that need, which we have not been aware of enough until now. That is a responsibility that we all bear-every one of us. Are we going to hide it when this convention comes along because someone does not like the United Nations? If people with a very odd fundamentalist view write to us are we going to knock the convention out? What an absurdity! What an issue of leadership! I am writing back to the protesters who write to me and I say, 'Will you please point out the exact words to which you object'. They will have to get together in a great convocation to find them. They have never been told about them yet; they have just been told that the convention is bad. I welcome this opportunity to say why I will vote against this motion. The facts are that it is a very simple issue. It has been occluded arid befogged by all of this odd opposition in this community. I stand against this motion and for the convention. I will very avidly explain it to my electors, and I will take their judgment on it.",113

206,Mr REID,ADJOURNMENT,"A constituent came into my office in Bendigo today. His name is Mr Andrew. He lives in Bendigo and is married. He has one child. His wife works in a government job earning about $27,000 a year. Mr Andrew is unemployed and has been for some time. He qualified for the jobstart allowance, having been out of work for six months. He finally got a'job and the employer collected the jobstart subsidy. When the subsidy ran out after the 16-week period, Mr Andrew says that he lost his job because the employer could not afford to pay the full wage, although Mr Andrew was kept on for a further two weeks. Now he has no job, and the Department of Employment, Education and Training has told him he has to be unemployed for another six months before being eligible for the jobstart subsidy again. As he pointed out, few employers will put anyone on without the subsidy. He is not eligible for unemployment benefits because his wife works. I ask the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley)-who I saw briefly in .the chamber but apparently he has left; perhaps the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bitney), who is at the table, would be kind enough to take up this issue with him-why a person who qualifies for the subsidy and is lucky enough to get work is then forced to start all over again to requalify just because of being unable to find a job, even though the job has been a short-term One. Where is the incentive to look for work? As Mr Andrew says, where is the incentive for his wife to keep her job when they would be better off if she were unemployed too? They would then get all of the benefits available, such as a health care card and all the other benefits. I ask the minister at the table to up that matter with the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Clark, Professor Manning Thompson, Edward Palmer",115
207,Mr TANNER,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to refer tonight to two historians. Firstly, I refer to the recent controversy with respect to the Australian historian Manning Clark that was initiated by an article by Peter Ryan in that well-known journal Quadrant. I would like .to say that that particular attack was essentially a politically motivated attack which comes from what I would describe as the old Right within the Australian community, which has for a long time felt very keenly the lack of intellectuals in the literary and historical arena on the right of the political spectrum. That part of the community has been keen to ensure that people such as Manning Clark, who has been seen to have essentially Left-oriented perspectives on Australian history in society, should be denigrated and torn down. Certainly one can put forward evidence that Manning Clark made some inaccurate references in some of his volumes. His style was a bit florid, but there is no doubt that there have been many Australians who have been inspired to an interest and a love of Australian history by Manning Clark's works. I, like numerous other people in this House, studied some of his works as a student. They have certainly been an inspiration to people who, in earlier days, had been brought up on history that essentially regarded Australia as a footnote to the British empire. For the first time, we had a historian who was pursuing an independent and nationally identifiable orientation with Australian history. So I would like to place on record my  attack, and to indicate that it is in keeping with his previously expressed political views in a number of other areas. It is essentially a politically motivated attack with limited substance. I suggest to the House the fact that Manning Clark may have, on one or two occasions, actually committed the severe crime of being a bit drunk before a lecture is take hardly the basis to impugn his reputation as a historian. The other historian that I would like to refer to is somebody whom honourable members opposite have probably never heard of, but never mind, and that is E.P. Thompson. Edward Palmer Thompson, amongst other achievements, was vice-president of the campaign for nuclear disarmament in England. He was also a founding member of the European nuclear disarmament movement, and the author of the seminal work The Making of the English Working Class, which was published in 1963. He'was also a lecturer at the University of Warwick in England. E.P. Thompson inspired and influenced a whole generation of historians, not only in England but in other countries, including Australia. I feel it is appropriate that his passing on the weekend be noted in this way because he has made a substantial contribution to intellectual debate, not only in his own country but in Europe and in this country as well. He was also a leading figure in a great international cause-nuclear disannament. South Sea Islanders",116
208,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,ADJOURNMENT,"Over the last few months, what has been overlooked in the debate that we have had on Mabo-the· claims and counterclaims-is the future and the plight of20,000 Australians who· are of South Sea Islander descent. I mention this because it has been in only the recent five to six years that these people have been segregated further still, falling outside the limb of any assistance they might have had available under ATSIC in the past. Not being indigenous people, they have now been sidelined, and they are probably the most deprived of the ethnic groups in Australia. As I have said, I understand that there are about 15,000 to 20,000 of these Australians in this situation. Within the last couple of months, and in amongst the Mabo dispute, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission has published the report The call for recognition. The main points of that report are set out in a statement Human rights report on South Sea Islanders, which states: ... recognise Australian South Sea Islanders as a unique minority group severely disadvantaged by racial discrimination, according to that report ... ... the report concludes that Australia's South Sea Islanders have suffered from a century of racial discrimination and harsh treatment. This has contributed to their being one of the most disadvanSouth taged groups in Australia. School retention, employment skills, home ownership and health are identified as areas of particular need. The report also notes that governments have denied South Sea Islanders recognition as a distinct black minority group. Until recently it was common for South Sea Islanders to access government programs for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. However this access is now being denied and the South Sea Islanders are being forced into mainstream programs which are culturally inappropriate. This report calls for action-and awaits the action-by both state and federal governments. The Queensland government also has a responsibility in this regard. In my own area, there are an estimated 4,000 to 5,000 people who are descendants of what used to be known as a. proud Kanaka race. Their history is a very proud one as far as the development of the sugar industry and their community are concerned, and the means by which they have accepted Christianity. They have kept their heritage and have kept their traditions, yet they are being denied any access to what had been mainstream programs. Certainly their traditions and culture are there. I would like to put on record that probably one of the greatest contributors from the South Sea Islander community presently captains the Australian Kangaroos. I think that is a mark of respect to the man himself, and also his acknowledgment of. the people he represents. The history of discrimination against these people by older Australians is not a proud one. If honourable members look back to the blackbirding from the islands from 1875 onwards, they might recall the savage repatriation of these people to the islands when there was a tremendous and indiscriminate loss of life. That was the first discrimination. Because they are not indigenous people, they have no entitlement under ATSIC. There is a discrimination, as the report indicates, in housing, health, legal affairs and education. I mention legal affairs particularly because they do not have access to ATSIC legal services. Another point is that there is no recognition of these people as a significant ethnic group as there is with many others within the community. So I say without a doubt that the Sea Islanders are a most disadvantaged group within our society. I had a particularly good friend of South Sea Islander extraction- MrNoel Fatnowna, who died early in 1991. He was one of the recognised citizens of Mackay. I do not say 'black citizens'; I say 'recognised citizens'. He was recognised for his voluntary work, his help within the' ambulance service and everything else that was associated with things we like to call good in Australia. He had a book written, entitled Fragments of a Lost Heritage, which details the history of South Sea Islanders in Australia-how they came here and what has been their lot since. He had the one common theme that if we live in Australia we are all Australians. But in fact these people are not being treated as we are treated, although he was proud to be an Australian. I think it is very important six recommendations in the report be acted upon quickly in order that we can end this discrimination and bring .these people into mainstream Australia so that they can confidently be called proper and proud Australians. Torres Strait Health Strategy",117
209,Mr DODD,ADJOURNMENT,"One of the most memorable and inspiring events I have attended since becoming the member for Ldchhardt occurred one afternoon last April on Thursday Island in the Torres Strait, in my electorate. On that day I represented the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) and presented the government's position and sat in on several workshops to develop a Torres Strait health strategy.. It was an inspiring occasion for me because of the dedication and determination that I sensed in the participants. There was a sense of new opportunities opening up and .a resolve to turn around unacceptable health statistics by adopting local control at the community level. To be frank, the statistics are totally unacceptable any standards. The current life expectancy of the people of the Torres Strai,t region is some 23 years less than for people in the rest of Australia and Torres Strait women have a life expectancy that is 30 years less. The three-day workshop in April was a forum for presenting and discussing the requirements and priorities of the Torres Strait community. There were representatives from community and government organisations, health workers, island council chairmen and individuals concerned with the currerit health status and facilities provided in the region. The primary· aim was to gather information from individuals on exactly what health issues need to be addressed and to determine the most effecth'e and culturally appropriate manner in,. which to address them. This information was gathered together and presented in one. pocument. I had the pleasure on Thursday Island to represent both the Queensland Minister for Health, the Hon. Ken Hayward, and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) in accepting this strategy on behalf of the Commonwealth and that the state governments. Congratulations for this document are in order, especially to Mr Alan Mosby, a member of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, who more or less launched the policy, and Elle Gafney, who spoke ably of her long fight for adequate health services in the Torres Strait. A special mention also goes to  executive officer of the Torres sector of the regional area health authority, who was the driving force behind this document. Local people taking control and responsibility was a strong focus of the workshop and is therefore essential to this strategy. It is a principle which I wholeheartedly support. I was delighted to hear that the Torres Strait Health Council is already developing proposals that implement this idea. Eight areas were addressed in the workshop, including environment, housing and infrastructure which is a vitally important matter in the Torres Strait. We cannot have proper health facilities if we do not have proper by housing, if we have overcrowded housing and if we do not have sewerage. services. The other areas discussed were nutrition, access to health services, community involvement and traditional culture, alcohol and substance abuse, women's health, infectious diseases and mental health. I congratulate the people of the Torres Strait for putting together this. strategy. It is part of the Commonwealth, government's national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health strategy. It is vitally important, because of the statistics that I have referred to earlier, that the government give total support to this strategy. I will be doing everything I can to urge both state and federal governments to support the people of the Torres. Strait so that we can do something about the appalling health statistics to which I referred earlier. Convention on the Rights of the Child",118
210,Mr CHARLES,ADJOURNMENT,"La Trobe) (10.44 p.m.)The House of Representatives of Australia is no longer a democratic institution. For some time. I have had major concerns that we are largely superfluous in this place as the execconcern. utive runs roughshod over the parliament and drives issue after issue through this House under gag and under guillotine. Honest to goodness, since this House has tesumed the budget sitting, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in a fit of anger directed at Senate for having had the audacity to set limits on presentation of important bills consideration has effectively closed the down as a democratic institution. The opposition no longer has the opportuniday ty to raise matters of national and public importance, to criticise ministers or to pend standing orders to discuss the issues of parliament. importance to this parliament. Tonight, in debate on an issue of national significance which has. now been running for some 21/2 years without proper debate in this parliament, the parliament was gagged and I was preventparliament. ed from speaking on an issue about which have great concern. Mr Bilney-By your whip.",119
211,Mr CHARLES,ADJOURNMENT,"By your whip who stood because and denied me the right to speak. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child is an issue about which I have had great concern for a long time. My concerns are not for the generality of the convention, which I ties. absolutely and heartily support. The convention is a document which was long years in the making and long years later than it should have held birth. Unfortunately, in a great rush at the end, I believe that those fine gentlemen, the bureaucrats who put together the UN expressed Convention on the Rights of the Child, made a few mistakes in English. Those mistakes in English have created great concern in my electorate. I have files' in my office over 12 inches thick consisting of letters from concerned parents and individuals, church groups and others within the community-not right ideologues-who want to make sure that they will continue to be able to exercise their rights as parents to give direction, and succour to their children without overt action by the state. There are a number of articles, being specifically 12 to 16, which if read in isolation from either the preamble or article 5 could give cause to their rise for The Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) tonight stated that this was an issue that was well for canvassed and debated in this House. The convention itself was ratified by the govern the ment without recourse to this House in time December 1990. Subsequently, the then for shadow Attorney-General, the honourable  the issue in private members time on Thursmorning and two speakers from each side were allowed to debate the issue briefly. It sushas not had wide canvass or debate in this I have in my possession 12 inches of files of concern by constituents in my electorate and I am unable to address .the issues in this Those concerns are real. We have I too frequently seen parents disappointed by . actions taken by state communities. Many parents seem not to trust the convention their intuition tells them that the document is likely to exacerbate the day-today development of conflict between parents and children and engender a feeling in children that their rights exceed their responsibiliThe convention fails to make logical connection between the rights of children as a philosophy and protection of children in need. Significant community concerns have been regarding those articles. If read in isolation, they have the potential to deny parents their rights and responsibilities for protection, development and direction of their children. I believe a mistake has been made in this place tonight and that democracy has been seriously curtailed in gagging once again the right of representatives to debate importwing ant issues. We have to do something to straighten this place out because, honest to goodness, we might as well not have a parliacomfort ment the way it is going. Raglan Ranges",119
212,Mr ADAMS,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to speak on this adjournment debate to raise an issue involving the west of my electorate. The Raglan Range is an area that has been logged since the 1930s and was given World Heritage status several years ago. The Bradshaw family has worked this area for many years, pulling sawlogs and transporting them along the Raglan Range Road to mill them in their mills. When this area achieved World Heritage status several years ago the road was closed off. The road had a gate put across it and it was left for walkers and traditional users. Two months ago the state division of parks, wildlife and heritage decided to rehabilitate the road. This is the essence of my concern tonight. The state division of parks, wildlife and heritage took on a value system which I believe has affected us in Tasmania for the past 10 or 15 years. It is of great concern to many of us. Its position is that traditional of land and cultural values from our history should be done away with. Areas of land which have been used for logging, hunting and fishing for many years have now been world heritage listed-and so these traditional things can no longer be done. . If world heritage status is to mean anything, It should also give recognition to the cultural values of areas, not just their tual value-or whatever someone else feels is its value. The value system which has enraged many Tasmanians-probably it is one of the issues on which I was elected to parliamenthas been imposed on the Raglan Range Road. Two months ago, under the Tasmanian minister, John Cleary, parks and wildlife, as part of the management plan for the area, decided to rehabilitate the road. The road is made of gravel, with drains on each side and incorporated along the road are several iandings for logging trucks to load up. Over time, they have been taken back by the bush. The road gives a view of the history of the area and of the logging people that worked in a very traditional and hard way over many years. Somebody decided that the road could be seen from the Frenchmans Cap national park walking track and had to be removed; it interfered with somebody's values. Returning the road to its natural state of prior to the 1930s meant putting some natural cover back on it, at a cost of $20,000.. That should not have happened. A heck of a mess has been created along this road, with broken trees and great disruption to the old track. Nothing useful has been achieved. In recent years in Tasmania we have undertaken a forest practices code. I believe that if the people who had imposed this work were subject to that code, they would shortly be going to court. I am sure that honourable members would be aware that recent land use arguments between people on the Greens side and those with traditional work values and ways of doing things have taken up a lot of time. Some of the animosity has subsided. I certainly do not wish to revisit the damming of the Franklin or to advocate the pulling of the plug on Lake Pedder. But we must be sensitive to uses everybody's needs in Tasmania. The west coasters, who have always stood up strongly for their beliefs and traditions, are finding the attitude being applied totally indefensible. The state government spent another $20,000 just down the road at Nelson Falls to create a track into the wilderness area so that somebody could have a natural walking track, when Raglan Range Road could have been scenic or spiri- used. (TIme expired) Question Time Budget 1993-94",120
213,Mrs SULLIVAN,ADJOURNMENT,"An issue arose between the Treasurer and me during question time. I sought the call on the basis of wishing to raise a point of order. In the heat of the moment I sat down without ever stating it. I noticed in checking the greens that you, Mr Speaker, were kind enough to assume that I was clarifying something that happened during the debate. My point of order was understanding order 145concerning relevance. I wanted to put that on the record for your sake, Mr Speaker. I would have spoken on the adjournment last night about some statements that were made in this House yesterday, but I was too late in the door and the House rose at 10.30 p.m. However, things that have happened today have continued the issue-and I am pleased that I did not speak on the matter then. Events. today have underlined what I was going to raise last night. When the 94 budget mark 1 was issued, Treasury analysis showed its very regressive nature. It showed, for example, that certain items were left out of the calculations of how people would be affected. The Treasury analysis did not take into account the impact of the 1 July 1995 increase in sales tax and the effect that would have particularly on low income earners. However, the analysis did show a number of startling things which have been very disturbing to the opposition, at least to the backbench of the government, and to the Australian community at large. Essentially, showed that the budget we were given at the beginning of this session was extremely regressive. Low income people would be very adversely affected and single income couples with two children would be worse off than they were 10 years ago. There were certain other assumptions, such as that all pensioners and the unemployed would receive rent assistance-and on it went. Treasury had used a very flawed model and the analysis that flowed from it was very generous towards the budget. Nevertheless, it still showed that the budget was extremely regressive. Budget mark 2 was formulated at an impromptu meeting of caucus on Monday night. My question to the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) yesterday was directed towards the outcome and modifications that we have been led to expect will happen; but, even after those changes, the poorer people would be worse off. For example, without taking account of bracket creep, the poorest 20 per cent of single-income families and the poorest 10 per cent of two-income families with children and most independent retiree couples would be worse off. The Treasurer in his answer referred to what was then a not released analysis of the budget, an analysis which he said was going to be released later that day. He made the statement: . . . 90 per cent of wage and salary earner household types on average will be shown to be better off. But the greens apparently were subsequently amended because they are slightly different 1993- from today's Hansard version. The words 'full-time' were inserted in front of 'wage and salary earners'. It is a fact of the recession we are now enduring that a substantial percentage of people in employment are underemployed. The unemployment figures do not show the effect of underemployment. So the insertion of the words 'full-time' in that context is significant. He went on to talk about 'self-employed and farm income household types'. None of these groups that he referred to are the groups that I had questioned him about. So it was the old business: when you are asked a question that you do not like, answer a different it question. He raised, in his answer, categories of people different from the ones that I had questioned him about. Yesterday afternoon, after question time, the so-called Prismod results were released. They showed that certain things were excluded. This analysis, which at question time the Treasurer was saying showed what a whacko budget it was, contained certain omissions: the income tax broadening issues; increases in the effect of fringe benefits tax and the retrospective taxation of unused annual leave; and the effect of bracket creep. They had not been taken into account, because no projections had been made past 1994-95. The government claims credit for cuts after 1994-95, but it cuts out that area when the inflationary effects of this budget are yet to be felt. (TIme eXpired) Budget 1993-94",120
214,Mrs SULLIVAN,ADJOURNMENT,"I will resume. The exclusion of such basic issues as the effect of inflation, particularly on low income people, is very significant. The issue I raised in question time today was the assumption that all motorists will use the cheaper unleaded petrol as from the time that this budget is passed. The fact is that approximately 60 per cent of Australians drive cars that require leaded petrol-which is to be significantly more expensive than unleaded petrol. The extra impact is on the very low income people, as the opposition has been saying, who are more likely to drive the older cars requiring the more expensive leaded petrol.",121
215,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 11.00 p.m., the debate is interrupted. The House stands adjourned until 9.30 a.m. tomorrow. House adjourned at 11.00 p.m. NA NA Mr Connolly to ask the SpeakerHave the (a) Joint House Department, (b) Department of the House of Representatives or (c) Department of the Senate commissioned any portraits since 1983; if so, in each case, (i) from whom was it commissioned and (ii) what sums were spent on (A) the purchase, (8) framing, (C) lighting and (D) other costs. NA The following paper was deemed to have been presented on 1 September 1993: Defence Housing Authority Act-Statement under section 10 relating to a joint venture between the Defence Housing Authority and Delfin Property Group Limited, August 1993. The following answers to questions were circulated: Superannuation (Question No. 80) Mr Forrest asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 10 May 1993: (1) Which institutions have been approved for the receipt of deposits under the Superannuation Guarantee Charge legislation. (2) What total sum (a) has been placed with approved institutions under the legislation since 1 July 1992 and (b) was placed before 1 July 1992 as required by awards. (3) What proportions of the total sum referred in part (2) have been deposited on behalf of employees undertaking itinerant, seasonally intermittent or casual labour. (4) Is he able to say what part of the funds received on behalf of the employees referred to in part (3) has been consumed in management charges and taxes. (5) Is he able to say what sum needs to be deposited on behalf of an employee for there to be a net gain to the employee at the end of each year. (6) Has the option of requiring employers to pay a sum equal to the Superannuation Guarantee Charge directly to the employees described in part (3), instead of an approved institution, where the charge is less than the sum identified in part (5) been examined; if so, what was the outcome. Mr Dawkins-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 requires that contributions must be made to a fund which complies with the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987 for Superannuation Guarantee Charge purposes. (2), (3) and (4) These data are not available. (5) No. The sum depends on the level of administrative charges, returns on investment and net tax paid, all of which can vary considerably from fund to fund. Nevertheless, funds typically impose an administrative charge of around $1 per week per account to which must be added, in some cases, fund management fees (often of the order of 0.5 per cent of the value of the fund), premiums for death and disability cover, and entry and exit fees. NA (6) The Government is currently assessing ways to protect the value ofsmall contributions required under the Superannuation Guarantee arrangements and, in that context, I have noted the honourable member's suggestion. Republic Advisory Committee (Question No. 295) Mr Truss asked the Special Minister of State, upon notice, on 19 August 1993: (1) Does the 1992-93 Budget include a commitment to spend $600 000 to establish a Republic to Advisory Committee and a further $200 000 for the Committee in each subsequent year until 1996-97. (2) What funds will the Government provide during the same period to organisations and groups opposed to becoming a republic.",122
216,Mr WALKER,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) There is no commitment in the 1992-93 Budget to provide funding for a Republic Advisory Committee, but $55 000 was provided to the Committee in the Additional Estimates in May 1993. The 1993-94 Budget provides $551 000 for the Republic Advisory Committee, the secretariat services being provided to it by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and any further constitutional reform activity arising this financial year. The Committee's task will be finished when it reports at the end of September 1993. The 199394 Budget did contain a commitment to spend $200 000 in the out years for constitutional reform activity. . (2) The terms of reference of the Republic Advisory Committee require it to produce im options paper which describes the minimum constitutional changes necessary to achieve a viable federal republic of Australia, maintaining the effect of our current conventions and principles of government. The Committee was asked to describe and analyse the practical possibilities and the main arguments for and against them, but was instructed not to make recommendations as such. The Government has not funded any groups which are in favour of either continuing the constitutional monarchy or changing to a republic and has no plans to fund any of the participants in this ongoing debate.",123
