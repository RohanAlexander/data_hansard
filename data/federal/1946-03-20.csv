2,Mr CHIFIEY,CONDITIONS ON JAPANESE DESTROYER," by leaveLast week, the honourable members for Reid (Mr Morgan), Parramatta (Sir Frederick' Stewart) and Boothby (Mr. . Sheehy) asked questions in regard to the use of war gratuities for the erection and purcliase of homes. Section -22 of the War Gratuity Act 1945, provides for the transfer of a war gratuity credit to the War Service Homes Commissioner or any other authority towards the cost of the erection or purchase of a dwelling-house for an ex-member of the forces. The implementation of this sectionhas been exhaustively considered by a committee representative of the Treasury and the War Service Homos Commission. The committee has made recommeudations, which are briefly summarized thus(1) For the purposes of section 22, the prescribed authority should be the war gratuity boards'as defined in the War Gratuity Regulations ; (2) "" Any other ' authority "" within the meaning of section 22 should be limited to the following:-(i ) Commonwealth instrumentality; (ii) State instrumentality; (i i i ) Local government authority; (iv) bank authorized under the' Banking Act to carry on banking business, in Australia; (v) life insurancecompany; (vi) friendly society; (vii) building society registered under a law of a State; (viii) 'co-operative housing society uuder the law of the State of Victoria. (3) Xeither private mortgagees nor financing companies, nor building companies should be approved; (4) Money advanced by an - approved .authority shall be made available bona-fide for the erection or purchase of a dwelling-house; (5) A life insurance company shall not require a member to take out any policy as a condition of accepting transfer of credit; (6) A formal notification of approval should be issued to each of the lending authorities approved; (7) The dwelling-house shall be used as a home for the memher and hi; dependants; (8) The ownership of another hoiun should not be a bar to the purchase of a new one; (9) The rate of interest which may he charged under uny mortgage or contract of sale should be limited to a maximum of 4$ per cent, per annum; (10) The member way use his war gratuity credit to reduce an existing mortgage on a houso purchased some years ago - and used by him as a home; (11) The member shall receive, to the extent of the present value of the (jratuity transferred, a full reduction on the outstanding liability for capital and interest; (12) In view of the difficulties associated with the transfer of war gratuity credits and the advantages to the member to be gained by cash payments, a regulation sliould be issued under section 21 of the War Gratuity Act permitting cash payment to bo mads to the lending authority where the war gratuity credit has been transferred to that authority under section 22. The War Gratuity Board wou'd then be able to arrange for immediate Ifr. Chiflev. - payment of the transferred credit so that the member will obtain an immediate reduction of his liability by the face value of the gratuity. The Government accepts these recommendations, and a regulation will be promulgated to permit war gratuity boards to authorize the payment of cash for a transferred war gratuity credit.

3,Mr CONELAN,CONDITIONS ON JAPANESE DESTROYER,"Can the Minister for the Army say when the public will 1 be acquainted with the facts elicited at the Darwin Military Court trials of Japanese war criminals, as promised by the President of the Court, so that public feeling concerning the outrageous decisions of the court may be allayed as quickly as possible? In view of the resentment aroused in Australia, will the findings of the court be considered by the Governmer.t?",13
4,Mr FORDE,CONDITIONS ON JAPANESE DESTROYER,"I cannot say when the evidence submitted to the court will be made uvailable to the public. So' far, I have not received any report on the subject apart from what I have read in the newspapers. Last night's Melbourne Herald contains a statement by Lieutenant-Colonel Arnold Brown, D.S.O., M.O., OBE., President of the Darwin Military Court, in which he replied to protests in the following terms"" This military court is a legally constituted body appointed for the sole purpose of trying the Japanese accused on the evidence before it nnd that has been done"", he said. ""Is it suggested that a public 2.000 miles away has heard every word und knows all circumstances!' This court will not in any circumrtancus he stampeded Into wrong action by pul>liv opiniun "". Colonel Hrown, who has been mentioned in despatches five times in two wave, is a grazier from Cooimbaiubran, New South Wales. I shall see whether it is possible lo obtain information which would enable me to comply with the honourable member's request, but I point out that the court is a legally constituted tribunal and that it is not the policy of the Government to interfere with the work of the trusted officers who have been appointed to conduct these {rials.",13
5,Mr WHITE,CONDITIONS ON JAPANESE DESTROYER,"Will the Minister for the Army ascertain whether or not written statements hy former prisoners of the Japanese were rejected as evidence, and former prisoners who wished to give evidence were not offered transport to Darwin? If so, will the right honourable gentleman ensure that tortured prisoners who are still alive will be given the opportunity to go to Darwin, so that they may testify at the trials? Will the right honourable gentleman also order a re-trial, so that the punishment may fit the crime instead of being no more than a commanding officer would pronounce in respect of a' serviceman who had been absent without leave for seven days?",14
6,Mr FORDE,CONDITIONS ON JAPANESE DESTROYER,"I have no knowledge of the accusations which the honourable member has made against the impartiality, of trusted Army officers who have been legally appointed to act as a tribunal to try these war criminals.",14
7,Mr WHITE,CONDITIONS ON JAPANESE DESTROYER,That interpretation cannot be placed on my question. The right honourable gentleman should not twist what I said.,14

11,Mr FORDE,CONDITIONS ON JAPANESE DESTROYER,I have not read these accusations in the press.,14
12,Mr WHITE,CONDITIONS ON JAPANESE DESTROYER,Then it is time that the right honourable gentleman did so.,14
13,Mr FORDE,CONDITIONS ON JAPANESE DESTROYER,I - gave to the House this afternoon the only reference that I have read.,14
14,Mr WHITE,CONDITIONS ON JAPANESE DESTROYER,"The accusations appear in the statement which the right honourable gentleman read, but he did not continue the quotation until he had reached them.",14
15,Mr FORDE,CONDITIONS ON JAPANESE DESTROYER,"I read what was published in the Melbourne Herald. If the honourable member will give me particulars of the accusations, I shall see whether I can obtain the information that he seeks. TYRES AND TUBES.",14
16,Mr MOUNTJOY,CONDITIONS ON JAPANESE DESTROYER,"Has the Minister representing the Minister for Supply and Shipping seen an advertisement by the Gommonwealth Disposals Commission in Western Australian newspapers to the effect that tyres and tubes are now available to fit Army vehicles. Is he aware that tyres and tubes are not available in Western Australia, and that many farmers in that State have had applications for them with the authorities for several months? Will he see that a fair allocation of tyres and tubes is made to Western Australia, and that goods to meet that allocation are de=patched to that State without further delay?",14
17,Mr DEDMAN,CONDITIONS ON JAPANESE DESTROYER,"I have not seen the advertisement to which the honourable member has referred, but I shall draw the attention of my colleague, the Minister for Supply and Shipping, to his question with a view to having any anomaly rectified.

Will the right honourable gentleman indicate his attitude towards the revival of this association?",14
19,Mr CHIFLEY,CONDITIONS ON JAPANESE DESTROYER,"I do not know of any arrangements having been made to resuscitate the body mentioned by the honourable member, nor am I aware of any discussions between representatives of interested parties and the Government. I shall discuss the matter with the Minister for Supply and Shipping and if he has any information on the subject. I shall pass it on bo the honourable member. FEDERAL GUIDE.",14
20,Mr BARNARD,CONDITIONS ON JAPANESE DESTROYER,"Seeing that the publication known as the Federal Guide has not been revised since 1944, will the Minister for Information have the book brought up to date?",14
21,Mr CALWELL,CONDITIONS ON JAPANESE DESTROYER,"I shall give early and, I hope, favourable consideration the suggestion, so that honourable members will have only themselves to blame if do not address inquiries to the proper departmentwhen seeking information. .POTATO INDUSTRY. - Dame ENID LYONS - Has the Government considered the proposal that the entirely false. control of potatoes, which would normally end on the 30th November of this year, should continue for at least one year more, thus covering the season. 1946-47, so as to enable the States to into operation such marketing legislation as they may be contemplating?

",15
22,Mr SCULLY,CONDITIONS ON JAPANESE DESTROYER,"This matter has been discussed between Commonwealth and State officials, and has also J>een mentioned at meetings of the Commonwealth Agricultural Council.

24,Mr DEDMAN,FAT STOCK SALES IN VICTORIA,"The terms of settleoperated ment of the meat .dispute reached at conference held in Melbourne during week-end conform to the policy regarding the meat industry outlined by the present Minister for Commerce and and myself last week. The settlement terms did not provide for the payment any subsidy, but did provide for the ! laintenance of the present ceiling prices. A decision to 'that effect having been to reached at the meeting, the representatives of the various sections of .the meat they industry agreed that a press statement should be made outlining the terms of the agreement. A full statement appeared in the Melbourne Age on Monday last, and any subsequent statements in other neAvspapers to the effect that a subsidy was to be paid to the meat industry are",15
25,Mr HUTCHINSON,FAT STOCK SALES IN VICTORIA,"I ask the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture whether any recommendation has been put made to him by the Commonwealth Meat Controller, Mr Tonkin, to the effect that the recent order for the acquisition of meat, as it applied to the Melbourne market, should be withdrawn. If so, action does the Government intend to take? Will the honourable gentleman comment on the possible effect on the price of meat of the withdrawal of this acquisition order and the restoration of an open selling market in Melbourne?",15

Mr FADDEN - Has the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture seen a reported statement by the secretary of the Meat In dustry Employees Union in Queensland, say Mr Neumann, in which he forecast a the strike throughout Queensland of 8,000 unless the dispute about the the dismissal of four employees of the bacon factory was settled within days ? In view of the fact that the ? bacon factory concerned is owned and by farmers on a co-operative the basis, will he instruct the Meat Conthe troller, Mr Tonkin, to visit Brisbane immediately with a. view to settling the strike, and averting the Agriculture threatened extension?",15
27,Mr SCULLY,FAT STOCK SALES IN VICTORIA,"I cannot promise to of send Mr Tonkin to Brisbane or anywhere else, but I shall have an investigation made immediately. We will get in touch with Mr Neumann, who has been very helpful in all negotiations with the department since I have been Minister for Commerce and Agriculture. I am sure that the matter will be straightened out. Mr Neumann has always tried to avoid dislocation, and I am sure that he will do so again.",15
28,Mr FADDEST,FAT STOCK SALES IN VICTORIA,Will the Minister also get in touch with the directors of the cooperative society?,16
29,Mr SCULLY,FAT STOCK SALES IN VICTORIA,Yes . ROYAL AUSTRALIAN NAVY. SHIP REPAIR WORK.,16
30,Mr MAKIN,FAT STOCK SALES IN VICTORIA,"On the 14th March, the honourable member for Griffith (Mr. Conelan) asked me a question concerning work undertaken by naval ratings on ships at the South Brisbane Repair Base, which he indicated was performed usually hy members of the Ships Painters and Dockers Union. I am now advised that chipping and painting of the outside of hulls of naval vessels above the waterline has been carried out by naval ratings from time immemorial. Such work is performed by painters and dockers only when naval ratings are not available from ships or depots for the purpose, and the fact that such work is carried by the award cannot preclude the use of ratings thereon. DETENTION CAMPS. REPORT OF COMMITTEE.",16
31,Mr CONELAN,FAT STOCK SALES IN VICTORIA,I ask the Minister for the Army when the report of the committee appointed to investigate army detention barracks and courts-martial will be available?,16
32,Mr FORDE,FAT STOCK SALES IN VICTORIA,I expect that it will he available at a very early date. SECURITY SERVICE.,16
33,Mr FRANCIS,FAT STOCK SALES IN VICTORIA,"I ask the Attorney General whether it is proposed to establish a peace-time security service as an adjunct to the Attorney-General's Department. Should not such a service, if necessary, be associated with the Military Intelligence Branch? If it is proposed to establish such an organization, what -3 being created. are the projected functions"" of the service, how many officers will be employed, and what will be their duties?",16
34,Dr EVATT,FAT STOCK SALES IN VICTORIA,"The Security Service established during the war performed many functions that previously had been undertaken by the Investigation Branch of the Attorney-General's Department. The work was extended greatly during the war, and hundreds of officers were employed. As soon as the Armistice was made with Japan last September, the Government and the Public Service Board appointed a committee to consider what should be done v/ith regard to liquidating that service and war-time services generally. The reports dealt with the Investigation Branch of the Attorney-General's Department and the Security Service, which, was transferred from the Department of the Army to the Attorney General's Department in 1942. Without attempting to detail the report, I can say that its substance was that the Security Service was to he practically wound up. There was, however, some work of a security nature not complete. For instance, large numbers of enemy aliens were interned in this country during the war, and the question whether they should be allowed to stay here or be deported had to be considered. In addition, other security measures had to he continued until peace was declared. The Security Service today consists of very few officers. I can give the honourable gentleman the number later if he desires it. There is no intention, I assure the House, to have' a permanent peace-time Security Service such as was necessary in wartime; nevertheless (here will have to .be in the Investigation Branch of the Attorney General's Department some officers whose duty will be tp watch security matters in the interests of the country. ,",16
35,Mr ABBOTT,FAT STOCK SALES IN VICTORIA,As in Canada?,16
36,Dr EVATT,FAT STOCK SALES IN VICTORIA,"As is and always has been the position in Great Britain in connection through the Foreign Office and Scotland Yard. In all parts of the world such services exists. The exact form of the service in Australia has still t.o be determined, but I assure honourable members that the war-time activities of the Security Service are being wound up. Mr .FRANCIS - And no new department",16
37,Dr EVATT,FAT STOCK SALES IN VICTORIA,"Tber e will be n new 0 - department. The service is being brought under the chief of the Investigation Branch, who will deal with matters that cannot yet be completed. The armistice has been signed, but there are still some problems of security that have to be dealt with by the Government. UNEMPLOYMENT ",16
38,Mr CLARK,FAT STOCK SALES IN VICTORIA,"In view of the constitutional difficulty that prevents the CommonwealthGovernment from providing work for unemployed persons, what action is being taken by it to assist in the provision of work for persons registered as unemployed? Are the States kept informed of the numbers of unemployed in _ their areas in order that they may take action to createfemploymentfor them ?",17
39,Mr HOLLOWAY,FAT STOCK SALES IN VICTORIA,"I do not admit the existence of any real unemployment problem at the moment, and we hope that there will not be one, but we have the machinery, which is being improved every day, by which we collaborate with the States in tabulating vacancies. and likely vacancies through work petering out, and in building up jobs for release at the right moment and in the right place to counteract any tendency towards deflation. Even this afternoon a conference was held in order to make the machinery more nearly perfect. EOREIGN LEGATIO N STAPES.",17
40,Mr ANTHONY,FAT STOCK SALES IN VICTORIA,"Has the Minister for External Affairs seen the reported speech of the Prime Minister of Canada, Mr Mackenzie King, that the subversive activities of Russian agents in Canada were directed to obtainingmformation c inimical to the interests of Great Britain and the United States of America he also noted that the Canadian dismembers ? closures occurred, through the voluntary confession of a member of the Russian staff in Canada? Has the right honourable gentleman made any inquiries as the nature of the activities of foreign legations in Australia and as to whether the size of the staffs employed is consistent with their normal diplomatic activities? Dr. EVATT - I have not seen the statement of the Prime Minister Canada. I have not made inquiries to the activities of legations accredited to this country, nor has any person, responsible or otherwise, suggested any improper activity on the part of any legation in this country.",17
41,Mr ANTHONY,FAT STOCK SALES IN VICTORIA,It was not suggested in Canada until certain persons confessed their guilt.,17
42,Dr EVATT,FAT STOCK SALES IN VICTORIA,"I am speaking of this country. I am fairly confident that the honourable member does not mean his question too seriously, because it seems to me to be an obvious attempt at mischief-making. NA COMMISSION. APPOINTMEN T OF NEWS EDITOR.",17
43,Mr MULCAHY,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"I ask the Minister representing the Postmaster - General whether it is a fact that a vacancy for a news editor exists in the Australian Broadcasting Commission? If so, will the Government see that the commission appoints to that vacancy a returned soldier ?",17
44,Mr CALWELL,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,I shall bring the honourable member's question to the notice of the Postmaster-General. I should like to add that the Australian Broadcasting Commission is an independent body created by statute. ADULT EDUCATION.,17
45,Mr RYAN,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"I ask the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction whether it is a fact that Dr Duncan of the University of Sydney has prepared a comprehensive report for the information of the Universities Commission in relation to adult education? If so, will the Minister make available a copy of Dr Duncan's report ? Has for the information of honourable",17
46,Mr DEDMAN,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,Dr Duncan has prepared a. report for the Government on the - matter mentioned by the honourable memto ber. That report is confidential. I shall have a look at the matter in order to see whether is copy of the report can be made by them available to honourable members. INCOME TAX.,17
47,Mr SHEEHAN,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"I ask the Treaof surer whether it is a fart that many as workers on receipt of their income tax assessments have found that they are in debt to the department, in some cases, to the amount of £30 or more? Is the Taxation Department asking that these balances be paid in a lump sum? Will the Treasurer arrange for the department to collect them in small .weekly instalments in order to ease the burden on the workers concerned?",17
48,Mr CHIFLEY,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"I do not know of specific instances. Weekly tax deductions made from salaries and wages are calculated upon the basis of fixed estiniates in respect of medical expenses, - concessional deductions, &c.; and, generally, it is estimated that of the total of taxpayers to whom assessments are issued 50 per cent. of .taxpayers receive refunds, whilst probably 50 per cent, will be obliged to pay an additional amount in order to meet their assessment in full. Under the pay-as-you-earn plan it is not possible to calculate with absolute accuracy the amount of tax which will ultimately be payable by each taxpayer, because certain concessional deductions and allowances which may apply in one case may not apply in another. With regard to the honourable member's request that the department should allow taxpayers to meet their unpaid balance in weekly instalments, it has been the practice of Taxation Commissioners for many years, when a taxpayer has been able to show that he cannot afford to meet the arrears in a lump sum, to arrange for him to pay off arrears in weekly instalments agreed upon. In some cases since I have heen Treasurer the Commissioner arranged for an increase of the weekly deductions from salaries and wages, which ultimately met in full the amount which was owing ou the assessment. WHEAT. INDUSTRY.",18
49,Mr TURNBULL,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"In view of the fact that seeding time is close at hand for many Victorian wheat-growers, and as many of them require financial assistance, will the Minister for Commerce and surveyors, Agriculture inform me whether it has been decided to pay a subsidy to those whose crops were a complete or partial failure last season? If so, has the amount per acre - of this payment been determined, and when can. the growers expect to receive the money?",18
50,Mr SCULLY,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Ne w South Wales, Victoria and South Australia are the three States concerned in this matter. Recently, a committee investigated the circumstances, and the Premiers svere notified that as the drought area was limited and the effects wereof a relatively restricted character, the Commonwealth Government considered that the responsibility for compensating the distressed wheat-growers belonged directly to those States. RE-ESTABLISHMENT. BUILDING MATERIALS : PREFERENCE FOB will EX-SERVICEMEN-LAN D SETTLEMENT I N QUEENSLAND.",18
51,Mr WILLIAMS,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"In view of the many difficulties of re-establishment, will the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction consider the institution of a scheme of preference for ex-servicemen in regard to the purchase of building materials, toola of trade and army trucks? Is the Minister aware that many ex-servicemen's associations are pressing for this privilege? Will he have the matter thoroughly investigated?",18
52,Mr DEDMAN,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"I have already given a great deal of consideration to this subject. The honourable member will understand that the problem is most difficult, because the Commonwealth Government's authority in this matter is limited by the Constitution. However, I shall see whether anything further can be done to give some form of preference to ex-servicemen in the acquisition of building materials and other things which they require for their re-establishment.",18
53,Mr BERNARD CORSER,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"During the war over 6,000,000 acres of pastoral land in central Queensland reverted to the Crown, and was earmarked for settlement after the war by ex-servicemen. As there appears a likelihood of delays occurring in making these lands available for settlement because of a lack of will the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction confer with the Government of Queensland with a view to getting surveyors from other States, or, if necessary, asking the Government of New Zealand to lend the services of surveyors, so that these lands may be made available for settlement as quickly as possible?",18
54,Mr DEDMAN,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,If land settlement in Queensland is being held up because of a lack of surveyors and other trained men 1 should say that the proper course would be for the Government of that State to make representation to the Gommonwealth Government for assistance. J suggest that the honourable member ask the Queensland Government to do that. NA SERVICES.,19
55,Mr GUY,TASMANIAN SHIPPING,"Las t week, the Minister for the Army promised that 293 serviceother men, who were stranded in Victoria, would be conveyed to their homes tomorrow. in Tasmania before the 21st March. That is tomorrow. I ask the Minister whether .his promise to me has been honoured? If not. when does he expect that a naval vessel will convey those men to Tasmania?",19
56,Mr FORDE,TASMANIAN SHIPPING,"The - present difficulty 3:as been caused by the shortage of ping, but I am having inquiries made and hope to be able to give some definite inforterday mation to the honourable gentleman. Unfortunately, the Army has been quite unable to obtain shipping facilities for the transport of those servicemen.",19
57,Mr GUY,TASMANIAN SHIPPING,The Minister promised that they would he conveyed to Tasmania before the 21st instant.,19
58,Mr FORDE,TASMANIAN SHIPPING,To-da y is not the 21st March.,19
59,Mr GUY,TASMANIAN SHIPPING,Quite ! Will the Minister honour his promise?,19
60,Mr FORDE,TASMANIAN SHIPPING,"The honourable member has asked a question, but he does not appear to want an answer. I am satisfied that he would he the most disappointed man in the world if those servicemen were provided with transport on the 21st instant. CANBERRA. PERMANENT ADMINISTRATIVE BUILDING.",19
61,Mr JAMES,TASMANIAN SHIPPING,"I ask the Minister for Works and Housing-(1 ) What progress ba3 been made in the preparations for the erection of a permanent administrafoT tive building on the foundations laid Parliament House in 1928; (2) have many major alterations been made, are they contemplated, to the plans as originally approved by a resolution this Parliament; (3) is the Government still bound by the condition of the original competition, in pursuance of which n Sydney firm of architects, as trustees for the estate of the successful competitor, was appointed to control the construction on the existing foundations?",19
62,Mr LAZZARINI,TASMANIAN SHIPPING,"Earl y in 1944, when the Department of Works was under the control of the Minister for the Interior, approval was given for the alteration of the foundations, and for the erection of a larger structure than was originally intended. I shall obtain the information sought by the honourable member and supply it to him CLOTHING TRADE. EMPLOYMENT OF EX-SERVICE TRAINEES.",19
63,Mr RANKIN,TASMANIAN SHIPPING,"Has the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction read the stateshipment by the Secretary of the Clothing Trades Union, Mr Wallis, published yesin the Melbourne press, that slow departmental procedure was holding up for from six to eight weeks, the employment of returned soldier trainees in the clothing trades? If so, in view of the urgent need to overtake arrears of supplies of civilian clothing, especially for discharged personnel, what action does the Minister propose to untangle the red tape that appears to be strangling his departmental officers?",19
64,Mr DEDMAN,TASMANIAN SHIPPING,"In the first instance, I deny absolutely that red-tape is strangling officers of my department. The question of training facilities for discharged servicemen in the clothing industry is engaging our attention constantly. There are many difficulties to overcome, and my department is doing its utmost to overcome them as early as possible. If the honourable member will cite specific cases in which undue delay has occurred, I shall have them, examined. IMMIGRATION .",19
65,Mr WATKINS,TASMANIAN SHIPPING,"I ask the Minister Immigration whether it is true that near the Jewish Welfare Society of New South Wales was granted a quota of 2,500 landor ing permits for members of the Jewish race, and that upon the exhaustion of that of quota, a further quota was granted? I should like to know also whether any other organization, racial or religious, in this country has been granted a similar quota; If so, has the organization concerned .guaranteed the good conduct and maintenance of immigrants upon entry into this country?",19
66,Mr CALWELL,TASMANIAN SHIPPING,"It is not true that the Jewish Welfare Society of New South Wales has been granted any right to nominate persons for landing permits. It is true, however, that the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, an Australia-wide organization, made representations to the former Minister for the Interior, Senator Collings. who then exercised powers under the Immigration Act, for the entry to Australia of the mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, or other Australia. close relatives of people in this country, provided those relatives had been victims of Nazi oppression. I granted permission for the issue of 2,000 landing permits to persons in such close degrees of consanguinity with Australian citizens, provided that the Europeans who were to be admitted had been in such prison camps as Belsen or Buchenwald, in slave labour gangs, or were now in dispossessed family camps, or were otherwise homeless and destitute in Europe. I did that as an act of humanity. Many of the individuals concerned are the last surviving members of their families in Europe. The issue of landing permits gives them facilities for leaving occupied Europe and going to Great Britain, France} or certain other allied countries where they will await Transport to Australia. It has been made clear to the Executive Council of Australian Jewry and the president of that body, Mr A. Masel, has stated in the press, that none of the holders of these ianding permits will be able to obtain shipping until the 6,000 priority passengers awaiting transport to Australia have been allotted accommodation. Persona in the priority classes are the wives and children of Australian servicemen who married in the United Kingdom, the fiancees of Australian servicemen, and the Australians who were stranded or marooned in England during the war years. About two years will elapse before any of the persons who have been granted landing permits will be able to leave Europe. Persons resident in Australia whose .wives and children are in occupied Europe are treated differently, they are permitted to bring their wives and children to Australia provided the security service knows nothing against them and there is no evidence of their having engaged in any subversive activity during the war. Three requirements must be fulfilled by those persons who will come to Austi-alia in puissuance of the landing permits that have been issued : first, they must be in good health; secondly, they must be of good character; and thirdly, the British security service must not know anything adverse in regard to them. Failure to comply with any one of those conditions will prevent the holder of a permit from coming to",20
67,Mr HOLLOWAY,TASMANIAN SHIPPING,"Those , who bring them here must guarantee that they will not be a burden on the State.",20
68,Mr CALWELL,TASMANIAN SHIPPING,"I thank the Minister for that reminder. The sponsors must guarantee to be responsible for the upkeep of these migrants for a period of five years after their arrival, thus ensuring that they will not be a burden on the State. The whole purpose of the plan is to make a humanitarian gesture to - these, the most long-suffering victims of Nazi tyranny. In regard to the members of other racial or religious groups, every case is considered on its merits. Bepresentations have been made to me by honourable members on both sides of the House, and I have tried to treat every application in a humane and sympathetic manner, requiring always the obligation that (he person seeking a landing permit shall be able to give the assurance that the person nominated will not be a charge on the State, and also laying down the condition that there shall bo no security objection by the British, Allied or other recognized authority in Europe that the person concerned has been associated ih .any wa-y with Nazi or Fascist ideologies. ARMED FORCES. DEMOBILIZATION . .",20
69,Mr DALY,TASMANIAN SHIPPING,"Can the Minister for Labour and National Service state approximately how many of the men wh<> fiad entered the fighting services sinethe beginning of the war have been discharged, the number discharged for special occupational reasons, the number discharged since demobilization began, the number who have drawn the re-employment allowance, and the amount of that allowance?",20
70,Mr HOLLOWAY,TASMANIAN SHIPPING,"The figures change from day to day. Not having dissected the figures, I cannot state separately the number of each sex. A week or ten days ago, the total number of service men and women who had been discharged was 650,000. The number of special releases was between 90,000 and 100,000. The number discharged during the last three and a half or four months, since demobilization officially began, is approximately 300,000. Many ex-service men and women will not accept employment until they can obtain that which they believe to be suited to their mentality orphysical condition, whilst others change their occupation repeatedly until they find themselves satisfactorily placed. The number last week was 4,600 throughout Australia. The amount of re-employment allowance that 'is paid during the waiting period is 50s. a week to the ex-serviceman, 22s. a week for his wife, and 9.3. a week for each child. This applies for a specified number of weeks, which so far has not been exceeded. Even if it were, the payment would not he stopped if. the circumstances warranted its continuance; but that contingency has not arisen, and I hope that it will not. Those who have, had to seek this relief do not constitute nearly 1 per cent, of the total number discharged. LEND-LEASE.",21

COMMUNISM. Mr HARRISON. - Can the Attorney General say whether there was in existence in 1942 a ministerial minute to the effect that no Communists were to be interned? Further, is it a fact that during the inquiry into the internment of members of the Australia First Move : ment, the Officer in Charge of Investigations, Captain Blood, stated that there was such a minute? Will the right honourable gentleman lay upon the table the file containing the minute referred to by Captain Blood ?",21
73,Dr EVATT,TASMANIAN SHIPPING,"This subject was debated on Friday last, when - the honourable member for New 'England (Mr Abbott) brought certain matters to my notice. The replies to the honourable member's questions are: (1) No; (2) yes; (3) there is no such file. In other words, there never was a minute to the effect indicated by the honourable gentleman. When it was suggested some time ago that such a minute existed, instructions were given that a full inquiry be made. The result of the investigation, which was most precise because an inquiry was pending before Mr Justice Clyne, was that no such minute existed. It was never produced.

The notice-paper records the Government's intention to introduce some half dozen bills which all appear to be related one another.

If the Prime Minister's motion is agreed to, many members, particularly on the Opposition side of the chamber, will be prevented from raising a number of important matters tomorrow. I point this out without any feeling of partisanship. It is very difficult for a private member, such whether he be a Government supporter or a member of the Opposition, to initiate discussion of any important matter in this House. Even a censure motion is allowed to be debated for only a limited time before the ""gag"" is applied by the Prime Minister or one of his colleagues. A restriction is placed upon the asking of questions without notice. The asking of questions by private members is their prerogative. I noticed today that the Prime Minister was more indulgent than usual, possibly to sweeten the pill which he has However, on most occasions a private member is very lucky if he is allowed to ask more than one question at the commencement of a day's sitting, and even then he frequently receives an answer such as was given to me today. These answers, which take the form of counter questions like, "" Can you vouch for the accuracy of your information?"" or ""Was it published in the press ? "", are not informative. Ministers ought to be thankful when private members ask helpful questions, about the affairs of their departments. There are many subjects about which the people of this democracy are indignant with the Government. Can anybody say that flhe Minister for Transport (MrWard), who proposes to standardize railway gauges and to pull down the airlinessystem to the level of efficiency of the New South Wales railways service, has full knowledge of all subjects that comeunder his jurisdiction?

The Labour party,, which is run on the caucus system, has its decisions made off-stage and prevents House from fulfilling its true purpose the debating centre of the nation.

That is something which he and I in common. However, this House has only recently reassembled after the longest break that I have experienced in nearly twelve years as a member of this ParliaMinister ment. We were absent from Oanb?rra five months. It stands to reason that ing that time the Government must have committed certain administrative acts which even some of my constituents will take exception. Opportunities for raisthe ing objections to the Government's conduct of the nation's affairs are extremely restricted at the best of times. We are occasion. not permitted to express complaints at length at question time because we are severely confined by the forms of House. Very little purpose is served laising them on the motion for the journment of the House at the end of day's sitting. I understand that for long time it was the practice for Ministers to be present in the chamber when the daily motion for adjournment was subcome mitted, so that they could give personal attention to matters raised by members the Opposition and perhaps by other members brave enough to speak critically of the Government. That custom has died out, and I very much regret the fact. Parliament has been in reces3 for five months, during which time one would should expect the Government, which is' comPrivate mitted io great economic, social and financial changes, to have prepared number of urgent bills. The fact is that the Government is not ready to go on with any of the important matters which it supposed to have in hand. The bills already on the notice-paper are of the type that come before Parliament every year, and their effects will not be farThe reaching or vital. I want to discuss number of important matters in this House. I have already stated, by interMinister jection, that I want to refer to the of the two "" Frankenstein brothers "" this left this Parliament recently. I have as not had an opportunity to do so. I was prevented from speaking on the want of confidence motion, with the result that on possibly one of the best speeches I had ever prepared was wasted. The Prime Minister should pay attention to our objections, because honourable members : and the views of electors. If the Government proposes to monopolize the have business of the Parliament, motions placed on the notice-paper by private members will never be debated. I understand that it will be the birthday of the for Transport tomorrow, and for in no circumstances would he like the durOpposition to be in a happy mood' on that anniversary.

I very much regret that the Prime. is using the undoubted power case that he has by virtue of the Labour who majority in this Parliament to whittle down further the privileges of all honourable members. I say all honourable members because this deprivation affects.not only members of the Opposition but also many members on the Government side who, I have no doubt, have things that they would like to say, not necessarily critical of the Government but in order to attract attention to them on behalf of their constituents. I tell the Prime Minister that cutting out Grievance Day will not mean a great saving of time.

STATES GEANTS (TA X REIMBURSEMENT ) BILL 1946. Motion (by Mr Chifley ) agreed toThat leave be given to bring in n bill for an net to make provision for the grant of financial assistance to States, and for other purposes. Bill presented, and read a first time SECOND BEADINO .",26
111,Mr CHIFLEY,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"Macquarie-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [4.25] - by lea-ve- I move- That tim hill be now read » second time. Tn 1942 the (Commonwealth Governright ment established uniform income taxation for the period of the war and one full financial year thereafter. Later in 1942, the Commonwealth legislationconsisting of the States Grants (Income Tax Reimbursement) Act, the Income Tax (Rates) Act, the Income Tax (Assessment) .Act and the Tncome Tax (War-time Arrangements) Act-wa s unsuccessfully challenged in the High Court of Australia by four of the State Governments. The High Court found that, quite apart from the defence power, the Commonwealth could enforce priority in the collection of its taxation and make grants to States on the condition that they vacated the field of taxation on, for example, incomes. Following thisi litigation - the Commonwealth, in agreement with the States concerned, established uniform entertainment; taxation on a similar basis. After considering the views expressed by the State Premiers, both before and during the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers held last January, the Commonwealth Government decided that uniform income taxation should be continued permanently. Prior to 1942 the many separate and widely differing State and Commonwealth taxation laws caused the individual taxpayer much confusion, complexity, and, in some cases, inequity. There were 26 different taxes on incomes. These laws involved different income tax returns, different rates, different methods of determining taxable income, and different concessional allowances. On the other hand', under uniform taxation there is only one inconifc-taxing authority, and conditions are uniform for taxpayers in all States of the Commonwealth. A taxpayer with the same income and the same family responsibilities pays the same tax, no matter in which State he resides. An effective pay-as-.you-earn system of collection of income tax is also practicable. 'From the point of view of the taxpayer, the abandonment of uniform taxation is unthinkable. Furthermore, prior to uniform taxation, the Commonwealth's taxation policy was hampered by the difficulty of .imposing uniform Commonwealth rates of income tax on top of widely differing rates of State taxation. If uniform taxation were abandoned, this difficulty would again be encountered because the Commonwealth's financial commitments arising from the war and from new peace-time responsibilities require income tax rates much higher than before the war. Because of its financial commitments the Commonwealth must also remain in the field of entertainments Mr Chifley. taxation. At the same time the Government recognizes that the reimbursement grants fixed in 1942 will not be adequate to the Sta-tes' responsibilities in peacetime, and it proposes to increase the reimbursement payments. To implement these decisions the Government is now proposing appropriate amendments to the Income Tax (Assessment) Act 1936-1945, the Income Tax (War-time Arrangements) Act 1942-44, the Commonwealth Public Service Act 1922-1945, the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund Act 1922-1945, the Entertainments Tax (Rates) Act 1942, and the Entertainments Tax (Assessment) Act 1942-1944. I shall deal with these proposed amendments at the appropriate time. The purpose of this bill is to provide for the increased reimbursement grants. At the Premiers Conference last January, the Premiers of the-States opposed in principle the establishment of uniform taxation on a permanent basis. Nevertheless they agreed to discuss the basis of reimbursement to be adopted should the Commonwealth proceed with its legislation and, after lengthy and detailed discussions between the Premiers and myself and between Commonwealth and State officials unanimous agreement on this aspect was finally reached. The bill now presented to the House embodies the terms of that agreement.",26
112,Mr MENZIES,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,The agreement related to the amount of the reimbursement. The Premiers did not abandon their objection in principle.,27
113,Mr CHIFLEY,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"No ; the Premiers made it clear that they were opposed to the continuance of uniform tax, and the only point upon which they came to agreement was with respect to reimbursement. Under the present legislation, separate tax reimbursement grants are paid to each State concerned in respect of income tax and entertainments tax, respectively. It is now proposed to combine these payments, so that as from the 1st July, 1946, the reimbursement in respect of both income tax and entertainments tax will be covered by the one grant. For this reason, and also because of the substantial amendments involved in the new method of calculating the grants, the Government considers it preferable to repeal the States Grants (Income Tas Reimbursement) Act 1942and the States Grants (Entertainments Tax Reimbursement) Act 1942 and to submit an entirely .new bill. As at present, the payment of the reimbursement grant in any year to any State will be subject to the condition that the State has not imposed in that year a tax upon incomes. Although the Commonwealth will continue to impose a tax - on entertainments, the payment of the .grant to any State will not be conditional - on that State refraining from imposing .a tax on entertainments. This is because, unlike the uniform income tax arrangements, the present scheme of uniform - entertainments taxation was originally - established under an agreement with the States concerned that it should not continue for more than twelve months after the war. Any State is therefore free to re-enter the field of entertainments taxation without prejudicing its right to .a tax reimbursement grant. I turn now to the aggregate grant to be paid by the Commonwealth and its - distribution between the . States. The present grants are fixed at the average - collections of income tax and entertainments tax by the States in the years 1939-40 and 1940-41. The existing legislation also provides that a State may seek an increase of its reimbursement .grant if that grant is insufficient to meet its revenue requirements in any year. Under the latter provision an additional amount of £553,000 was paid to South Australia in respect of 1944-45, but, in .general, the grants have proved sufficient for the war-time requirements of the States. The Commonwealth Government recognizes, however, that the basis of present fax reimbursement grants is unsatisfactory for inclusion in a permanent scheme of uniform taxation. First, some imrne-diate increase in the grants is necessary to cover.a prospective deterioration in State finances, due, not only to the : graclua.l disappearance of war-time opportunities for economy and of the indirect a-sistance to State revenues arising out Commonwealth war expenditure, but also to the increased level of wages and prices, :snd to the increasing responsibilities of the States in the field of social services. Secondly, some automatic provision - for subsequent variations in the grants, not involving special applications each year, is desirable to cover variations in inescapable State commitments due to increasing population and to movements in the levels of prices and wages. Thirdly, some variation in the present distribution of the total grant between the States has become necessary. The existing distribution is based on relative taxation collections in 1939-40 and 1940-41, and its continuance would prevent certain States from bringing their social and other services into line with those prevailing in other States. Accordingly, the Government proposes that the aggregate grant should be £40,000,000 in each of the years 1946-47 and 1947-48.",27
114,Mr FADDEN,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,Coul d the right honourable gentleman make'available to honourable members the formula upon which the aggregate grant was arrived at?,28
115,Mr CHIFLEY,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"I am having a statement on that matter prepared for distribution to honourable members. I regret that it has not' been possible to issue it today. This is an increase of £5,745,000 on the present total, but after taking account of the increased needs of the States to which I have already referred, and of the reduction of the special grants - under section 96 of the Constitution which may be expected to follow the increase of more than £2,000,000 in the reimbursement grants to South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania, I am fatisfied that the increase is not excessive. In 1948-49 and 'subsequent 'years the aggregate grant will be £40,000,000, increased in proportion to the. increase in population and then further increased by half the percentage increase, if any, in average wages per person employed over the level in 1946-47. The reason for the population adjustment is self-evident. The adjustment for movements in the "" wage"" index brings into account the variations in State commitments which follow variation^ in the level of wages and prices. The Commonwealth and State of - statistical officers have advised that the "" wage "" index is the best currently available index for this purpose. The adjustment is limited to half the percentage increase in this index, because some State expenditures do not vary with levels of prices and wages. Honourable members will note that the provisions relating to the variation of the aggregate grant are framed so as to ensure that the States will, in the aggregate, receive at least £40,000,000 increased in proportion to population. With regard to the distribution of the aggregate grant between States, the bill provides that in 1946-47 and 1947-48 the amount for each State will be as set out in the first schedule. The Premiers agreed to this distribution as approximating to their relative financial needs those years. Thereafter, the intention is to progress by stages to a position where the aggregate grant is distributed between the States in proportion to their respective populations, after adjustments to take into account relative sparsity of population and numbers of school children. These adjustments are made because of the greater costs of administration and social services in sparsely populated areas, and because of the high cost of education for school children. The distribution will not be made solely on basis of adjusted population until 1957-58. In the intervening years a gradually diminishing part of the aggregate grant will be distributed in the proportions in which the aggregate grant of £40,000,000 is distributed in 1946-47 and 1947-48, and a gradually increasing part in proportion to the adjusted populations of the States. In 1948-49 90 per cent - of the aggregate grant will be distributed in accordance with the 1946-47 proportions, in 1949-50 80 per cent., with a similar reduction of 10 per cent, in each of the succeeding years. As at present, the grants to each Sta.te will be reduced by the amount of any arrears of income tax which are collected by or on behalf of the State during any year. If the States should ever decide forgo the Commonwealth granls and to reimpose their own taxes on incomes amount equal to these arrears, less any refunds of taxation made by the ComJuly, monwealth on behalf of the States, will be paid to t.he States. This provision continues the arrangements under the existing legislation except that interest Hr. Ohifley. will not accrue after the end of this financial year. As I have already mentioned, under section 6 of the States Grants (Income Tax Reimbursement) Act 1942, a State may seek additional financial asistance in any year if the tax reimbursement grantsare insufficient to meet the State's revenue requirements in that year. With fixed grants this provided a necessary element of flexibility. The basis of reimbursement grants now proposed should prove sufficiently flexible to meet the futurerevenue requirements of the Slates, and accordingly the Government does not pro-pose to continue the provision. I should in add that if, in special circumstances, any State does require further financial assistance from the Commonwealth, application may he made by that State for a special grant under section 96 of the Constitution. It is understood that South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania are making application under section 6 of the existing Act for additional financial assistance in - respect of the present financial year. Accordingly, the in order that the .Commonwealth Grant3 Commission may, if necessary, make recommendations on such applications after the 30th June, 1946, and to enable any payments that may be necessary in respect of 1945-46 to be made after the date, sections 6 and 7 of the present act will be preserved temporarily for this purpose. I am hopeful that the basis of tax reimbursement grants set out in this bill will not require amendment for many years. Nevertheless, at the Premiers Conference, it was agreed that, in the interests both of the Commonwealth and of the States, it was desirable to set out the circumstances in which a review of the basis of tax reimbursement grants eould be sought. The understanding between the Premiers and myself is that to a review of the method of determining the aggregate grant and its distribution an may be sought at any time after the expiration of seven years from the 1st 1946, by either the Commonwealth or a State Government. - If, however, there is a major change in Commonwealth-State relations having an effect on State finances caused, for example, by (a) a substantial alteration in the powers - or functions of the Commonwealth or of - any State or States; or (6) the assumption of major new responsibilities by the - States, either the Commonwealth or a - State Government may seek a review of the basis of reimbursement before the - expiration of the period of seven years. As this understanding has not been incorporated in a formal agreement between the Commonwealth and the States, clause 10 of the Bill does not purport to prevent, as indeed it would not be possible to do, future Commonwealth Parliaments from amending the legislation. This Government wiil, however, abide by the understanding reached with the Premiers. Debate (on motion by Mr MENZIES) - adjourned. NA SERVICE BILL 1946.

'Bill presented, and read a first time. SECOND READING.",28
116,Mr CHIFLEY,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"Macquarie - Prime Minister and Treasurer) [4.43] - by lecf-e- I move That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Commonwealth Public Service Act in order to permit officers of State income tax departments to be appointed to the Commonwealth Public Service. The bill is one of a number which will be required to implement the Government's deci-ion to establish the Commonwealth as the sole authority for the assessment and collection of income tax from the 1st July, 1916. The present arrangements under which the Commonwealth is the sole income tax collecting authority were made in 194.2'. As part of those arrangements, the staff which had been employed by the States for the purpose of collecting income tax, were transferred to the employment of the Commonwealth. They were, however, only temporarily transferred, because the uniform taxation arrangements which were introduced in 1942, were designed to cover only the war-time period. The Government considers that, if the Commonwealth is now to be established as the sole income tax collecting authority, the staff employed on that work should now be given the opportunity of transferring permanently to the Commonwealth. The bill which I now submit for the consideration of honourable members, therefore, sets out the manner in which the transfer of staff will be effected and the conditions under which the staff will be employed by the Commonwealth. Broadly, the bill seeks to appoint or to employ each member of the staff with remuneration not lower than he received in the service of the State. The right to recreation leave accrued to a State employee at the time of his transfer to the Commonwealth Service will be preserved, and continuous service by such an officer with .a State and the Common: wealth will be reckoned as service with the Commonwealth for the purposes of the Commonwealth Public Service Act. The bill does not require any employee to transfer from the service of the State to that of - the Commonwealth. Each employee will be invited to accept employment in the Commonwealth Public Service. A permanent officer of the State service will be eligible for appointment as a permanent officer of the Commonwealth service. A temporary employee of the State will be offered temporary employment with the Commonwealth.",30
117,Mr SPENDER,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"Many temporary State employees will be given an opportunity under this legislation to become temporary employees of the Commonwealth. But although they are at present temporary employees of a State, their employment is really of a substantially permanent character. If they are transferred to the Commonwealth as temporary officers, they can be dismissed at three or four weeks' notice.",30
118,Mr CHIFLEY,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"I agree that a great number of difficulties exist, but I inform the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender) that a series of conferences on these subjects have been taking place between representatives of the officers concerned, and the Public Service Commissioner and the Commissioner of .Taxation. We are endeavouring to' smooth out as far as possible all difficulties which might tend to create an injustice. I am not able, at this juncture, to deal with all the details, because the conferences extended over a number of days; but it is hoped that, in general, no officer shall suffer any disability as the result of this change. I shall examine the point raised by the honourable member for Warringah that although many of the State officers concerned are classed as temporary employees, they enjoy virtually permanent, status.",30
119,Mr SPENDER,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,Some have been employed in a temporary capacity ' for seventeen years.,31
120,Mr CHIFLEY,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,-.Some employees in the Commonwealth are in precisely the same position.,31
121,Mr SPENDER,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"But the temporary ployees of the States, who may become temporary employees of the Commonannuation wealth, can be dismissed .much more easily after they have transferred.",31
122,Mr CHIFLEY,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"I shall examine that point. As well as those employees who are the present time employed in income offices, the right of transfer to the monwealth service will extend to any State income tax officer who is now a membev of the forces, and to any State income-tax officer who is at the present time employed on other duties. The right will also extend to the small staff which has been to the Commonwealth in some States for duties connected with. the collection entertainments tax. An officer who is member of the forces or who is absent from the income tax office because of his. employment on other duties will be offered appointment with the Commonwealth under conditions which would have, a applied to him if he bad remained on duty in the income tax office. The bill states that the provisions any law providing for preference in employment to ex-servicemen shall not in relation to appointments which are made under the provisions of the hill. This is proposed because there is clearly difference between appointments to made under the provisions of this bill and appointments made to the Commonwealth service in the normal way. The appointment of officers under this bill will be, in effect, a transfer en bloc of State oflicers to the Commonwealth. Debate (on motion by Mr MENZIES)/ adjourned. SUPERANNUATION BILL 1946.

123,Mr CHIFLEY,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"Macquarie - Prime Minister and Treasurer) [4.47] - by leave- I move That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to extend toState taxation officers, who are to beemtaken over by the Commonwealth, the same conditions in regard to superas were granted last year toState officers appointed to the Commonwealth Public Service in connection with the Commonwealth Employment Service.. The conditions give to a State officer theat option of electing to pay - to the Commontax wealth Superannuation Board the refund Comof contributions which will be received by him from the State fund and to continue to contribute to the Commonwealth, fund at 4he same rate as he contributed, to the State fund for such pension benefits under the Commonwealth act as theloaned Commonwealth Actuary certifies areequivalent to his State rights. If heof decides to retain his refund of contribua tions from the State fund he will comeunder the Commonwealth act as a newcontributor at rate for age next birthdayas at the date of appointment and besubject to medical examination. Where State officer has gratuity rights instead of superannuation rights, the gratuity rights will be preserved to him under the Public Service Act. He may, if he soof desires, convert such rights into a pension apply under the Superannuation Act. Theamendment will also protect the superannuation rights of other State officersa wh'o may from time to time be appointed be to the Commonwealth Public Service,, with the exception of any officer whoseappointment is the result of competitive examination for admission to the Commonwealth Public Service. Opportunity is also being taken to amend the provisions of the act relating to payments from the Provident Account, by restricting the minimum payment of six months' salary to cases of retirement on invalidity or retrenchment or death in the service. The restriction will apply only to persons who become contributors to the Provident Account after the enactment of this bill. Debate (on motion by Mr MENZIES) adjourned. INCOME TAX (WAR-TIME ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 1946. Motion (by Mr Chifley) agreed toThat leave be given to bring in a bill for *,n act to amend the Income Tax (War-time Arrangements) Act 1942-1944. Bill presented, and read a first time. SECOND READING.",31
124,Mr CHIFLEY,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"Macquarie-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [4.51] - by leave- I move That the bil! be now read a second time. This bill seeks to repeal certain sections - of the Income Tax (War-time Arrangements) Act. The act was passed in 1942, and was one of the measures which .authorized the uniform taxation arrangements which were adopted at that time. It will be recalled that under the uniform taxation arrangements the Commonwealth, took over the income tax organizations of the States for the duration of the war. The transfer of those organizations was effected by the Income Tax (Wartime Arrangements) Act, which provided for the temporary transfer to the Commonwealth of the income tax staff, office accommodation, furniture, equipment and records of the various States. The act - also authorized the suspension of agreements which existed between the Commonwealth and the States for the collection by the States of Commonwealth income tax. In another measure which the Government has submitted to the House, it is proposed to arrange for members of the State income tax staffs to be appointed permanently or temporarily to the Commonwealth service according to their status in the State service. The appointment of those officers to the Commonwealth service will terminate their temporary transfer under the Income Tax (War-time Arrangements) Act, and, consequently, the provisions of that act which relate to the temporary transfer of staff to the Commonwealth will no longer be necessary. This bill, therefore, seeks - to repeal the sections of the act which provide for the temporary transfer of staff and which set. out the conditions under which the staff are employed by the Commonwealth. As it is proposed to appoint the officers concerned to the Commonwealth service from the 1st July, 1946, the repeal of those sections will take effect on that date - In repealing those sections, the bill proposes that the officer : who is at present temporarily transferred to the service of. the Conimonwealthwill retain his right to be reinstated in the service of the State upon the termination of his temporary transfer. It proposes to retain, also, the' - liability which the act placed upon the Commonwealth to reimburse the Sfates for amounts contributed by the States to superannuation funds established for the benefit of those officers. Those sections of the Income Tax (War-time Arrangements) Act which relate to the transfer to the Commonwealth of office accommodation, furniture and equipment, and to the agreements under which the States previously collected Commonwealth income tax, are not being repealed at this stage. At the present time negotiations are proceeding between the Commonwealth and the States for the purchase by the Commonwealth of the office accommodation, furniture and equipment, or for their continued use by the Commonwealth. Action has been taken to terminate from the 31st August, 1946. the agreements for the collection by the States, of Commonwealth income tax. Negotiations are proceeding with the States for an earlier termination of the agreements. Under the circumstances it is not proposed to repeal the relevant section of the Income Tax (War-time Arrangements) Act at this stage. Debate (on motion by Mr MENZIES) adjourned. NA ASSESSMENT "" BILL 1946 Motion (by Mr Chifley ) agreed toThat leave be given to bring in a bill an aot to repeal section 29 of the EntertainAct 1030-1945. ments Tax Assessment Act 1942-1944.

125,Mr CHIFLEY,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"Macquarie - Prime Minister and Treasurer) [4.55] - by leave- I move That the bill be now rqpd a second time. Tbis bill proposes that section 29 of the Entertainments Tax Assessment Ac t sbould be repealed. Section 29 sets a term to the operation of the act and provides for it to continue in operation until the end of the first financial year after the end of the war. The effect of the bill, therefore, is to remove the time limi t which has been placed on the operation of - the act and to give indefinite operation to the act. When the act was passed in 1942 arrangements were made with the Governments of those States which had been imposing an entertainments tax, for the field to be vacated by the States in order that the Commonwealth might impose and collect one uniform entertainments tax throughout Australia. The States were compensated for the loss of entertainments tax revenue by a grant from Commonwealth revenue. The arrangements were, in fact, based on those which had been enacted for uniform income taxation. As the legislation for uniform income taxation was expressed to expire at the end of the first financial year after the war, the same expiry date was adopted in the Entertainments Tax Assessment Act. In view of its present financial' responsibilities, the Government proposes to continue in the entertainments tax field, and has made provision in the States Grants (Income Tax and Entertainments Tax Reimbursement) Bill for reimbursement payments in respect of both income tax and entertainments tax. Debate (on motion by Mr MENZIES ) adjourned. NA 1946.

126,Mr CHIFLEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"Macquarie - Prims Minister and Treasurer) [4.57] - by leave- I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The bill which I now bring before honourable members does nof propose any radical changes in the law relating to income tax. It s principal provisions are designed simply to allow, within the existing structure of the Income Tax Assessment Act, certain concessions to taxpayers which the Government believes to be a practical contribution to the solution of the post-war problems confronting industry. These amendments are designed to help in the building up and improving of Australian industry, and to encourage the bettering of industrial conditions.",33
127,Mr ABBOTT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,Does that include prim ary i nd ustr i es ?,33
128,Mr CHIFLEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"Yes , all industries. The most important of the concessions to"" which I refer-takin g them in the order in which they appear in the bill are the allowance of .an additional depreciation deduction in respect of expenditure on amenities provided for employees; the allowanco of a special depreciation deduction in respect of property such as plant and machinery acquired during the post-war period; the allowance of a deduction or rebate of tax in respect of expenditure on research; and, the allowance of a tax credit in relation to expenditure incurred in reconverting businesses fro m war-time to peacetime production. During 1945, representations were made to the Government by the Associated Chambers of Manufactures for certain modifications of the income tax law. The Government was anxious to explore the possibility of adopting any useful suggestions. Accordingly, a .conference was arranged between Government representatives and representatives of the Associated Chambers of Manufactures. The proposals put forward by the manufacturers were weighed and examined with the utmost care. Whilst it was not possible to accept all the suggestions which were made, the amendments to which 1I have referred above are founded on the recommendations of the Government's representatives at the conference and represent a contribution towards reconstruction and a practical form of encouragement to the business community. I turn now to a consideration of the proposals in more specific terms. In clauses 7 and 8 provision is made for the allowance of depreciation on certain amenities provided for employees by taxpayers who are engaged in business. In respect of some fixtures and fit'.ings not at present subject to depreciation, normal rates of depreciation will be allowed. Other amenities for employees will be depreciated at a rate of 33-J per cent. These provisions are a recognition of the important part which good conditions for employees play in the conduct of a business, and are intended to encourage employers to provide modern and hygienic facilities for their staffs. Clause 9 proposes an amendment that is designed to assist in the expansion and establishment of businesses in the immediate post-war period. The Government proposes to provide a special initial depreciation deduction of 20 per cent, of cost in respect of plant and machinery acquired during the period from the 1st July, 1945, to the 30th June, 1950, for the benefit, at their option, of all taxpayers in business-, including primary producers. Depreciation at ordinary rates will also be allowed, in the year in which the plant is acquired or installed, but of course, be calculated on cost less the special allowance. I may add that the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and South Africa have also found it desirable to allow a similar concession. Their deduction rates range from 10 per cent, to 20 ner cent, of cost. The Government also proposes an amendment to provide for an additional deduction in respect of amounts expended on scientific research for business purposes. The importance of scientific research in its bearing on industry can hardly be overstated. It is of the utmost importance' in the development of the nation's resources, and the allowance of an income tax deduction is being granted in the hope that research for business purposes will be encouraged and that Australian industry will be enabled to take fuller advantage of the opportunities which modern scientific discoveries offer. Under these proposals, certain research expenditure of a capital nature will be allowed as a deduction. In addition, payments to an approved research institute will be allowed as a deduction provided the research is related to the business of the taxpayer. Within certain necessary limits, expenditure incurred on buildings for research purposes will be allowed over tbree years, and depreciation will be allowable in respect of plant used for research at a rate of 33^ per cent. Provision is made elsewhere in the bill for concessions in respect of gifts made by companies and individuals to the same research institutions. Clause 19 embodies another proposal that is designed to assist in - the re-establishment of industry. It refers particularly to these businesses which were converted during the war to purposes primarily connected with the prosecution of the war and are now under the necessity of reconverting to peace-time production. Under the present law, business expenditure which is allowable as a deduction is deductible from the income of the year in which the expenditure is incurred. Allowable expenditure which is incurred in reconverting a business from war-time to peace-time production is accordingly deductible from post-war income. The Government takes the vicw will, that where a business has engagedin war production, the cost of converting that business to peace-time production should fairly he charged against war-time income. In this way, the deduction would be allowed at war-time instead of peacetime rates of tax. Therefore, provision will be made for an allowance in respect of expenditure incurred before the 1st July, 1947, in reconverting plant and machinery, and losses sustained before that date as a result of selling or scrapping plant which had been subjected to excessive wear and tear during the war years. The. allowance will take .the form of a credit of tax in post-war assessments, and will be equal to the reduction of income tax which the taxpayer would obtain if the reconversion expenditure and losses had been deducted from income of the year ended on the 30th June, 1945, instead of from income of the later year in which they were incurred. The Government proposes to supplement these measures by providing a concession for the benefit of visiting industrial experts, technicians and Others from overseas. This, it is hoped, will enable Australian industry to obtain the best possible advice and assistance from overseas in .the task of development. So far, I have been dealing with those clauses which have a particular bearing on the problems of reconstruction. The post-war period, however, has raised other problems which impinge upon the sphere of taxation. The cessation of hostilities and subsequent events have made it necessary foi the Government to review those income tax provisions which relate particularly to members of the Defence Force. As honourable members are .aware, the special sacrifices of those who served with the forces during the war have been recognized in some degree by means of income tax concessions. At present, all members of the forces enjoy exemption in respect of pay and allowances earned out of Australia, and those membe'rs who . serve outside Australia for a specified period also enjoy retrospective exemption of pay and allowances earned in Australia for periods of up to two years prior to their departure. Personnel who qualify - for the retrospective exemption are also entitled to exemption of pay and. allowances earned in Australia during the three months following iheir return to duty here. Dependants' allowances and deferred pay are also exempt. The Government considers that there is no longer warrant for extending exemption to members who go abroad in respect of pay and allowances which have been or will be earned in Australia, or for providing exemption in respect of pay and allowances at peace-time rates, and it proposes that in future-(a) exemption shall apply only to pay and allowances, whether earned in or out of Australia, which are at the special war-time rates; (o) exemption shall apply to pay and allowances earned in Australia by memMr Chifley. bers of the occupation and interim forces who volunteered for service with those forces on or before the date of the announcement of the Government's decision to modify the taxation concessions provided for members of the forces - that is, the 13th February, 1946-bu t shall not apply to members who volunteer to serve with 'that force after that date; (c) that exemptions shall cease oh and after the ist July, 1947; (d) that the exemption in respect of deferred pay shall belimitcd in the same manner, and (e) that the special diminishing deduction of £250 allowed to members of the Defence Force in Australia and certain civilian personnel attached to the forces, as well as to the merchant marine, will continue to apply up to the 30th June, 1947. I emphasize that the new provisions will not operate so as to deprive members of the forces of any concessions under the existing law for which they have already qualified. Dependants' allowances paid by the Government will continue to be exempt as hitherto. Benefits for ax-sservice>men are proposed by clauses 5 and 21. Under the first provision, exemption will be granted to ex-service personnel in respect of certain allowances which are payable while they are awaiting re-employment. Ex-servicemen who are vocational trainees will benefit in two ways; they will be brought under the scheme of payment of tax by instalments, and they will be allowed, inrespect of living-away-from-home-allowances, the same deduction as employees who receive such allowances; that is to say, they will be assessed on living-awayfrom-home allowances only to the amount of 15s. a week. Clause 20 relates to the priority of the Commonwealth over the States in the matter of the payment of income tax. This amendment is a part of the Government's plan to make uniform income tax permanent. The few remaining clauses do not call for comment at this stage. Apart from those clauses which deal with purely technical matters, or amendments consequent on alterations which I have already discussed, provision is made for the exempting of unemployment and sickness benefits, and of premiums paid in respect of Grown leases that are used for residential purposes only. Another amendment relates to the collection of income tax on bearer debenture interest in certain instances. The technical aspects of the proposed amendments are more full y explained in the explanatory memorandum which is being circulated to honourable members. I commend the bill to honourable members.

Public companies are subject to war-time company tax as well as to income tax and it is proposed to allow a tax credit of war-time company tax on the same principle as is being adopted for income tax EVATT purposes.

The purpose of this resolution is to provide that the operation of the Entertainments Tax Act 1942-1944, which imposed uniform rates of entertainments tax, shall not be limited in point of time. The need for the continued imposition of entertainments tax by the Commonwealth has already been e explained to honourable members. Section 6 of the Entertainments Tax Act 1942-44 limited the imposition of entertainments tax by the Commonwealth to the close of the first financial year to commence after the cessation of the war.

Progress reported. IN TERN A TIONAL AFFAIRS.' Debate resumed from the 13th March (iyi.de page 206), on motion by Dr. That the following paper be printed:Foreign Affairs-Mission s OverseasMinisterial Statement, 13th March. 1940.",36
131,Mr MENZIES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"Kooyong-Leade r of ' the Opposition) [5.16] - In the course of his informative paper the Minister for External Affairs (Dr Evatt), has, of necessity, covered a vast field. If debate is to be useful it is idle for the rest of us to endeavour to go over the whole of the ground. I therefore propose, within ihe limits of reasonable parliamentary time, to concentrate upon those aspects of international affairs-particularl y as they touch the European settlementwhich are of immediate and urgent importance. The Minister stated three basic principles of Australian policy with respect to Europe. The first of them was that Australia, as a belligerent in the European war, is entitled to participate fully in decisions relating to the European peace settlement; and that the establishment of a just and democratic peace in Europe is essential to the security of Britain and all British Dominions. The second was that while the leadership of the three major powers is accepted, other directly interested belligerents must be brought into consultation on important peace arrangements, especially those affecting territorial adjustments. The third was that we must consistently maintain the right of all active belligerents to a full share in the framing of the peace. These principles will not provoke controversy unless they contain an assumption that Australia is a completely separate nation, which may regard all its international problems from a purely individual point of view. If it is true, as I believe, and the Minister himself stated, that "" we cannot - contract out of Europe "", it is equally true that we must not contract out of the British Empire. Great Britain is one of the three major powers whose leadership is accepted, largely because of its position at the head of a family of nations. I want to emphasize that. It is all too frequently forgotten that if Great Britain and each of the Dominions is to pursue its path on these foreign matters as if completely independent, of the others, as if they were completely separate nations, then not only will such action diminish the real value of our own voice, because we lose the benefit of the family association, but if will most seriously diminish the strength which Great Britain itself can exercise, because its strength is not Mr Menzies. merely that of 45,000,000 people in one quarter of the world, but of a vast association of people all over the world. In respect of all international councils and conferences, therefore, the fullest pre-consultation sbould occur between Great Britain and the Dominions, with a view to a joint policy. It is no answer to this to say that a British Empire bloc is inconsistent with the United Nations Charter or organization, or that it may provoke counter-blocs. Honourable members have read in the press observations criticizing the idea of an Empire bloc. I believe that a strong and cohesive British Empire is vital to the success of the United Nations, and that the special association, organic and functional, of the British Empire countries is so unique and so utterly distinguished from temporary alliances or groups, that to refer to it - as a "" bloc "" is to ignore its history and to falsify its true character. The rest of the.world, though it has understood this association imperfectly, has for many years recognized it hy accepting Empire preference as not inconsistent with the most-favoured-nation clause in international trade treaties. The basic defect of the Australian Government's policy or, at any rate, the policy of the present Mmister for External Affairs, is' - in practice and probably also in theory - that it aims at utter independence of Australian thought ancl action-which , for 7,000,000 people in a remote island continent is more pretentious than sensible-as if no special British relationship existed at all. I turn now to say something about the United Nations organization. Last week the right honourable gentleman rather took some of us to task-no t by name, but in substance-for having referred to the United Nations organization as experimental. I confess freely that on more than one occasion I have contrasted the experimental qualitv of that organization with the tried quality, over a very long period and under all sorts of difficulties, of the British Empire association. The United Nations organization is unquestionably ""an experiment"", though it is one which strives towards an ideal which is supported hy all decent humanity. It is experimental in the sense that, if used wrongly or approached in the wrong way, its Council may turn out to be little more tban an angry debating society enjoying a world audience, but emphasizing and exacerbating international divisions; whilst, if used as an instrument of collaboration with constant emphasis upon the absolute importance of peace and international justice and tolerance, it can help in the deliverance of mankind from the scourge. Let me elaborate this a little. We all suffer from the temptation to treat an international peace organization as if it were an organic structure, with legislative and executive arms, able to legislate, to judge, and to enforce. There is a further temptation, as we saw before the war, to treat the problem of national security as more or less disposed of by the creation of a league and the contractual entry into the obligations of a charter. This is a dangerous fallacy. In the present instance the Charter, whilst it deals with many matters, leaves untouched the relations between the Great Powers. They, with some others, meet in the Security Council in what is in reality a conference, with facilities for discussion but with no major obligations or commitments. What is described as "" the veto"" amounts to nothing more tban this-that in this conference no major power is subject to compulsion, and that the only pressure is that of argument or of world opinion. I pause here to s.ay that when I refer to the veto I refer to something which is there. I do not desire to go back to the discussion as to whether there should be any recognition of a veto. That matter was fully thrashed out at San Francisco. It became clear that some of the Great Powers would not find their way into this scheme unless the power of veto were reserved to them.",36
132,Mr ANTHONY,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,Can there be discussion ?,38
133,Mr MENZIES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"There can be discussion, but no decisions in the presence of opposition from the power concerned. I refer to that >as something which is chere-somethin g which the Minister for External Affairs regrets, since he foughl against it. But it is there, because it one of the conditions on which the Charter itself came into existence. So long as it is there, meetings of the Council, and meetings between the Great Powers, are conferences, and it would be a fallacy-for people to believe that those meetings will produce, against the will of any one power, some legislative result or some executive action. In brief, we have here a piece of machinery which the powers may use for a' genuine exchange of ideas, a genuine investigation of differences, a real cooperation in an attack upon some of the national or economic or social causes of the world's problems, but which equally they may use for the pursuing of purely national ends. If the nations come to such a conference to pursue objectives of power, or to seek advantages unrelated to world peace-in brief, to play out a game of international politics-the machinery may prove disastrous to world peace, the delegates becoming the vocal champions of conflicting ideas and interests, and small disputes growing into great ones in the forcing house of publicity and propaganda. These reflections, which I believe are realistic, lead to the conclusion that this new league, like the old, can rise no higher than its source, its source being the goodwill of the individual, nations composing it. Its existence, realistically considered, absolves no nation from the obligation to provide for its own defence, to maintain a steady and firm course in foreign policy, or, as I shall point out, to cultivate its special friendsbips with such nations as bave common interests with it. It is essentia] for tliese reasons that we refer to the United Nations organization as "" experimental "". It must be tried, but not beyond its strength, and its true nature must not be mistaken. If some of us continue to emphasize that the British Empire is not experimental, but tried and proved, it is merely because we know that every nucleus of peace and non-aggression and good-will within the international, structure is a mighty source of strength for the United Nations organization. It is just at this point that Mr Churchill's Fulton speech has been so gravely misinterpreted. To issue a call to the British and'American was peoples for a close fraternal association in the cause of peace is not to threaten any nation and least of all the peaceloving nations.",38
134,Mr WARD,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,It has been referred to as an appeal for a military alliance. .,38
135,Mr MENZIES,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"It was not, and Mr. Churchill has repeatedly said that it was not. However, if the Government believes that it was a call for a .military alliance I begin to understand some of the things about its policy that I previously did not understand. I repeat that to issue a call for a close fraternal association is not to threaten the peace of the world. The truth is that mutual understanding and tolerance in this world are constantly impeded by a host of circumstances-difference s of racial tradition, differences of language, differences of religious outlook, differences bf political institutions, differences in public educational development, and many more. To ignore these things while endeavouring to set up a new world international order, particularly one in which the postulated use of concerted international force to control national aggression, points, however vaguely, towards the first rudimentary shape of an international superState, would be fatal. The TJnited Nations organization will not spring fully grown from the womb of war and bitterness ; it will be a slow growth if it is a strong one. The real case for close and abiding associ n tion between the English-speaking peoples is that, by natural evolution from a large common racial and traditional stock, they possess a common love of indi vidual freedom, a common language, a common religious outlook, common political institutions, and a similar public educational development. These elements were not produced by any treaty, nor do they need a formal treaty for their continuance. But they offer a solid foundation for a special association which will mean a building of reality into the United Nations organization itself. It is indeed unfortunate that anybody in the United States of America, should perceive in the stating of these truths the making of some special case for an Anglo-American treaty with all the legalities and set commitments which treaties involve. But it is more than unfortunate, it is tragic, that the leader of the Soviet Union, whose efforts in the common struggle and through a period of splendid mutual assistance have moved the hearts of both British and Americans alike, should find in a plea for continued Anglo-American association merely the assertion of a brutal doctrine of racial superiority- a doctrine for the defeat of which both nations have poured out blood and treasure in two great wars - and a threat of war against all nations - who refuse to acknowledge what he describes as Anglo-American domination. It is always difficult to judge in respect of countries where government is by the authority of a limited few, where there' is a controlled press, and propaganda achieves unchecked and uncriticized power, whether statements of this kind are made for home consumption or for literal .acceptance by the world. But as they have been made, it is necessary that there should come from both the British Empire and the United States, through the mouths of responsible public men of all parties and of all political opinions, a good round declaration that we indeed have no thoughts of aggression. We desire to live and let live in peace. In very truth we seek ""no aggrandisement territorial or other"".' The one thing we to be seek for ourselves and for others is the right to live free lives in a world of men who through peace shall have come to prosperity. It would be idle to pretend that the world is not at this moment in an apprehensive and pessimistic mood, and that the greatest factors producing this mood are not the policy .and the actions of the Soviet Union. The issue was stated by the Minister for External Affairs in these wordsThe real question is, not whether the Soviet Union territory and zones of influence' have expanded, but what is the underlying intention and purpose of the Soviet Union. Js it to secure the political domination of other countries, or is it merely to protect Bussia against any repetition of the so-called cordon sanitaire which united all reactionary influence in Europe against her. during the _ period between the two great wars? Is it aggressive in substance, or defensive in substance? That is the great question. There are involved in this question implications which cannot be accepted. The chief of them is that extensions of Soviet territoiy and zones of influence are to be regarded as faits accompli? and that if they are based merely upon a desire for national defence and the development of the Russian economy, they may be accepted as internationally legitimate and proper. Rightly or wrongly, this proposition is so reminiscent of the case w.hich was made out for Hitler's lebensraum before the war and the earlier irredentist movement in Italy that it obviously calls for the closest examination. It is curiously ironical that having made the statement just quoted, which is the very quintessence of what would have been called "" appeasement"" before the war, the Minister immediately went on to condemn in terms "" the Munich era of appeasement of Hitler and his Axis associates "". In the course of doing so, a very curious exchange occurred. The Minister said thisI repeat that, in the Munich era of ment of Hitler and his Axis associates, there waa the greatest inclination on - the part of some Western democracies to isolate the Soviet Union, and to hail Hitler as the saviour of civilization against the so-called Bolshevik hordes. Earlier, the Minister had very boldly said, in reply to an interjection by me, that he could quote some of my own speeches in support of his contention. I should like him to do so; in fact I should like him to find any speech made by responsible Ministers, in Great Britain or Australia, which represented Hitler and his people as the saviours of civilization against the so-called "" Bolshevik hordes "". The Minister went on to sayI am saying that Bussia, between the two wars, wns treated iis outside the pale and was not brought into an alliance against Hitler. Until Hitler actually attacked Soviet Russia, no arrangement with it was entered into by the Western powers. Then, an interjection by the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender) reminded him of _ the German-Russian agreement. This is a most curious account of pre-war history. It leaves out of the picture altogether the fact that, at the very moment when British representatives were in Moscow conducting negotiations with the Soviet authorities, an announcement was made on the 21st August, 1939- a fortnight before the war-of a German-Soviet pact. We would indeed be blind to history if we did not think that the bringing into existence of that pact had something to do with the ultimate launching, very shortly afterwards, of the German attack upon Poland. At that very moment, the British authori[16] ties, following visits of months before, were in negotiation with the Soviet authorities. All this is brushed aside by the statement that Russia was not brought into the picture, and that the attitude of the Western democracies, including Great Britain, was one of supporting Hitler, and of being violently opposed to the Soviet. Having said all these things, the Minister concluded by sayingI take the view that the Soviet Union's policy is directed towards self-protection and security against future attack. In my opinion its desire is to develop its own economy and to improve the welfare of itd peoples. The Minister should be aware that, if he were to find this very sentence, subappeasestituting "" Germany"" for "" the Soviet Union "", in a speech by a British statesman after the Anschluss and the absorption of Czechoslovakia, he would, in the light of later events, condemn it as either feeble or reactionary. This is not to say that he is prima facie wrong, or that our policy must be one of hostility to Russia, or that the parallels of history are to be projected too far; but it does render it necessary to clarify our minds by facing up to and analysing as clearly as possible the state of affairs with which we are now confronted. If I have recalled the mind of the Minister to some recent history no apology need be made, for in his written paper as amplified in answer to interjections in the House he has himself gone to some trouble to distort history. The charge that Great Britain, as one of the Western democracies, showed the greatest inclination to "" hail Hitler "" as the saviour of civilization against the so called "" Bolshevik hordes "" is sheer nonsense. That there were some few people in Great Britain who took this view need not be denied. But to attribute it as a policy to Great Britain itself is merely another indication of a bias in respect of Great Britain which the Minister would do well to learn to modify. But to return to the particular problem of Russia today: I submit for the consideration of the House a series of propositions which seem to me to be relevant to such a supremely important matter. In dealing with or assessing actions or intentions of a foreign power, particularly one in which political institutions and philosophy differ so sharply from our own, there is always the danger of oversimplification. This danger is to be avoided. It is not a question of being pro-Russian or anti-Russian. If we glibly group other nations into those which are always.right and those which are always wrong, we sball commit a childish error, and the end will be disaster. The Soviet Union has by the harsh labours of war earned the right to an understanding hearing and a calm and objective judgment by the Western democracies. It is therefore necessary for us-and that, alas, with imperfect information-to sort out our ideas about Russia, avoiding, rhetoric and preconceived ideas, but aiming at realism and not being afraid of the realistic view. It is unreasonable to expect Russians to think in just the same way as we do or to have a similar background. The social and political mental atmosphere of the. Soviet Union is, as Communist literature makes clear, anti-reformist and pro-revolutionary. The "" precedent broadening down to precedent"" which characterizes - British - constitutional history is, with small exceptions, reformist and' not revolutionary. It is not to be supposed that a people whose greatest modern political and social changes have been achieved by direct action and by revolutionary violence itself will have any sentimental inhibitions on the question of establishing an international political position by direct action. Our people over centuries have succeeded in reconciling monarchy with democracy. The Russians destroyed monarchy to establish a republic and, abjuring what_ they regarded as ' the weakness ofdemocracy, have seen the path to their own concept of freedom through a dictatorship. But to us a dictatorship is the antithesis of freedom. The Russians have sought what they believe to be ecor nomic freedom - for the masses through the power'of the State; whilst we have visualized the only true power of the State as resting upon the political frredom of the individual. Each of us thinks that he is right. And each of us may be, in his' own country. Provided we eachrespect the other's ideas, there is room for both of u3 in a world of men. But the ilr. Menzies. condition of adjustment is that there should be no aggression by either, and that other nations should be left really free to make their own choice. It is, therefore, a condition of true Anglo-American-Soviet friendship and tolerance that we should not think in terms of conflicting ideologies, a practice which breeds hatreds and may therefore breed war, but in terms of mutual recognition. That is to say, if Russia desires non-interference in Russia's affairs by us, it is entitled to say so. If we desire non-interference in our affairs by Russia, we are entitled to say so. If smaller Powers desire non-interference by either of us, they ai'e entitled to say so. In brief, there can be no real peace in the world unless every nation has respect for the territorial rights of the others. Certain questions thereupon naturally arise. Since the war have we-and I use the word "" w e "" ,a3 describing the British people all over the world, because for the whole purpose of this discussion we are to be regarded as one people-inter vened in the affairs of other countries against their will? In the case of the two countries in respect of which British action has been challenged, namely, Greece and the Netherlands East Indies, the answer must clearly be in the negative. The Greek Government itself made it clear at the Security Counci] that Greece desired British troops to remain, whilst in the case of the Netherlands East Indies, .the work of clearing out the Japanese and releasing internees was work which British troops were properly called upon to do in conjunction with the long-established Netherlands Ea.«t Indies Government itself. Now I turn to the other side of the picture: Has the Soviet Union intervened in the affairs of other countries against their will? One has only to take the map and to realise that already, with the war in Europe less than a year'-finisned, the Soviet Union has annexed Esthonia, Latvia, Lithuania, East Prussia, East Poland, CarpathoUkraine, Bukovina, Moldavia, and Bessarabia, to have the clearest answer! And on top of this, direct Soviet influence has been established in Eastern 'Germany, in Hungary, in Roumania, in Yugoslavia, with demands upon Turkey for Eussian fortifications in the Straits, and the most recent incident of all, in Persia. Eussia's explanation of all this falls into two parts: (a) the annexations are of territories possessing some historic or racial association with Eussia and are in any event' directed, to adopt words of the Minister for External Affairs, ""towards selfprotection and security against future attack""; and (6) the establishing of spheres of influence outside the annexed areas is justified-and here I quote Stalin's recent - statement-by "" the"" fact that the Germans invaded the Soviet Union through Finland, Poland, Boumania, Bulgaria and Hungary."" This leads Stalin to the remarkable question, and again I quote- ; Is it to be wondered that the Soviet Union in its desire to safeguard itself for the future should make some effort to secure in these countries governments loyal to the Soviet Union? On the mere recital of these facts it is quite clear that the Soviet Union has abandoned the terms of the Atlantic Charter, has swept aside the independence of other nations where it has thought desirable, and has in fact, as a result of victory in the war, enormously extended its boundaries, and its European authority, while enhancing remarkably its military and strategic position in the world. For the most part, therefore, the territorial adjustments made during and since the war have been by unilateral action on the part of the Soviet Union. They all have served fo strengthen the position of the Union, and thereforeand it is a fact at which we must not blink-to weaken the position of the ""Western democracies. The Minister accepts the Russian view that while all this is no doubt in sad conflict with the whole principle of the United Nations organization, it has been done quite reasonably for Eussia's security. But security against whom? Does Eussia fe.ar attack by its smaller neighbours? Is the Soviet Union anticipating and guarding against an attack hy a revived Germany? After all, that question will not arise unless Germany does once more become a great military power, and.it is not likely to become that unless the Soviet Union quarrels with the Western democracies, and in the quarrel Germany gets to its feet. [Extension of time granted.""] Or, to take the third possibility, is the anticipated attack from Great Britain and the United States of America? Eeading Stalin's statement one would almost think so. These questions well deserve to - be stated. There is no reason why we should go round corners in this business. With the best will in tfie world, and we have the. best will in the world towards the Eussian people, we must bring these questions out and look at them fairly and squarely. These questions are immensely important because in all cases-in each of the three I have mentioned-the extent of the defence must be related to the scale of the anticipated attack. If the Soviet Union is really setting out to make itself secure against attack by the other great powers, what reason is there to suppose that its annexations will stop where they are now? After all, to put the matter in the plainest terms, if the Soviet Union desires to be secure against attack by the other two of the Big Three it can do so only by having more strength in defence on its own account than they have in combination for purposes of attack. In other words, this doctrine by which a nation, powerfully placed as a result of a victory in a war, is thought to. be entitled by annexations of territory and political pressure to put itself beyond the reach of successful attacks by others, and above all by others who offer no attack, is a doctrine which gives recognition to world domination as the prize of victory. All that can be said is, that if the British Empire ahd the United States of America are prepared to sit back and accept the comfortable theory put forward by the Minister for External Affairs about the present Soviet progress, the day will inevitably come when the world's power wil] be out of balance and when, through the strength of an impregnable position, the Soviet Union will be able to dictate its own terms to the world. 1 All these considerations, profoundly disturbing as they are, lead to one conclusion. Our natural interest in accelerating the growth of the United Nations from something which is an international conference to something which is a real international instrument of peace should not hlind us to the fact that the most urgent of all British problems is the restoration of British economic and general powei-. This is needed so that the British Empire, in close association with the United States of America, may combine in tolerance and goodwill towards all other men, with an earnest desire .to 'restore prosperity to all nations, with the resolute intention of respecting the political views and aspirations of other nations, but with, all the time, the assured knowledge that between them they have enough strength to defend the liberties of simple men and women against attack hy tyrannies from whatever source the attack may come",39
136,Unknown,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,Sitting suspended from 5.54 to 8 p.m.,43
137,Mr MAKIN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"Hindmarsh-Minister for the Navy, Minister for Munitions and Minister for Aircraft Production) [8.0] - The speech which the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) delivered this afternoon did not improve international understanding, and will not help the cause' of Australia in the counsels of nations. Indeed, it can be responsible for causing, very disturbing conditions. It is only the echo' of a speech which was recently reported as having been delivered at Fulton, in the United States of America, and which had a serious reaction and caused an atmosphere of foreboding throughout the world. Consequently, it. is fortunate 'that, Australia has been afforded the advantage of the admirable speech which the Minister for External Affairs (Dr Evatt) delivered last week, because it gives a more reassuring picture of - world affairs, and inspires a feeling of hope which is much more acceptable to the Australian people than were the expressions of the Leader of the Opposition this afternoon. Further, the speech of. the Minister for External Affairs was a splendid review of world conditions, and was in harmony with two other powerful speeches that were made last week-end, one by the Secretary of State in the United States of America, Mr Byrnes, and the other by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in Great Britain, Mr Ernest Bevin. The speeches which those eminent and distinguished gentlemen made gave us much more to anticipate regarding peace and goodwill in world affairs than we find in the declarations of the Leader of the Opposition. The right honourable gentleman again produced the threadbare argument which endeavours to misrepresent the attitude of Commonwealth Ministers and the Australian Labour movement generally towards Great Britain. Never at any period in history was the cooperation between the-Commonwealth and the United Kingdom more close than it is at this moment. I believe - that I have a right to express that view, because I am the last Australian Minister to - have had consultations with British statesmen. The Prime Minister of Great Britain, Mr Attlee, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and the Secretary of State for the Dominions expressed warm and cordial feelings towards this country, and acknowledged the' great assistance that Australia has rendered to Great Britain. The Labour Government which is now in office in Great Britain finds it much easier to reach an agreement and to co-operate with the Labour Government in Australia than it would with a government led by the present Leader of the Opposition. The reason is that both governments have an identity of policy, political philosophy and principle, and our approaches to one another are made on the basis of complete understanding and cordialitv. This relationship cements the friendship between the two countries even more firmly than in the past. The statements of honourable members opposite, who endeavour to convince the world that our relations with the United Kingdom have undergone a change, are unfounded, and certainly misrepresent most unfairly the attitude which Australia bas adopted and is. continuing to adopt towards the British Commonwealth of Nations. If honourable members opposite require any proof of that co-ordination of effort, mutual understanding and confidence, surely it is to be found in the appointment of that eminent Australian, Mr. Macmahon Ball, to represent the interests, not only of Australia, but also of Great Britain and other parts of the British Empire in the administration of Japan. In addition, one of onr most prominent soldiers, General Northcott, has been appointed commander of the British Empire forces in the occupation of Japan. Those appointments afford more than ample proof that the canard which was uttered this afternoon by the Leader of the Opposition does not express honestly and fairly the true relationship between Australia and Great Britain. That being so, I sincerely hope that during the remainder of this debate, honourable members opposite will have the decency not to declare that something is lacking in the relations between the two countries, or that Australia has failed in any way to respond fully to its obligations to Great Britain. The Leader of the Opposition sought also to belittle the United Nations, which has been created in order to endeavour to reconcile conflicting opinions among nations. He tried to convince the House that the United Nations was only an experimental body, and would be weak and ineffective. If public .men criticize the organization in that manner they will only assist to destroy its prestige and authority, and will not contribute anything towards making more effective its earnest endeavours to preserve world peace and security. By my own personal observations at the United Nations, I was able to gauge the earnestness of the delegates, and the integrity of the nations represented there. I saw displayed beyond all question the most earnest desire to make that world organization succeed. It is unfortunate that an attempt should be made now to attribute bad faith to any nation. There is no justification for such a charge against any country that is prepared to join the United Nations and to bring before that authority whatever problems may arise in its relations with other nations with a view to having them discussed frankly and freely, and resolved by that organization. The fLeader of the Opposition sought to disparage the United Nations by questioning its effect'veness in view of a certain feature of its constitution, namely, the right of veto. I have seen the right of veto used. In my view, the power of the United' . Nations lies in the fact that it is a world forum in which world problems may be discussed with complete frankness. It is a bar of puiblic opinion before which any nation may ,be asked to justify its actions - Fear - of creating adverse world opinion will always act as a deterrent to any nation which may be tempted fo make undue demands upon its neighbours. No nation can afford to ignore completely the opinion of the peoples of other nations. For that reason alone I believe that the United Nations will be effective in preserving the peace and the security of the world. The Leader of the Opposition sought to attribute to Bussia ulterior motives in what he regarded as a trespass upon the rights of bordering coun.ries, and he mentioned a number of such countries bhat had been incorporated in the Soviet Union. Apparently the right honourable gentleman has forgotten that Russia's action in relation to many of the nations to which he referred was taken in accordance with agreements reached between the former British Prime Minister, Mr Churchill, the late President Roosevelt, and Marshal Stalin/",43
138,Mr SPENDER,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,That is not correct.,44
139,Mr MAKIN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"Whether the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender) believes that it is correct or incorrect, the fact remains that certain States granted concessions to Soviet Russia by agreement between the three great powers and it is remarkable that the right ""honourable gentleman should, now speak of these actions °s appeasement. At times it is refreshing to delve into the pages of history. 'Speaking in this chamber on the 28th September, 1938, the then Prime Minister, the late Mr Lyons, saidThe Commonwealth Government followed with close attention and in constant consultation with the British Government, the developments in the situation. It was believed that the annual rally of the Nazi party due to commence at Nuremberg on the 5th September, and at which Herr Hitler was expected to make a pronouncement of po'icy concerning the German minority in Czechoslovakia, would be a further critical period. Accordingly, on the 1st September, the Commonwealth Government fully reviewed the various proposals which had from time to time been advanced as possible solutions of the Sudeten German problems. Tho United Kingdom Government was also informed that the Commonwealth Government urged that the Government of Czechoslovakia should not delay in making a public announcement of the most liberal concessions which it could offer, and that representations should be made to the Czechoslovakian Government with a view to securing an immediate public statement' of such concessions. In other words the British Government was being earnestly urged to exercise its innuence upon Czechoslovakia to satisfy Hitler's demands. Presumably the Leader of tihe Opposition subscribed to that pronouncement of policy by his then leader. If further evidence be required of the right honourable member's - views at that time, I draw attention to the following statement made ""by hi m on the 12th December, 1938, at a service for - men held in St. Stephen's Church:I think there is a great deal to be said Germany re-arming. A nation of 70,000,000 of the most virile people in Europe, it was unarmed in a ring of nations, most of whom had armed or were arming to the teeth. The Melbourne - Argus of the 15th November, 1938, reported the right honourable gentleman as stating that during his visit to Germany he had been impressed by German industrial efficiency. The following statement was attributed to the right honourable gentleman:It was no good sitting back and thanking God that wo were better than Germans or the Italians. Democracy might be the form of Government that suited Australia, but that did not mean that it suited everyone else. ""What declarations they are! The views then held by the right honourable gentleman as to the possibility of another world war were reported in the West Australian of the 13th .September, 1938, as follows:-r Prophecies of the inevitability of another world war were discounted by Mr Menzies. He considers that while there are dangerous explosive elements in Europe the general outlook is better than it was six months ago: Mr Menzies suggests that it would be a mistake to take sides too hastily in the dispute about Czechoslovakia. He also protests against a one-sided judgment of Germany. It is inevitable that, as an aftermath of the world-wide convulsion, we shall have to face, for years to come, serious conditions of international unrest, disturbances and difficulties which can only be adjusted by some world tribunal. considerations impressed- upon the'"" United Nations the need for the establishilr. Makin. ment of a Security Council as a means of judging these difficulties and of affording some reconciliation of world problems as they arose. Those who endeavour to make the world believe that today there are circumstances which are again driving us to war are but chanting hymns of hate with a view to provoking war. If this world had again to face another war, it would not survive the ordeal. The right honourable gentleman may regard the organization established by the United Nations as an experiment; I unhesitatingly say that it is an instrument that .cannot afford to fail in its purpose if the world is .to survive. Surely all men of earnest goodwill and good intention for world peace should give to for this organization their undivided support rather than prejudice its success by discounting its effective power to achieve its objectives. Instead of attempting to destroy it they should seek to strengthen its arm so that it may discharge more capably the onerous responsibilities placed upon it . I have had an opportunity to associate with the representatives of other countries around the Security Council table and without exception I found them actuated by an earnest desire for peace. I deplore the efforts made in some sections of the press throughout the world to feature what they regarded to be matters of difference between the members of the Security Council. I say unhesitatingly that I found no evidence of conflict among those, associated with it . On the other hand there was a genuine desire to ascertain the facts and to determine the issues involved oh their merits. In all cases there was expressed mutual satisfaction at the way in which problems submitted for consideration were handled. As the result of the deliberations of the Security Council the relationships Ibetween the member nations were even more firmly cemented. Australians should therefore combine with other people of goodwill throughout the world and increase as far as possible the opportunities that exist today to bring the nations more closely together for the general betterment of the economic These and social well-being of humanity generally. Dp honourable members realise that, today, 23,000,000 people in Central Europe face starvation and general living conditions on the lowest scale in history? This is hut one of the tragedies that war has left as a heritage to the people of our own day and generation. Therefore, we should all exert ourselves to preserve the peace and promote the cause of international' friendship. Those who fail to do. so display a lack of understanding of the tragedy that, the war has left in its wake. That being so, our purpose must always be to ascertain the facts, have thorough inquiries, and insist that the point of of every country shall be received objectively and without prejudice. Under any other policy the result must be disastrous to world organization and the great cause of peace on behalf of which all of us should exert ourselves, earnestly endeavouring to use our powers to the utmost in order to establish in our day and generation a higher conception of what life should be for every man, woman and child.",44
140,Mr MCEWEN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"Indi) [8.31] - When the Minister for the Navy (Mr Makin), who has been Acting Minister for External Affairs for some months, assumed the role of second speaker on this motion on behalf of the Government, I expected that the House would receive from him some supplementary explanation of the Government's foreign policy, and some lead as to what the Parliament and the people of this country might expect to be the future conduct of Australia in relation to foreign affairs. I submit that we have had nothing but a ponderous declamation. The Minister devoted an appreciable proportion of the early part of his speech to an endeavour to make party political capital out of this issue. Indeed, he turned the pages of that complete dossier which the Government apparently keeps with respect to everything that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) has ever done or said, and treated us to another tedious repetition of quotations that we had heard many times previously. Insofar as the honourable gentleman's speech dealt with international affairs, it consisted of nothing but flat denials, unsupported by argument. When arguments in> rebuttal are the only matters that can he regardedas worthwhile, the Minister cannot expect to get away with a series of flat denials. I have nothing to say against the very passable sermon, the .very moralizing discourse, of which the latter portion of the honourable gentleman's speech consisted, and I have nothing to say for it. The real matter at issue in this debate is the statement on international affairs that was made by the Minister for External Affairs (Dr Evatt). That right honourable gentleman again directed the attention of the House to the fact that Australia's membership of. the United view Nations is the guiding light in Australia's foreign policy today. He recalled to our minds the fact that co-day we have a book of rules, in the form of the Charter of the United Nations, to guide us in our international relationships, and claimed that whatever problem might arise one could turn to the correct chapter and page and there discover the formula for solving it. That sounds perfectly easy and simple; and it would be in a, theoretical world. Of course, this is not a theoretical world, but a real tough, hard world. I agree entirely with the Leader of the Opposition that, important as is the United' Nations, and fortunate as is the world that such an organization has been created, none the less it is not to be recognized as a body which has within its own power the authority to solve every problem that arises. As the Minister who has just resumed his seat has told us, it is an open forum, a place which affords an opportunity for the representatives of the nations of the world to talk and to resolve, but not to enforce their will unless there is unanimity among them. Thus it is an experiment which, as we all know, is not in its final form; and it must be the task of all of us to help to mould it along such lines that, in itsfinal form, it ' w i ll assure to this troubled world the hope of a continuous peace. At the same time, in a real world, in which the United Nations cannot speak with the authority of law and force on every issue, it is incumbent on us to realise that this nation still has a separate sphere of responsibility; that is - to say, it shall n6t divest itself of its opportunities to look after its own interests. Erankly, I am bound to confess that I have not been able to discover in the speech of the Minister for External Affairs, apart from the reiteration about the TJnited Nations, some continuous thread or motive"" that would give us a guide to what he propounds as our foreign policy: nevertheless, I - have discovered a continuous thread of iteration and reiteration of the separate, individual nationhood of Australia.",46
141,Mr CALWELL,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,There is nothing wrong with that.,47
142,Mr MCEWEN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"There is nothing at all wrong with that. But it has to be remembered that this is a formal, separate, independent"" nationhood within a family of nations. There is in the speech of the right honourable gentleman a conspicuous and continuous absence of any words that would serve to recall that fact to our minds. For months past, not a week has gone by in which there has not been some incident which has served to direct our attention to the fact that the United Nations are still dominated by three great powers. There is every evidence that, for all practical purposes, we can assume that in the days that lie ahead the United Nations will continue to be dominated by the three great powers. That is a practical state of affairs which it would be foolish of us to attempt to ignore. In that wonderful unanimity that was achieved between the leaders of the three great powers in the days of peril, there was born in the minds of the whole of the Allied people, the conviction that those three great leaders had discovered a fundamental common interest which would not only serve to guide us to victory in war but also hold out an unquestionable assurance that, in the spirit of this common purpose and objective, we could look forward to a world of peace, in which the three great powers would march together, exercising their influence as one, and directing themselves to the moulding of a better and safer world. But the incidents of months past have borne in upon us the knowledge that, the peril of war being past, the three great powers have separated up to a point, and now stand counterpoised: three great, powerful nations dominating the world. Many of those incidents have served to show to us that there has not been discovered that complete identity of interest and purpose, that economy and ideology, which we had hoped would emerge from the perils of war. That is the plain fact. Australia, with whose future we are primarily concerned, is not one of the great powers. But it is a partner of one of the great powers. We in this country occupy a position unique in history; Australia enjoys the right of separate nationhood in the counsels of the nations, and at the same time, is a partner in a bloc of nations. In ' other words Australia has a Dr Jekyll ancl Mr Hyde existence. It would be well for us in this country to have regard to both those factors. If we would discharge our responsibility to ourselves and to those who will come after us in this country, we must not lose sight of the fact that the first Australian Imperial Force in battle, and the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) at Versailles, established for Australia the right to be recognized as a separate nation- a right which no one has yet challenged. I do not suggest that that right should be taken from us, but I point out that if we rest entirely on that claim, we shall classify ourselves as one of the "" small fry "" internationally. In the present state of the world, it is not safe to be one of the "" small fry "". Apart from all sentimental considerations, it is well to' remember that Australia is a partner of one of the great powers, and it is our duty, to see that nothing is done to lessen our authority within the Empire partnership. We have come to assess Russia as a virtual Colossus because of its tremendous power. Russia is a powerful nation, possessing ^not only great wealth, but also a big population consisting of people whose spirit has been demonstrated in war. We have seen, too, the industrial resources of the United States of America organized for war along lines which few had ever dreamed to be possible. That country developed naval forces which dwarfed those of the British Empire. In addition, it had a tremendously powerful army and a magnificent air force, whilst its war production exceeded anything previously seen. I mention these things because I fear that there are some people who. think that the British Empire has been overshadowed by the other two great powers that I have mentioned. But that is not so. If we take time to assess the resources of the British Empire, we shall find that, whether judged from the stand-point of man-power, physical resources, national spirit, military genius, or political experience, its potentialities for either war or peace outstrip those of any other nation. It is our great fortune as Australians to belong to the British Empire. We should serve our country ill indeed if we forget that fact, or did anything to weaken our place within the Empire. We would do well to recognize that of all the issues of external policy that an Australian government can have before it for consideration, none can match in importance the wisdom of strengthening the ties that bind the British Empire together. The Minister for External Affairs said that Japan is a defeated nation and that we must be careful to ensure that it never again has sufficient strength to become an aggressor. I think that every honourable member agrees with ' that view. Despite the fact that Japan has been shorn of its military strength, and that allied forces now occupy the Japanese homeland, I would say that no threat from Japan that I can visualize as a possibility in the future would he as serious as the secession of India from the British Empire. Within the structure of the Empire there are issues of far more importance than are some of the foreign issues to which our attention is directed by some of our leaders. We had the spectacle of Eire remaining neutral when the rest of the Empire was at war. Had the Germans successfully invaded Eire- a possibility in view of that country's unarmed neutrality - that would have been an infinitely more deadly thrust at Britain than the seizure of Gibraltar or the Suez Canal. The Minister for External Affairs related a number of incidents in which he bad figured which, he said, emphasized Australia's separate nationhood. I put a different point of vicw to the Minister for his consideration. I say that, in pursuance of courses designed to - satisfy' ourselves, and'by'the signing of documents indicating that. Australia has a separate sovereign right in the world, we can gain only so much, after which such a - policy is subject to the law of diminishing returns. Take, for example, the war with - Japan, and the signing of the terms of surrender. No unbiased observer could have any doubt that in the war against Japan an overwhelming proportion of the fighting was done by the United States of America, while the other two great contributing powers to victory were the United Kingdom and Australia. Nothing can take away from us the reality of our contribution to the defeat of Japan. However, when it was proposed that Australia should not be invited to sign the surrender document, our right to do so was urged by the Minister for External Affairs with such force, and the logic of his argument was so indisputable, that the point was conceded; but it could not he conceded to Australia alone. It had also to be conceded to New Zealand and Canada and to the Dutch, although their contribution to the defeat of Japan could not possibly be compared with ours.",47
143,Dr EVATT,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"The proposed exclusion of Australia on such an occasion was intolerable, and I am sure that the honourable gentleman agrees with me on that point.",48
144,Mr MCEWEN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"I regret the intended . exclusion of Australia, but I put it to the Minister that in establishing Australia's claim to sign the surrender document he did not add to the stature of Australia, but rather reduced it.",48
145,Dr EVATT,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,I obtained what was due to Australia.,48
146,Mr MCEWEN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"Le t us now consider a more recent case, the conference of Eoreign Ministers in London. Australia might reasonably be expected to be represented at such a conference, but its claims to be represented could not be granted unless the conference were turned into what would be virtually a meeting of the United Nations, and we know 'that business is not done by a gathering of 40 people; it is done by three. or four or five peonle meetine together. The Minister for External Affairs persisted in his claim that Australia should be represented, and again he prevailed, hut the representative of Australia was .admitted to only one short session in company with the representative of Italy. Does any one believe that sucb an occurrence added to the prestige of Australia? 4:50 International Affairs. | KEPRESENTATIVES.] I need not pursue the unhappy subject any further. Our record in the war will speak for itself.",48
147,Dr EVATT,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,It will not speak for itself unless the country's representatives speak for it.,49
148,Mr MCEWEN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"This attempt to have all our rights written down precisely getting us into the morass which is always ""waiting for those who pursue sueh a course. No one should know better than the Minister himself the limiting characwhom ter of a written constitution. No one should know better than he that more successful claims have been made in courts of law based upon what was left out of written contracts than upon what was put into them. The world's most superb diplomats, the British, do not to have every "" t "" crossed and every "" i "" dotted. The position of Australia must be conby sidered in relation to Europe, and to our own more immediate neighbours in the Pacific. The Minister has said that we cannot contract out of Europe. I agree with that statement, although hitherto the Labour party has held the contrary view. That has been the basic point of difference on foreign policy which bas divided the parties on this side of the Houre from the Labour party durclosest ing the last three decades. We cannot contract ourselves out of Europe, but do not believe that we can ever exercise dominating influence there. We must acquainted with the problems of Europe, because we may become involved in them. I believe that, in regard to European affairs, we must, willy-nilly, go with senior partner. However, Australia has special sphere of responsibility in Pacific. Just as I admit the leadership Great Britain in regard to European affairs, so, in the Pacific, Australia and New Zealand are entitled to claim leadership in the Brit sh point of Outside the boundaries of British influence in the Pacific, we come up agaii>.*t what must be regarded as the very corner-stone of our foreign policy, name }', a friendly understanding and 1 accord with the United States of America. For all of the reasons which were put the Leader of the Opposition in a manner which I could not hope to match, namely, common ancestry, common objectives International Affairs. and ideals, and similar forms of government, as well as a common language, it is evident that Australia's destiny, situated as we are in geographical relation to the United States of America, must be in a large measure inseparable from the destiny of the United States of America. is I am sure that no honourable member of this Parliament would dispute that. But in the Pacific we have nearer neighbours than the United States of America with our policy must concern itself. The nearest foreign soil to the eastern coast of Australia is the French territory of New Caledonia. I know that the Minister for External Affairs has never ignored that fact. I did not ignore it myself when I held the External Affairs portfolio. I seek may now say that I personally took the initiative in supplanting in the clays of our greatest peril the pro-Vichy administration there with a governor nominated General de Gaulle. It is quite evident that in considering our foreign policy we must not overlook our relationship with France in respect of New Caledonia. Geographically our nearest foreign neighbours are the Dutch, with whom, before their entry into the war, we had as close, friendly and complete an understanding as was compatible with their neutrality. After their entry into the war we had the liaison with them along lines that earned mutual respect. It is history that I detachments of the Royal Navy, the Royal a Australian Navy and the United States be of America Navy were proud to serve under that notable Dutch admiral, Admiral Helfrich. It is all the sadder that our relations with the Dutch since the peace has been restored should have been a impaired on the waterfront hy an industhe ti"" al union which has made decisions of upon foreign policy, decisions that should be the responsibility of the Government.",49
149,Mr WARD,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"Who made the decision view. on "" ihe Brisbane line "" ? :",49
150,Mr MCEWEN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"The Minister who interjects. He can have that all to himself. The Government is servile in the face of the seizure of its authority by the waterside Avorkers. I can hardly think of a more unfortunate incident than that by which occurred today. The ""mercy"" ships which, as the Commonwealth Conciliation Commissioner himself sa'd in court, are required to take food and medical supplies to the Netherlands East Indies for the relief of 150,000 internees have been idle in Australian ports for seven months as the result of the refusal of the waterside workers to load them. We read this morning that the ships were at last to sail, that the Australasian Council of Trade Unions and the waterside workers had nominated two persons to travel with them to the Netherlands East Indies as observers.",49
151,Mr WARD,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,Is the honourable member disappointed because they are to sail?,50
152,Mr MCEWEN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"But they are not going. To-day the Dutch Minister in quite understandable terms said that he and his government would not accept a decision affecting the Dutch relations with Australia that had been made by a Communist-controlled union. What is the 'Government going to do? No one has denied that the Waterside Workers Federation is dominated by Communists. The Government has been servile and silent clearly because the backbone of-the Australian Labour party is the industrial unions. [Extension of time granted.] The Minister for External Affairs himself, was reported to have said that domination of this issue by the waterside workers could not be tolerated. It is most elementary that the foreign policy of a country ought to be devised by the government of that country. In . this case neither requirement has been satisfied, for we know that the Communist party, not the Government, has decided this issue. The Communist party's spiritual home is Russia. Few are innocent enough to attempt to deny that it takes its instructions from the central organization of the Communist party. The Communist party in Russia is a governmental party. So this Government tolerates having its foreign policy shaped outside Australia and applied in this country by a nongovernmental authority. It is time that that state of affairs was brought to an end. The Communists have, captured some of the important unions in Australia and are powerful influences in others. The unions are the backbone' of the political Labour party and exercise a dominating influence on the party's policy. The unions through th'eir political .'- """"liations determine the choice of Labour candidates for parliament and determine whether sitting members should be reendorsed, and that includes ministers. Laibour ministries are influenced by the Communist party. That is intolerably wrong. It is dangerous to this country. It is time that the 'Government put an end. to it. Perpetuation of this situation is not compatible with loyalty to Australia. I know that I have got under the skin of some honourable members opposite and have touched a sore point - It is notorious that Ministers are unhappy on the very point that I have been making, that they are not free agents and that their presence in. this House and their opportunities to re-enter it will be determined, in many cases, by unions wihich are dominated hy Communists. I wish to make two other points. Before the San Francisco Conference, the Minister for External Affairs made many speeches upon a theory of regional security. Such speeches were being made during the currency of the San Francisco Conference and provision in respect of regional security is written into the Charter of the United Nations. Under tihe Charter, Australia is obligated to provide, if called upon, a contingent of armed forces to the United Nations; and that is a subtraction from the strength of the forces under our control. 1 do not know whether it is the intention of the Government to engage in any regional arrangement. We, of course, would not know until that was an accomplished fact. If there 'be no such intention, my remarks are not needed; buti f there, be such an intention, I voice a warning. I say that under an arrangement whereby a group of nations within a region commit themselves to an engagement for security they must inevitably commit themselves to the retention in their own zone of a certain proportion of their military strength. No other nation is so far flung over the surface of the globe as is the British nation, and should the British nation pursue a policy of engaging in a series of regional security arrangements over the whole surface of the globe-and the British people have 'interests over its whole surface - of a character which oViges it to retain forces within those regions, then the result Would be a further subtraction from those forces which could be in control-yes . regarded as fluid and available for Empire purposes. No such arrangements could in themselves provide absolute security wiihin a region; but a policy freezing the power of the British' Empire into a world-wide series of watertight Compartments' would at one stroke take from the British Empire its force as world power. I voice that warning here, and I hope that that policy upon which quite a number of speeches' have been made will not be pursued. Iii the atmosphere which exists at moment I could not conclude my remarks upon international affairs without making some reference to the position which has developed, and still exists, with respect to Bussia. The Minister for Exterconduct nal Affairs did not seek to sideand step this issue or to evade offering liis views upon it; nor did the Leader of the Opposition. That is an issue which must engage the attention of any responsible assembly in a discussion international affairs. The Minister the Navy said a few days' ago that if the newspapers would take three months' holiday we could almost feel assured of the peace of the world. I do not believe for a moment that holiday on the part of the newspapers for three months, or three years, would dispose of the fact that today Bussian forces are still in Persia, notwithstanding Russia's solemn undertaking to remove them by the 2nd March. That i-s one cause of the existing tension. Nor would a holiday on the part of the newspapers dispose of the transparent attempt which was made at the recent meeting of the TJnited Nations to divide delegates by making charges against the TJnited that Kingdom in respect of its conduct in relaNations tion to Greece and Indonesia. issues must be faced, even though graphically they are remote from us. The Minister for External Affairs, - biting terms, called to our mind the attiof tude of so-called appeasers towards Hitler when he was brow-beating and over-running his neighbours to secure lebensraum, which he claimed Germany needed. The Minister admitted openly that in his criticism of some western democracies in that respect he included Great Britain. Mr MCEicen.",50
153,Dr EVATT,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,The Tory parties-thos e,51
154,Mr MCEWEN,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"The right honourable gentleman was not then making a party political attack, and it is too late for of him now to turn his attack in that way. But now, before the strong statements of Mr Bevin, Mr Churchill and Mr. Byrnes have died away, the Minister hima self is found making an .appeasing statement. He told us that, with respect to the issue with Russia, the test is not whether every small nation on the geographical perimeter of expanded Bussian territory the ought to have been dragooned into establishing a government so supine to Russia's wishes as to be a puppet of Russia; he said that that is not the real ""test. Nor is the real test whether this squares with the Four Freedoms the principles of the Charter of the TJnited Nations. The real question, he said, is whether the Soviet TJnion, in using the power of its position to establish this encircling ring of buffer states, it was of motivated by aggressive or defensive infor tentions; and we have the Minister's word for it that Russia'smotives were defensive only. How much better that assurance will prove than Mr Chamberlain's "" peace in our time"" assurance, a only time and history will prove. I see virtue in being non-provocative, but surely the denunciation of so-called appeasers of the dictator, Hitler, is an incredible preamble to an appeasement of the most notable appeaser of all, Stalin. However, I am sure that neither what I , nor the Minister, says will have any influpnce on events in that zone; so we need not raise our blood pressure unduly upon that matter. Nevertheless, a useful purpose is served in examining the situation arises if the fair words of the United Charter are not yet exactly interThese preted by all parties to it according to geotheir precise dictionary meaning. We shall benefit if we are. reminded that in in this very realistic world, a combination high motive and real strength is still the best recipe for peace and security.",51
155,Mr BEAZLEY,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"Fremantle) [9.20] The honourable member for Indi (Mr. MCEwen),. in the course of his speech, hinted at the control of Australian foreign policy by trade unions, and the control of trade unions by Russia itself. He came very close, I sbould say, to going further, and suggesting that we on this side of the House were recipients of Moscow gold. The last person who made statements similar to that was General Franco's „ radio spokesman, Quiepo di Llano, who was referring to the Church of England. As I am a member of the Church of England and of the Labour party, I should receive some addition to my income in the near future. I regret that because of an interruption, I was not able to hear the preamble to the speech of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies), but as I entered the chamber, I heard him make two distinct points. The. first was virtually to present, as alternatives to this House, membership of the British Commonwealth of Nations or membership of the United Nations. The second was to take"" strong exception to a suggestion that Russia was diplomatically cold-shouldered before the war. Later, he rebuked the Miuister for External Affairs (Dr Evatt) on the ground that, he had exhibited continuously anti-British tendencies, and suggested that the Minister's reference to the cold-shouldering of Russia was indicative of his anti-British tendencies. If that be so, the Minister i - in distinctly good company. ""When reading speeches on this subject in the House of Commons, I found that the present Prime Minister of Great Britain, Mr Attlee, said on the 3rd October, 193S, during the debate on the Munich agreementI t has been a very great weakness that Britain. throughout there has been this cold-shouldering of the Union of Soviet Socialist Eepublics. The Prime Minisier cannot .bear even to tion them. They were never brought into oonsultation except on one occasion, and was when it looked as if things were coming to tJit; worse, and their help .was wanted. Then an approach was made, but when was a question of negotiation they were not brought in at all. I do not know whether they will be brought into any future negotiations. But there you get the weakness of this Government and at the same time of franco-and I say thu weakness of France even greater. At no time did they make their minds whether they were going to stand or to tell Czechoslovakia to make its terms. Similarly anti-British was the Leader the British Liberal party, Sir Archibald Sinclair, and I should saj' in passing that I regret the disappearance of the British Liberal party, because it was liberal. Sir Archibald Sinclair expressed this viewWhy is not Bussia mentioned, too, as a guarantor? Why is not Bussia. to. be represented on the Internationa! Commission which is to be established under the Munich plantBussia, who has proved to be a loyal member of the League: Bussia, who in Spain and in China hus actually befriended the victims of aggression; Russia, who is better situated than we are tp bring help to the CVechs in the time of need; Bussia, the historic protector of the Slav race; Bussia, whom we need now more than ever to restore the balance of power in Europe; Bussia, whom the Governinent named as an ally on Tuesday whoii they thought we wore going to be in trouble but who are now excluded from the council chamber. His Majesty's Goveriunent. will be making a disastrous mistake if they go on truckling to Herr Hitler and Signor MusFolini and leave Bussia standing outside, on the - mat. Bring her in. and let her join in thu guarantee to Czechoslovakia. Similarly anti-British was Mr Churchill, who, in the course of the same debate. , declaredFrance and Great Britain together, especially if they had maintained a close contact with Russia, which certainly was not done, would have been able in those days in the summer, when thcy had the prestige, to influence many ot the smaller States of Europe, and I believe they could have determined the attitude of Poland. If such a statement as that is taken by the Leader of the Opposition as proof that the Minister for External Affairs is anti-British, I say again that he errs in good company, namely, with the leader of every political party in Great The points which the Leader of the menOpposition made concerning the British connection, and those that have been made that later in this debate, would suggest that in this House, the question.of maintaini t ing the British connection was an Australian political issue. But there is no political party in the Commonwealth which favours secession from the British - Empire. It is not a political issue in is this"" country; and to present as alterup natives membership of the British Comown monwealth of Nations or membership of the United Nations, because the of Minister for External Affairs has been a - strong protagonist of the United Nations, is to resort to the old tactic of putting np a straw man for the purpose of knowing it down - On several occasions, the Minister has suffered this accusation of being anti-British. He has been the recipient of this foi'm of abuse because on certain occasions at the TJnited Nations he disagreed with the British representatives. He disagreed with them in particular on the issue of trusteeship. From 1916 to 1941 this House was dominated, except for two years when the Scullin Government was in office, by non-Labour governments. Nearly 25 years! Whatever criticisms may be directed against those governments, and I could direct many, there is one' matter on which they eannot be criticized, arid that is the excellent administration by Australia of its mandated territory. Anstralia had a great record in that respect. There were provided expanding medical and educational facilities for natives, and the administration reported periodically to the League of Nations Mandates Commission. The reports and the work undertaken were examined by experts. Those administrators testified as to what a stimulus it was to the administration to have to make reports, which continually drew on the Australian administration-the searchlight of publicity. When the Minister was defending the trusteeship system against the disapproval of Lord Halifax ancl Lord Oranborne, - he was accused of being anti-British. The Minister was defending the achievement of anti-Labour governments in. the administration of the mandated territory,, with one modification, that in future, under the trusteeship system, it will be possible to fortify mandated - territories. So [ contend that to weigh the disapproval of Lord Halifax against the very substantial achievements of the mandate system or trusteeship system would be very foolish indeed. It is rather interesting to observe that Lord Oranborne, who on that occasion was associated with Lord Halifax, had so strongly disagreed earlier with Lord Halifax's foreign policy that rather than be a party to it, he resigned, with Mr Eden, from the British Government. That, of course, exposes the meaningless nature of this term "" anti-British "". What is Britain in this Mr lieanlcy. particular context? Successive British governments have pursued contradictory policies. The policy of the Conservative party shortly before it was defeated, was not to favour ^he trusteeship system. But Mr Attlee, in the House of Commons on the 23rd February last, strongly supported the idea of trusteeship. Therefore, the new British Government has reversed the policy of its predecessor. If to disagree with any given British government on a particular issue is to be anti-British, then to be pro-British we must reverse our policy now, having agreed with Lord Halifax about trusteeship, and we must begin to agree with the new policy emanating from Mr Attlee. So long as it is a clear issue on international affairs and a clear moral stand is being taken, it cannot be helped if we are not in agreement"" on that particular point with Great Britain. It does not call into. question the Britishconnexion, which is not an issue in Australian politics. I leave that subject now, and turn to other matters before us. The honourable member for Indi declared that the Australian Government lacked prestige in the .eyes of other countries. He mentioned that we had been included in the peace negotiations, and then were treated as a minor power. He failed to mention, of course, that Australia was elected to the Security Council, which is the cabinet of the international organization,- and that is a pretty fair compliment to a - minor power. He did not mention, either, that the na tions recognize the constructive part, which the Minister for External Affairs played at the TJnited Nations Conference at San Francisco. He did utter certain meaningless words concerning oui area of special concern in the 1 South-West Pacific, but went on to warn us that if we recognized that Great Britain took the initiative in Europe, and that Australia took the initiative in the South-West Pacific, we should be, in some mystic way, subdividing the British Empire andweakening it. A sensible statement on that, matter has come - from the London Times, which in a recent leading article saidThe course of the war against Japan has brought Australia, into wholly new prominence as a power in the Pacific. It seems clear that she will exercise increasing influence in shaping the policy of the British Commonwealth throughout the area. The danger to which she was exposed and the part she played in averting it have aroused her to a lively consciousness of her international position and the responsibilities to which this gives rise. Australia's new position as a Pacific power is further acknowledged by the selection of Mr W. MACMahon Ball to represent the whole of the British Commonwealth on the Allied Council in Tokyo. As Australian External Affairs Minister (Dr Evatt) pointed out, the appointment of an Australian to represent the whole of the British Commonwealth on the Tokyo Council may mark the beginning of a new stage of development in British Connnonwealth relations, in which the dominions may share with Britain the duty of acting on behalf of all members of the Commonwealth. The point made by the Times is indicative of what is bound to be the new trend in foreign affairs in this country. The Minister for External Affairs has pointed out in many speeches the inevitability of Great Britain taking the initiative in Europe, and when he was in dispute with the former British Government, it was because that administration did not take account of the aspiration of Australia in making declarations concerningour intentions in the South-West Pacific. The Cairo declaration of the Snd - September, 1943, by the TJnited States of America, TJnited Kingdom and China, made certain declarations about the Pacific which ignored this country altogether, and that reprehensible tendency on the part of the then Brifcish Government has since been discontinued. It is wise for Great Britain to consult with the dominions which are adjacent-to any area - that is under discussion. After all, it is an historic fact that although the dominions have been called upon to underwrite British foreign policy in Europe on two occasions-in the war of ]9J4-18. and in the conflict just endedBritain has not yet been called upon to go to war on behalf of a dominion. I do not di'S-nute that British naval forces defended this country during the last war. b'-it Britain has not had to so to war i i ' thp first instance on behalf of any do^'in'r-n. So. there has been a two-way fih' ™»f r""i in this matter, and the Aus; ; trahan Government, in emnhas-iVnsr that i(line the risrht to have its voice he.T'd in B r ^ l n r>n matters cnripp'-irnsr the Soutli-We^t .Pacific, is quite correct, and, from the point of view of the healthy development of British Commonwealth relations, it is quite wise. The evolution of British Commonwealth relations has been referred to by the Minister for External Affairs. It is a far cry from the days of 1911, when Sir Edward Grey informed Mr Andrew Eisher that the dominions would be consulted on issues of foreign policy when time, place and circumstances permitted. By 1917, thanks to the work of the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes), this country had secured a voice in the determination of British foreign policy. By' 1926, Mr S. M . Bruce, whom some branches of the Liberal party would like to see back in this countrj' to lead that party, had succeeded, with other dominion Prime Ministers, in obtaining the Balfour declaration, which stated that the dominions were in no way subordinate one to the other, or to Great Britain , in any respect of domestic or external affairs. By emphasizing the need for an Australian voice in South-West Pacific affairs, the Minister for External Affairs has succeeded in getting the British Government to recognize the principle, and an Australian representative is to represent the whole of the B r it ' s h Commonwealth in the administration of Japan. I turn now to a matter which has been exercising the minds of many honourable members, namely the development of Russian foreign policy, to which reference has been made by Mr Churchill, and by the Minister for External Affairs in his speech to this House. I do not stand here in the role of 'an apologist for any foreign power. I believe that the quota-' tion made by the Minister for the Navy (Mr Makin ) concerning the welcoming by the present Leader of the Opposition of German re-armament in 1938, should warn us of the danarer of makino: such statements in this House or elsewhere, because they will always be quoted in future. The honourable member for Warrinsrah (Mr Spender) no doubt has V-.= qnnfatioris rpadv to produce shortly. However, I do think that it is a case of "" If the cap fits, wear it "" . The Minister for External Affairs has poh ted out that some of those who were v^ry reluctant to make any expression against the continual development of German aggression - the Leader of the Opposition's statement concerning German re-armament was made after the Munich Pact, when German aggression was patent to whole world-hav e heen very rapid condemn Russia at the first indication of what, at its worse interpretation, was Russian aggression. I do not say any of thing concerning Russian policy, but I do say that ideology has never deterand mined the foreign policy of Great Britain fco any considerable degree, when fundamental interests of the British Empire have been involved. Back in days of Napoleon the expansion of the central power drove Britain and Russia togetheiwliether or not they liked one another's ideology. In 1914 Sir Edward Grey disliked Czarism very much, but the expansion of Germany in the centre drove Britain and Russia together. Simiaggression larly, when the last war began and many was expanding to the East, ' Churchill, who has never had any sympathy for Russian ideology, was willing to become an ally of Russia. So, I do not believe that this issue munism which is always being played in Australia, weighs very much in foreign policy. If there is to be a concerning Persia between Great Britain and Russia-somebod y apparently is expecting it, although Mr Ernest Bevin is not-it will have nothing to do with ideology, but it will have much to with British interests in the Persian Gulf. Russia's foreign policy in historic channels. Its actions on its western front, its present policy in Manchuria and right down to Port Arthur, and its aspirations towards the Persian - Gulf-if there be such aspirations-ar all old in Russian history. I do not know whether or not that is Russia's policy, but the implication of the speeches of honourable members opposite has-always been that it is. I personally do not venture to make an assertion on that point, but I do draw attention to what seem to me to be very wise words on part of the London Times. That newstralia paper statesEelations between Great Britain and Soviet Un on provide at this time a cardinal : test for British statesmanship. They require to the based, as Mr Churchill said, appeasement"" but on ""settlement"". Mr Beazlry. I am quite certain that if the policy enunciated by the Minister for External Affairs be followed by sane international the negotiations, a settlement will be to achieved. The article continuesThat settlement must take account both of the effective interests ancl the effective power both parties. So far as Britain is concerned, favourable results will not be achieved by a policy of words unaccompanied by action, still less by reliance on American support as a substitute for a balanced and carefully least of all weighed British policy. So far as the United States of America the is concerned, Mr Byrnes does not feel that the international situation indicates that a formal alliance between Great Britain and the Uniled States of America is necessary. It is mischief-making to hint, as many have here, that we are eonfronted with a situation pf Russian which will call into being the Gerneed for an alliance between Great Mr Britain and the United States of America. I do not adopt the role of a prophet, but I believe that there is no fundamental disparity of interest, between of ComGreat Britain, the United States of up America and Russia. There was a British fundamental disparity of interest between Britain and Erance on the dispute one hand and Germany on the other, but there is nothing so fundamental in any d""'fference.s, there maj'- be in the relationship that exists between Great Britain and Russia, and the innuendoes do directed at one great power by members of the Liberal party have been is flowing entirely mischievous.",51
156,Mr HOLT,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"Eawkner) [9.41] - This debate has provided the House with one of its rare but welcome opportunities t.o e express some views on foreign policy in so far as Australia is directly interested. It has been made notable by the speech of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) who, I believe, has given to this House one of the most masterly and eloquent pieces of analysis of Australian foreign relations to which we have ever been privileged to listen. If ever athe man could claim to have spoken for Ausand stated where Australia stood', on the live issues facing us today that the man is the Leader of the Opposition in this House. By his cogent and clearnot on elaboration of his points he has made the task of many of vis on this side of the chamber much easier. The Minister for External Affairs (Dr Evatt) has told us in a very long but very disappointing review that the status and prestige of Australia in international affairs have recently been dramatically increased. I believe we are to gather from that that the Minister himself has bad a very large part to play in the position that has developed. He made this claim with a certain degree of selfconsciousness-almos t aggressive selfconsciousness--and not ""without some measure of complacency. We all agree from the'space which has been given to his advocacy of Australia's policy abroad that Australia is a 'better known nation; the question upon which I have yet to be satisfied however is whether Australia, as the result of his efforts, is a more favourably known nation. I believe with ihe Leader of the Opposition that there is a bas c unsoundness in the policy of the ; Minister, which spreads right through the Government and its supporters, which is to 'be found in the emphasis he persists in laying on the separateness of the Australian viewpoint from that of Great Britain. Despite the treatment given to it by the Leader of the Opposition it is necessary to deal with this matter again, because of the speech which Lias just been made by the honourable member for Eremantle (Mr. Beazley). The honourable gentleman chooses to interpret pur criticisms as a charge that the Minister is antiBritish. That is a distortion of what I believe and of the views expressed by t lie Leader of the Opposition. Honourable members sitting on this side of the House regard a strong British Empire as being necessary in Australia's own vital interests. Where we detect unsoundness on the part of the Government and of the Minister is that they have not yet. realized that an emphasis on the separateness of the Australian positionin international affairs and the separateness of the othei' Dominions comprising the British Gomnionwealth must have the effect of weakening, not only the position of Australia itself, but also the existence of the British Empire as a whole. One does not need to be anti-British to weaken ihe position of Britain and Australia. Just bow dangerous this policy may be and how it may prejudice the position of Australia in world affairs is not appreciated by honourable members opposite. The honourable member for Fremantle said that no member of the British Commonwealth desired secession. He did not see any possible weakening of the I m perial connection, and the implication of his speech was that all we had to do was to go along very much as we had been during the last generation or so and the British Empire would retain its pristine strength. Let us for a moment consider some comparatively recent events in the history of the British Empire. I believe that, in as far as"" the British Empire has remained a closely knit Commonwealth of Nations over the last generation or so, it has been due to the determined and persistent efforts on the part of those who saw the strength of their own countries in the strength of partnership and have directed their policies to counter any propaganda in their own countries that would have a tendency to weaken that tie. Let us look for a moment at some other parts of the Empire. It is not so long since Ireland was a full member of the British Empire, and not so long ago when one government in South Africa, was developing a policy of pressure to force separation from the Imperial connection. We have seen developments in Canada over the last ten or twenty years which, while they_ have sought to stress the individuality of Canada in international affairs, have endangered the Empire position because of misunderstandings on the part of other countries as to just where Canada was heading. In view of developments in India today, who can say just how much longer India will continue to be a full member of the British Empire? Coming closer home, I do not think anybody here will forget the illogical and panicky anti-British feeling on the part of many people that swept overthis country during the war and which gave an enthusiastic echo to thestatement of the former Prime Minister, Mr Curtin. that we were turning to the United States of America without any pangs. Thesemanifestations of separateness cannot be lightly dismissed, .and we cannol. ignore the fact that the Empire is noi; so closely knit today as it ' was some time ago. The best interests of Australia lie in the maintenance of the greatest strength in the British Empire as a whole, and therefore we are determined to counter any policy or any administrative act which would have the effect of weakening the Empire simply in order to magnify, for a passing moment, the position of Australia in the world. We on this side of the House have no fears, no inferiority complex as to where Australia stands today in world affairs. For' a people of' 7,000,000 we can be proud of our record. We have aroused the admiration of the peoples of the world who have bothered to study what has happened in this country over the last 150 years. We do not need to try to impress upon the world the fact that we, a nation of 7,000,000 people, aim to be one of the great powers of the world. We can have, as we have pointed out in this place time and again, a voice and an influence out of all proportion to our numbers, by reason of our partnership in one of the strongest national groups in world affairs today, namely, the British Empire. So long as we maintain that partnership unimpaired, the voice of Australia will mean something of significance in world councils. I turn to the statement of the Minister for External Affairs (Dr Evatt). was disappointing in that it consisted principally of a factual review of international events that had occurred since he last addressed the House. Where he indulged in some comment - upon the foreign issues of the day, he provoked the criticism to which the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) gave expression this afternoon. One of our criticisms, upon which my leader did not have time to enlarge, is that, however unsound the policv of the' Government may be while the Minister for External Affairs is in Australia, we unfortunately have no foreign policy at all during his frequent and lengthy peregrinations abroad. From time to time, during his absences, we have vainly attempted to ascertain just where the Government stood on some issue that had arisen, but experienced the greatest difficulty-in fact. I think I can say tha* Mr Bolt. we had no success-in securing a clear, unequivocal .statement as to where the Government stood. There could not be amore graphic illustration of that than was given today in connection with the dispute on the Australian waterfront, arising out of the refusal of Australian waterside workers to load Dutch ships with foodstuffs and medical .supplies for the Netherlands East"" Indies. If ever a government displayed inertia, and a refusal to give positive expression to its foreign policy, this Government has done so in relation to that episode. I believe that there is one recurring and fundamental weakness in the foreign policy of any Labour government that may be elected to lead this country. Labour members are dependent upon the trade union movement for their return to Parliament. I question whether one honourable member opposite could hold his seat if the trade union movement in his electorate decided not to support him. Every honourable member opposite knows that, and is influenced beyond a proper degree by the policy and the, attitude of the movement as they are conveyed to him in his electorate. We have had in this Parliament in recent years more than one instance of a Labour government refusing - to give any expression to its foreign policy, and allowing it to be dictated by thetrade union movement. 1 take a quick glance back to the notorious It scrap-iron episode, out of which honourable members opposite have made party political capital for years. We all know, because in a sense we are professionals, how easy it is to provoke a cheap and encouraging guffaw from an audience by casting a jeer at the policy of our political opponents. I gather from today's press that the Minister for Information (Mr. Calwell) has had some recent practice in that sphere in the electorate of Henty.' He and his kind have made party political capital for years out of the scrap-iron episode. Had the policy of the then leader of the Government been properly understood, not only the workers, but also the people of Australia as a whole, wpuld have commended him for his strength, his diplomacy, and the soundness of that policy so far as Australia was concerned. Let us have a few facts placed on record in respect of that matter At that time, Australia was sending to Japan wheat, wool, and other commodities in large quantities. The quantity of scrap iron which Australia was sending to' Japan was one-twentieth of the quantity that was being sent by the United States of America. Scrap-iron was heing freely obtained by the Japanese Government from a number of countries, which were only too glad to supply it. On the other hand, Australia was obtaining from Japan, during that period, canvas for military tents, silk for parachutes and other defence purposes, and machine tools, for use in our munitions factories to produce munitions with which to fight the Japanese later. I mention those as facts, not merely in justification of the policy that was adopted. The Government of that day decided its own foreign policy on the basis of the facts, public and private, which it had before it. It was not influenced by some pressure group saying, "" This is the foreign policy of Australia; you go ahead and do this "". History will prove the soundness of that policy, and the stupidity of the criticism of it. Do Labour members forget the time when a Labour government in Western Australia was agitating very actively for the transfer to the Japanese Government of the iron ore deposits at Yampi Sound ? I am not trying to make party political capital out of that. Using its best judgment, and on the facts as it knew them, the Labour government of that State considered that it was doing something in the interests of the State by pressing for the transfer of but the' national Government at Canberra-the Lyons Government-realise d the dangers of that policy, and vetoed the proposal. That is an instance of a governiment acting decisively in respeot foreign policy, and it is the way in which any government which claims to speak for Australia, as the Prime Minister does, should act when such Issues arise. But what happened in ""respect of the present dispute in connection with the Dutch ships? The Dutch, as we know only too well, were our tried allies during the war that has just concluded. When their islands were taken from them, they diverted cargoes of valuable material for the assistance of Australia, and stuck by us as we did by them during the whole course of the war. Yet what have we as a people-becaus e it is through our Government that we speak as a peopledone for the Dutch in this dispute? We on this side know, as does every honourable member opposite, that this has been a Communist stunt from beginning to end. The trade union movement knows it. Mr Monk, secretary of the Australasian Council of Trade Unions, has said that he did. not know of any dispute in which there had been more chicanery than there had been in this particular dispute, which has held up these ships for seven months, during the whole of which time the Government, which claims to speak for Australia, has been dumb. What did the Minister say in his statement? He was all for the Dutch and all for the Indonesians, and all the time the ships were tied up while he did nothing. He tried to have "" a bit each way "", without saying a word as to where the Australian Government stood. We learned today that there had been a settlement of the dispute, and to-night we have read of the very understandable reaction of the Dutch Minister in Australia. These are Dutch ships, yet the terms of our settlement propose that two prominent Labour figures, one prominent in Communist trade union circles- Mr . Chappie-and the other prominent in orthodox Labour circles- a candidate in Labour electorates, and a regular henchman whose services are utilized freely for various purposes by this Governmentthose deposits; Mr Barry, KC.",55

158,Mr HOLT,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"He is a very able man. I am not criticizing his ability or denyof ing to him the right to hold the political views that he expounds. The Government appointed these two observers to go on Dutch ships, manned by Dutch nationals, in order to see that the transaction shall be completed as Australia would wish. What would be the reaction of any self-respecting Australian government if the position were reversed, and some other government said, "" We shall not allow our people to load ships unless we can put a couple of observers on board to see that undertakings given to us are honoured ""? That would be an indication that our assurances were not accepted. I hope that the Government will show sufficient courage to settle this matter.",58

161,Mr CALWELL,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,I have known proaction. minent Liberals io appear on the same platforms as Communists.,59
162,Mr HOLT,ENTERTAINMENTS TAX,"I shall not attempt cover the same ground as my leader has already done with regard to the Russian position. There can be no misunderstandaffairs ing on the part of any Russian in this countiy as to where the Opposition stands in relation to Russia. All of' us Jiave admired, as the world has admired, Russia's war effort, and the courage and wonderful performance of its people in the war. We have only the warmest friendliest feelings towards them as people.. The representatives of Russia with whom honourable members have come in contact in this country are charming amiable people, with whom it has been easy to work. If they are a fair repreof sentation of the people of their native land, I foresee very little difficulty in people of the English-speaking democmine racies getting along well with them. Certain factors which create misapprefor hension on our part have been mentioned, and we are not unaware of other factors which create distrust and misapprehension on the part of the Russian people. know that the present regime in Russia Russia. began with the 1917 revolution and that many public men of the English-speaking world were not merely critical of what was done but also took an active part campaigning against Russia. No doubt what was said and done by them has been magnified in Russia. It is easy inderrtand a great deal of distrust on the part of the Russian people because what the democracies have done in the past. We have all these things in mind when we express our own concern developments t'hat have taken place. it comes back to a problem of security, perhaps the Russian people and Russian Government will realise the basic truth that if one nation which seeks security creates a feeling of insecurity among the people of other nations it will in time find that its own last state is worse than its first. If the struggle - for national security is pursued to such a length that every other country of comparable stature he believes that its security is threatened the general prospect of peace and for the world is endangered. That is probably the effect of Russia's The activities of Russian governments, both past and present, have not been confined fco an expansionist territorial policy; it is a to matter of common knowledge that for many, years after the last war the Soviet Union took an active part, in the domestic of other countries, even those as far removed from Russia as is Australia. How would the Russian people react if the Government of Great Britain, the United States of Americaor any other major power sent its representatives into Russia with a view to fomenting trouble, and or educated in their own countries a Russian subjects who then went back to foment strife and discord? Yet that is precisely what Russia has done in many other countries, including Australia. Honourable members have probably heard the Marxist-Lenin Institute in Moscow in which an international group studies the the tactics of revolution, how to underthe confidence of workers in their national institutions, and how to prepare civil war. If I am asked how this policy affects Australia, I reply that some people in this country, who have become notorious in recent years, have been We through that course of preparation in Among them are "" Jock"" Garden, a close associate of the Minister for Transport (Mr Ward). He was one of the first to make the pilgrimage to in his spiritual Mecca. Others include L. Sharkey, president, of the Communist party of Australia; Tom Wriglit. to of the Sheet Metal Workers Union: R. Dixon, assistant general secretary of of the Communist party; L. Donald, secretary of the Victorian State Committee ; Norman Jeffrey and last, but not least, at the in the hierarchy is Mr Ernest If Thornton, who is probably the chief of the gang in Australia. He recently the had his own opportunity to study matters in Russia. It would be interesting to see whether a representative group from this side of the House would receive the same welcome, and be provided with the same facilities, should they endeavour to seek the truth about Russia. I make these comments in no unfriendly spirit, but merely to show why we on this side and the people of Australia generally, and indeed the people of other countries, are concerned :about Russia's policy of territorial expansion, and in particular, wish to know whether that policy of active interference with the domestic affairs of the - democracies will be pursued with the same vigour in the future. ""Will those European countries which have been - devastated by war-Erance , Belgium, the Scandinavian countries, and others"".have any greater sense of security as the result of Russia's expansionist policy or .are they likely to be drawn as satellites into the Russian constellation? Are they ..going to find that in the post-war years the resuscitation of democratic practices is to be fraught with the utmost difficulty? I do not .know what is the view of those who have inspected those countries recently at first hand, but, looking at them from this distance, one would imagine that such developments are inevitable. Industries have been devastated, people ;are scattered, and governmental institutions are in a chaotic state. Obviously,, the rebuilding of those countries will-demand the existence of strong, central ;povernnients. However much we might advocate t.he advantages of private enterprise in times of peace, we must recognize that, in time of emergency, such as these - countries are passing through, there must be strong central governments exercising - emergency powers. Associated with that factor, which is in itself discouraging to those who believe in democratic practices, there is the disheartened feeling of the people themselves, the feeling of how - difficult it is to - start to build again of the mass of governmental restrictions which impede action. We can foresee that in suck a situation there exists the danger - of violent departure from democratic tradition, and a turning, as in the case of 'Germany during the growth of the Hitler regime, towards a strong, central leadership that promises to overcome the difficulties. I should have liked the Minister, in the course of his statement, to have said something of ihe possible future of Europe, as he sees it, of the possibility of countries recovering from the difficulties which beset them, and of the strength of democratic institutions in Europe. Two major wars have been fought in our lifetime to preserve democracy. By the irony of events, after the successful termination of those wars, we find that in many of the countries of Europe democracy is in the gravest danger that it has .ever experienced. The eclipse of democracy would be a tragic thing for the countries themselves, and it would also be a threat to world security; so much so that another avalanche of war might descend upon the world even in our own time. The statement of the Minister contained very slight reference to economicdevelopments. I understand that his department insists on economic developments - which may affect foreign relations being channelled through it, and one would have expected' that, in a review of such length, a more extended reference wou'd be made to economic matters, particularly the developments which have taken place in regard to lend-lease since the House last met, and to the Bretton Woods financial arrangement.",59

When the Government states its policy we shall be in a position to offer such advice as we can - from this side of the House, and I have no doubt that it will be very good advice.
