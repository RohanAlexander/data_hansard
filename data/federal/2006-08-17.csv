7,The SPEAKER,NOES,"I remind all members that they are expected to uphold proper dress standards when they come into the chamber. TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2006 MEASURES No. 5) BILL 2006 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum pre Bill read a first time. Second Reading  Secretary to the Treasurer) (9.19 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill amends various taxation laws to implement a range of changes and improvements to Australia's taxation system. A number of changes in this bill will reduce compliance costs for Australian taxpayers. Schedule 1 implements two fringe benefits tax recommendations from the Report of the taskforce on reducing the regulatory burdens of business: rethinking regulation. The first recommendation reduces compliance costs for business by increasing the minor benefits exemption threshold from less than $100 to less than $300. The second recommendation also reduces compliance costs by increasing the reportable fringe benefits amount threshold from more than $1,000 to more than $2,000. This schedule also further reduces compliance costs by increasing the reduction of taxable value that applies to eligible inhouse fringe benefits and airline fringe benefits from $500 to $1,000. In addition, this schedule extends the definition of ‘remote' for the purposes of the fringe benefits tax concessions, where the shortest practicable route involves travel by water. This is in recognition of the special circumstances of employees who work in locations isolated from populated areas by a body of water. All of the amendments will apply in respect of the fringe benefits tax year commencing 1 April 2007 and all later years. Schedule 2 proposes several amendments to the GST concessions following the establishment of the Military Compensation Scheme under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004. Firstly, this schedule will ensure that supplies of drugs, medicines and other pharmaceutical items are GST free when supplied as pharmaceutical benefits under the Military Compensation Scheme. Secondly, the GST-free car concession is extended to include people whose service in the Defence Force or in any other armed force of Her Majesty has resulted in them receiving, or being eligible to receive, a special rate disability pension under the Military Compensation Scheme. These amendments will take effect from 1 July 2004, the date of the commencement of the Military Compensation Scheme. Schedule 3 removes the part-year tax-free threshold for taxpayers who cease to be engaged in full-time education for the first time. This measure extends the full tax-free threshold of $6,000 to these taxpayers. The amendments were announced in the 2006-07 budget and will simplify the tax law and reduce compliance costs for taxpayers completing full-time study. Under the current law, taxpayers who cease full-time education for the first time are not eligible for the full tax-free threshold of $6,000. Rather, they are entitled to a reduced tax-free threshold that depends on the number of months they are not studying as well as their income during the full-time education period. These amendments apply from the 2006-07 income year. Full details of the measures in the bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Edwards) adjourned. NA BILL 2006 Cognate bill: NA NA (INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS) BILL 2006 Second Reading Debate resumed from 22 June, on motion by Mr Andrews: That this bill be now read a second time.",22
8,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Labor opposes the Independent Contractors Bill 2006 and the bill associated with it, the Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Independent Contractors) Bill 2006. At the conclusion of my remarks, I will formally move a second reading amendment which reflects the substance of the reason for Labor's position. This bill and the associated bill follow on from the government's so-called Work Choices legislation, from its extreme industrial relations legislation. In that, we see an attack upon rights, an attack upon entitlements, an attack upon conditions and an overall attack upon living standards. In the so-called independent contractors legislation we see a further attack upon rights, conditions, entitlements and protections in the workplace and on living standards generally. In the government's so called Work Choices legislation, in its extreme industrial relations legislation, we see an approach which attacks and reduces wages, removes or reduces conditions, and removes or reduces entitlements. That legislation tilts the lever in favour of the employer as against the employee-a weighting of the lever massively in favour of the employer. When it comes to the so-called independent contractors legislation, there are two basic prospects which the government's legislation sets up. On the one hand, under the guise of so-called independent contractors, the legislation will allow genuine employees, vulnerable employees, to be pushed out of a genuine employer-employee relationship and to be established as so-called independent contractors-effectively sham independent contractors. The consequence of that will be that that employee's conditions and entitlements will be reduced or removed, but further burdens will be placed on that employee as a sham independent contractor: the burden of workers compensation, the burden of taxation arrangements and the burden of superannuation arrangements, which would normally be carried by the employer. On the other hand, we have at the state level many very soundly based protections which are there to protect contractors who are effectively in a dependent contract positioncontractors who provide services or a service in the main to one contract partner, not unfamiliar in the transport industry, particularly with owner-drivers. The legislation removes or reduces the protections afforded to dependent contractors to reduce or remove protections currently afforded to contractors or small businesses. It does that by overriding state provisions in state based legislation which have employee deeming provisions or which provide access at the state level to unfair contract provisions and unfair contract legislation. These protections are for the benefit not just of consumers but of contractors and small business. The effective message from this legislation either to a vulnerable employee or to a dependent contractor is: you are on your own. The government has sought to create a mirage that somehow this legislation is good for small business and good for contractors. Nothing could be further from the truth. For small business and for dependent contractors, it is effectively saying: ‘You are on your own. In an unequal bargaining position with a superior contract partner, you will effectively now be on your own, with no access to state based protections, no access to unfair contract provisions, no access to employee deeming provisions.' That is summarised in the second reading amendment which I will formally move at the conclusion of my remarks but will now detail to the House: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House notes that: (a) this bill follows on from the Government's extreme industrial relations changes which are a massive attack on living standards and living conditions, by removing rights, entitlements and conditions of Australian employees; (b) this bill also removes rights, entitlements, conditions and protections afforded to Australians in the workplace, whether employees or independent contractors; (c) this bill does this by allowing employees to be treated as “independent contractors”, thereby removing employee protections and entitlements and placing superannuation, tax, and workers' compensation burdens on them; (d) this bill does this by removing protections from independent contractors who are in a dependent contract position and as a consequence in an unequal bargaining position; (e) this bill effects this by: i. continuing to use the common law definition of independent contractor as the basis of law without the guidance of statutory criteria. ii. allowing employees to be treated as independent contractors in a sham way by ineffective anti-sham provisions. iii. overriding State laws with employee deeming provisions. iv. overriding State unfair contracts provisions which provide protection to employees, contractors and small business. v. overriding any future State and Territory owner-driver transport laws and putting existing State owner-driver transport laws at risk. vi. failing to provide any genuine protections for outworkers through ineffective outworker provisions, significantly weakening outworker entitlements. (f) this bill introduces even more complexity and confusion into Australia's workplace laws; and (g) this bill treats the Senate Employment and Workplace Relations Committee reporting on these matters with contempt by dealing with the legislation prior to consideration of its report'. The central principle which underpins this bill and the accompanying bill is that independent contracting relationships should be recognised and supported and that the appropriate mechanism for regulation is commercial law, not industrial law. Estimates vary as to the total number of independent contractors operating in Australian workplaces. The Productivity Commission estimates, from the ABS forms of employment survey data, that the total number of independent contractors was 787,600 in 2004-8.2 per cent of all employed persons-down from the 1998 figure of 843,900, which is 10.1 per cent of all employed persons. This is disputed by the Independent Contractors of Australia, which has also cited Productivity Commission and FOES data to claim that the percentage of independent contractors in total employment has grown from 16.4 per cent in 1978 to 19.9 per cent in 2004, almost two million employees. Accordingly, estimates range from approximately 800,000 to two million independent contractors in 2004, somewhere between eight per cent and 20 per cent of all Australian employed people. The government's legislation does not seek to define the term ‘independent contractors' beyond its meaning under common law. At common law, employees are engaged under a contract of services, whereas contractors are engaged under a contract for services. In other words, an independent contractor is generally a person who is engaged on a labour only contract, usually determined as a one-off flat rate. Generally, the independent contractor remains responsible for a number of aspects of the relationship that would usually be the responsibility of an employer-for example, superannuation payments and remitting income tax to the Australian Taxation Office. This is problematic and it means that an independent contractor is seen to be a person who contracts for services to be provided, without having the legal status or protections of an employee, even if they are dependent upon that contract-for example, owner-drivers in the transport industry. In addition to this definitional issue, government's legislation covers five key areas. These are: (1) state laws with employee deeming provisions; (2) state transport owner-driver laws; (3) state unfair contracts jurisdiction; (4) outworkers in the TCF industry; and, (5) the so-called sham arrangement provisions. The Independent Contractors Bill 2006 has five separate parts. Part 1 contains the principal objects and the relevant definition as referred to. Part 2 seeks to override state and territory deeming provisions. Part 3 seeks to establish a national services contract review scheme to enable applications to be made to a court for the review of services contracts. Part 4 seeks to provide a default minimum rate of pay for contract outworkers in the TCF industry and part 5 seeks to create transitional arrangements under the legislation. As I have indicated, associated with this bill is the Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Independent Contractors) Bill 2006. The purpose of that bill is to amend the Workplace Relations Act 1996 to deal with the sham employment arrangements. On analysis of the bill, despite government assertions that the legislation is intended to protect independent contractors, the legislation does no such thing. The bill introduces a layer of additional complexity on an already complex industrial relations legal system provided to us by the government. The provisions are highly prescriptive, technical and introduce an effusing array of concepts. There are, for example, pre-reform commencement contracts, continuation contracts, related continuation contracts, remedy contracts, test contracts and a contractor test designed to clarify the continued application of state contractor law under the deeming provisions to relevant services contracts. In addition, some types of contracts entered into after the commencement of the bill will be subject to relevant state laws, while others the will not, depending upon the satisfaction of technical requirements. That difficulty is referred to in the second reading amendment which notes that the bill introduces even more complexity and confusion into Australia's workplace laws. I referred earlier to the application of the common-law test and it is worthwhile dealing with that in more detail. The test for tinguishing between employees and independent contractors is the common-law test as it has been applied by Australian courts and tribunals for many years. It is acknowledged that that test is difficult and complex but the criteria applied by the courts includes: the degree of control the worker has over the work; the degree to which the worker is treated as part of the principal's enterprise-for example, if the worker wears the principal's uniform; whether the worker is using his or her tools and equipment; how the principal pays the worker; whether it is at the discretion of the worker to work, if the principal has the right to dictate hours of work and the worker can refuse tasks; the provision of leave, superannuation and other entitlements by the principal to the worker; the place of work; whether the worker has the right to delegate work to others; whether the worker provides similar services to the general public; and whether the worker is providing skilled labour or labour that requires special qualifications. Genuine independent contractors have always been considered by our courts and tribunals to be in commercial arrangements and are therefore subject to the provisions of contract law. When called upon to test the validity of a claim to either employee or independent contractor status, the courts have applied the relevant common-law test. Affirming this status and the commercial status of independent contractors therefore adds nothing new to the current regulatory framework. The bills, by adopting the common-law test, bring with them all the same difficulties. In practical terms, Professor Andrew Stewart has identified the limitations of the common-law approach. He said: The fact is that any competent employment lawyer can take almost any form of employment relationship and reconstruct it as something that the common law would treat as a relationship disbetween principal and contractor ... thereby avoiding the effect of a wide range of regulation which is typically applicable only to employees, such as industrial awards, registered agreements, leave and superannuation legislation, and unfair dismissal laws. That goes to the first primary point that under this legislation people who are genuine employees, particularly those in vulnerable positions such as outworkers, will be pushed out of the employer-employee relationship, lose whatever protections they have as employees under the employer-employee relationship and then have the additional burden of those things which genuine independent contractors would normally make provision for-namely, superannuation, taxation arrangements and workers compensation. That is the first, central focus of the government's legislation. The government's so-called antisham provisions to prevent people from being pushed into that position are in themselves a sham. So the government's sham provisions are in themselves a sham and require vulnerable employees to effectively apply to a Federal Magistrates Court to seek a determination of that issue. Issues also remain of workers hired as independent contractors under tax law. Concern has been expressed that, while a worker may be hired on a commercial contract basis, they may meet the definition of ‘employee' for tax purposes. Alienation of personal services income, PSI, tax rules which came into effect on 1 July 2000 removed most tax advantages for personal services contractors-while independent contractors must cover expenses for salary continuance, superannuation and the like. This then denies legitimate business deductions for dependent contractors. Similarly, professionals working as legitimate independent contractors who undertake major projects over one year are also penalised under the PSI tax rule-for example, the 80:20 rule. That goes to the second aspect of this legislation: the government is seeking to trumpet this legislation as being of benefit to small business and as being of benefit to contractors. Nothing could be further from the truth. Not only does it introduce that tax complexity to which I have referred but, in the case of genuine independent contractors who essentially provide services to one other contracting partner who is in a dependent position, very many of the state based protections-whether it be unfair contract or employee deeming provisions-are removed, with no subsequent protections provided in the government's legislation. I will now move to an analysis of some of the areas of concern about the bill. I will with state laws with employee deeming provisions. The bills override all existing deeming provisions contained in state industrial legislation which deem certain categories of independent contractors to be employees and provisions granting employee related entitlements to independent contractors. In New South Wales, for example, certain categories of workers are declared to be employees and brought within the scope of industrial relations even though they may be independent contractors at common law. These deeming provisions cover a wide range of occupations, including milk vendors, cleaners, carpenters, joiners, bricklayers, painters, bread vendors, outworkers in clothing trades, timber cutters and suppliers, plumbers, drainers, plasterers, blinds fitters, council swimming centre managers, ready-mix concrete truck drivers, Roads and Traffic Authority lorry drivers and others prescribed by regulations. These provisions seek to redress the unequal bargaining power of these categories of workers which compromises their ability to negotiate working conditions. These are workers in demand categories. In many cases their working arrangements are not different in substance from those of employees. State deeming provisions have been introduced to offer protection to workers from effectively disguised employment relationships. The Commonwealth legislation overriding state legislation is subject to a three year transitional period and the preservation of existing deeming provisions for outworkers and owner-drivers. As a consequence, they will not apply to contracted textile, clothing and footwear outworkers. The bill provides a three-year transitional period for the commencement of the legislation and only deeming provisions in state industrial relations laws will be overridden. Deeming provisions will continue to apply to existing contracts for three years after the start commencement of the act and parties may leave this arrangement early if they wish under section 33 of the principal bill, which provides the parties with an ability to enter into a reform opt-in agreement. The direct result of overriding state deeming provisions will be to leave many vulnerable workers in an unfair bargaining situation and without access to basic entitlements. The second area that I wish to go into some analysis of is state transport ownerdriver laws. The bill provides for an exemption of existing New South Wales and Victorian owner-driver legislation. The New South Wales system includes basic regulatory protection for owner-drivers, including that owner-drivers are able to recover their costs. The New South Wales system includes enterprise specific arrangements for ownerdrivers. The New South Wales system does not apply to genuine independent contract transport companies, instead applying only to single vehicle owner-drivers who are dependent contractors with one company. The New South Wales legislation allows for minimum standards to be created. The Victorian system uses small business models and uses TPA protections-asking what rate owner-drivers would have gotten if they had performed that work as an employee. All contracts must list minimum hours and rates, if any, and dispute resolution is provided by the Small Business Commissioner. The legislation allows for the collective negotiation of rates. Currently only New South Wales and Victoria have state based legislation covering the employment conditions of owner-drivers. Western Australia is proposing to introduce legislation into its parliament shortly and the ACT is also suggesting similar legislation for the Australian Capital Territory. Exemptions of both the New South Wales and Victorian state legislation are to be reviewed in 2007. This review opens up the prospect that such exemptions will cease either before or after the next federal election if the government is re-elected. There has been some coalition disquiet about these provisions, and I note that in the Financial Review the member for O'Connor, Mr Tuckey, urged the minister and the Prime Minister to remove these protections entirely. As a consequence we saw the government committing itself to a review. Most of us in this place know what a review is likely to lead to. If the government is re-elected, the results of that review, on the urging of people like Mr Tuckey, would no doubt see the existing New South Wales and Victorian protection provisions removed, just as the legislation has the effect of preventing other states-for example, my own state of Western Australia-from introducing comparable legislation to protect so-called dependent contractors. The third area is the exclusion of the unfair contracts jurisdiction. Independent contractors can no longer access state unfair contract laws. The bill creates a federal unfair contracts jurisdiction. Arguably, in some ways the bill extends the rights of independent contractors by introducing a national unfair contract regime. However, the states' tests are much broader, and much more easily able to be accessed. The new unfair contract provisions are significantly more limited, for example, than those in New South Wales. In New South Wales, the state Industrial Relations Commission can review a contract which has become unfair subsequent to the parties entering into it. Under this bill there is no ability for employer organisations or unions to apply for unfair contract review on behalf of a party, which is the case under state law. The effect of this part will be greatest in states where existing regulation is most prevalent-New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland in particular. The parties to independent contract arrangements in these jurisdictions will see a sharp decline in the level of the regulation of their relationships. This provision treats all contractors on a purely commercial basis, regardless of whether they are an outworker, a deemed employee or an independent contractor. This will result in a loss of entitlements and protections and will encourage employers to hire workers as independent contractors rather than employees. In addition to removing the state unfair contracts legislation, unfair contract matters will now be tried in the Federal Magistrates Court, a more formalistic jurisdiction. This will add to the expense, the length and complexity of arguments and the exposure to costs. Concern has also been expressed that overriding state unfair contract legislation would water down protection for consumers and small business. Current legislation in state New South Wales and Queensland provides for state industrial relations tribunals to hear cases of unfair contracts and provide remedies. This is because of the broad way in which the employer relationship is construed under these jurisdictions' legislations. The repeal of these provisions reduces opportunities of small business to claim that a contract is unfair. There is no effective federal unfair contracts legislation, and unconscionable contract principles under common law do not provide an effective remedy in most cases. These two areas are referred to in the second reading amendment and draw together the strands of overriding state laws to remove or reduce protections which are afforded not just to individual employees but also to small business and to contractors, particularly the access of small business and contractors to the unfair contracts provisions in New South Wales. Let me move to outworkers in the textile, clothing and footwear industry. Part 4 of the bill provides for a default minimum rate of pay for contractor textile, clothing and footwear outworkers which would operate where an outworker is not guaranteed a minimum rate of pay under state and territory law. The wage is based on the minimum rate applicable to the TCF contracted worker under the minimum wage guarantee contained in the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard. Contract outworkers along the chain of contract, as well as head contractors, may be liable for the payment of the default minimum rate. Records must be kept for TCF outworkers. Contracted outworkers will not have access to relevant state unfair contract jurisdictions. Currently outworkers are deemed to be employees under state industrial legislation in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania. This means they are entitled to all benefits which attach to being an employee, even though they are employed under a contract for services. Clause 7(2)(a) of the bill will permit a state and territory law to continue to the extent that the law applies to a services contract in which an outworker is a party. The bills introduce the notion of an outworker being a contract worker. This dual characterisation will lead to greater confusion among clothing suppliers and outworkers as well as providing an additional incentive to those suppliers to circumvent the current system. It will encourage forum shopping by enabling state outworker entitlements to be enforced under state law, whereas any proceedings for review of unfair contracts must be instituted under the federal jurisdiction. The dual operation of state and federal jurisdictions will result in state authorised inspectors having the added burden of determining the extent to which clothing suppliers have genuine defences under this bill. As well, there is no provision in the government's legislation to aid in the enforcement of state outworker laws such as issuing compliance declarations by companies when engaging outworkers. Nor does the bill require contractors to inform outworkers of their entitlements under the relevant state law. These bills will do little to protect outworkers without the proper application of state based outworker legislation. Given the generally accepted vulnerable and exploited position of outworkers in the contract process, there is a compelling argument that all relevant matters dealing with the engagement and regulation of outworkers should be removed from the jurisdiction established by the bills and remain a matter for state regulation. The legislation as drafted will have the effect of significantly weakening outworker entitlements. The Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee, effectively as we speak, is conducting a private hearing with the textile, clothing and footwear industry to consider these regulations. It would have been preferable if the government had allowed the committee to conclude its deliberations and make recommendations in respect of outworkers prior to the commencement of debate in this House. But I hope that the Senate committee will recommend amendments to the government's legislation to ensure much more effective protection of outworkers. It is clearly the case that this is an area of great weakness in the legislative arrangements. One area of great weakness in regard to outworkers leads me to a major area of weakness in the legislation-the so-called sham arrangements provisions. The explanatory material accompanying the bill states that a sham arrangement is ‘an arrangement through which an employer seeks to cloak a work relationship to falsely appear as an independent contracting arrangement in order to avoid responsibility for legal entitlements due to employees'-the very point that Professor Stewart drew attention to. I referred to him earlier. Page 9 of the explanatory memorandum states: Employees in disguised employment relationships should have appropriate remedies available to them as they are not in reality independent contractors. The difficulty with the so-called sham provisions is that they are themselves a sham and will be completely ineffective in preventing precisely that from occurring. This is in very many respects the major deficiency of this bill. It is not done by error; it is done deliberately. This will enable employees who are genuinely in an employer-employee relationship and who are in a vulnerable position, with unequal bargaining power, to be pushed artificially into a so-called independent contractor's provision that will see them at risk of having their employee conditions and entitlements reduced or removed and also place on them the normal burdens of a genuine independent contractor in terms of provision for workers compensation, taxation arrangements and the like. Those points are picked up in the second reading amendment-that is, ‘allowing employees to be treated as independent contractors in a sham way by ineffective anti-sham provisions'. The so-called sham provisions are of themselves a sham. Let me draw the strands of Labor's analysis of this legislation together. The government would like the community to believe that somehow a so-called independent contractors bill will be beneficial to small business and to independent contractors. Nothing could be further from the truth. For small business and independent contractors, this reduces or removes current protections, particularly those protections made available under state laws providing access to the unfair contract jurisdiction and access to deeming provisions. At the same time, the ineffective operation, no doubt deliberately designed, of the so-called sham provisions will see vulnerable employees pushed into an artificial independent contractor provision, seeing their rights and entitlements reduced and an additional burden placed on them. They are the great two messages of this piece of legislation: you are on your own. I move: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House notes that: (a) bill follows on from the Government's extreme industrial relations changes which are a massive attack on living standards and living conditions, by removing rights, entitlements and conditions of Australian employees; (b) this bill also removes rights, entitlements, conditions and protections afforded to Australians in the workplace, whether employees or independent contractors; (c) this bill does this by allowing employees to be treated as “independent contractors”, thereby removing employee protections and entitlements and placing superannuation, tax, and workers' compensation burdens on them; (d) this bill does this by removing protections from independent contractors who are in a dependent contract position and as a consequence in an unequal bargaining position; (e) this bill effects this by: i. continuing to use the common law definition of independent contractor as the basis of law without the guidance of statutory criteria. ii. allowing employees to be treated as independent contractors in a sham way by ineffective anti-sham provisions. iii. overriding State laws with employee deeming provisions. iv. overriding State unfair contracts provisions which provide protection to employees, contractors and small business. v. overriding any future State and Territory owner-driver transport laws and putting existing State owner-driver transport laws at risk. vi. failing to provide any genuine protections for outworkers through ineffective outworker provisions, significantly weakening outworker entitlements. (f) this bill introduces even more complexity and confusion into Australia's workplace laws; and (g) this bill treats the Senate Employment and Workplace Relations Committee reporting on these matters with contempt by dealing with the legislation prior to consideration of report'.",23
9,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,Is the amendment seconded? Mr Edwards-I take great pride in seconding this very worthwhile amendment and reserve my right to speak.,31
10,Mr CADMAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"In Australia today, many of those hard working independent small businesses that formerly have been terrorised by the union movement and stood over in an unfair way in the workplace will be free at last. It will be a great day for many small businesses in Australia when the Independent Contractors Bill 2006 successfully passes both the House of Representatives and the Senate. If there is any one area that has bogged down Australian productivity and workplace relations, it is the definition of who is and who is not a contractor. We have had the previous spokesman outline that in New South Wales the whole of the building industry is deemed to be employees. Nothing can be more distressing than to meet a contractor who is locked out of a site because he does not carry a bus card or a union membership, when he has been required by the head contractor to go onto a site to carry out work, and to have some musclebound person paid by the union stand at the gate and deny him access to perform his duties and earn a real income. On the other hand, if one looks at the housing industry across the nation, which is totally subcontract and contract, the efficiency, value for money and earnings from those contracts are the best in the world. No housing industry in the world can match the Australian housing industry, all carried out by contractors. That is what this legislation is about. We can have those wonderful contractors get to work without impairment, without its obstruction and without the standover tactics that CFMEU has adopted at so many sites around the country. But it is not only the building industry. There are many other industries where people just want the opportunity to be set free into their own business. Now they will have a proper choice. They will be able to decide whether they want to be an employee or whether they want to be a self-employed contractor. The decision that they have to make will be a clear one, and nobody will be able to coerce them one way or the other because there are protections in this legislation against sham contracts and unfair contract identification. First of all, it needs to be understood that, because this is Commonwealth law, this provision will only apply to a circumstance where one party to the commercial contract is a corporation under corporate law, the Commonwealth of Australia or a territory, or a resident or registered as a business in a territory. So the limitation is there. This law cannot apply to a sole trader or to an individual who is not incorporated. It is a wide ambit, but there are exclusions. If two independent people want to enter into a contract, they can be whatever they like but they cannot be covered by this legislation. The other important factor within the legislation is the definition of who is actually an independent contractor. Unlike the Labor Party, which loves prescriptive law, I am pleased that the government has chosen to use the common law which, over a long period of time, has established precisely what is understood to be a self-employed person. Once we get into the definitional process it becomes like a bill of rights: we all think we know what it means but every bit of it has to be tested in court. So the commonly accepted process which the courts apply to decide who is an independent contractor and not an employee amounts to whether they are working on their own account or through a partnership or a corporate structure. It relies upon the degree of control the worker has over the work-for example: is the worker subjected to direction on how the work is to be performed, not just what the job is? It depends on the degree to which a worker is integrated into and treated as part of a principal's enterprise. A thing like a uniform is a simple indication that a person is presenting themselves to the public as part of an organisation. It also depends on whether the worker is making a capital contribution to the process that is going on, how the principal pays the worker, and whether the worker has freedom to choose their hours of work or whether they have an obligation to work at particular times. The freedom to make decisions as an independent individual is very much part of the common-law test of who is an employee and who is self-employed. Factors such as the provision of leave, superannuation and other entitlements are also taken into account under common law. Another factor is the place of work. Does the person work from their own premises-even if it is from their home-or do they work from a factory, a workshop or a garage? This is about whether they can say that they work from their own premises or use that as a base. What about delegation of work to others? Has a person got the capacity to delegate other people to perform work or to subcontract to them? There is a test of whether the income tax is deducted from the worker's pay by the principal or whether the worker is responsible for their own income tax payments. Common law also indicates whether a worker provides similar services to the general public, so that anybody can come along and say, ‘I would like you to do a job for me.' Another test is whether or not a worker has scope to bargain for their remuneration. There is also the test of whether the worker is providing skilled labour or labour that requires special qualifications. I do not know whether there are many members in the House who are skilled bricklayers-I doubt it. That is a skill that is acquired through study, attendance at TAFE and experience on the job. It also requires the person to bring their own tools to the site. There will be the removal of many of the provisions put in place by state governments that deem a person to be an employee, disregarding their capacity to make some of the decisions that I have outlined and disregarding things such as who they work for, when they work and what skills and knowledge they bring to the site. All of those things are significant in determining who is selfemployed. That is why I am so pleased that this legislation will set so many Australians who have felt oppressed by past industrial law free of all of those inhibitions. They will be able to make decisions from their very first step into the world of being selfemployed on their way to becoming a full and competent business. Another test applied to whether or not a person is an employer or an employee is the issue of deterrence from future harm. Is the principal in a position to reduce accidents and provide for things to be done in a better manner? The background to this legislation is that the government made an election commitment to introduce separate workplace legislation. I do not know of many countries in the world that have legislation like this, and I applaud the government for introducing it. There are approximately one million contractors-maybe more-in Australia. Australians are voting with their feet whether they want to be employees or self-employed. To be employed or self-employed is the test. Most of the young people that I meet in the electorate of Mitchell in north-western Sydney have a high degree of motivation and ultimately want to be involved in something where they make their own decisions and are not reliant on an employer. They say that they want self-managed employment, which means they want to choose between opportunities. This probably involves study of some sort-whether it is for a trade or means going to university. They want to be able to work part-time on a regular basis. It is a mixture of self-directed, self-managed opportunities that they aspire to. This is the true rational voter as distinct from people whom a previous leader of the Labor Party attempted to describe. The fact of the matter is that people aspire to be able to do special and different things, and this legislation will provide the groundwork and the opportunity for that. (Quorum formed) This legislation, for the first time, recognises and protects the unique position of independent contractors in Australia, something that has long been desired but something that has long been fought against by the Labor Party and the union movement. Combined, they have sought to make people who are self-employed into employees. They want to bring them under control. They want to manipulate them and bring them to a status where they can control and manage their lives through the union movement. The legislation will enshrine the freedom of independent contractors to enter into arrangements they choose, primarily based on commercial considerations and on the definition in the common law as to who is selfemployed, free from the prescriptive arrangements that are at the heart of so much of what the Labor Party loves and what the union movement lives on. The bill delivers on the government's commitment to ensure that independent contracting is encouraged, expanded, built up and given opportunities so that people in those industries will have freedoms they do not have at the moment. It will provide efficiencies and joy in the workplace which are not there when people are forced to do things and to behave in a manner which is against their best interests and against getting a job finished. A principle this government believes in is that genuine independent contracting relationships should be governed by commercial, not industrial, law. So the break-out is from aspiindustrial law to commercial law. People will be able to say that they are either employees or contractors. A contractor is self-employed, separate from what an employee is. This bill excludes some aspects of territory and state laws but will provide a fairer and more accessible national contracting review mechanism through the courts if there are proposals to change unfair contracts or to review contracts. The freedom to operate as a genuine contractor should be protected from inappropriate limits. People should have the freedom to enter into contracts. The efficiency of a modern economy relies on our maximising the skills, imagination and creativity of the Australian people, and most often that is best done when a person is reliant upon their own decisions, not the decisions of others. The existing regulation for genuine independent contracting across many of the states is a regulation of entrepreneurship: it limits people. This legislation does not have any sort of statutory requirement for definition, and I applaud that. It is the totality of circumstances surrounding the workplace and what a person actually does that is taken into consideration. This legislation will override most of the states' legislation for people termed as ‘deemed employees'. A previous speaker from the Australian Labor Party read out an amazingly long list of those industries and workers who are deemed to be employees whether they work for themselves or not. What a limitation that is, not only on entrepreneurship but on productivity, job satisfaction and the opportunity to go ahead. So these changes are really significant. Do the changes come into place tomorrow? No, they do not. There is a three-year period for the transition to take place. So state deeming laws will not be knocked over tomorrow-the sky won't fall in. Things will not happen overnight, but within three years those state deeming laws will be wiped out, and if people are a corporation, or one of the partners in a contract is a corporation, or are within a Commonwealth or territory jurisdiction, they will have to change. The transitional period will allow deemed employees and employers to be fully informed about the government's intentions and to make the one-off change. The transitional period will not apply to people who, after the passage of this legislation, enter into arrangements. From now on, people coming into the workforce are no longer able to be deemed as employees. There is protection for outworkers in this legislation and there is a carve-out for owner-drivers in New South Wales. I am sorry that a better result has not been established for the owner-drivers of New South Wales. I understand the difficulties that have been created over many years. I also realise that the Razorback stoppage, along with ‘green dog' and the history of that industrial conflict, was really about owner-drivers wanting unions off their backs. It was also about large freight forwarders trying to control owner-drivers. Owner-drivers in that case rejected the activity of both the Transport Workers Union and the large freight forwarders operating in concert. They wanted to be broken free of those controls. A capacity to negotiate in their own right, which the Trade Practices Act now provides for, should be encouraged so that they can in fact have a concerted and reasonable voice which does not have to be controlled, manipulated or directed by the TWU in New South Wales or anywhere else. That is what Razorback was about. Those are the attitudes we have to resolve and that is why the minister is having a review of the process-a review which I, for one, want to be genuine, to resolve this problem and to give freedom to owner-drivers right across the country, in no matter what state, to make their own decisions, to contract together, to negotiate together for their own benefit and they for the benefit of their families.

11,Mr HAYES,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"After listening to the presentation by the member for Mitchell, I cannot help but think of setting the workers free. It conjures up the in my mind of releasing the dove of peace into the wild blue yonder, but not before ing it a good old-fashioned throttling. From the outset, let me say that I am absolutely opposed to the Independent Contractors Bill 2006 and cognate bill, just as I was opposed to the Work Choices legislation brought down by this government. This legislation will give independent contractors no direct benefit. They will not be better off. It will not better equip them to negotiate with unscrupulous employers or operators. It will not even up the difference in bargaining power that exists between businesses and potential contractors as they ply their trade. Just like the Work Choices legislation, the passage of this legislation will end with duced wages, conditions and entitlements for hard working Australians. This legislation is the culmination of big business plotting with the government to ensure that employers hold every card in the deck when it comes to future negotiations or determining employment conditions of Australian workers. In his second reading speech, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations spent a considerable time using words such as ‘choice', ‘freedom' and ‘flexibility'. As Australian workers have come to understand, when this government uses those words to describe industrial relations, no good can come of it. No good can come of these changes. We have all heard of the quiet lution in Australian labour markets at the moment, which has resulted in a considerable number of individuals becoming contractors and in a shift in responsibility from employers to the contractors themselves. Generally, independent contractors remain responsible for their own superannuation payments and the remittance of income tax payments to the tax office. The minister described contractors as idea people who have chosen to work for themselves. Some people do do that but plenty do givnot. Many are in my electorate, whether they be painters or carpenters-my son included-and they do not get a choice. Either you front up for a job with an ABN and are prepared to act as a contractor or you do not get the job. That is beyond argument. That is a fact of life applying currently in various industries. For many of the people whom the minister describes as having chosen to work as individual contractors, there is no choice. The quiet labour force revolution has meant that the independent contractor is seen to be a person who contracts for services to be provided without having the legal status or protections of an employee, even if they re- are dependent upon that contract for work. Sure, there are plenty of people who have genuinely decided that they will be better off working in a contracting role, who have established businesses accordingly, preferring to retain the capacity to decide when and where they work. I do not begrudge people that choice, although I suspect, if you consider the profile of individuals who have pursued this path, you will find that they are relatively highly skilled, quite able to work for themselves, to ply their trade and to negotiate on a reasonable basis as they sell their services to prospective organisations. As the Uniting Church pointed out to the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations revo- and Education Legislation Committee: We are, however, also aware that there are many workers who are being coerced into moving from being employees to being contractors, although this results in financial disadvantage and lost security of employment. They perform similar work to the work they performed as employees and/or to the work done by employees working alongside them. The church went on to say: Whether or not contracts contribute positively to anyone's well-being depends on their content and the circumstances to which they refer. An exploitative contract which results in less than a living wage creates poverty and is not in the lic interest. Once again, the churches and community groups have spoken out against the dead hand of this government's extreme industrial relations changes. While the minister talks about freedom and choice, individuals and community organisations know only too well that under this government freedom and choice are in fact being removed. The Australian population realise that, when the government talks about industrial relations changes, it is not acting in their interests and that their wages and conditions are at risk. While many contractors might have thought that somehow they would be immune from the excesses and unfair provisions of the Work Choices legislation, the provisions of this bill mean they will not be. They will know that, even if there are changes proposed to contracts, there will be no real negotiations other than around the margins. It is interesting that the government has chosen to exclude small groups from the provisions of the bill before us. It is particularly interesting, given the anti-union, ideologically driven short-sightedness that led to the development of this bill, that ownerdrivers in New South Wales and Victoria were excluded from the provisions because of the strong representations of the Transport Workers Union on behalf of its membership. The bill seeks to maintain the existing legislation in New South Wales and Victoria with respect to road transport owner-drivers, which will be subject to review in 2007. It allows the laws that have been in place in New South Wales for some 30 years-laws I note the minister recognised in his second reading speech as having bipartisan support-whereby owner-drivers can bargain collectively, with minimum rates of pay and goodwill compensation set by a tribunal. The minister notes in his second reading pubspeech that the reason for continuing to exclude owner-drivers in New South Wales and Victoria was that special circumstances face these owner-drivers. He noted that ownerdrivers: ... operate within very tight business margins because of the large loans they have to take out to pay for their vehicles. The minister knew he had once again gone a bridge too far with the original version of the legislation, because the Transport Workers Union rallied in support of owner-drivers in New South Wales and Victoria and provided the minister with some considerable feedback on how strong their feeling was about the original legislation. The union got behind its owner-drivers and convinced the minister of the folly of his ways. It is interesting that action by a union has convinced the minister to change his mind in this circumstance, given that the primary purpose of this bill is, quite frankly, to remove unions from the equation. Let me remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, of the Dawson bill, which is currently stalled in the Senate. Its very purpose is to allow for collective bargaining of small businesses provided that they do not allow a union to be the coordinator of their bargaining. That bill has stalled in the Senate, courtesy of Senator Joyce, but the bill was a government initiative to try to strip any involvement of unions, principally the Transport Workers Union, in representing the interests of their membersin this case, owner-drivers. The fact that the minister has backed down in respect of owner-drivers in New South Wales and Victoria indicates the importance of strong representation from unions such as the TWU, which has proved that it is prepared to get out there and look after its members. Let us face it: its members are running their businesses and applying their trades as owner-drivers in an essential industry in New South Wales and Victoria. There is no doubt that many people within the broad class of independent contractors were deeply concerned at the prospect of what the extension of the government's extreme industrial relations changes might mean for them. Many independent contractors know that they are independent in name only and that, in practice, they are virtually indistinguishable from employees. The prospect of the introduction of this legislation sent a chill through my electorate and certainly through the owner-drivers, who have invested considerable sums of money in purchasing their vehicles, who have spent considerable time in running up their goodwill and who certainly do a lot to earn a living and to provide for their families. Christopher Buttel, a fellow in my electorate, indicated to me that he was concerned about the changing dynamic in the workplace that would follow the introduction of this legislation. He was particularly concerned that there would be an opportunity for companies to use their power to influence the allocation of work unfairly, with the end sult being that your personality, not your work performance, would decide whether you were going to eat next week. Similarly, Robert Serafini told me that he has been driving for 16 years and has invested $70,000 in setting himself up. He was concerned that he was going to lose access to his union and that, without them, he would be under considerable pressure when negotiating future contracts. These are just two ple who have told me their stories, and I am sure they are not unique. The minister may not hear the stories as he travels the boardrooms of Australia spruiking his new industrial relations laws, but people with stories like those of Christopher and Robert are out there. Maybe listening to the real-life experiences of working Australians will be the job of the new Minister Assisting the Minister for Workplace Relations-Joe Hockey might be persuaded to lend an ear to some real-life stories. Maybe it will be the job of the government's new industrial relations task force. But who would know, because nothing has been said about what either the task force or the new minister will be doing. Either way, it will stand in stark contrast to Labor's industrial relations task force, of which I have been a member, which has visited 22 electorates across the Commonwealth and spoken to more than 200 witnesses. We are out there listening to the real voices within our communities. The retention of the protections for owner-drivers in New South Wales and Victoria allows the basic minimum regulatory protections to remain in the industry in a way that does not hinder competition and does not reduce flexibility or destroy productivity. When the minister was driving this legislation through cabinet-until he was tripped up by his backbench-he seemed to forget that there is an additional dimension when it re- comes to the transport industry: we need to be mindful that measures that erode the protection of workers also erode the safety of the entire community. No-one wants a situation in which owner-drivers are forced to take huge risks to meet deadlines. The introduction of unreasonable transport timetables puts at risk their lives and the lives of other road users. That said, the sting in the tail of these exemptions for New South Wales and peo- Victoria, which was provoked by a backbench revolt, is that the legislation will be reviewed in 2007. So, sometime before or after the next federal election, this government is going to revisit these issues. Possibly the biggest problem in this bill is the provision that relates to sham contracts. Quite frankly, the government's sham contracting arrangements are a sham. The explanatory memorandum outlines a sham contract arrangement as ‘an arrangement through which an employer seeks to disguise an employment relationship as an independent contract in order to avoid responsibility for the legal entitlements of an employee'. This type of arrangement is a disgrace. It is an abuse of the system and, as all members in this place know, it is, sadly, far too common. The government has acted to perpetuate the likelihood that sham contracts will be entered into with increasing regularity. If this is what we have to rely on to stop a sham, it has completely failed. While the minister believes that the arrangements he has put in place in this bill will send a clear message to employers that dressing up employment relationships as contracts will not be tolerated, he has failed spectacularly to introduce such a regime. The provisions introduce a reverse onus of proof, requiring a contractee to demonstrate that they could not reasonably have known that the contract was an employment contract rather than a contract for services. That is not all. The worse aspect is that an applicant is required to demonstrate that the contracting arrangement would be an employment relationship. Talk about putting the cart before the horse! For a successful application to be mounted, an affected worker not only has to convince the Federal Court that the contract is, or is intended to be, a contract of service-that is, an employment contract-but also must successfully rebut any claim that the contractee could not reasonably have been expected to know that it is a contract of employment. As a layperson, that sounds pretty complex to me. It is almost as complex as the Work Choices legislation itself. The cynical among us might think that putting such a system in place was aimed not at deterring contractees from entering into sham contracts but at deterring affected workers from challenging unfair sham arrangements. These thoughts are all but confirmed when you realise that breaches will be dealt with by the Federal Court or the Federal Magistrates Court, and not by the industrial relations commissions. These are cost jurisdictions, so any affected worker who manages to get through the earlier complexities of the system also faces the prospect of having costs awarded against them should they be unsuccessful in challenging a sham arrangement. Members on the other side will not mention a word of that. This is the disincentive for people to pursue sham arrangements. Great protections, aren't they? Protections? They are disincentives. They erode access to justice by people who are working as contractors under these arrangements. The simple fact of the matter is that those who are most likely to be caught up in sham contracts are those who are the least able to stand up for themselves. Those workers who are being taken advantage of under sham contracting arrangements are the least likely to be able to put together a case and front up to the Federal Court or the Federal Magistrates Court. However, this government is tearing down protections for the workers who need them most. This government governs for itself and its mates, and certainly not for this country. (Time expired)",34
12,Mr TUCKEY,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"O'Connor) (10.35 am)A simple analysis of the contribution by the member for Werriwa can be put in a very short sentence: ‘The 750,000 persons identified by the Productivity Commissionpossibly extending to 1.9 million Australians-who have, irrespective of this legislation, chosen personally to be independent contractors are too dopey to make decisions on their own behalf and must have their hands firmly held by Greg Combet or, for instance, the head of the CFMEU in Western Australia, Mr Reynolds.' And Mr Reynolds seems to have done fairly well from the job. He has just occupied an apartment in the most expensive apartment block in Western Australia. Maybe, to assist in the financing of that, he sold his share of a $3 million ern in which he has been the major investor for some years. The tavern, I might add, is in the electorate of the member for Brand. Who is being defended in this place? Is it the trade union movement, and the fees it attracts from, for instance, a certain group owner-drivers? And would they ever explain to those owner-drivers the massive conflict of interest that exists when you have the same representative in a market situation defending the rights of your principal opponent? There is no anger and distrust between a waged driver at, say, Fox, and an ownerdriver, but they are competing for the same work. The member for Werriwa quotes a comment frequently made that you have to look after owner-drivers because they have such big loans to pay off. Now how did that happen? Did Lindsay Fox go out in the street and do as they used to do in the old days to collect people for the Navy? Did he put his very large arm around their necks, drag them through the gate and say, ‘You are going to buy a truck, sign up for a very expensive hire-purchase or lease agreement and then work for me for ridiculously low rates'? No. I have been in the business. I have been an owner and I have been a subcontractor. I had a licence to drive a road train-until a conspiracy between the unions and our government and the state governments wiped my licence out, along with those of 30,000 others, because we were not driving regularly. Too bad if you drove three months a year seasonally-you were not considered a regular driver, and you would have to pay $2,000 to get your licence back. And we think we have a skills problem! And now they are talking about bringing in overseas drivers. It was the union movement that wanted to kill off all those licences. But let me come back to the main issue. It tavhas always been a problem for owner-drivers that, by their own choice, they line up andbecause they have got no money-take on a lease contract on an asset, which is worth possibly a quarter of a million plus these days, and pay the highest possible interest of rate. The prime contractor, on the other hand, has two choices. He does not pay that sort of interest rate. He has the option to buy brandnew equipment-well, he might use shareholders' money to pay for it-and then he pays wages. There is nothing wrong with that. That is the judgement he makes back in the front office: a judgement between the cost to his business at his cost of capital and the cost of wages. He is competing with an owner-driver who generally pays very high interest rates and, as a consequence-and, for the member for Throsby's informationusually continues to operate an old smoky truck, because he cannot afford a new one. That owner-driver has got to compete, with his choice of capital, with the prime contractor. That is the judgement. It is not avaricious; that is the judgement. And who is the representative who says, ‘I'll look after you; trust me'? The trade union movement. If this bill were about recognising the role of the owner-driver contractors association as a body representing its members in the Magistrates Court to argue some of these instances, I could see the sense in it. But when people come to this place and tell me they need the protection of the Industrial Relations Commission of New South Wales, when it has a conflict of interest with their entitlement to work, I find it absolutely ridiculous. I am deeply concerned, consequently, that this legislation chooses to exclude from its provisions the laws of New South Wales that create that conflict of interest. And there are a hell of a lot of drivers in vehicle. New South Wales who would like to shed that restriction. Those opposite talk about minimum rates. But once you arbitrate a rate, it also becomes the maximum rate. And independent contracting is all about initiative and hard work, in whatever category, and about delivering better returns, both to the person who takes that independent contracting choice and to the community. Because if you want to double the freight rates to a remote area in Australia-and there are plenty of them-what happens at that locality? The prices go up. If those rates have been decided in a commission that does not take that into account, then it is a bad deal. The prime contractor is in competition. If a freight contract opens up for a major mining company or something like that, it will be Linfox versus TNT versus the other big players-Toll, in particular. And of course their business decisions are made accordingly. They have cheap capital. Ownerdrivers do not. And the fundamental issue is: owner-drivers need to be able to make their own judgements as to the price they will charge. Say you are a really smart operator, and you have saved your money, or you have got an inheritance-maybe mum and dad died and you got their house, which is worth more than a truck these days-and you use cash to buy a truck and you are lucky enough to be able to put a couple of trailers behind that. In New South Wales and Victoria, the two perpetrators of this particular type of legislation, the governments have done everything to make trucking uneconomic for subcontractors by not giving them a decent configuration. But Western Australia has led in that respect, I know. We allow doublebottom semis to run around the Perth metropolitan area-surprise, surprise, they have not run over anyone yet-and that configuration adds significantly to the efficiency of the So someone in New South Wales-and we are going to perpetuate this-spends their own capital and thinks the rate of return they want to get will be a little bit better than bank interest. They buy a brand-new, nonpolluting prime mover and they want a job, given the investment of their capital. They go to Lindsay Fox or they go to Mr Little of Toll and say, ‘I want to work at this rate.' Under the laws of that state they have got to be shown the door. So another bloke, with smoke coming out of his truck's exhaust pipe, gets the job, because the system provides for it. It provides for the minimum amount of investment and the lowest quality equipment-and the owner-driver is stuck with it. He cannot be competitive. He cannot go and buy the more efficient truck, the more environmentally friendly truck, and get a job, because the prime contractor would break the law if he gave him the job, notwithstanding that he has come in and said, ‘I will deliver to that remote Aboriginal community for less money than anybody else.' But you are not allowed to do that under Victorian law. (Quorum formed) Wouldn't it have been good for Kim if he could have called a quorum at the doorstop the other day? Next thing they will be trying it! ‘Don't confuse me with the facts,' those opposite say. Here they have the opportunity to hear me speak on behalf of the very people they say they are defending by opposing this legislation. But they are turning around and denying me the opportunity to explain why there is a conflict of interest in owner-drivers being represented by the trade union movement. Let me say that I understand the circumstances in New South Wales. They have a long history. It is amazing that people can come to this parliament and tell us, quite correctly, how tough it is to be an ownerdriver and then tell us they paid goodwill for the job in excess of the value of the truck they bought. Given that the rule when you buy a business is that goodwill is the luxury value of owning that business, it is silly that they do so-but I do recognise it. My concern with the provisions of this bill that exclude owner-drivers is that they will be across Australia. I think the minister is deluded in thinking he can limit national legislation to one or two states. But putting that aside, I cannot see how this proposal will benefit owner-drivers. As for my suggestion, it is still under consideration. I have had my discussions with the Prime Minister, and I want those people out there who are concerned about these exclusions to know that the government is now going to wait until it receives the report from the Senate committee. I think certain members thought that inquiry was going to be a great opportunity for the trade union movement to put its case. There have been a lot of industry people putting representations to that committee too. Quite properly, the government is going to consider those before this bill is debated in the Senate. I have only requested an amendment that puts a two-year sunset clause into this legislation, so that something is done about it. That does not mean the removal of the rights of owner-drivers in New South Wales, where they are to their benefit. But, as I just said, if we are going to acknowledge some people as being a representative group of ownerdrivers, why isn't it the owner-drivers association? Why is it a group in the trade union movement that has got its eye on its own waged member who is in competition for the job down at Toll or Linfox? The system does not work. The reality is this: if we want to give some rights of representation to ownerdrivers in this case, why not let them form an association? I might add that the government recently put legislation into this House-which passed it and sent it up to the Senate-which allowed owner-drivers and other small business people to negotiate collectively under a set of conditions. The reason that stopped is that the Labor Party voted against it. Senator Barnaby Joyce gets a mention but the reality is that his vote counted for nothing. It is like border protection here the other day: two or three people sat over there. They could not change anything in this place without a 100 per cent vote against border protection by the Labor Party. The same thing applies. If Labor had supported that legislation rather than making a tricky little political point, there would be a provision in as we speak where sections of the contracting community, independent people, could have negotiated collectively by the simple act of notifying the ACCC-and getting their approval, admittedly, but there was a process. That is hung out to dry. To hang it out to dry on the principle that Coles and Woolworths might amalgamate one day-what a joke. Before that happens, Wal-Mart will buy one of them! It is a silly concept and a good opportunity to create some fairness in industry. I oppose these measures because I think they are wrong-but not in the context that there is not a situation in New South Wales that has to be addressed. You just cannot tell a lot of people overnight they no longer have goodwill when they have provided for it. If I can come back to my example of the fellow who got an inheritance and paid cash for a truck, he does not need his superannuation to be protected. He will make provision for that out of the profits of his truck. But that sort of person is denied work under the New South Wales legislation because he cannot be competitive. He cannot come in and say, ‘Look at my beautiful new half-amillion dollar rig, highly efficient and highly environmentally sensitive. It's got a speed limiter on it so I can't drive too fast,' because the boss will say, ‘Can't take you at your price; I'm obliged to pay more and I've got a coupla blokes with smoky old rigs that are on the list already. I daren't put them off, because the union'll go crook.' That is the situation. That is what this piece of the legislation forgets, and it is time this parliament woke up to where the benefits to the environment and the benefits to efficiency arise: out of a competitive environment. But I can bet you the bloke who has inherited that money would not go and do that and put that money at risk. I guarantee you he is not as stupid as the member for Werriwa suggests-how you have to have people who have a $3 million apartment looking after their affairs under the guise of being trade union leaders. Excuse me! This legislation has got to go further, and I hope that the Senate committee will have sensible recommendations for the government that look after people that are in an invidious position of their own making. It has got to be resolved, but not by this process of giving them a conflict of interest.",38
13,Ms GEORGE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I will resist the temptation to engage in a discussion with the member for O'Connor. It would be good advice to suggest the member for O'Connor speak to some owner-drivers, particularly those on long haulage trips, and ask them why they have to resort to the use of amphetamines to meet the contracts at minimum wage levels, to understand that people in that industry do not bargain on a level playing field. The bargaining relationship for many owner-drivers is very unfair and inequitable. I think the comments that we heard from the member for O'Connor and earlier from the member for Mitchell should explain very clearly to the broader community that this bill needs to be seen in conjunction with the government's Work Choices legislation as yet another attack on the rights and protections of working people, particularly of those people who are classified as dependent contractors. The Independent Contractors Bill 2006 continues the government's attacks on the union movement and its right to properly protect and represent the interests of workers. Again, we are not surprised to hear the union-bashing sentiment in the words used by both the member for Mitchell-about which I was quite disappointed, because he normally refrains from playing the personand the member for O'Connor, who has good form on this account. I think the comments that they made about individual people in the union movement are quite unjust and disparaging and not befitting the level of debate that should occur about a bill that has significance for a lot of working people. The minister claimed in his second reading speech that unions are opposed to independent contractors and have used industrial relations and political tactics to try to restrict their natural growth and force contractors into the traditional industrial relations system. Really, nothing could be further from the truth. Neither the union movement nor the opposition has any argument about genuine independent contracting arrangements freely entered into where people conduct their own businesses under a commercial contract. But the situation is far more complex than this in the real world and far more muddied-far more muddied than the minister's simplistic statements in his second reading speech would have you believe and far more muddied than the very superficial comments made about this bill by the member for O'Connor this morning. I want to go to the substance of the argument, try to convince people about the distinction between independent and dependent contracting and argue that dependent contractors are nothing more than employees who often have been forced into a dependent contracting arrangement because they do not have bargaining power to resist that approach from their employer. It is true that, over the last two decades, we have seen a big expansion in non-standard work arrangements. We know that in our country workers have been protected historically by industrial and workplace regulation when they enter into a contract of employment; quite distinct from the self-employed, who are involved in contracting their services out to a number of cliHistorically ents and who have been seen traditionally as in business for themselves and operating under commercial contracts. So we have this quite clear distinction: you are either in an employment contractand you are a worker or an employee-or in a contract for services, where you are seen to be independent and in business for yourself. While one does not argue about the use of non-standard work arrangements in circumstances where the traditional employment relationship is not able to meet the needs changing workforce, it is, in my view, folly in the extreme to not recognise and understand that these non-standard arrangements are increasingly used by employers to undermine the traditional employment relationship and the protections that have been attached to it. In this way, by making people dependent contractors, employers can evade their responsibilities by contriving situations of ‘disguised employment'. I will address these sham arrangements in more detail a little later. In the growth of the labour hire industry we have seen employers shift much of their responsibilities to the third party, the labour hire operators. The lack of regulation allows this industry to be used as a means of reducing workers' wages and conditions-not by all labour hire firms, because some are very reputable. In the absence of effective regulation, you have shonks out there in the labour hire industry who have used that industry as a means of competing on wages and conditions. The industry has grown beyond its original purpose of supplementing labour on a short-term basis that operated through our traditional temp agencies to a means of now replacing entire workforces by unscrupulous operators in an unregulated industry. That is one form of non-standard work arrangement. The other that is dealt with in this bill is what we call the contracting arrangement. and traditionally, contractors are seen as people who conduct their own business or enterprise and who are engaged to perform work under a commercial contract. The ABS use the term ‘own account' worker. They note, as the minister does, that there has been quite a growth in people described as ‘own account' workers, reaching a figure in the vicinity of 936,000 such people in November 2004. According to estimates from the Productivity Commission, around 10 per cent of of a people in employment today work as selfemployed contractors, the largest group being tradespeople and professionals. That sounds fine and reasonable, and we have heard how we have to nurture the entrepreneurial spirit and support people who want to go into their own businesses. There is no problem with that at all. Where it is growing and where it is a genuine independent contractor arrangement, that is fine. As we know, contractor arrangements do not have the rights and responsibilities that go with an employment relationship. But the real point of the debate is this: the distinction between contractors and employees is increasingly blurred, with the terms ‘independent contractor' and ‘dependent contractor' now used to distinguish between contractors who clearly run their own business in an independent manner and those who are contracted to supply their labour to a particular principal controlled or dependent manner. In that huge growth of contractors, it is now estimated that up to 41 per cent of contractors are in fact dependent contractors-that is, nothing more, nothing less than what we have known traditionally as employees who, in a proper and fair system of regulation, would be protected in an employment contract, not in a commercial contract. It is through contracting that employers have been able to evade their responsibility to their employees by contriving situations. As I said earlier, there is nothing inherently wrong with an independent contracting arrangement if both parties freely enter into it with a proper understanding of the nature and effect of such a relationship. Genuine independent contractors conduct their own business or enterprise and are engaged to perform work under a commercial contract. Such an arrangement does not attract the rights and responsibilities of an employment relationship. But in sham arrangements-and this is what I want to focus on-the worker is often unaware that this contracting arrangement transfers responsibility from the employer to the individual worker for obligations such as taxation, superannuation, workers compensation, insurance and public liability insurance. It is a pity that the member for O'Connor is not in the chamber, because I will cite one example and ask him to tell me whether these people are workers or independent contractors. Back at the time of the Olympics, a multinational catering company tried to avoid paying award wages-which they would be responsible for under an employment contract-to their catering employees, some of whom were as young as 15, by attempting to turn them into independent contractors. When the mums and dads woke up to what was going on, they contacted the unions to complain that their children were in a being required to take out an ABN and would be paid only on a commission basis. That was contrary to the award which applied to the employer at the time. That is a simple illustration of what I am talking about in terms of sham arrangements, where people who normally would be covered by an employment relationship-where the employer has obligations for tax, super and workers compensation-turn that arrangement around, transfer the responsibility from the employer to the individual worker and somehow deem them to be independent contractors. What a joke-if it was not so serious! In the Financial Review some 10 years ago-this is how long these scams have been going on-under the headline ‘Huge financial penalties if contractors deemed employees'-that is, if you get caught out by abusing the laws-a tax consultant at Deloittes stated: Due to the steadily increasing volume of employment legislation and regulation, more businesses are using independent contractors and outsourcing to do work previously done by full time employees. No wonder. He argued there were plenty of tax advantages to employers, pointing out that: ... businesses using contractors were not required to pay payroll tax, superannuation contributions, workers compensation and were usually saved the administrative burden of PAYE tax. In a note of caution he said: ... it was impossible to be absolutely certain that all contractors legally remained contractors, rather than employees, but business could greatly increase their ability to survive an ATO audit by adopting a number of basic precautions. And he went on to elaborate. So there we were, 10 years ago, with tax consultants advising business to be very careful about how they constructed these sham arrangements, which transfer all these obligations to the poor individual worker. They were saying, ‘Be careful, boys, because if you get caught out you might face a penalty from the tax office.' As acknowledged by the tax expert, the distinction between contractors and employees was becoming increasingly blurred. It is now estimated, as I said earlier, that up to 41 per cent of contractors are in fact dependent contractors-that is, people who do not run their own business in an independent manner but who are contracted to supply their labour to a particular principal in a controlled and dependent manner, just like the young catering employees, aged 15, whom I referred to earlier with respect to an attempted sham arrangement. Some legal academics state: ... with a modicum of care and ingenuity it remains possible for business to obtain work from individuals who are virtually indistinguishable from employees, in terms of their close connection to the organisation and subordinating to its managers and supervisors, yet whom the common law does not characterise as ‘employees'. This can in most instances be achieved simply through a well drafted contract that is designed to look much like a client/contractor agreement as possible. I think that says it all, and I think the inherent dangers posed in this bill apply to many classes of workers out there who today are genuine employees but who under these sham arrangements are somehow considered to be independent contractors. The limitations in this bill arise from the philosophy behind the legislation: the belief by this government that contractors should be regulated solely through the Trade Practices Act and be subject to laws designed to apply to corporations and businesses. Why should those 15-year-old employees who worked during the Olympic Games not be subject to the protections of industrial law but be seen to be caught up in the ambit of laws that apply to businesses and corporations? What a joke. It denies the reality that many independent contractors are earning their income primarily through their own labour. They are not running their own business or making a profit but rather selling their labour to one person. Frequently that income comes just from the one source. In this position they are indistinguishable in practice from the traditional employeeother than that the traditional employee is still bound by a contract of employment that provides rights and protections. It is precisely for these reasons that, to their credit, a number of state jurisdictions have used deeming provisions to extend the traditional worker protections and entitlements to various classes of so-called contractors. In my own state, the New South Wales act deems certain types of workers to be employees. It includes a range of specific occupations such as cleaners, carpenters, joiners, bricklayers, plumbers and, very importantly, clothing outworkers. As we know, clothing outworkers are one of the most vulnerable as groups of workers. It is quite proper that they have been deemed to be employees under IR legislation in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania. This means that they are entitled to all the benefits which are attached to being an employee, even if they are employed under a contract for service-and more often than not on very low rates of pay and in shocking conditions. The New South Wales government itself believes that if there were not these deeming provisions, there may in fact be a significant degree of inequality in the bargaining power between the worker and the provider of work. That is why some state tribunals also have jurisdiction in relation to the issue of unfair contracts. The case of owner-drivers in New South Wales highlights the inequality in the bargaining relationship for many contractors and why such protections have been legislated. Unlike the member for O'Connor, who obviously is very happy to see wages driven to the bottom with no minimum protections at all, owner-drivers understand very clearly the inequality in their bargaining power. Owner-drivers are single-vehicle operations, the vast majority of whom perform work exclusively for a single operator, the principal contractor. They are highly dependent upon those with whom they contract. Ownerdrivers are price takers in the market. This dependence leads to an inequality in bargaining power and the associated potential for exploitation. Unlike earlier government speakers, I want to place on record my congratulations to the Transport Workers Union. They have highlighted very effectively in the community the enormous pressures that ownerdrivers face, particularly long-haul drivers, trying to meet the conditions of their contracts of employment-often at great risk to themselves and their families. There is the use of amphetamines in that industry and the consequent risks to safety and safe driving that that poses. Is there anything wrong with the fact that state governments have legislated to protect the interests of people and to ensure that there are some minimum standards that apply to ensure that the bar is not so low that their lives and the safety of others are put at risk? While maintaining existing legislation and protections in New South Wales and Victoria for owner-drivers in this legislation, the government intends to review the situation in 2007. I say to the TWU that I would be very cautious about the efficacy of those protections in view of the comments made by the member for O'Connor in the debate this morning. He made it clear that he and others are urging the government to accept only a two-year sunset clause on the protections applying to owner-drivers. At the end of the day we need to realise that sham arrangements have led to huge numbers of people who should be classified and treated as workers, as employees, under an employment contract, but who have had rights and responsibilities transferred from the employer to the worker under sham arrangements to the benefit of the employer at the expense of the individual worker. The bill fails to properly recognise and understand these disguised sham employment arrangements. It denies the reality that many contractors are indistinguishable in practice from employees, though denied the protections that other workers receive through industrial law and regulations. In conclusion, I oppose this bill and the philosophy behind it which seeks to regulate workers through the trade practices and commercial law. The bill does not properly deal with sham arrangements. The bill will in make it easier for an employer to use contract arrangements to avoid their proper and legal employer obligations such as the payment of superannuation, workers compensation and the like, and it will deny large numbers of workers the ability to protect their interests as workers.",42
14,Mrs MARKUS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Greenway) (11.15 am)I rise today to speak on the Independent Contractors Bill 2006 and the Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Independent Contractors) Bill 2006. One bill is the principal bill. The other makes a number of necessary amendments to the Workplace Relations Act. The two bills have the same outcome-that is, to implement the government's 2004 election commitment to establish legislation for independent contractors. The Productivity Commission estimates that there are between 800,000 and 1.9 million people operating as independent contractors in this nation. The numbers are growing. People want the freedom to choose their own path in life and, in a modern economy such as Australia's, there should be a dynamic mix of working arrangements. The Independent Contractors Bill 2006, the principal bill, is the first of its kind. It the first piece of legislation that acknowledges the independent contractor niche by introducing a stand-alone bill, rather than introducing the reforms in the workplace relations legislation. It is a bill that not only acknowledges but also protects this unique sector of the workforce. It delivers on a 2004 election promise and is another reminder of the Howard government's commitment to remove barriers to opportunity, to reduce red tape and to protect the freedom of choice. Independent contracting is not for everyone, but for the people who work in it-for example, the building and construction industry, the transport industry, which includes owner-drivers, the IT industry, the textile, clothing and footwear industry, the services industry, consultants, couriers and cab drivers-this bill delivers legitimacy, certainty and protection. Tradespeople and related workers make up the bulk of independent contractors. Independent contractors are generally microbusinesses. The Productivity Commission reports that 27 per cent of all self-employed contractors are trades based. This is particularly true of the building and construction industry, where the bulk of independent contractors work as tradespeople in the housing sector. Professionals make up the second largest group at 18.3 per cent, with production and transport workers and labourers the third highest, at 10.6 per cent. The June 2004 national profile snapshot published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics shows that there are just over three million businesses in Australia. The majority of those businesses are non-employing-in other words, independent contractors running their own businesses. In my electorate of Greenway as at June 2004 there were 3,866 small businesses in the construction industry and 1,322 small businesses in the transport and storage indusis try. For these people, the bills will, in simple terms, clarify the status of independent contracts as a legitimate form of work, protect the freedom of independent contractors to enter into contracts of their choice, preserve existing protections for certain groups-in particular, textile, clothing and footwear outworkers and owner-drivers-provide penalties for employers who seek to avoid their obligations by the practice of sham arrangements and establish a single unfair contracts jurisdiction. The legislation will further develop an industry based voluntary code of practice for the labour hire industry and fund a compliance and education campaign of $15 million for employers and contractors to inform them of the new arrangements, and it will include specific information on how to make sound contracts. Finally, it will exclude certain state and territory laws which seek to limit the ability of genuine independent contractors to enter into commercial agreements or which seek to draw independent contractors into the net of workplace regulation. This bill will free up restrictions on entrepreneurship and will create more jobs. Independent contracting is a way of balancing work and family, of building wealth and of providing services in a person's own area of expertise. Between 1998 and 2004, the number of self-employed persons grew by almost a quarter of a million people, by approximately 14 per cent. These are people who have taken the initiative to set up and establish themselves as businesspeople. They are not employees and should not be considered by industrial relations law to be employees. As the honourable member for Menzies, the Hon. Kevin Andrews, said in this place on 22 June 2006: Independent contractors are entrepreneurs and, course, the one-person micro-businesses of today are often the employing small businesses of tomorrow. People who have chosen to become independent contractors are people who have chosen to work for themselves to gain the benefits and the flexibility that selfemployment provides. That choice should be respected. The term ‘independent contractor' generally means a person who offers services on a contractual basis. Contracts are set for a duration and for a set fee for a client, and the contractor controls their own work. The contractor supplies their own entitlements such as insurance and superannuation and pays their own tax. In some instances this could be through a third party, such as a labour hire firm. Under this scenario, the contractor is generally seen as running a business in a commercial enterprise. The bills strongly support the notion that independent contracting should be in the realm of commercial law and that the courts should continue to apply long-established common-law tests to establish the status of the contractor. The Independent Contractors Bill 2006 and related bill have a number of provisions that are worth noting. The bills acknowledge independent contracting as a legitimate form of contracting for services that fall outside the common understanding of ‘an employee'. The bills do not define the term ‘independent contractor' beyond its meaning under common law. This provides clarification, certainty and consistency, and it assures people of the freedom of choice to make their own arrangements in respect of their working lives. The bills do not disturb the definition of ‘independent contractor' used by the Australian Taxation Office to identify independent contracts, nor does the principal bill's definiof tion of an independent contractor expand beyond its common-law meaning. It does, however, override state provisions which deem certain classes of independent contractors to be employees. It is ridiculous that under some states' deeming laws a bus driver who is an independent contractor can be deemed to be an employee while a taxidriver cannot. A person who works from home is deemed to be an employee, but if they do the same job on business premises they are deemed to be a contractor. A supplier, an installer of window blinds, can be deemed to be an employee but a plumber cannot. They all provide services, yet the deeming laws marginalise these workers. The deeming laws are a dead hand on entrepreneurship. They choke initiative and relegate people instead of rewarding them. The principal bill, the Independent Contractors Bill 2006, will remove these arbitrary distinctions and free up choice. There will be a three-year transition phase, during which time a fully funded awareness program will be conducted. The funding for this education campaign has been accounted for in the 2006-07 budget. Of particular interest is the way the bills approach the issue of outworkers and ownerdrivers in the transport industry. Australian law recognises two types of outworkersemployee outworkers and outworkers who are independent contractors. Outworkers are considered to be a particularly vulnerable category of worker because of the generally held view that these workers tend to lack bargaining power in relation to their rights and entitlements. According to the Productivity Commission, outworkers are typically women from East Asian background with low English skills and limited formal education. This bill will not override state protections for contract outworkers. When looking at the challenges of this particularly vulnerable sector, the government has sought to protect all workers in this category by extending existing federal provisions which guarantee minimum remuneration for contract outworkers in Victoria to all contracted textile, clothing and footwear outworkers throughout Australia. This provision will be part of the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard and will cover workers who are not already covered by state or territory legislation. A similar provision has been included for owner-drivers. There are a number of large transport companies in my electorate who use contractors, as well as a number of individual owner-drivers, and this bill offers both protection and opportunity. The bills will not override protections for owner-drivers in New South Wales and Victoria. This approach will ensure that the status quo remains in these states, pending a review of owner-driver arrangements to be undertaken in 2007. The review will examine the existing state regulation of owner-drivers, with a view to rationalising but not replicating the existing state regulatory arrangements. All these protections would not be as effective if there were not measures at all levels. Stand-alone solutions help, but unless there is a whole-of-business approach the effect will be muted. This is why the government has also looked at the client end of the equation and has established provisions for unfair contracts and penalties for sham arrangements. Currently, unfair contract laws suffer from duplication. There are systems in place in New South Wales and Queensland where these matters are dealt with by industrial commissions and the federal jurisdiction, which resides within the courts. Under the new provision, the government will establish a single, national unfair contracts jurisdiction as far as constitutionally possible. (Quorum formed) Such a provision will give a small family business and eligible, incorporated independent contractors access for the first time to the unfair contracts scheme. This means that there will be less delay and expense in dealing with applications to the national unfair contracts scheme. Importantly, the bills will allow a financial cap to be imposed on unfair contracts claims by regulation, if there is a demonstrated need. Unfortunately, in the commercial world of supply and demand, some clients do not behave with integrity. The incidence of sham contracts where clients seek to avoid their obligations regarding the entitlements to employees does happen, and we need to discourage that practice. The government has recognised the impact that victims of sham contracts suffer and has moved to include substantial penalties in the bills. The provisions in the Independent Contractors Bill 2006 set a world standard in legitimising independent contractors in their own right. For the first time the status of this sector of the working community is being recognised, with the force of law to create opportunity for this sector and to protect it against unscrupulous operators. These bills have bipartisan support as both the government and the unions recognise the reality of a modern economy. There is a place for government to stand up for the small businesses in this sector by removing barriers to business and protecting those who are most vulnerable. There is also a place where vested interests can agree on what is in the best interests of this working nation. I commend the bills to the House.",46
15,Mr RIPOLL,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Oxley) (11.32 am)Before I go through the detail of the Independent Contractors Bill 2006 and cognate bill and what they propose to do, I make the very obvious point that this legislation is about the government roping in those workers left in the community who as yet have not been directly impacted on by the Work Choices legislation. This is a way for government to rope in those last few workers who are out there either as independent contractors or as employees who would be independent contractors. It also ties in a number of small businesses. The bill is part of the government's suite of reforms to reduce wages and conditions and to strip away unfair dismissal laws and the protections for workers provided by state based legislation. It is to make life harder. I cannot see any other purpose for the legislation. I have certainly heard nothing from government speakers on the bill that would say to me that there is some good intent in it about protecting workers-whether they are independent contractors or small business people. I have heard nothing about it protecting their wages, their hours of work, their conditions, their entitlements or their superannuation. I have heard nothing about it protecting or enhancing their quality of life at work or the balance between work and family. We do not see any of that in this bill or any other part of the government's Work Choices legislation. Speaking about choices, when government members come into the House they cannot help but use the word ‘choice'. It is now a meaningless word, thrown up by government members, and means: if you are forced to do something, you are given a choice. My definition of what that word means is according to what the government do. They give you a choice between accepting something or nothing. That is not choice. It is not real choice; it is not choice of any kind. What this so-called independent contractors legislation will do is leave people out on their own. They are going to be independent, all right. They are going to be completely on their own, with no protection. There will be no protections under law-no real protections for their wages and conditions, their ability to work, how they work or their hours of work. They will be on their own. That is the message that independent contractors are going to receive from the government when this legislation passes this House. In an excellent media release, our shadow minister for industrial relations, Stephen Smith, said that these laws amount to nothing more than the Howard government's latest attempt to slash wages and strip away the conditions of working Australians. That is exactly what it does. On the other hand, Labor genuinely supports people who want to start their own business. There is absolute support for workers who want to start their own business and who have the skills and capacity to go out on their own. They should be supported by government. It should not be made more difficult for them with the introduction of legislation such as this. If the government are trying to create something beneficial for small business and in contractors, they are not going to achieve it through this legislation; it will do precisely the opposite. In fact, the legislation will provide more power to the big end of town, the big market players, who have enormous economies of scale and power over their employees. They will start to push people out of the traditional, normal relationship of employee-employer into so-called independent contracting jobs. You do not have to be Einstein, an industrial genius or someone who fully comprehends all the complexities contained within these laws to understand that, in a normal employer-employee relationship, the employer is bound to carry the burden of superannuation and a whole range of entitlements such as sickness benefits and other things that workers expect as an entitlement, as a right. They are part of the employment contract. For the productivity that workers provide, they are given in return not only a salgovernment's ary but also some assurances and some protection. They can have a life of their own. They can borrow money for a home loan-of course, these days that is more and more difficult. That is the central theme of the employer-employee relationship. These proposed laws will fundamentally change that forever. They will push people out into so-called independent contract jobs but, really, all that will happen is Friday afternoon you will finish working for the big company and on Monday morning you will restart with the same company, wearing the same uniform and doing the same job with much the same conditions, except that now you will be deemed to be an independent contractor. That will mean that perhaps you will be paid a little bit more hour-perhaps not; there is no guarantee of that either because the minimum set by this government is $12.75 per hour. But as an independent contractor you have to carry the burden of your own superannuation payments and you have to carry the burden of dealing with the Australian Taxation Office. You, the employee, the so-called independent contractor, will have to carry the burden of providing for yourself. You will have to insure yourself so that if you fall sick you are competitive. covered in those instances where you may not be able to meet your mortgage payments, which otherwise you might have been able to do had you fallen sick and taken a day off under your normal entitlements. That is what this legislation does: it pushes people out. It makes their lives less secure and it slashes their wages and conditions. There is no question about that. Nowhere in this bill does it argue against that and nowhere in this bill does it put in place any frameworks, legal or otherwise, that will protect people. I think that is the disgraceful part about this bill. As I said earlier on, it is just part of the full suite of extreme industrial relations legislation. Just because this legislation is about so-called independent contractors, people should not view it as being any different from the workplace relations bills, acts and laws that the government has put in place. The intent is identical. The intent is about removing rights, entitlements and any balance of power from an employee, a person working for wages, and rebalancing that that on a power in favour of the employer. I have no beef with employers and good bosses. I have many in my electorate whom I either am friends with or know, and they are excellent employers and excellent companies. They do the right thing not only by the economy and the region in which they operate but also by their employees because they per understand the importance of a solid employer-employee relationship. They understand productivity gains and growth; they understand what makes this country great. They understand why we do enjoy today a good, strong economy, although that is turning very fast and is questionable under the leadership of this government. They understand that it is because there are workers out there, working hard. There are people out there being productive, efficient and globally Does this bill propose to enhance that in any way? No, it doesn't. Does this bill actually propose in any way to put forward legislation that would improve productivity? Productivity is the key to growth and growth is the key to employment. That is how we manage to maintain our living standards in this country and the quality of life that we so enjoy. But these are fragile qualities that can turn and change, and we are seeing that now. We are seeing 10 years of dereliction of responsibility by this government. We are seeing now, 10 years after inheriting a great economy, a growing economy, 10 years of dereliction starting to turn things. We are starting to see underlying inflation on the rise. That will cause some massive problems. We are starting to see interest rates rise. You often hear the government talk about interest rates-they used to talk about interest rates but they are a bit more ashamed to talk about interest rates these days; they are a bit more quiet-of six per cent. Supposedly, six per cent is low. It is low as a number, but it is very high when compared with the rest of the world. Interest rates always need to be looked at in global terms because it is the cost of money. How much does it cost to borrow money? What is money worth? In global terms six per cent in Australia is very expensive. You do not have to look any further than the families around the kitchen tables in Australia right now who are doing their sums on the supposedly low interest rates and realising that they cannot afford them anymore. They realise they are struggling. Another quarter of a percent, that tiny little bit, may be the straw that breaks the camel's back in terms of people being able to afford their mortgage interest payments. No more evidence was needed than the Reserve Bank of Australia this week confirming what we have known for some time: it is more expensive to pay interest payments today as a proportion of your income than it was to pay 17 per cent back in 1989. Some people say, ‘Wow! I can't believe that. I didn't know that.' The evidence is there: it is more expensive today. That is the real cost to families. This legislation does nothing to serve anybody. Interestingly, if you look at the Productivity Commission report done on employment surveys, and which has specific data about independent contractors, you see that over recent years there have been between 750,000 and about 900,000 independent contractors in the data for how many people are in those types of employment arrangements. That number is starting to climb very high. It is now closer to 1.9 million employees deemed to be independent contractors, and it could possibly be well over the two million mark in 2006. These are figures for 2004. Is that a good thing for Australia, is that a good thing for independent contractors, and is that a good thing for workers? I suspect that for many it is, because they are people who are in genuinely independent contract type arrangements where they basically run a small business. They are their own small business. They are an independent, sole operator type of small business. But I think the larger extent of this growth in the numbers is a case of people being pushed out of their traditional contract of employment and onto one-off, flat rate fees, onto the labour only types of contracts. Is that good? I think it will be detrimental for a lot of people. We have only to look at a number of categories-for instance, ownerdrivers, in particular, and taxidrivers. There is a whole range of people who struggle with that halfway house in their employment status: what they are deemed to be under law, particularly tax law and what they can claim, and what they actually are under federal law. This legislation will only further confuse independent contractors and workers. It will further blur the lines between people who deserve a fair go in terms of having proper wages, conditions and protection and people who will be marginalised-people who already struggle, people who are not wealthy, people who are at the lower end of the wage scale who, under these proposed laws, will come under this category of independent contractor and who are in reality nothing at all like a true independent contractor. There are plenty of incidents that demonstrate this. Definition is really important here and a common-law test will be applied. Who is defined as an ‘independent contractor'? Certainly a person who has a degree of control over their own work would in my book be an independent contractor. In many cases, that will not be the case under this legislation it will not be the case for many people who are deemed to be an independent contractor. Also, workers who are wearing the uniform of the company will finish work on Friday as an employee and start on Monday as an independent contractor, wearing the same uniform, driving the same truck and doing exactly the same work. They will be left to fend for themselves, thrown out in the cold and may be told: ‘You have this warm fuzzy feeling inside and you can call yourself an independent contractor. You are a small business person, but you will earn less money and have the burden of extra work. You have to work more hours because you are under a contract to deliver a particular type of product, under a certain set of conditions and for a set amount of money. You have to work harder. You just work a lot harder for the same money, if not less.' Independent contractors will have to provide their own vehicle, tools and equipment-all of the things that you would not expect an employee to supply-where previously the company would have provided the tools and machinery, whatever was needed to carry out the work. So there is a range of issues concerning definition. I think that is going to be a huge problem and cause a great deal of confusion, worse of all meaning that a lot of people are going to be exploited. People will be exploited under these laws because they will not understand where they fit in the legal framework. What is even more confusing is that the state governments provide, under their industrial relations laws, specific deeming of categories of workers so that they are protected. You would think we would protect people from unscrupulous employers, but we need to protect them from unscrupulous federal governments such as this government. There will be some problems where federal legislation overrides state based industrial laws. and That is a great shame because state based laws provide protection for workers and an understanding of the difference between a real independent contractor and an employee and the benefits that that carries. I mentioned earlier but I will mention again the relationship with the Australian Taxation Office, because of rules for personal services income: what type of person are they under law and how can they deal with their tax affairs? If you are a small business person you really do come under a different category with a range of claimable deductions and ways you can organise your business. You could split income between partners in the business or with your spouse or family, depending on how you arrange your business. An independent contractor, you would imagine, would be protected under this legislation and there would be some clarity about how they could organise their business; but the reality is that that is not the case in this legislation. Most people will find that they come under the pay-as-you-go tax arrangement. In tax law, PAYG people are employees. So with that warm fuzzy feeling, which I talked about earlier, the boss might tell you: ‘Now you're an independent contractor. You have all these new-found freedoms and powers. You're just going to get a heap less money and the tax office will still deem you to be an employee. You'll have no other benefits, no rights. You'll have to pay for your own super and make sure you never get sick. And when we do not like you anymore, because no unfair dismissal laws apply to independent contractors, the only recourse you will have will be to go to court at huge expense.' That is something that these people could not afford to do. So there is a minefield of legal problems and entitlement problems for people who are going to be missing out completely. Unfortunately, this will override state powers and provisions that protect workers such as milk vendors, cleaners, carpenters, joiners, bricklayers, painters, bread vendors, outworkers in the TCF industries-who are particularly exploited workers-who need all the protections that can be afforded them by the federal government, by state governments and by the courts. Those people will be the losers from this legislation. Timber cutters and suppliers, plumbers, drainers, plasterers, blind fitters, council swimming centre managers, supervisors, truck drivers, lorry drivers-a whole range of people who would traditionally work for an employer will be pushed out to do it on their own as an independent contractor. If the employer or the contractee rather than the contractor-there is no longer an employer as such-decides that they no longer require your services, they will just terminate the contract. There are no unfair dismissal provisions and the fact that the contract may have been unfair in the first instance will have no bearing. To deal with that you would have to get help from legal experts. There will not be a heap of avenues to pursue. There certainly will not be any protection. While there is provision in this bill to deal with those issues and there will be fines for exploiting people, when you get down to the practical nature of how these things work, independent contractors are not going to have the access to that knowledge or the capacity to use it. It is not their is not what they are about. A milk vendor is not going to be arguing the underlying unfairness of the contract for milk deliveries. Their job is to deliver milk, not to be a legal expert. They are not going to have the finances either to go to court, nor should they have to, nor should the burden be on them to prove their case. The few safeguards in this legislation are weighted heavily in favour of the contractee and will do very little to protect independent contractors. Unfair contracts will be another blow to ordinary people trying to remedy any cases where there is wrongdoing in place. Currently outworkers are deemed to be employees, and this is very important in terms of the relationship between the federal legislation and the state industrial legislation. Outworkers are deemed to be employees regardless of whether or not they are an independent contractor, to afford them the protection they deserve. This will be undermined by this bill. This bill does nothing to help workers or independent contractors. This government says to people, ‘You are on your own.' There will be no support and no protection. You will get bare minimum pay. Your entitlements will go.' Nobody is going to be fooled by this, certainly not independent contractors when they have a closer look at their finances at the end of the month or at the end of the year. This legislation is a disgrace. (Time expired)",49
16,Mr HENRY,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Hasluck) (11.52 am)Listening to the member for Oxley and, earlier, to his colleague the member for Throsby, there is no doubt the Independent Contractors Bill 2006 is a bill which goes to the heart of the political division in this country. This bill is about enshrining the rights of the individual to work under conditions of their own choice without governments or unions imposing limits and conrole. It straints on their freedom to contractsomething that is opposed by the member for Oxley and his Labor Party colleagues. This bill demonstrates the coalition's commitment to freedom of choice in the workplace and that long-held Liberal ideal of encouraging entrepreneurship, self-reliance and self-sufficiency. I quote the Prime Minister from his first parliamentary speech: ... Australia built on deep respect for the individinterested ual ... The right to succeed, to accept responsibilused ity, to work harder if they wish and to be rewarded for it. The individual's success is the community's success ... To reiterate: the purpose of this bill is to preserve and guarantee for Australian workers the freedom to contract, the freedom to operate as a genuine independent contractor and the freedom to engage work through on-hire arrangements. The Labor Party are not interested in freedom of choice, and this is demonstrated by their support for and by the union movement, where ‘no ticket, no start' is the catch cry and workers do not even get to choose which union they join. More telling perhaps than coalition support for this bill is Labor's opposition at the state and federal level, where they demonstrate their commitment only to the power, prestige and wealth of the union movement-not for the benefit of workers of this country; rather, for their own base political purposes. Workers in Australia are voting with their feet. Australians are abandoning the union movement. There are now more independent contractors in our workforce than there are union members. This is a huge concern for the Labor Party. The good news for workers in our national economy is that people are choosing-in fact, they prefer-to work outside the traditional employment framework. This means that our labour force is more flexible, more responsive and better able to react to and satisfy the needs of consumers. Independent contractors are an important part of our modern, dynamic Australian workforce. Trade unions, therefore the Labor Party, are fundamentally opposed to independent contractors, although I note that some unions have independent contractors as members, perhaps in opposition to their constitution. Independent contractors are not in joining unions. The unions have any means possible, from industrial tactics to political manipulation of all too willing state Labor governments, to force independent contractors into the traditional industrial relations systems. I agree with Minister Andrews that the current complex and competing state and federal systems allow far too much interference by third parties in what are essentially private commercial business arrangements. We have already started moving towards this under Work Choices, which prevents federal awards and agreements from restricting the use of independent contractors or labour hire workers, for example preventing businesses from engaging workers outside award arrangements. I read with particular interest the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations discussion paper on independent contracting which was put out last year, and I endorse much of what was said. It was pointed out in that paper that independent contracting arrangements have a very real benefit for contractors, employers and the economy as a whole, which include employment opportunities. Often a significant proportion of an employer's total labour resources will not be required all the time. Contracting allows flexibility, it reduces the need for excessive overtime in busy periods and it reduces labour hoarding. Contracting can also give employers the flexibility to address processes more quickly, which provides greater scope for developing improved ways of doing things. It also allows for more flexible labour use, particularly where job descriptions have become fixed by excessive detail and rigidity. Contractors themselves can benefit from specialisation in particular areas and activities where an employer is not able to do so. Our economy is made more efficient and flexible when people are able to start up small businesses, to respond to rapidly emerging opportunities and to meet the demands of consumers more effectively. I have a particular interest in this bill. electorate of Hasluck is home to many independent contractors-hard working individuals who have made the choice to work for themselves. They want the flexibility; they want the independence of being selfemployed. I have received many representations from these constituents, who are very concerned to preserve and protect their rights as independent contractors. I spent nearly 20 years of my life representing businesspeople in the plumbing and painting industriesmainly self-employed workers who valued their independence and the flexibility offered through independent contracting arrangements. I know the value of these workers to our economy and in our community but, most importantly, I know that their choices and their freedom to operate as independent contractors should be respected and not overridden by Labor governments and unions. I have worked for myself for a good part of my working life. I started my first contracting business as an 18-year-old in rural Australia and then I worked for many years in the building and construction industry. As a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation, I was proud to contribute to the very detailed inquiry report Making it work, which was tabled in this place one year ago. Submissions were received from every state and territory, and I am pleased to see almost all the recommendations of the committee enshrined in the legislation before us today. The Independent Contractors Bill seeks to enshrine in legislation the rights of individuals in this country to contract their services for payment without being deemed to be employees. It upholds the principle that independent contracting arrangements should be governed by commercial law, not industrial My law. Why are the Labor Party so keen to summarily deem independent contractors to be employees? Why are they disregarding the rights and choices of so many Australian workers? Independent contractors make up 28 per cent of the private sector workforce in Australia, or nearly two million workers. Labor have a particular interest in ensuring that this number does not grow and that the advantages of working as an independent contractor are reduced to nothing, because every worker who chooses to be an independent contractor is one fewer potential member for unions. The bill enables these people to be self-reliant and to not be reduced to a number-the lowest common denominator in a collective of mediocrity such as the union and labour movements in this country. Labor will do anything to help their union mates, including trampling over the rights and individual aspirations of Australian workers. The Independent Contractors Bill 2006 and the Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Independent Contractors) Bill 2006 make use of constitutional heads of power-in particular, the corporations power-to override certain provisions of state legislation which restrict the use of independent contractors. This fulfils the Howard government's promise, made prior to the 2004 election, to protect the right of individual independent contractors throughout Australia to enter into contracts of their choice, and to preserve independent contracting as a legitimate form of work. For the information of the member for Hotham, these bills deliberately do not seek to define the terms ‘independent contractor' and ‘employee' other than to reaffirm that they should hold their common-law definitions. The common law has evolved over hundreds of years and has developed complex and exacting legal tests to identify and determine employment status. These tests take into account the entirety of an individual's circumstances and cannot be meaningfully replicated in legislation. Mr Crean interjecting",54
17,Mr HENRY,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"It is typical that the member for Hotham wants to regulate and define everything so that you cannot move outside of it. As I said a little while ago, he wants reduce everything to the lowest common denominator-a level of mediocrity that most Australians do not want anymore. They do not want the labour movement representing them, defining them or telling them who they are or what they can do. You need to move on. This approach was recommended in the committee's report Making it work-and I support the retention of the common-law definitions. A distinction between employees and independent contractors has been made in common law for a very long time. A subtle distinction is that employees are engaged under a contract ‘of' service whereas a contractor is engaged under a contract ‘for' service. This essentially semantic distinction is the expression of a range of common-law tests which take into account the totality of the relationship between the two contracting parties. The matters considered range from the level of direction provided by the employer to whether the employee or contractor provides their own tools. The tests are most clearly set out in the Australian common law in the High Court cases of Hollis v Vabu Pty Ltd and Stevens v Broadribb Sawmilling Company. I noted that, in his second reading speech and in the text of the bill, the minister has not implemented the committee's recommendation to include some elements of the tests used by the Australian Taxation Office to determine independent contractor employment status. The ATO requires that some independent contractors be taxed as though they were employees. However, independent contractors will not be taxed as employees if they are found to be running a personal services business, as defined by the ATO. While I agree with the minister that the test used by the ATO is a self-assessment, is easily mato nipulated, was developed to address tax issues and is much narrower than the commonlaw tests, I still believe some measure of consistency between employment status for the purpose of contracts, industrial rights and taxation can and should be achieved. The Howard government is enshrining the rights and protections in separate legislation in recognitionMr Crean interjecting",57
18,Mr HENRY,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,I am glad to see the member for Hotham agrees with that Mr Crean interjecting,57
19,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,Order! I remind honourable members that it is inappropriate to interject and to respond to interjections.,57
20,Mr HENRY,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"My apologies, Mr Deputy Speaker. The Howard government is enshrining the rights and protections in separate legislation in recognition of the importance of independent contractors in our economy. The decision to not merely include these provisions in the Workplace Relations Act reflects the independent and commercial nature of these contracts, clearly setting them apart from industrial law. This legislation is important to introduce consistency across state borders and to remove barriers imposed by state Labor governments. The legislation will remove the state governments' deeming provisionswhich are arbitrary in nature, deeming some independent contractors to be employees and others to be contractors, often without any underlying logic. This has led to some absurd situations such as independent contractors who drive buses being deemed to be employees whereas taxidrivers are not. In my home state of Western Australia, the state government has been seeking to effectively deem independent contractors through its industrial relations legislation by expanding the definition of ‘employee' to include, for example, outworkers, labour hire workers and contract cleaners. In Queensland, section 275 of the Industrial Relations Act 1999Ms King- Mr Deputy Speaker, I draw your attention to the state of the House. The bells having been rung",57

22,Unknown,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,Sitting suspended from 12.05 pm to 12.19 pm The House having been counted and a quorum being present,58
23,Mr HENRY,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"As I was saying earlier, section 275 of the Queensland Industrial Relations Act 1999 gives the Queensland Industrial Relations Commission the power to declare persons who work under a contract for service to be an employee-a great example of what I have been talking about in terms of Labor governments responding to their union mates and taking away incentives for, and the aspirations of, individuals to be selfemployed and taking away the freedom and the choice to be so. It is worth repeating that every worker who chooses to be an independent contractor is one fewer potential union member. Our legislation enables such people to have their own individuality, be self-reliant and not be reduced to a numberthe lowest common denominator in a collective of mediocrity such as the unions and labour movement in this country. The Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Independent Contractors) Bill 2006 allows penalties to be imposed on employers who try to avoid their obligations under employment law by disguising their employees as independent contractors or who coerce their employees to become independent contractors. The penalties in this bill for so-called ‘sham' contracting are harsh, sending a clear message to unscrupulous employers that this behaviour will not be tolerated. These protections address our responsibilities under international law through International Labour Organisation conventions with regard to disguised employment. Independent Contractors of Australia believe that the independent contractors bill is consistent with and reflects ILO recommendations. In fact, in their commentary on the bill, ICA said the bill ‘applies a highly robust process for combating disguised employment relationships'. The prosecution of employers and employees who misuse independent contracting arrangements is important to preserve the integrity of independent contractors nationwide. There is no doubt that unscrupulous employers may occasionally attempt to coerce employees into sham independent contracting arrangements for whatever reason, and this bill take steps to ensure that those employers are dealt with and that effective deterrents exist to help prevent such behaviour. One of the groundbreaking elements of this legislation is the introduction of a single nationwide unfair contracts jurisdiction. Existing federal unfair contract provisions will be moved from the Workplace Relations Act to the independent contractors bill. This is a more appropriate approach, given these provisions relate to commercial contracts rather than industrial agreements. State unfair contract jurisdictions will be overridden wherever possible using the corporations powers. These bills, along with the Work Choices legislation, ensure the flexibility and responstrip siveness of Australia's labour market and thereby strengthen our economy. (Time expired)",58
24,Mr CREAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I think we have just seen during the honourable member's contribution the contempt that the government holds for this parliament-a government that could not provide a quorum when it was called, a government that will not provide speakers in key debates in this place. You would not have thought there was a more important issue out there in the Australian public than petrol prices, yet the government could manage only three speakers on that bill-three government speakers to 23 speakers on this side. You would have thought the increased deployment of troops to Afghanistan was an important, serious national issue. The government was able to scrape only one speaker",59
25,Mr HUNT,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"It was a good speech though, let me say!",59
26,Mr CREAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"It may well have been a worthy contribution, but there are not worthy contributors joining you. Yesterday, of course, we saw that outrageous abuse in question time, particularly by the Leader of the House. We felt that the government should be held to account. We could not call quorums yesterday because there were no people speaking on the government's side in any debate that we conducted! And that is why we have had the quorum called today. This is an important focus for legislation. Labor opposes the Independent Contractors Bill 2006 and the Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Independent Contractors) Bill 2006 before us because, under the guise of protecting contractors-which I happen to believe is a worthy objective-the legislation in fact does the opposite. The bills away the rights and protections of Australian workers and the nature of the workplace. The Australian workplace is changing and we do have to acknowledge that. There has been a huge increase in the number of contractors and independent workers. We recognise this as an essential development in terms of our evolving economy and the calls for greater flexibility and diversity in the way in which people perform their jobs. It is ironic that this government purports to be the champion of small business, of the contractor, of the entrepreneur, but, oddly, this legislation does nothing to protect them or to benefit them. In fact it strips away those protections which are indeed now afforded by state legislation. The truth of it is that only Labor will protect the rights of individual workers, whether they are regarded as traditional employees or as independent workers. We believe that contractual arrangements and non-traditional or nonstandard work practices should meet a fairness test and should recognise the central role of work in most Australians' quality of life. These contractual arrangements should not be supported where they undermine the employment relationship and such basic entitlements as the right to bargain collectively, the right to fair and decent wages and conditions, the right to be free of harassment or discrimination, the right to proper training to perform the work required as well as, of course, the right to appropriate occupational health and safety standards. These bills are another step down the road to stripping Australian workers of their rights and of their protections. It makes it easier under this legislation to regard an employee as a contractor and so take away those basic entitlements. The bills purport to protect independent contractors but in fact do no such thing. It is another example of the government's doublespeak. Just as it argues its industrial relations legislation is about work choices, it in fact offers no choice. If the ployer is not prepared or willing to bargain collectively, that is the end of the matter. That is the end of collective bargaining in this country-at the whim of the employer. It re-weights the system in favour of the employer. This legislation does likewise in relation to contractors: it re-weights it in favour of the person they are contracted to. This legislation is driven by ideologynot by good management practices, not by fairness, not by the standards for a civilised society. It is driven by the blind belief government in working solely to a free market as distinct from recognising collective responsibilities. We understand better than anyone in this place the importance of getting that balance right. It is what the labour movement has striven for in terms of opening up its relationship with employers to try to find the appropriate balance to drive productivity and to drive profit but to distribute fairly and to not have people exploited. There is a place for both approaches, but this government is driven by its hatred for unions. I was surprised to hear the previous member's denigration of unions, given the great contribution that they have made to this country over many periods of our history. It is about pushing industrial relations to the extreme to re-weight the system. The government has done it in the Work Choices legislation; it is now doing it in the Independent Contractors Bill 2006 and the amendment to the Workplace Relations Act. To understand how this issue regarding contractors has emerged within the workforce, I remind the House of a dispute that occurred last year. It involved my old union, as a matter of interest, and a company called Kemalex. Just when the workers were negotiating a new enterprise agreement, back in April last year, the company told the union that any new workers would be treated as independent contractors. The fact is these em- new employees were, in every way, workers-factory production line workers on minimal wages, with hours and duties all dictated by the company. They had a workforce that previously were treated as employees, but new employees, doing exactly the same thing, following the same commands and the same orders, were going to be called independent contractors. As independent contractors they would have to get an ABN and they would lose their rights to sick leave, annual leave, long service leave et of this cetera. They were mostly migrant women. The point here is that the company tried to categorise employees as contractors, when clearly they were not. There was a lengthy dispute associated with that company. I think the company has simply pulled up stumps and moved to another state to avoid the circumstances. But the fact of the matter is that this legislation before us today will make it even easier for the employer to redefine his employment relationship. What is fair about that? Why should an employee who has given long and loyal service to the company wake up one day and be told, ‘You're no longer an employee; you are an independent contractor, but we want you to do exactly the same functions as you were doing before.' We have to get certainty into the system. Interestingly, this issue of the burgeoning growth of independent contractors and of labour hire companies has been the subject of important parliamentary inquiry and scrutiny. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation-of which the member for Hasluck, who preceded me in this debate, is a memberreported on 17 August in an important document called Making it work. It was an inquiry into independent contractors and labour hire arrangements. The Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee is also inquiring into this bill. It begs the question: why are we debating this bill now before that inquiry reports? Unlike the member for Hasluck's assertion, it is not correct to assert that the recity ommendations of his House of Representatives committee have all been adopted. They have not. There was a dissenting report of that committee-and I will come to aspects of that in a moment-but there were aspects of the report, some 16 recommendations, which received unanimous endorsement. One of those went to an attempt to further define ‘independent contractor' beyond the common law to pick up elements of the taxation definition that the member for Hasluck referred to. Why do we not have in this legislation some attempt to define or codify what constitutes an independent contractor? If we accept that it is important to have legislation covering independent contractors in recognition of the emerging workforce development, why shouldn't we as a parliament seek to define what we are talking about? That is what legislation is. It is not a question of hamstringing people; it is about giving clarity to the circumstance, giving certainty so that these sham arrangements-an example of which I have referred to already-cannot happen. Interestingly, recommendations 2 and 3 of that House of Representatives committee have not been adopted in this legislation. further, because I think it makes common sense that we seek to define the distinction between running one's own business and working for someone else. I think it is a terribly important distinction and differentiation to make in our workplace arrangements not only for the purposes of the commercial activity but for the purposes of people's entitlements and protections. Different laws do apply in different circumstances. Whether a person works as an independent contractor or as an employee, particularly an independent contractor for one employer, why shouldn't that person be entitled to the same rights and conditions as though that person were an employee? It is about attempting to get clarin definitional terms so that those protections can be afforded so that we know the employment circumstance or otherwise that we are talking about. This legislation has two important flaws: first, its reliance on the common-law definition of independent contractor to define the services contract and, second, its overriding of the deeming provisions contained within state and territory industrial relations legislation. This uncertain definition comes about because of the circumstances in which we seek to ascertain whether a person is working as an employee-in other words, working to a contract of service or working as a contractor, whereby they provide a contract for services to produce an agreed result. That is the conceptual differentiation in this; it has been recognised in the common law. The trouble is that this is a definition that increasingly has become blurred. I might say that this legislation will blur it even more. The result of that is that we often get seemingly arbitrary and unpredictable outcomes. The view has been advanced that the real problem with the judicial approach-that is, just leaving it to the courts rather than to the parliament; and why should the parliament I go not have a view on these things-is that it enables one or both of the parties in a work relationship, and usually it is the employer, to evade obligations that would otherwise be imposed by awards and statutes. As Breen Creighton and Andrew Stewart put it, and I quote them because this is relevant: There is nothing wrong in principle with allowing the parties to categorise their contractual arrangements as they choose. But in many cases it is only the “employer” who both understands the nature and effect of the arrangement, and stands to gain from it. In other words, in leaving it to the courts you put more power in the hands of the person who has access to resources and legal advice and a strategic view as to what they want to get from tipping the arrangement in their favour. It re-weights the system in their favour. This is another example of the inequality of the bargaining power between the employer and the employee. Creighton and Stewart go on to say: The advantages accruing to a worker who “freely” agrees to a non-employment arrangement are often illusory. While it may in some circumstances be possible to earn more as a contractor than as an employee, and even to reap certain tax advantages, it is important not to underestimate the real value of the statutory and award benefits foregone. The point I am making is that the employer is better placed to understand the legal and financial significance of the status of the employee, usually to the employer's advantage. This bill makes no attempt to codify or define the relationship. It does not provide any certainty and it is part of a strategy to make it easier to strip away people's basic entitlements. The House of Representatives Making it work report recommended that the government maintain the common-law approach but that it should adopt aspects of income tax law-a point conceded even by the member for Hasluck when he made his contribution; and it ought to have been, because he agreed with it in this unanimous recommendationsuch as the alienation of personal services income tests to identify independent contractors. If it is appropriate to have it applied for taxation purposes, why not start to pick it up for the purposes of identifying tests that determine whether or not a person is an employee or a contractor? It should not be difficult to codify that which the common law has spelled out by way of tests. I think it is important for the parliament to try to do that. The other flaw in this legislation is that, this legislation aside and the common-law uncertainties taken into account, there has been in state and territory legislation the realisation that some attempt has to be made to define. And so we have state and territory legislation that does what is called deeming-it deems certain people to be employees. These are the deeming provisions. That does give certainty in those jurisdictions. But what does this legislation do? It overrides it. So, where a state has taken steps to bring certainty and clarity, this legislation will override it. This legislation has the effect of overriding state law deeming such contractors to be employees, with the consequent denial of access for them to the protections provided by state industrial relations laws. So, where the states have attempted to define and codify, this bill overrides them. The government wants to provide clarity but it ignores the common-law tests and an attempt to codify it. It ignores the taxation test, despite the unanimous recommendations of the House of Representatives committee, and it overrides state legislation. This bill should be withdrawn. It is an inadequate response to a very important issue. We believe that the consideration by the House of Representatives committee, as well as by the Senate, should be allowed to proceed before we go further with this bill. I suggest to this government that it withdraw the legislation and that it talk with the opposition about how we can get clarity; that is important for all those in the equation. It is important not just for employers but also for people-and for their entitlements and for clarity and certainty within the system.",59
27,Mr SLIPPER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I would like to say at the outset that every so often there is a debate in the parliament and both sides of politics take different positions. The Labor Party here appears to be going back to the old concepts of class warfare of the 1890s. The member for Hotham is no doubt speaking from the heart, but the reality is that the Labor Party is so completely out of touch with modern working arrangements in Australia that we have heard a troglodytic speech from the honourable member for Hotham. The government made an election commitment in 2004 to introduce separate legislation governing independent contractors and on-hire arrangements. One only has to cast one's mind back about 10 years to see that the Labor Party made a whole series of promises prior to getting elected and then broke those promises. We in government deliver on our election commitments. We place a high level of priority on keeping faith with the Australian people. Prior to the 2004 election the government said that, were we to be re-elected at that poll, legislation similar to the legislation currently before the House would be placed on the statute books by this government. The government's proposal of the Independent Contractors Bill 2006 indicates that we want to clarify, make certain and protect the status of independent contractors in order to provide for certainty and choice for a significant number of Australians who are working in fields as diverse as housing construction, transport and information technology. It is simply a fact that more than one million independent contractors are currently in the Australian workforce. This government and, indeed, this parliament would be entirely neglecting our collective responsibility if we did not bring in legislation to recognise that people today are no longer working under the old working arrangements. This government-and I am sorry to hear that the opposition does not-respects the rights of genuine independent contractors to manage their own affairs and enter into their own agreements with their clients if that is their preference, just as it respects the rights of employees to be accorded the relevant legal protections. Independent contractors are a crucial component of a modern economy and of a modern, flexible labour force. One would have thought that was an axiom, yet one has to be disturbed by a situation where the Labor Party is opposing this legislation. It is as though it is seeking to make sure that independent contractors are no longer able to run their own businesses, as they do, and ought to in effect become employees once again. The government wants to protect through this legislation the freedom to contract, the freedom to operate as a genuine independent contractor and the freedom to engage work through on-hire arrangements. The government's proposal for an independent contractors bill is intended to clarify and protect the status of independent contractors to provide for certainty and choice. The Labor Party, through weasel words, is seeking to have this legislation withdrawn. What it would really like is for it to be mandatory that independent contractors be employed as workers in the future. That is unacceptable. Honourable members who have looked at the Notice Paper would be aware that there are two bills: the principal bill and a bill amending the Workplace Relations Act 1996. The principal bill recognises and protects the unique position of independent contractors in the Australian workplace by supporting their freedom to enter into arrangements outside the framework of workplace relations laws. This outcome will be achieved in a number of ways-that is, by excluding certain state and territory laws which seek to limit the ability of genuine independent contractors to enter into commercial arrangements or which seek to draw independent contractors into the net of workplace relations regulation, by providing a transitional scheme for workers deemed by state or territory laws to be employees and by providing a national services contract review mechanism for independent contractors. Again, the Labor Party would want you to believe that this government has no respect for the rights of workers, but the bill retains under state legislation protections for contracted outworkers in the TCF industry. In addition, where contracted TCF outworkers are not covered by a law providing for some form of minimum remuneration, they will be covered by the wages guarantee in the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard. The principal bill will only exclude state and territory laws with respect to workplace relations matters. Despite what some opposition luminaries have suggested, the bill will not interfere with non-workplace relations matters in state or territory laws. These matters include taxation, workers compensation, occupational health and safety and superannuation and go to any definition of an employee for those matters. (Quorum formed) As I was saying before I was interrupted by the honourable member for Ballarat, who was wasting time of the House by calling for a quorum, the amendment bill will complement the principal bill by prohibiting sham contracting arrangements, where employers seek to disguise the employer-employee relationship as an independent contracting relationship and thereby avoid the legal entitlements that are due to employees. In his speech the member for Hotham seemed to be saying that the government was riding roughshod over the rights of workers. This government is seeking a balanced approach; it is seeking to implement an election promise. The amendment bill will: insert a new part into the Workplace Relations Act 1996 that prohibits sham employment arrangements and provides penalties where sham arrangements do occur; make consequential and transitional amendments relating to textile, clothing and footwear outworkers; and provide consequential amendments relating to unfair contracts in the Workplace Relations Act and the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005. The incidence of independent contractor arrangements is becoming substantially more significant. I mentioned a figure of more than one million independent contractors. Actually, estimates of the number of independent contractors in Australia range up to 1.9 million. It could well be that up to 19 per cent of Australian workers are independent contractors. The Labor Party gets concerned because people are voting with their feet and walking away from union membership. While unions might well have played a very important role 100 years ago, today unions have become insufficiently focused on positive outcomes for workers and have been playing politics and ideology, with the net result that, unless people are forced by circumstance to join a union, generally speaking they believe that their union membership fee would be better used if it remained in their pocket. That is why, particularly in the private sector, the proportion of union membership has dropped below 20 per cent. That is an ongoing situation. Given their connection with the Labor Party and given their significant control over the Labor Party both now and historically, the unions are quite desperate. Every so often you find the Labor Party comes into the parliament and essentially acts as the mouthpiece for the union movement. The speech by the honourable member for Hotham is an indication that that old ideology held by the trade union movement and the Labor Party is not dead but ongoing. That is the situation. The Labor Party is proving itself to be irrelevant and once again shows itself to be a party of the unions-controlled by the unions and operating for the unions. That is a matter of some concern. There are a number of provisions in the bills. There is a definition of an independent contractor. In the principal bill this definition is not broadened beyond its common-law meaning, and courts will look at the whole of the relationship between the parties and consider a range of indicia, such as the control of the worker over the work, economic independence and the description of the relationship in a contract. The opposition would have us believe that sham arrangements, whereby people who for all intents and purposes are employees will be deemed to be independent contractors, will continue to occur. I am pleased to be able to assure the honourable member for Hotham and those opposite that the definition of independent contractor in the principal bill is not expanded beyond its common-law meaning. So any concerns that people might have through the scaremongering tactics of the opposition in relation to this matter are entirely lacking in validity. The indicia that courts are required to consider under the common-law test include the degree of control the worker has over the work and the degree to which the worker is integrated into and treated as part of the principal's enterprise. For example, if the employer wears the principal's uniform and represents the principal's enterprise to the public, this supports the worker being found to be an employee. Another matter to be looked at is whether the worker is making a significant capital contribution-such as using his or her own motor vehicle or carrying the maintenance and the running cost-to the enterprise. Also relevant is how the principal pays the worker. For example, payment by results supports a finding that a worker is an independent contractor, whereas payment on an hourly basis supports a finding that a worker is an employee. Other factors to be considered are whether the worker has an obligation to work and the provision of leave, superannuation or other entitlements. These entitlements usually only apply in employment situations. The place of work is another factor. If the worker works at his or her own premises, this supports the worker being found to be an independent contractor. Other relevant considerations are whether the worker has the right to delegate work to others, whether income tax is deducted from the worker's pay by the principal, whether the worker provides similar services to the general public, whether there is any scope for the worker to bargain for his or her remuneration, whether the worker is providing skilled labour or labour that requires special qualifications-if so, this supports a finding that the worker is an independent contractor-and whether the issue of deterrence of future harm arises, for example where the principal is in a position to reduce accidents by efficient organisation and supervision. This may support a finding that a worker is an employee. I am pleased to reassure the honourable member for Hotham that the court will determine the appropriate weight to be attributed to the indicia depending on the circumstances of the case and then come to a considered conclusion about whether the worker is an employee or an independent contractor. The government's policy position is that genuine independent contractors should be governed not by industrial law but by commercial law-because they are not employees, that is the appropriate way to go. As they are independent contractors they are running their own business and work under commercial and not employment contracts. This legislation is not extreme. It is fair and reasonable and reflects the workplace situation of 2006. It recognises that up to 18 per cent of working people are in fact operating as independent contractors. A government which did not legislate to protect and entrench the position of up to 1.9 million Australians is a government which would be failing in its responsibility to the Australian people. These bills are strongly worthy of support. They are bills which seek to implement a promise made by the Australian government to the Australian people at the last election. We are delivering on our mandate. We were elected to office by the Australian people to implement a range of promises. The promise being implemented by this legislation is one of them. We are entitled to have this policy implemented and we seek the support of the parliament so that we are able to keep faith with the Australian people in this manner. I commend the bills to the House.",63
28,Mr MELHAM,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I rise today to oppose the Independent Contractors Bill 2006 and the Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Independent Contractors) Bill 2006. I begin my remarks by quoting from the minister's second reading speech, in which he said: The coalition believes everyone's life opportunities are diminished by restrictions on the freedom to work. I do find the comment incongruous from a government whose sole purpose in this parliament has been the imposition of restrictions through its appalling Work Choices legislation. This legislation has already had such a deleterious impact on the lives of so many Australians. I first spoke on the so called Work Choices bill on 9 November 2005. At that time. I warned: With this legislation the government has come down fairly and squarely on the side of the employers ... The government does not even pretend to be fair in this situation. This trend began with the discriminatory attack on the building and construction industry; it continued with the attack on all workers covered by federal legislation and now continues with this piece of worthless legislation. The net effect of the independent contractors bills is to ensure that basic rights are ripped away from contractors. These rights include those which are so fundamental that they should defy definition: annual leave, workers compensation, long service leave, superannuation, sick leave and paid public holidays. The term ‘independent contractor' is somewhat misleading. Many of these contractors are not independent. The legislation does not seek to define the term ‘independent contractor'. Instead, it relies on the commonlaw definition. At common law employees are engaged under the contract of services, whereas contractors are engaged under a contract for services. In other words, an independent contractor is generally engaged on a labour only contract, usually determined as a one-off flat rate. Generally the independent contractor remains responsible for a number of aspects of the relationship that would usually be the responsibility of an employer. This is problematic. Most recently we have seen examples of how this relationship is demonstrably not independent-to the detriment of the contractors. Figures from the Productivity Commission based on the ABS forms of employment survey estimate that there are 787,600 independent contractors in Australia, 8.2 per cent of all employed persons. Technicians installing for Foxtel, for example, pay for all their materials-a van, tools and petrol. There has not been an increase in their contract rates for over 10 years. Optus workers were made redundant earlier this year and re-applied for their jobs as independent contractors. There is no doubt that Optus management was sure that the company would not suffer financially as a result of this change-indeed, rather the opposite. Owner-drivers delivering Tooheys beer faced a 42 per cent cut when Linfox took over this year. The vast majority of ownerdrivers, for instance, are single vehicle operators who are highly dependent on the employers to whom they contract. Often ownerdrivers only work for the one employer. They can only work for that operator and must take the price they are offered. There is little independence in terms of bargaining power, and the contractors are vulnerable, never more so than if this legislation passes both houses. Many trucking families live on overdrafts as they struggle to pay off the huge debt incurred in purchasing a vehicle. Surveys have found that around one-third of people could not find permanent work and three-quarters believe that these arrangements are simply used by their employer to avoid any obligations to their staff. In my own electorate there are a number of owner-drivers. Their stories, provided to me through the TWU, are a clear illustration of why this legislation must be defeated. Adam works in the general transport industry and has invested $300,000 in his business. He believes that deregulation will mean a decrease in rates for many drivers. Adam also believes that he will have to increase an already high workload-in excess of 70 hours a week. David, with 17 years of service and $100,000 invested, also believes that driver rates will be negatively affected and is concerned about his ongoing vehicle repayments, maintenance and fuel costs, which still need to be serviced. He says: I think it's a disgrace that a government that says its on the side of small business has just kicked so many, right in the guts. Another owner-driver, Ian, sees the introduction of this bill as a direct attack on his ability to collectively bargain. He said: My mates have stuck up for me in the past but I guess after this, I'm on my own. Andrew is also concerned about the impact on collective bargaining. Andrew said: Now I am going to have to pay solicitor fees to go to court when before my union was able to represent me for free. I thought I had the freedom to choose. Another constituent, Ali, a courier with $150,000 invested in his business, is worried about the fact that the deregulation will see an increase in the number of unsustainable operators. Ali works in the very competitive courier industry, where ease of entry and little product differentiation means that there is always a high turnover and a high level of unsustainable operators-drivers working for very low rates to build a client base. He also sees it as an attack on his ability to resolve disputes in an easy and affordable way: If I went up against a company outside the commission-I wouldn't win, I couldn't pay the big bucks, I'd spend two weeks income to win back a day. I understand that the legislation now excludes owner-drivers from New South Wales and Victoria. This has been as a result of significant lobbying, not the least of which has been from the Transport Workers Union. The comments and stories I have quoted are from my own constituents in Banks in Sydney. I would be very surprised to find that these do not represent the views of owner-drivers across Australia. In the 1960s the particular vulnerabilities of owner-drivers were recognised-by a Liberal government. A commission of inquiry established that there was an ‘overwhelming case' for the regulation of ownerdrivers. The inquiry recognised that, while owner-drivers were contractors, they operated in a dependent relationship with the employing companies. The current New South Wales act-the Industrial Relations Act 1996-recognises enforceable minimum standards providing the certainty of at least cost recovery; the prevention of unfair destructive competition by preventing undercutting across a site or industry sector; the capacity for incentive systems to flourish above the minima on either an individual or an enterprise level; tection against arbitrary termination of the contract; no-cost and timely access to the Industrial Relations Commission for the resolution of disputes about various matters, including goodwill; and the capacity to recover goodwill where termination of the contract has resulted in that goodwill being unfairly extinguished. This system has had bipartisan support in New South Wales since its inception. In Victoria, an inquiry was established in 2003 which established that significant disadvantage exists amongst owner-drivers, requiring legislative intervention. The Victorian government passed the Owner Drivers and Forestry Contractors Act 2005 to remedy this situation. Some of the critical elements of this act include: the provision of an information booklet to the owner-driver prior to the entering into of a contract; the provision of published rates and cost schedules to the owner-driver prior to the entering into of a contract-this identifies the typical fixed and variable overhead costs for that class of contractor and the base hourly and casual rate that would typically apply to that class of contractor; that contracts must be in writing and include the guaranteed minimum hours of work; the rates to be paid and the minimum period of notice applicable; the creation of the capacity for owner-drivers to appoint a negotiating agent; the establishment of codes of practice in relation to ownerdrivers and hirers; the prevention of unfair business practices through the articulation of a series of tests in relation to unconscionable conduct; and the establishment of a low-cost, accessible dispute resolution procedure under the auspice of the Victorian Small Business Commissioner. As I understand it, it is the government's intention to preserve existing New South Wales and Victorian arrangements and protections-and, on behalf of those people in promy electorate who are impacted, I am very pleased. Nonetheless, the exclusion begs the question: if it is unacceptable for the independent contractors of New South Wales and Victoria, why is it acceptable for the independent contractors of the other states and territories? It shows the typical short sightedness of this government. I also note that the government will review this exemption in 2007, which opens up the prospect of whether the review will be before or after the next federal election. The likelihood is that the exemption will be rescinded-I am a pessimist. The Australian Labor Party oppose these bills. We note that it is a continuation of the government's attack on the conditions of Australian workers, and we will continue to oppose such unfair legislation.",66
29,Mr HARTSUYKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak on the Independent Contractors Bill 2006 and the Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Independent Contractors) Bill 2006. I welcome this opportunity to address the House on a measure that is extremely important to working men and women throughout Australia. I use the phrase ‘working men and women', though some may find it strange in this context, because I wish to highlight the changing nature of employment in the Australian economy and the change in attitude that has enabled us to make so much progress in the last 10 years. I believe that the phrase ‘workcompete ing men and women' now covers a far wider section of society than some of the old class warriors on the other side of the House and in the labour movement would have us believe. It is worth noting the figures given to the House earlier this week by the Minister for Education, Science and Training and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women's Issues. More than one million new jobs for women have been created since 1996, and there are now 4.6 million women in employment-a 28 per cent increase since 1996. The working men and women of Australia are increasingly grasping the opportunities and the benefits of the modernisation of the Australian economy. They realise that old definitions and the old ways of doing things are no longer good enough. They realise that they cannot stand still while the of the world shakes off the old attitudes that have retarded growth. They realise that, if we ignore what is happening in the rest of the world, we do so at our peril. Let me remind members why this government brought in the Work Choices legislation-part of the government's reform agenda, of which this bill is a further element. The reason was that an increasingly global economy is also an increasingly competitive international scene. The benefits that we have seen since 1996-namely higher wages, more jobs and better living standards-have come from successfully dealing with competition. We all recognise that we have a huge opportunity in selling our natural resources into the rapidly growing economies of India and China, but not everyone seems to recognise that we could not have taken advantage of that opportunity if our ports and docksides were still crippled by a range of restrictive work practices. We have to recognise that, as these economies grow, they will not only take our resources but also with the wider range of sectors in our own economy, and they will be competing against companies within this economy from a far lower cost base. This is not to say that we should, or can, compete with them on the basis of cost alone. But what we have to do is remove the impediments that restrain us from achieving our full potential. We have to be lean, fit and fast on our feet. As I have said in this House before, we are a country of only 20 million people. In a global economy, we simply cannot afford to have six separate industrial relations systems. China's population is estimated at more than 1.3 billion. We have only 20 million. The European Union does not have six separate state systems. It has 25 member nations, and they are considering harmonising toward a central workplace relations system. Resisting or ignoring these trends is pure rest folly. Of course, many in the union movement resist out of pure self-interest. The thrust of Work Choices and the Independent Contractors Bill is to provide flexibility with safeguards. So let me now turn to the union reaction to one way in which flexibility is provided for both employees and employers. As I have said, our future prosperity depends on being able to compete in international markets. I think we would all agree that Qantas is certainly a company that has to do this. Against a background of sharply rising fuel costs and operating in a market which is threatened by terrorism, Qantas is provided with quite a challenge. Qantas realises, if it is going to compete in an international market, it has to have world competitive practices in every aspect of its operation, and that means in relation to its workforce as well. The company has signalled that one of the remaining ways in which it will be able to compete more effectively is to have a look at the way that it has 38,000 employees on 45 different enterprise agreements. I know Qantas is very keen on, and sees very much the benefits of having, Australian workplace agreements. This issue has also arisen in relation to Jetstar. Jetstar would be provided substantial benefits through the use of AWAs. But we know what the unions' attitude is to AWAs. We know what the opinions of the Australian Labor Party are towards AWAs. Their approach to this is to rip them up, if they ever get the chance. I would be interested to know what the Australian Labor Party and the unions would say to the some 2,800 applicants who have sought the 200 jobs at Jetstar on AWAs. Would they be wanting to tear up those AWAs that have been provided with those 200 jobs? I think they would. As we have heard recently in the House, almost one million AWAs have been entered into. The Australian Labor Party and the union movement would have such AWAs torn up. It is interesting to note that the mining industry-one of our most successful export earners-attributes a substantial proportion of its success to the labour flexibility that offered by AWAs. It is estimated that the abolition of AWAs would cost some $6.54 billion, according to the Mines and Metals Association. It would be interesting to see the impact of a loss of $6.54 billion on the bottom lines of companies which are employing Australians, paying tax and producing the wealth which enables this country to prosper. But what does the Australian Labor Party do? It just resolves to simplistically tear up these arrangements-to tear them up and retreat behind the walls of Fortress Australia, to bury their heads in the sand and to ignore the way in which the rest of the world travels. Unfortunately for the Australian Labor Party, Fortress Australia is not a refuge any more. The global economy means that we have to compete. We cannot put up barriers. The Independent Contractors Bill is very much a part of ensuring that we have the sort of flexibility that enables people to contract, to come up with efficient outcomes for their customers and to provide a much more efficient economy. The writing is on the wall. We cannot afford to tear up AWAs. We cannot adopt the strategy of Fortress Australia. The Australian Labor Party in their stance choose to ignore the evidence which they have before them. They choose to ignore the government's record unemployment. Our record unemployment is most impressive. We have unemployment at record 30-year lows. We are achieving higher wages. We are achieving higher standards of living. The government have achieved much of this through reform of the labour market-reform that is being fought by the Australian Labor Party and the union movement every inch of the way. The unions and the ALP have said that the sky will fall in. They have said that there will be mass sackings. They have said that a is whole range of adverse consequences would occur through the introduction of Work Choices. They indicated that it is a bit like putting termites into your house. They cannot ignore the fact that in the order of 50,000 jobs are being created a month. The sky has not fallen in. Mass sackings have not occurred. The empty rhetoric which has been put forward by the Australian Labor Party and by the union movement is being exposed for what it is-nothing but empty rhetoric. Whether we are talking about AWAs or provisions for independent contractors, the rhetoric is the same. It is nothing but scaremongering. They believe that something that is good for employers cannot possibly be good for employees. They say that a provision that helps small business, just by its very definition, has to be somehow bad for employees. But we as a nation have moved on, including the 1.9 million working men and women who have chosen not to be union members but to manage their affairs as independent contractors. There are now more independent contractors than there are union members in the Australian workforce. This government, through this legislation, is going to help those people by giving them the freedom to run their own businesses as they see fit, not being dictated to by a union which they do not wish to be a member of. As with Work Choices, we need to rationalise the current situation by removing the inconsistencies that currently exist between the states, by removing the barriers that state legislation presents to those wishing to set up their own business as contractors and by reducing compliance costs, which place a proportionally larger burden on the small business sector. The current system tends to try to force independent contractors into the traditional industrial relations system, which is simply not appropriate. If an individual has taken the decision to become a contractor or an entrepreneur, they should be free to negotiate their own terms and conditions. Both they and their business partners should be able to reach an agreement without the restriction that a contractor should be treated as an employee, with all that that entails. It is only providing this kind of freedom to negotiate that both partners can take advantage of the flexibility that independent contractors can offer and that is necessary for us to remain a globally competitive economy. So the bill will ensure that independent contractors operate under commercial arrangements, rather than employment arrangements. It will override state and territory legislation that deems contractors to be employees for industrial relations legislation, and it will ensure that sham arrangements are not-and, I repeat, not-legitimised. It is clearly a nonsense that in New South Wales, for example, a carpenter could be regarded as an employee, whereas elsewhere in Australia the same carpenter may choose to be an independent contractor. That also applies to another 12 categories of workers. Just as Work Choices banned clauses in awards and agreements which set out to prevent the recruitment of contractors or to impose conditions upon them, this bill will override state legislation to ensure these deemed workers operate in a less restrictive environment. Those currently deemed to be employees under state law will continue as such for three years, unless they decide to become an independent contractor in the meantime. This will give them a chance to consider the new arrangements and, if they wish to, make the necessary changes. As I said, we should reduce the burdens on those running their own businesses as much as possible, and this breathing space will give them plenty of time to make that transition. On the one hand, then, the bill will enable those who wish to operate as independent contractors to derive the full benefit from their independent status, to take full advantage of the opportunities of the dynamism of the Australian economy and to strike whatever agreements best suit their personal and by working environment. On the other hand, it also offers protection to those who might suffer by being forced into a position of independence and provides restraints on employers seeking to avoid their obligations. Just as the Work Choices legislation recognised that there were both good and bad employees, and good and bad employers, this bill will provide a civil penalty for those employers who try to evade their responsibilities by declaring genuine employees as contractors through sham arrangements. The Office of Workplace Services will take up the cases of those employees who are disadvantaged in this way. Interestingly, in the light of those false allegations that Work Choices actually set out to abolish awards, there will be penalties for the breach of an award if it is found that a person was treated as a contractor when they were in fact an employee and had not been paid their full entitlements as such. These penalties will also be incurred for breaches of the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard where that applies. These range from $6,600 for an individual to $33,000 for a body corporate. There will also be safeguards for contractors as the bill will signal a move toward a single system for dealing with unfair contracts and a move away from the duplication and confusion that flows from overlapping state legislation. The corporations power will be used to override state regimes, and the Federal Magistrates Court will be given the power to hear unfair contracts cases, thus giving contractors easier and cheaper access to remedy under the law. This will apply to both incorporated independent contractors, who do not have access to the federal system at present, and to those operating as natural persons. There are also two groups of workers who, rightly, will receive special consideration under this bill. Currently most states regard outworkers in the textile, clothing and footwear industries as employees. Clearly, those who work on their own, have little opportunity to organise with their coworkers and may be unable to work their way through the supply chain of subcontractors in the event of having to claim any money owed to them, are a special case. The Independent Contractors Bill will therefore not affect state legislation that is specific workers, but the Fair Pay and Conditions Standard will apply to those outworkers where they are not covered by a law providing some form of wages guarantee. This again shows that, far from removing all the safeguards for workers, this government believes in providing protection for workers in a vulnerable situation. This bill retains the special provisions for owner-drivers in New South Wales and Victoria. Owner-drivers have historically been recognised as having particular vulnerabilities and requiring special protections. Many work for only one commercial partner and face interest payments on large loans needed to buy their vehicles. The provisions that currently stand in the state legislation of New South Wales and Victoria to determine contracts and for dispute resolution will remain. However, it is right that we should try to achieve consistency across the whole country. I welcome the review that will be undertaken with the aim of rationalising these particular laws. It is worth noting the comments by Labor's workplace relations spokesman, Stephen Smith, who said this morning in his usual uninformed way: ... many owner drivers in the transport industry, for example, it takes away very many of the statebased protections for dependent contractors. This, in the good opposition spokesman's inimitable style, is, as usual, completely wrong. As I have just noted, the protections for owner-drivers in New South Wales and Victoria, the only two states which have such legislative protection, will be maintained by this legislation-not taken away but maintained. Once again the shadow minister has got it completely wrong. At least this point has been acknowledged by the New South Wales Transport Workers Union secretary, Tony Sheldon. In a media release on 3 May, he said: ... the Independent Contractors Act will maintain to outprotections for NSW owner-drivers. It would be good if the Australian Labor Party at least talked to their union mates now and again. This lack of attention to detail by the Labor front-bench is why they seem to get it so wrong. So often on workplace relations they get it wrong-they just do not understand the issues, and they do not understand the debate generally. In conclusion, these bills, together with many of the provisions of the Work Choices legislation, will benefit many small business people and encourage those thinking of going into business. They offer them more freedom and more flexibility. They reduce the administrative burden. They provide safeguards and redress. For many areas in regional and rural Australia, such as my electorate of Cowper, the vast majority of businesses are small businesses. They make up the bulk of the local economy. The more people we can encourage to set up business-whether they operate as a single independent contractor or whether they employ a number of people-the better. In a modern economy, independent contractors are working men and women. Entrepreneurs are working men and women. Jetstar cabin crew are working men and women. Working men and women need to have the freedom to determine conditions that reflect their particular circumstances and which enable them to make the maximum contribution to the economy and to their own families and finances. I commend these bills to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Brough) adjourned.

30,Mr BROUGH,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"Longman-Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Indigenous Affairs) (1.29 pm)-I move: That the amendments be agreed to. I think all sides of the House would agree that the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 2006 is very important legislation. I noticed that one of the newspapers this morning-I think it was the Courier-Mail-when commenting about this had a fact wrong. That is unusual for the Courier-Mail. It stated that this legislation was introduced by the Whitlam government. As was rightly acknowledged by those who sit opposite-I think it was the member for Banks yesterday or the member for Lingiari-it was Fraser government legislation then and landmark, as it was. I certainly was not part of government at the time, but I think all those at the time had great hopes that this legislation would lead to a new and improved set of circumstances for Indigenous Australians around landownership and ultimately around self-determination. Unfortunately, again as I am sure we would all recognise in this House, that has not come to fruition. There has been a nine-year period of consultation for this bill. Wonderful and positive contributions have been made by a variety of groups, by the Northern Territory Labor government, by the Northern Land Council and by individuals. And the process will continue. There has been a long and wideranging debate in the Senate on this bill and on the amendments to it and a number of different views have been expressed. The one thing we all agree on, whilst we may disagree on how it can be achieved, is that we all have the goal of alleviating the plight of the First Australians, the Australian Aborigines. The last 30 years have promised much but delivered far too little to many of these remote communities. As I said in this place yesterday and previously, the bill before us, which I hope to bring to conclusion shortly, is not putting any requirements on Aboriginal Australians. It is making the way forward to a better future easier, should they elect to do so. The bill will make the operation of what is already available less onerous, quicker to implement and less confusing for those who are part of the process. But, most importantly, it can make reality what the rest of us take for granted-and that is the opportunity to own your own home in your own right, if that is something you choose to do. The amendments we are reconsidering today are the culmination of amendments to the original bill that were moved in this place; amendments to the amendments, which are money matters and which were moved in this place; and then a range of other inconsequential amendments, predominantly made in the other place. This now brings it all together, and hopefully today we will bring this matter to a conclusion. The honourable member for Lingiari has a couple of other amendments he wants this place to consider, so I will not delay the House any further.",74
31,Mr SNOWDON,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"Lingiari) (1.33 pm)by leave-I move: (1) Senate amendment 7, omit “, (12)”, substitute: “, (12), (13)”. (2) Senate amendment 8, omit the amendment, substitute: “Schedule 1, item 192, page 74 (line 16) to page 76 (line 28), omit subsections 67A (12) to (17)”. These amendments relate specifically to the issue of intertidal claims. The first amendment relates to item 189, proposed section 67A(5). It will have the effect of omitting paragraphs (12) and (13). The more substantial amendment, however, is an amendment to schedule 1. The purpose of this amendment is to omit proposed sections 67A(12) to (17)-all of those proposed sections dealing with the disposal of claims on intertidal zones. The purpose of this I will make clear. There has been no procedural fairness in relation to these amendments. We are trying to prevent the government from effectively extinguishing claims which have already been assessed by the land commissioner and recommended for grant but which have been not granted by successive federal ministersMinisters Ruddock, Vanstone and now Brough. The recommendations for grant were made as a result of claims made in 2002 and 2003. The government is now moving to extinguish these claims. For each claim, Justice Olney stated that approximately 2,000 traditional owners would benefit from the grant. Justice Olney was also confident, judging from his long experience as land commissioner, that non-Indigenous interests would be accommodated as a result of his recommendations. There has been no discussion with the traditional owners who would be affected by these amendments, as proposed by the government, and no attempt made to seek their agreement or otherwise. This demonstrates a total lack of interest by the government in sitting down and dealing with traditional owners in a way which is fair to their interests and to their rights as Australian citizens. After all, what we are talking about here are claims which were made legitimately under the provisions of the Aboriginal land rights act, claims which were heard at a great cost to the Commonwealth, the Northern Territory and land councils representing traditional owners in the Northern Territory. During the land claims process I have observed and participated in land claims hearings over many years, and they are extremely arduous. But there is no fairness in this approach, because the claims have been made, the hearings have been held and, as a consequence of those hearings, recommendations have been made by the land commissionerrecommendations which sit on the desk of the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. If the minister were reasonable and the government were reasonable, they would have dealt with these claims once they had arrived on their desks and the land could have been granted once issues of detriment, should there be any, had been properly addressed and dealt with. There has been no attempt by the government to validate why it is that they are proposing to go down this course. The only reason that I can contemplate is that they are doing this because of political interests not in this chamber. There is absolutely no doubt at all that this undermines the rights of Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory as traditional owners and, I would argue, deprives them of rights as Australian citizens. This is not what this parliament should be about. What we should be about is enhancing the interests of all Australians, building upon the rights that they currently have, not diminishing their rights or seeking to take away their rights and eliminating the possibility, in this case, that they might have land granted to them. I know that the family of a very good friend of mine, Barbara MCCarthy, the member for Arnhem and a member of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, is affected by these amendments. There has been no discussion with her family about these amendments. (Extension of time granted) In any event, people's rights are being eliminated by the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 2006. It is not fair, it is not reasonable and it is not appropriate. I know the minister and others travelled to the Borroloola region over recent months. Had they wanted to, they could have sat down at the time and discussed the matter with the traditional owners. It was not raised by the government and its representatives. In fact, the irony is that we were there to hand back land. The minister was treated with great respect by those people to whom he was handing back the land. They understood that this process not only took them a long time in their particular instance-islands off Borroloola-but recognised their integrity, their cultural and spiritual affiliation and their traditional ownership of the country that was handed back to them. The minister spoke well on that occasion, and I was pleased he was there. But he could well have sat down with the other people who are claimants, whose rights he is now eliminating as a result of these actions. This is not fair, it is not reasonable and it is totally un-Australian. I say to the minister: reflect upon this action. I say to the minister: you have one last opportunity, Minister, to fix this problem by accepting our amendments. We are not seeking to substantially change other areas of the amendments that you have put forward-primarily because it is very difficult technically-but we are moving these amendments. I say to you, Minister: here is an opportunity for you to show your bona fides to the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory-and, indeed, of Australia-to show them you understand their interests and their rights, to show them that you appreciate the significance to them of the land and to show them that you understand that they have been through this process, that land has been recommended for grant and that you are prepared to grant it.",75
32,Mr MCMULLAN,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"Fraser) (1.42 pm)While I do want to speak on the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 2006 because I feel strongly about some of the matters that have arisen, it may also be appropriate if I speak just long enough for the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and the parliamentary secretary to get a few procedural matters sorted out, so let me do both things. I was concerned when the bill first came in, and with the comments the minister made in introducing these amendments, that the criticism of what has followed on from the original land rights act is far too sweeping. There has no doubt been some disappointment, but let us not ignore the substantial economic and cultural benefits that are flowing from the recognition of entitlement to land. It was an important Whitlam government initiative that the Fraser government quite properly brought to fruition, and we ought not to underestimate that. The minister said that there has been a very substantial degree of consultation. There has, and it led to a very broad area of agreement about amendment to the land rights act. It was very welcome; I agreed with every element of that. But the trouble is that this bill goes far beyond that. I am shocked now to find, after listening to the member for Lingiari and noting the amendments he moved, that it goes further than I was even aware. I was not conscious in the original discussion that this significant impact on the tidal zone and on the rights of people was to be retrospectively aggregated. I have never heard of such a thing. It must be very close to being unconstitutional in terms of these people's claims, almost being property rights, being taken away from them. I assume that matter has been looked at by others, but I am shocked. Given what I understand to be the procedural agreement, I will give my colleague the member for Kingsford Smith a chance to speak. But I am distinctly unhappy about the broader process and shocked about this immediate matter with which we are dealing. I hope these amendments moved by the member for Lingiari can be supported.",76
33,Mr GARRETT,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"In following on from the remarks made by my colleagues the member for Lingiari and the member for Fraser, I want to speak about the way this legislation has travelled through the House and about the significant disquiet on the part of Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory because they do not feel that the consultation process has been at all adequate. Traditional owners and others have legitimate claims under way and are going through a process which includes, under the Aboriginal land rights act, claims on the intertidal zone. By the effect of the government's legislation, they now find that they no longer have the capacity to proceed with the claims made by them for their country and for their rights to country. It is a particularly poor day for Indigenous people in the Northern Territory when legislation like this comes through the House at such a pace. The member for Fraser mentioned the aspects of the legislation that Labor are supporting. During this debate, Labor put the proposal that we should split the amendments and identify those parts of the legislaintertion which have consent and which mining organisations, traditional owners, governments and communities believe have purpose and merit. We want to look closely at those matters on which there is consent. They are the matters that should be considered by this House. That is what democracy is all about. People have anxiety and concern because they do not feel that they have been properly consulted or because they feel that their rights are being denied or taken away. Those rights, which were hard fought for some 40 or more years ago-and we will be recognising and commemorating some of those campaigns in this House over the next 12 months-will be denied under this legislation. I again echo the comments of the member for Lingiari to the minister: there are amendments here which we think have merit and deserve your consideration. The way in which this legislation has come through the House has not served the people of the Northern Territory.",77
34,Mr BROUGH,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"Longman-Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Indigenous Affairs) (1.46 pm)-I thank the honourable members for their genuine beliefs and thoughts on this issue. I understand where they are coming from and where they believe the system is at. I want to clarify that this legislation was brought up with and provided to the Northern Land Council in October 2005. It is not new; it has not been sprung on anyone. I do not want anyone to think that for a moment. I understand the views of members opposite. The current bill provides for the disposal of land to the intertidal zone and to the beds and banks of the rivers. We are literally talking about-as members would know but many in the gallery might not-a mud flat between highand low-water mark. We are talking about that bit of land. It is about having a line in the sand so that people know what is in and what is out and where they have connection. Claims covering the banks of rivers that are not contiguous with Aboriginal land are being disposed of. We believe that those claims which cover narrow strips of land are inappropriate to grant because of the issue of tidal water marks. For what it is worth, I might add that this legislation is in line with the proposal put by the ALP's Northern Territory government. Whilst I understand the reasoning behind your position on this and your beliefMr Snowdon interjecting",78
35,Mr BROUGH,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"The member for Lingiari reminds me that they are not here; they are his ALP colleagues in the Northern Territory. It just goes to show that there are a range of views on this issue, even within the ALP. I commend the original bill to the House and reject the proposals put by the member for Lingiari.

39,Mr HOWARD,OF LONG TAN," Mr Speaker, may I have the indulgence of the House to speak briefly about the 40th anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan and Vietnam Vietnams Day, which will be marked tomorrow. As members know, there will be a reception in the Great Hall this evening to pay tribute to the hundreds of Vietnam veterans who have come to Canberra to mark this event. Let me start by acknowledging and, on behalf of the House, honouring and paying tribute to the member for Cowan, Graham Edwards, who served in the Australian Army from 1968 to 1971 as a member of the Pioneer Platoon, 7th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment. He is, in my understanding, the only currently serving member of the parliament who served in Vietnam. He paid a terrible price for his service-he lost both legs in a landmine blast. Following his discharge from the Army, he spent many years-and he continues to do so-assisting veterans. On behalf of my colleagues and I know all members of the House, we acknowledge his contribution and we honour his service and his bravery. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",79
40,Mr HOWARD,OF LONG TAN,"Many well-known former members of this House served in Vietnam-most recently, the former Deputy Prime Minister and member for Farrer, Tim Fischer. Other former members who served in Vietnam include the former member for Isaacs, Rod Atkinson; the member for MCPherson, John Bradfield; the member for Bass, the late Kevin Newman; and another former member for MCPherson, the late Peter White, who was awarded the Military Cross for his courage and leadership during the 1968 Tet offensive. Tomorrow is the 40th anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan. That battle, which was the first major engagement in which Australia was involved in the Vietnam War, has come to symbolise the bravery and the struggle faced by our Vietnam veterans. It is fitting that the anniversary of that battle is also Vietnam Veterans Day. On the afternoon of 18 August 1966, Delta Company 6RAR, which was a force of 108 men, patrolling in the area of the Long Tan rubber plantation, encountered an enemy force estimated at some 2,500. A very fierce battle ensued, as a result of which 18 Australians lost their lives and a further 24 were wounded. Some 245 Vietcong combatants were found and other enemy casualties were carried away in the retreat. In the time of the Vietnam War, some 50,000 Australians served in Vietnam. More than 500 died and about 3,000 were wounded. It should be said on this occasion that the Vietnam War caused considerable domestic political controversy. It is not my intention in any way to revisit the internal debate. I respect the fact that there were very strongly held views on both sides of politics on that matter. Any discussion of Vietnam reminds us of those divisions. I think we accept that people held their views with tenacity and with conviction, but it does have to be said that whatever views were held on the rightness or justice of Australia's involvement in Vietnam-and the remarks I am about to make do not seek to distinguish between those who opposed and those who supported our involvement-an objective assessment would reveal our nation's collective failure at the time to adequately honour the service of those who went to Vietnam. The sad fact is that those who served in Vietnam were not welcomed back as they should have been. Whatever our views may have been-and I include those who supported the war as well as those who opposed it-the nation collectively failed those men. They are owed our apologies and our regrets for that failure. The very least that we can do on this 40th anniversary is to acknowledge that fact, to acknowledge the difficulties that so many of them have had in coping with the postwar trauma and to acknowledge the magnificent contribution that they have continued to make to our nation. So this afternoon and tomorrow we will in different ways-and I know in a totally bipartisan fashion-pay proper regard to their bravery, their service and their commitment. They did what their country lawfully asked them to do at the time. They did it with distinction, with honour and with bravery, and they should have been more properly honoured for that some 40 years ago. I hope with the passage of time they will understand the goodwill of the current generation of Australians in relation to that matter. There are just two other things that I do wish to mention. One of them relates to the issue of the bravery awards that came out of the Battle of Long Tan. They have become the subject of much debate. It does appear, on the assessment of many, that some injustice was done in relation to the changes that were made in the theatre of war to the original recommendations made by the commanding officers during that battle. It has been put strongly to the government-as I understand, it was put strongly to the former government-that a case exists for reopening the changes that were made between the honours recommended by the commanders in the field and the honours recommended by the ultimate commander of the Australian operations in Vietnam. I do understand fully the sense of grievance and the sense of injustice that many of these men feel, and I had the opportunity this morning to spend an hour with Colonel Harry Smith and a number of his colleagues. Colonel Smith, of course, was the Commanding Officer of Delta Company 6RAR in the Battle of Long Tan. The difficulty faced by any government in reopening a particular set of recommendations, having regard to changes that might have been made on the original recommendations, is that as one sense of grievance might be addressed so many others are opened up. It is my understanding, and the understanding of many that have examined this issue, that it has frequently been the practice that changes are made on the original recommendations when the recommendations are received by the commanders further up the chain. Whilst I will continue to engage with representatives of the Vietnam veterans community, and most particularly those who were involved in the Battle of Long Tan, as will the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, I would like to frankly explain to the House the difficulty of opening up in the manner requested this particular set of recommendations without also legitimately opening up others, indeed in relation to battles stretching back to World War II and in respect of relatives from battles stretching back to World War I and similar situations. That is the difficulty the government faces. Finally, I would like to say to the House that, as a further recognition, the government has decided, as a living memorial to the Battle of Long Tan, to rename the Australian Defence Force Leadership and Team Work Awards for secondary schools to the Defence Long Tan Leadership and Team Work Prize, which is a particular recognition of the place that that battle holds-generally in a representative way-in the minds and the hearts of all Australians. I say to our Vietnam veterans that we honour everything you did. You deserve the respect and the affection of a grateful nation. We regret the inadequacies of the past, and we hope that the extension of the hand of friendship and honour by today's Australians will be of comfort and value to all of you.",80
41,Mr BEAZLEY,OF LONG TAN,"On indulgence, I acknowledge the statements made by the Prime Minister and in particular his statement that he will keep in dialogue with the veterans community in relation to the issues about the awards associated with the Long Tan battle that came to light when documents were released in 1996. I do hope that he and his minister can bring those discussions to a satisfactory conclusion from the veterans' point of view. I wanted today to have a couple of speakers on this matter. Time pressures make that difficult. Therefore I wished to ask our member for Cowan to speak on behalf of the opposition. He, however, said he thinks I ought to speak on behalf of the opposition as the leader of the party. Therefore I will meet things halfway. I will take advantage of your indulgence and read a letter that the member for Cowan wrote to me, and that will suffice for my remarks. I will say no more. He wrote: I have just been advised that the Prime Minister will only allow one speaker on this important statement before the house today. I thank you for the opportunity to be our speaker but I believe that our recognition of the service, sacrifice and suffering of Vietnam veterans should dren. rightly come from you, as our Leader. I would however be pleased if you could perhaps consider just a couple of things. I noted that at the Launch of the book Vietnam Our War-Our Peace the Minister for Veterans Affairs offered an apology to Vietnam Veterans for the actions of all who opposed the war. Kim, many good Australians opposed that war and not all who opposed the war took it out on the troops. My father for instance strongly opposed the war. I remember too that Senator John Wheeldon, a former Labor Minister for Repatriation, was a bitter opponent of the war but he was incredibly compassionate toward the individual veterans and strongly supportive of their needs. Equally it should be said that not all who supported the war supported the troops, and even to this day many Vietnam Veterans refuse to join the RSL because of the treatment they received on their return home. Had I the opportunity to speak today I would have taken the time to publicly forgive the person from my mother's church in Scarborough who wrote an anonymous letter to my mother saying she hoped I died as a result of my wounds, as I was a killer. I could not have found it in my heart to say those words a few years ago but it is time to move on. Kim today is not a day to enter into the divisive issues surrounding Australia's involvement in that war. Today is a day when our Federal Parliament should honour our Vietnam Veterans, recognise their service and say to them that they did a good job in the best tradition of the ANZACs. It is also a time when we should remember the sacrifice of those who did not come home at all. It is a day when we should remember the Regulars and the National Service men who confronted their enemy on his home ground and who never took a backward step. To say to them, our veterans, that we understand the difficulties of those who suffer Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and that we recognise and respect the love and loyalty of the families of veterans, particularly the wives, the partners and the chilToday is a day when we should say we are proud of our Vietnam veterans. A day when we honour and recognise their sacrifice, their service and their suffering. I think it is also a time to reflect on the horror of war, the lasting trauma of those involved and the terror and suffering of innocent civilians caught in the devastation of war. I just also want to thank you for your support in Government of the Welcome Home Parade. I know there are many veterans in Australia who would not have made it to that incredibly warm and emotional parade if you had not pitched into ensure the support of defence and other government agencies to get them there and home again. Kim, can I just say those who served Vietnam either on the ground, in the air or on the waters served as a team. We would enhance our support today if once again we could become a team and work together to support each other. Kim I said earlier that it is time to move on. Last night I had dinner with the Vietnamese Ambassador. As we left the table he said to me that both our countries must look to the future. I agree. I would wish him and his children, indeed all the children of the world that which was most elusive during the last century-peace. In closing Kim I want to say I am proud to have served my nation and proud of all who served with me. I am proud of my mates and the contribution they made to Australia. I take pride in their mateship. I don't need anyone's apology for that. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Sex Discrimination Commissioner",81
42,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister confirm that the Sex Discrimination Commissioner has recently been reappointed for three years, after the expiry of her five year appointment on 30 July this year? Why has the government kept this reappointment secret when the established practice is to announce such appointments publicly? Is the Prime Minister providing Pru Goward with a $253,000 safety net, including an accommodation allowance, in case, despite his support, Ms Goward is denied preselection by the extreme right-wing New South Wales Liberal Party? Mrs Mirabella-Feminist hypocrite!",83
43,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My understanding is that Ms Goward has been reappointed. I will check with the Attorney-General as to the Executive Council and subsequent processes on whether there has been an announcement made.

44,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"hang on-his or her position until such time, if they are successful in the preselection, as nominations are called. My recollection, for example, is that the former Solicitor-General of the Commonwealth, Bob Ellicott, contested the preselection for Berowra. He was unsuccessful in the preselection. So was I, incidentally. I remember the preselection very well. He did not have to resign his position as Solicitor General in order to contest the Liberal Party preselection. The basis of the argument of the member for Gellibrand is that we are trying to preserve a sinecure for somebody while they contest a political preselection. Just for the information of the honourable member: I am completely neutral in the preselection. I am not supporting anybody. Ms Gillard- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. In the course of that question the member for Indi made an offensive remark about the member for Gellibrand and I ask that you have her withdraw it.",83
45,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I did not hear the interjection. However, if the member for Indi made an offensive remark, I would ask the member for Indi to withdraw that remark.

48,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I asked the member for Indi if she made an offensive remark. She informed me that she did not. I will have to take the member's word on this. Ms Roxon- Mr Speaker, on a further matter, I seek leave to table a document listing the appointments that were announced by the Attorney on 28 July, which does not include that of the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, who was also reappointed on that day. Leave granted. Ms Roxon-I thank the House. Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order further to the points of order raised by the member for Lalor and the member for Gellibrand. Am I to take it that your ruling is that people will be able to judge for themselves the nature of the offensive remark-that is, whether or not fensive-or the person so offended will, as standing orders clearly state?",84

55,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I call the member for Boothby.,84
56,Dr SOUTHCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister update the House on Australia's role in ensuring international nusafeguards and non-proliferation? Is the minister aware of any criticisms of Australia's role?,84
57,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question. I think members will be aware he is the Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, and at the moment they are examining the nuclear safeguards agreement that we have negotiated with China, so he has a real understanding of these issues. In answer to the honourable member's question, let me say that Australia is at the forefront of international efforts to control the spread of nuclear weapons and nuclear materials that could be used in weapons systems and to ban weapons testing. As the foreign affairs minister, I introduced into the United Nations General Assembly in September 1996 the comprehensive test ban treaty, which was adopted by the General Assembly. We in Australia have the world's most rigorous uranium export safeguards-and with 40 per cent of the world's known exploitable and commercially available uranium it is important we do. Australia is a very active member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group and also of the International Atomic Energy Agency. No country has a more diligent record than Australia. As the House and the honourable members know, the Prime Minister has commissioned a review of uranium mining and processing and nuclear energy, and I think this is a responsible thing to do so that we can have a serious debate about these issues. There has been some criticism, in particular from the Leader of the Opposition, who said on the ABC on 24 July: I'm not going to move to support enrichment and nuclear power because I think that's the policy of an idiot ... I would draw the House's attention to the fact that France, the United Kingdom, the United States, Japan and many other countries in the world use nuclear energy, so the suggestion that somehow these countries are run by idiots or have the policies of idiots is, I would have thought, a bizarre thing for the Leader of the Opposition, who aspires to be the Prime Minister, to say. He said on the same day to the Sydney Institute-and this was, after all, in a written speech-that our consideration of these nuclear issues: ... sends the wrong message to the region. There is no question that Australia would be less secure, and not more, if our neighbours believe we have nuclear ambitions. I do not think that is actually a responsible thing to say. This country does not, of course, have nuclear weapons ambitions, and everybody in the region knows it. To suggest that a country which is considering issues like nuclear power is also considering nuclear weapons and that others in the region would think that is, to say the least, utterly absurd. Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia all either have nuclear energy programs or at least are considering them. The simple fact is that the people of Australia deserve to have a more mature debate on these sorts of issues than those kinds of statements suggest. I certainly think that it is quite the wrong thing to drum up antagonism towards this country in the region just in order to make a political point. NA",84

59,Mr RIPOLL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister confirm that his government has just appointed Pru Goward chairwoman of the Council for Australian-Arab Relations, replacing former AWB chairman Brendan Stewart? Are the relations that Ms Goward will be improving those between herself and the 100 Arab branch stacks recruited into the Cherrybrook branch by his extreme rightwing faction, which has taken over the New South Wales Liberal Party?",85

64,Mr FAWCETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Would the Treasurer update the House on what the government is doing to crack down on tax fraud and to defend the integrity of Australia's tax system?,86
65,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I can inform him that in 2004 the government set up Project Wickenby, a project funded with $300 million to investigate international tax evasion and tax fraud. This dedicated operation brings together the Australian Taxation Office, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the Australian Crime Commission, the DPP, the Australian Federal Police and AUSTRAC. Under the investigation to date, three people have been arrested and charged with conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth and assets have been frozen in relation to persons of interest. The international scams which are being investigated under Project Wickenby have the capacity to threaten the integrity of the Australian taxation system. Today I am announcing that the government will introduce legislation to enable the agencies involved in Project Wickenby to share information between themselves which will assist in bringing successful prosecutions. These prosecutions will be not just in the tax area but in other areas, including money laundering. Separately but related to that I am announcing a larger project to review the laws that protect taxpayer secrecy and disclosure between various agencies of government. the This project will be commenced with the release of a discussion paper looking at existing secrecy and disclosure provisions from around 30 tax acts and proposing to standardise them in a way which will clarify the operation of the provisions and provide increased certainty for taxpayers and tax officials. This is part of a program which is continuing to simplify the operation of Australia's taxation laws. In relation to Project Wickenby, I can inform the House that this government will adequately fund and see through that investigation into international tax evasion, which this government will not countenance and which, if it were left unchecked, would undermine the Australian taxation system.

72,Mr CAUSLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. Would the Minister for Trade inform the House how education has contributed to our strong export performance? How does this compare with previous years?,87
73,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Page for his question. The member for Page would be well aware of the great export earning effort that is being contributed to by the education sector, given that Southern Cross University is in Lismore in his electorate and other campuses along the mid-North Coast of New South Wales. In 2005-06 the return to Australia from education exports hit a record figure of $8 billion, rising 13 per cent on the previous year. That $8 billion earned for the Australian economy was through the export of education services delivered both onshore and offshore, in person and through the internet. Education services are now our fourth largest export earner-hitting a record-one of the top four export earners in 2005-06. It is an extraordinary result. It has been achieved not just by the universities in Australia-as I indicated, Southern Cross University is in the electorate of the member for Page-but by other educational institutions also exporting their services to the world. Over the last 10 years there has been a dramatic increase in export earnings from education-in fact, a 320 per cent increase. In 1996 export earnings from the education sector were only $2.5 billion. They have now risen to $8 billion. As I say, it is our fourth largest export earner. Australian universities now have enrolments from students from more than 160 countries across the globe. It is helping to build a larger critical mass in our universities in Australia. In 2005, enrolments from China alone passed 81,000 students, and enrolments of students from India grew 33 per cent to 27,500. These exports growing in key markets are not only producing export income; part of this process is developing key cross-cultural ties with many countries across the world. Offshore students being educated in Australian universities go on to be business leaders and political leaders in those countries. It stands Australia in good stead in terms of the relationship between ourselves and many of our near neighbours. Labor says it wants to establish worldclass universities in Australia. We already has have them. Those students coming to Australia to get their education here are voting with their feet. They are flocking to Australian universities. So not only have we expanded our base of education export services in Australia but we are also providing a lot more education places in our universities for Australian students. We are building critical mass in our education system in Australia, particularly in our universities, and at the same time creating many more jobs in the Australian economy through our exports. Chickens  the Treasurer and Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party. I refer the Treasurer to table 1B in the latest version of the Australian Bureau of Statistics publication 7215, showing that the trend annual growth in chicken slaughter was: 1.4 million extra chickens every year under the Whitlam government; 2.8 million chickens under the Fraser government; 2.2 million chickens under the Hawke and Keating governments; and 2.6 million chickens every year under the Howard government, with 110 million chickens now dying every year. Will the Treasurer confirm that chicken deaths will always be higher under a Liberal government than under a Labor government? Miss Jackie Kelly- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order.

76,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I remind the member for Lalor that she is on thin ice.,88
77,Mr VASTA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Would the minister advise the House how young workers are sharing the benefits of record low unemployment? How will the government's new workplace reforms benefit young workers? Is the minister aware of any groups seeking to mislead young workers?,88
78,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Bonner for his question and his interest in jobs for young Australians. I can inform him that the teenage full-time unemployment to population ratio, which refers to the proporrelations. tion of the total teenage population unemployed and looking for full-time work, declined to just 4.4 per cent in July, which well below the peak of 10.1 per cent which was recorded in July 1992, when the Leader of the Opposition was then the Australian employment minister. In 1996, the Leader of the Opposition told young Australians that the Howard government's workplace reforms would ‘put young Australians at a disadvantage'. The reality is just the opposite. What they have done is provide greater opportunities for young Australians to get into the workforce-as shown by the fall from 10.1 per cent to 4.4 per cent. Not much has changed in 10 years, because, 10 years later, the Leader of the Opposition is still trying to scaremonger amongst young workers about workplace reform. He has said: Mums and dads know that John Howard's industrial relations laws are throwing their children to the wolves. Again, the data reveals that that is just not the case. The member for Bonner also asked me whether there are any attempts to mislead young Australians on these matters. I came across an interesting new curriculum which is being propagated by the labour movement, particularly in New South Wales, for teachers to deliver to their students. The content of these union lessons to be delivered, which are on their website, is quite concerning. For example, there is an activity that says: Teacher roleplays with students. As the call-centre employer teacher begins to change the conditions of work by setting time limits or quotas on simple tasks. Students complete tasks and teacher pressures them. Conflict is created. So the union movement's idea of industrial relations, what they are saying to teachers and students through this curriculum, is: ‘We should go out there and create conflict.' That is the union movement's idea of industrial There is another case study on this website which is teaching students to become xenophobic by teaching them to fear is having their jobs go to foreign workers. This is a curriculum promoted by the union movement for students in our schools, from years 7 to 10. Why are the labour movement and the Labor Party promoting xenophobia amongst students in our secondary schools in Australia? As the data which I used at the outset of this question illustrates, the reforms of both 1996 and this year are actually about creating more jobs for young Australians and putting protections in there for Australians. The Leader of the Opposition and the unions are more concerned with and focused on filling young Australians with fear rather than with facts. Oil for Food Program",88
79,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer to a confidential cable to the minister of October 2003 on the $300 million ‘wheat for weapons' scandal, on which he was questioned by the Cole inquiry, which states that the Australian embassy in Washington had been advised by the US state department that ‘scrutiny of oil for food contracts revealed that per cent had been added to the price of every oil for food contract'. Given that this was 19th warning that the government had received about corrupt AWB payments to Saddam Hussein's regime, why did the government later direct Australia's ambassador in Washington to tell the Americans that accusations against the AWB were false? Is it not a fact that the government directed our ambassador to lie to the Americans to save the government from political fallout just prior to the last Australian federal election?",89

81,Mr NEVILLE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Ageing. With due deference to my Central Queensland colleague the member for Dawson, I ask: is the minister aware of claims of alleged serious malpractice at Mackay Base Hospital? What is the government's response?",89
82,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Hinkler for his question, and I do appreciate that he is asking it on his own behalf and, in effect, on behalf of the member for Dawson as well. I appreciate that the member for Hinkler has seen at close quarters the human damage that can be inflicted by a secretive and coercive culture in health institutions. When allegations were made of surgical incompetence at Bundaberg Hospital, the whistleblowers were ridiculed and vilified but ultimately vindicated by a royal commission. Now the member for Dawson has made allegations of serious misconduct at Mackay Base Hospital based on information provided to her by credible health professionals. Today I have written to the Queensland health minister asking him to establish a full, open and independent inquiry into these allegations. The member for Dawson, in two speeches to this House, has claimed that an 10 underqualified surgeon worked at Mackay Base Hospital without supervision, that the the hospital knew that this doctor was working without the required supervision, that at least 10 patients had botched operations performed on them by this underqualified surgeon working without proper supervision and that staff complaining about this have been subject to bullying and harassment. I stress that these are allegations-albeit allegations based on evidence provided by credible people. I do not want to prejudge this matter, but there is a very serious problem when potential misconduct is swept under the carpet by a secretive and coercive health structure. This matter does need to be investigated, and an investigation should not be put off until after the election, if confidence in the Queensland public hospital system is to be maintained. In my letter to the Queensland minister, I have suggested a means by which an inquiry could be expedited. This is a serious matter and it does deserve urgent attention. I table my letter to the Queensland health minister. Oil for Food Program",89

85,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"yes, but not unto yourselves",90
86,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member will come to his question.,90
87,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"from November 1999, which has just been released by the Cole inquiry. Isn't it a fact that this email refers to discussions with the AWB on your department's concerns about the AWB breaching UN sanctions against Iraq back then, in 1999, but that your department concluded: ‘AWB may have been doing this for some time, but there is no benefit in launching a witch-hunt at this stage'? Why didn't the government investigate the AWB's activities at this time when the $300 million ‘wheat for weapons' scandal was in its infancy? Or was this part of the government's pattern of ongoing collusion with the AWB over the five years that this scandal then ran?",90
88,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me explain that, very obviously, there was no collusion over several years by the government in relation to the AWB, nor has there been an attempt by the government to cover up. I would have thought-and I might be wrong-that something like 60 days worth of public hearings by the Cole commission, including substantial interviews, cross-examinations and examinations of officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade-which, if the Leader of the Opposition chose, he may wish to read-would have revealed precisely what the department knew, what it did not know, what it did do and what it did not do. The Minister for Trade appeared before the commission, and I myself spent around four hours before the Cole commission answering questions. The Prime Minister did likewise. The opposition asked questions on this topic on every single day-I think almost without exception-for the first three months of this year. We have been exhaustive in providing information. When the Cole commission endeavoured to get still further information from AWB Ltd, we have gone so far as to not only set up the Cole commission so that an independent commission can get to the heart of this matter but even amend legislation to facilitate his access to documentation.

93,Mr CAMERON THOMPSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Would the minister advise the House on the progress of vital transport infrastructure works in Queensland? Is the minister aware of any alternative policies?,90
94,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Blair for the question and recognise his particular interest in major road projects in Queensland, like the Ipswich Motorway and the Goodna bypass, for which he has been a champion over recent years. The Australian government has been working diligently to endeavour to get some of these projects up and running so that the people of Queensland can benefit from the $3 billion that this government has committed to Queensland for road and rail infrastructure under the AusLink program. Unfortunately, the Queensland government continue to dither and procrastinate while the cost of all these projects just goes through the roof. The Queensland government, for instance, keep demanding that the Australian government allocate more money for the Ipswich Motorway. We have provided $556 million under AusLink already and they demand more. The reality is that, at the end of June this year, of that $556 millionMr Ripoll interjecting",90

100,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is a disappointment the member for Oxley is not available to hear something about the failure of the Queensland government to get on with an important construction job in his electorate, because the reality is this is an important project which this government is committed to and for which it has been prepared to provide financial resources. A little further north, I have reported to the House on a number of occasions on our efforts to upgrade the Bruce Highway and the significant commitment that has been made to planning for new routes to make four-lanes on the highway between Curra and Cooroy, only to find out after a year and a half on the job that the Queensland government has decided to flood nine kilometres of the road-not build new dams on the sites that have already been acquired but instead flood some of the existing highway. This is typical of the lack of planning and foresight of the Queensland Labor government. They sat by while the population of south-east Queensland grew-they boasted about it-but there are no plans to provide the adequate infrastructure. In addition to that, it took a water restriction on the rose garden at Parliament House before they actually realised that the state was in 10 years of drought and was running out of water. This is the kind of incompetent planning of infrastructure that makes up the alternative policies of Labor in Queensland. The determination of the Queensland government to always blame the federal government for all its troubles is quite extraordinary. The members representing Gold Coast seats would be well aware of the campaign and literature being distributed by Mr Lucas, the minister for transport in Queensland. He is always happy to take credit when federal government money is being provided for a state job, but when the funding is not to his satisfaction he blames the federal government for not having funded Queensland government roads and sends circulars out to everybody that say: ‘This road can't go ahead because the Australian government haven't provided funding for a road that is actually their responsibility.' This is typical of a government that has lost sight of its objectives and the reason for governments to provide infrastructure and planning. We will get on with the job. A change of government in Queensland would make a real difference to delivery of infrastructure in that state. Oil for Food Program",91
101,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer the minister to an email from the Australian embassy in Oman to the AWB nine months before the Iraq war, which has just been released by the Cole inquiry. I refer specifically to the embassy's meeting with Mr Jamal Shareef Hazaa and the embassy's report of Mr Hazaa's close connections with senior figures in the Iraqi regime, including with Saddam Hussein himself. I also refer the minister to the embassy's statement in this email that they would be prepared to arrange an introduction between the AWB and Mr Hazaa, using his direct connections with the Iraqi dictator and his offer to enhance AWB sales to Saddam by ‘working behind the scenes'. Can the minister inform the House whether it was appropriate for the government to be offering matchmaking services between the minister's close friends in the AWB and Saddam Hussein's inner circle, or was this seen by the government as ‘business as usual' in cuddling up to the Iraqi dictator just prior to going to war?",92
102,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Minister for Foreign Affairs can ignore the last part of that question.,92

107,Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"2.56 pm)My question is addressed to the Minister for Education, Science and Training. Would the minister update the House on today's Australian History Summit? Is the minister aware of any views being expressed that the teaching of Australian history is not important?",92
108,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Mackellar for her question and acknowledge her interest in the teaching of Australian history in our schools. I can report to the House that the Prime Minister opened the Australian History Summit today in Parliament House. There are 23 participants in this summit, ranging from eminent historians and teachers to educators and curriculum developers. The summit participants will be providing advice to the Australian government on how we can strengthen the teaching of Australian history in our schools. During the opening this morning, the Prime Minister announced that the Australian government will be contributing $100,000 annually for a Prime Minister's Australian history prize. This substantial amount will be for a substantial work: a book, a film or a documentary. As it is an annual prize, we hope that it will attract not only historians and teachers but also the broader community. This prize highlights the government's commitment to ensuring that Australian history is taught, and taught properly, in our schools. The member for Mackellar asks me if there are other views. This morning the member for Lilley, referring to the Australian History Summit, said it was ‘all about spreading mass confusion'.",92
109,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He didn't say that, did he?",93
110,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am afraid so, Prime Minister-that is what the member for Lilley said. It seems that the only confusion on this issue is in fact on the Labor side of the House. A few months ago, it was reported in the Canberra Times that ‘students needed to be taught the narrative history of this country .' The Prime Minister could have said that, but indeed it was the Leader of the Opposition who said that. A few months ago the Leader of the Opposition was saying that students needed to be taught the narrative history of this country and yet, a few months later, Beazley was ‘against the history revival' and in fact dismissed the teaching of traditional Australian history in schools as an ‘elite preoccupation'. So while there is clearly confusion on the part of the Leader of the Opposition-and the Australian public are entitled to be confused about where he stands on this and many other issues-I can assure Australian parents that I will be listenother ing to the advice from the summit participants and that I will be working with education authorities to ensure that the teaching of Australian history takes its rightful place in Australian schools. Workplace Relations",93
111,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. I refer to Qantas's $670 million yearly profit, announced today, and CEO Mr Geoff Dixon's confirmation in announcing the profit that both Qantas and Jetstar will utilise the government's AWAs. I also refer to the Prime Minister's statement in the House earlier this week in regard to Jetstar's AWAs: … this is not the result of Work Choices; it is the result of the normal operations of the labour market ... Isn't it the case that Mr Dixon made clear in October and November last year that Qantas welcomed the government's legislation and would use AWAs? Minister, isn't Qantas doing exactly what the government wants it to do under its legislation-embarking on a wages race to the bottom, from Jetstar to Qantas?",93
112,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In answer to the question from the honourable member for Perth, Qantas is doing what the government wants it to do-that is, creating jobs for Australians. What the opposition does not seem to understand is that Qantas, through the Jetstar subsidiary, just in the last week has created 200 new jobs for Australians. In this debate, the one word you will never uttered hear from the lips of the Leader of the Opposition is ‘jobs'. When did anybody in Australia last hear the Leader of the Opposition or the Labor Party talk about jobs? To quote Mr Dixon, the CEO of Qantas: We have created jobs, unlike just about every airline in the world. We can continue to create jobs if we can change the way we operate further, and we are going to do that. This government supports Mr Dixon and Qantas in creating jobs. Greenhouse Gas Emissions",93
113,Mr LAMING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources. Is the minister aware of reports of a new emissions trading scheme announced yesterday? What is the government's response to such a scheme?",93
114,Mr IAN MACFARLANE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Mr Speaker Mr Tanner-Give us that lecture about,93
115,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Melbourne!,93
116,Mr IAN MACFARLANE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Happy to, any time, mate. Mr Tanner-It was a good economics lecture",94
117,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Melbourne is warned!,94
118,Mr IAN MACFARLANE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Well, that's fixed him! I thank the member for Bowman for his question and also for his interest in ensuring that Australia's economy continues to grow. In its climate change policy this government has the balance right between lowering emissions and maintaining economic growth. Companies like Xstrata, for instance, have benefited from that policy. Xstrata not only is the biggest exporter of coal in Australia but pays almost $1 billion in taxes, earns billions of dollars in exports and employs 5,000 people in the coal industry and some 3,000 people in the base metals industry, all of whose jobs would be in danger if the policies of those opposite and of their counterparts at a state level in regard emissions trading were adopted. Yesterday the states launched their plans for an emissions trading scheme, which by their own admission will increase the price of electricity and drive Australian industry, jobs and investment offshore. But don't take my word for it-let us listen to what some Australian organisations have said. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry have said that the states' proposal will ‘reduce the international competitiveness of our strongest industries'. They go on to say: ‘On just about any rational policy measure it's a failure, and more about political symbolism than achieving real results.' There are even those in the Labor Party who would agree with that. The Premier of Western Australia has rejected the scheme outright, saying it raises ‘a number of concerns for WA, including the possible impact on the WA economy and electricity costs for WA consumers'. In Queensland, Premier Beattie is trying to walk both sides of the street. In one breath he has described Australia's emissions as ‘chickenfeed' and yet in the same breath he has not committed Queensland either to supporting the scheme or to opposing the scheme. It is about time Peter Beattie stopped walking both sides of the street and was honest with Queenslanders about putting Australia's interests first and about putting their jobs first. Any concerns state premiers may have will be swept aside if the Leader of the Opposition ever gets into power and puts in place his emission trading scheme. It will not only slow economic growth; it will increase the price of electricity and petrol and cost Australians jobs. Greenhouse Gas Emissions",94
119,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources. Is he aware of these comto ments made by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage during Senate estimates hearings on 16 February of this year in relation to emissions trading: I think carbon trading schemes are part of the policy answer ... There is nothing radical about supporting trading schemes. Is the minister also aware of these comments made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 31 July 2005: We know that emissions can't continue at their current rate ... we'll have to investigate price signals coming from energy ... You can get more investment into cleaner energy through changing pricing signals ... Does the minister agree with these comments? If so, when will emissions trading become part of the Howard government's policy answer, as proposed to cabinet by the Treasurer and the then environment minister in their 2003 submission-a submission supported by your department?",94
120,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member for Grayndler will be aware that it is not in order to ask a minister to comment on another minister's quotations. However, if the minister chooses to answer the question, I will call the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources.",95
121,Mr IAN MACFARLANE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. Of course I would never take the member for Grayndler's quotes without first checking them against the record. The reality is that the solutions to lowering Australia's emissions and lowering the world's emissions lie in technology. That is the policy that this government has adopted. Mr Albanese interjecting",95
122,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Grayndler has asked his question.,95
123,Mr IAN MACFARLANE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Labor Party is quite happy to trade away the jobs of Australians in pursuit of an idealistic policy. This government will never trade away Australian jobs. We will always find practical solutions that lower greenhouse gas emissions. Younger People in Nursing Homes,95
124,Mrs MAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. Would the minister advise the House on government initiatives to bring about a reduction in the number of young disabled people living in residential aged care?",95
125,Mr BROUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for MCPherson for her question. It is a sad reality today that there are too many young Australians who are inappropriately being housed in aged care facilities. These are people who, through either disease or accidents, find themselves in an aged care facility simply because there is no appropriate place for a young person to get the care they need in a safe environment. The fact is that the housing of people with disabilities, under the disability agreement, is a state responsibility. But back in February, due to the leadership of the Howard government and particularly the Prime Minister, the federal government signed an agreement in the COAG process allocating $244 million to this particular cause of removing young people from aged care facilities and housing them in appropriate accommodation that will meet their lifestyle needs. This is an important initiative, and today I can inform the House that three of the states have now signed direct bilaterals with the federal government. For the information of honourable members, Victoria, South Australia and Queensland have done so, and negotiations are under way with two other states. Can I suggest to the other states that are still discussing this matter-this is the most polite way I can do it-that an aged care facility is not an appropriate place for a young person to be and we should all be making every effort to honour the agreement that was made in February to have these young people removed. I took the step, along with the states, of advertising throughout Australia back on 15 July for expressions of interest on appropriate ways to house people in these various circumstances. We have been overwhelmed by the response that we have had from individuals, community organisations and care groups. In fact I have had over 140 inquiries thus far, and some very innovative approaches have been brought forward. The aim of this initiative is to ensure that we move young people with a disability into appropriate residential care, to help those who wish to remain in an aged care facility for various reasons to have the appropriate level of care provided to them and also to assist those who are not in an aged care facility to be able to remain in appropriate care. This does require everybody's effort. It requires the states to work with us to ensure that we meet our objectives of having fewer young people in aged care facilities and that they are housed in an appropriate form of care, recognising their needs as Australians who should be able to have a full life expectancy that otherwise they are denied when they are put in inappropriate circumstances in aged care facilities. Mr Swan-Could the minister please table the notes from which he was quoting?",95
126,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Was the minister reading from confidential notes?,96
127,Mr BROUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Lilley must be short of sight; I hardly read a thing, Mr Speaker. These are confidential notes.",96

129,Mr TRUSS,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,"Wide Bay-Minister for Transport and Regional Services) (3.11 pm)- Mr Speaker, I seek the indulgence of the chair to add to an answer.",96
130,The SPEAKER,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,The minister may proceed.,96
131,Mr TRUSS,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,"Yesterday, the honourable member for Brisbane asked me a series of questions about security at Sydney airport, in particular in relation to the temporary fence that has been built as the new security fence while construction is occurring in one of the Qantas hangars. I will table some pictures of the fence which will demonstrate to anyone who cares to notice that it is a very tial fence with barbed wire at the top. It meets all of the requirements for a security fence at an airport. The honourable member for Brisbane then went on to wave around a timber chock, and he asked if this was the best practical measure the government could find to protect the Australian public from terror attacks at our busiest airport, after having said earlier that this chock was all that was keeping out terrorists from moving from the construction site to the secure area of the airport. I was naturally concerned by the claims by the honourable member for Brisbane, and so I have arranged for the Office of Transport Security and the Qantas security people to examine the site and to look for a chock of the nature that the honourable member for Brisbane displayed to the House. We did find such a chock near to a door, and I have also brought along a picture of that chock. It is quite clearly rather like the one that the member for Brisbane displayed. However, the problem for the honourable member for Brisbane is that it was at an entrance to an office, an office that was entirely inside the construction site. There is no chock of the nature that the honourable member for Brisbane put on display that has had any part at all to do with the security fence surrounding the Sydney airport. His question was dishonest and he needs to acknowledge his error. NA",96

136,Mr BEAZLEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"The Minister for Education, Science and Training said in the course of her remarks in discussing the issues related to her history conference that I had stated two totally inconsistent positions. One was to support the idea of narrative history, and the other was to suggest that there ought to be a different priority associated with the advent of her conference, in which she implied that, because I thought it was not the best of ideas, I opposed the teaching of narrative history. I think it is very important that we all know who Blaxland, Wentworth and Lawson were.",96

145,Mr BEVIS,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,He said that I was dishonest. The information contained in those questions was not only accurate but confirmed again when at seven o'clock this morning workers at Sydney airport were installing bolts to fasten a piece of timber to the floor of that plywood door which opens onto the restricted area of the airport.,97

151,Mr BEVIS,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I am in the process of doing that, Mr Speaker. Thank you. It was the case not only yesterday but also today as those bolts were being put in that piece of timber at seven o'clock this morning. The fence which the minister refers to is on only three sides of the hangar. The sliding door to which I referred is not the door that the minister talks about.

165,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,About five minutes ago the Minister for Transport and Regional Services at the dispatch box called the member for Brisbane ‘dishonest'. I would like to ask why you did not require him to withdraw.,98
166,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"The member for Melbourne would be well aware that, if he wishes to seek a withdrawal, he does so at the time, not after the event. Mr Tanner- Mr Speaker, I make two points in response: first, you have a capacity to intervene yourself. Clearly, you would have been able to hear that unparliamentary language; and, second, prior to my getting an opportunity, the Leader of the Opposition rose, you recognised him and there was an exchange between him and the minister. That was the first opportunity I had to raise the point.",98
167,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,The member for Melbourne would be aware that the chair has ruled on that matter. I do not wish to revisit it. Standing Orders,98
168,Mr FITZGIBBON,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I have a question of you, Mr Speaker. I want to assure you and the House that I raise this question not as a means of making a smart point but because I think we have established a serious area of ambiguity in the rules of the House. I am hoping that you can clarify the point by providing us with a ruling, not necessarily now but some time in the not too distant future. I asked you during the final division before question time whether all members were seated where they could be counted in the division. You ruled that all members were. There is no secret that I was referring to the Treasurer, who was sitting in the seat usually occupied by the Serjeant-at-Arms. Mr Speaker, I refer you to page 275 of House of Representatives Practice fifth edition, which states that members not within the area of members seats are not counted. I further refer you to the latest copy of House of Representatives Standing and Sessional Orders, which states: area of Members' seats means the area of seats on the floor of the Chamber reserved for Members only. The word ‘within' could be the ambiguous part of the wording in House of Representatives Practice. I suggest to you that the wording in the standing orders could be taken to mean that the Serjeant's seat is included, but then again it may not include the Serjeant's seat. I suggest to you, Sir, that this could have serious ramifications in the case of a close vote-we do have conscience votes in this place on occasions, and we will possibly be having one very soon-and it could make a difference. It could be a serious problem for you if that were to occur. I think to clarify it would be appropriate.",98
169,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I thank the member for Hunter. I note the definitions in the standing orders that he refers to. On page 6 it says: area of Members' seats means the area of seats on the floor of the Chamber reserved for Members only. It does not specifically exclude the Serjeant's seat and, therefore, I have ruled that it is in order. However, if the member for Hunter wishes to take it further then I suggest that he refers the matter to the Procedure Committee. Ministerial Comment",99
170,Mr MCMULLAN,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, I wish to ask a question of you. I ask you to reflect on and reconsider a ruling you made, which did not have any impact on the proceedings today, in which you said that it was not appropriate to ask a minister to comment on comments made by another minister. First of all, I do not think that is a proper reading of the standing orders or of House of Representatives Practice where it refers to the limits. Even were it to be so, I ask you to consider the implications. It means that, if we have a contradiction between two ministers",99

175,Mr MCMULLAN,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"It would mean, if applied generally, that where there is a contradiction between the statements of two ministers the House is limited in its capacity to pursue it. I know that was not your intention and it did not have that effect today, Mr Speaker, but I think you should give that some consideration. I am not asking for an instant reply today, but I think it is a very important question because you can imagine the circumstances in which the capacity to ask just such a question could be very important.",99
176,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I thank the member for Fraser for his question. It is my understanding that it is not in order to ask another minister to comment on statements by a colleague. However, it is in order to ask the Prime Minister such a question.

188,The SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Grayndler proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The Government surrendering the national interest in favour of its own political interest. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",101
189,Mr ALBANESE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Grayndler) (3.27 pm)This is a government that has surrendered the national interest for its own political interests. What we have seen this fortnight is a government that has had an absolute shocker: bungling incompetence followed by embarrassing retreat; one humiliating withdrawal after another. This week we have seen a modern physiological feat, a man without a backbone performing backflip after backflip after backflip: the Prime Minister-no backbone but plenty of backflips. Since the Prime Minister had his big win over the great pretender all we have seen is the great surrender: surrendering our borders, surrendering on conscience votes, surrendering on petrol prices, surrendering Middle Australia, surrendering on climate change-simply surrendering our future. In fact, ever since the Prime Minister said that he was sticking around, it has been all downhill, and not just for the Treasurer. Every day we have seen one blackflip after another-no agenda. The Prime Minister's daily walk is really a warm-up for his daily backflip. And while this government frays at the edges, the needs of Middle Australia are surrendered. Their hopes and aspirations are left out in the cold by a government more obsessed with itself than with the needs of families. It has been an extraordinary fortnight, with surrender after surrender and one embarrassing retreat after another. We had the Prime Minister surrendering on petrol and then coming up with an on-therun, cobbled together plan pinched from our fuels blueprint; he took some of it but not all of it. His colleagues, including Senator Boswell, went out and bucketed the plan straight away. We saw the surrender on interest rates as we blew out of the water the government's claim that it would keep them low. We saw an absolute surrendering and humiliation of the member for Menzies when he was given a support minister to ramp up the spin. But it is not about spin; it is about cutting the wages of Australians, giving them the choice of that or having to face the sack. We have seen a surrender on the promise that there would be no $100,000 degrees. There are 96 degrees that cost more than that, there are five that cost more than $200,000 and one, at least, that costs more than the average mortgage. We saw an absolute surrendering on the immigration bill, when he could not even convince his own party that border surrender was in the national interest. And then we saw a surrender on parliamentary procedure because the vote was not even allowed to be held in the Senate, showing contempt for our democracy. We saw a surrender on the conscience vote for government MPs after trying to dictate a cabinet view. We have seen a surrendering of the Treasurer's view, held also by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, by the department of the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, if not by the minister himself, by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and others supporting a national emissions trading scheme. They have been left grasping for an alibi since we raised that question yesterday. We have seen a retreat to the same old tactics of playing the man rather than playing the issue, promoting fear rather than hope in the community. One of the biggest issues in the community is petrol prices. The Special Minister of State belled the cat on that. He wrote to the member for Throsby and said, ‘We think it is a pretty bad idea for the government fleet.' is all right to have rhetoric out there, but when it comes to real action we see that he withdrew and the member for Throsby clearly finished off, in a day, the weakness the government's position on petrol. We need to look at how many Australians will benefit from this announcement. We reckon it is about three per cent. We have asked and asked and received no answer. That leaves 97 per cent of Australians getting nothing-not today, not next week, not next month and not next year. They will have to wait for a Beazley Labor government to do something about these issues. Then we come to interest rates. The Prime Minister says, ‘I never promised interest rates would not go up.' We all know what the government campaigned on at the last election. The as were still on the website last week. Perhaps the person who belled the cat on that was the member for Wentworth, the man born with a silver foot in his mouth! He gave it all up. This member has never seen an interest rates hike that he did not likehow arrogant and out of touch. It might be okay campaigning with the people he goes on his yacht with, as the Liberal candidate for Wentworth, wearing their ‘Malcolm for Wentworth' T-shirts. It is not too far to drive out to Marrickville. The people in my electorate are struggling big time with their mortgages. I reckon the member for Wentworth will get a bit of a shock. of people in Kings Cross, Paddington and Woolloomooloo, fine constituents of the member for Sydney, are about to go over to the member for Wentworth. I reckon they will give him a message about whether this interest rates rise really is no big deal, which is what the member for Wentworth thinks. We have seen from the Prime Minister arrogance, indifference and breaches of trust. This Prime Minister has changed. He has It been in office simply too long. It happens. It happens in politics and in lots of forums. Last week he went for a walk with Georgie Gregan around the lake. Sometimes it is just of time to move on. We are seeing a Prime Minister who has surrendered Middle Australia. We have now seen seven consecutive interest rates rises since 2002 and just this morning we found out that average home loan repayments for a first home have exploded past $2,000 a month for the first time ever. We know that Australians now are paying more as a proportion of their income on interest rates than ever before. We know that the government was elected on the basis of a falsehood-that they would keep interest rates low. We know that interest rates are near to the point the Housing Industry Association calls a no-go zone because people are paying 28 per cent of their income. That has an impact on them and on the economy, but today the Treasurer is wandering around trying to shift the blame. Blaming the states is much easier than taking it on the chin, although maybe he has given up because today we had the extraordinary feat whereby, when the Treasurer was asked a question, he said, ‘Pass. I won't answer that.' The Prime Minister simply does not have answers. Mr Rudd-He loved the history question.",101
190,Mr ALBANESE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The history question which was asked by the leader was a ripper. It pointed out that interest rates in 1982 were I reckon lots 21.39 per cent. Ms Macklin-Who was the Treasurer?,102
191,Mr ALBANESE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We asked who the Treasurer was. The Prime Minister has lost it, because he did not know. He did not take responsibility because he simply never does. Then we come to the issue which above any other will see us win the next election and that is the attack by this government with extreme industrial relations legislation. government wants to impose on our kids American style degrees where you have to pay $100,000 and American style working conditions where you work simply for tips. We know that this Prime Minister is presiding over a system of a wages race to the bottom. The great surrender: the Prime Minister's surrender to China and India. Let us not compete on the high-skills, high-value, higheconomic growth road. Let us go the lowwage, low-skill road, a surrender of our children's future. What the Prime Minister is saying is that we will not try to compete with those economies on exports and our intellectual capacity; we will try to compete with them on wages. I asked the Prime Minister last week about the Tristar steering factory in my electorate, where 60 fine Australian workers, with an average service of about 25 years, are facing redundancy after 30 September. Why after 30 September? It is because that is when their enterprise bargaining agreement runs out. Instead of receiving four weeks pay per year of service, the company is waiting until 30 September and then, when the workers are made redundant, they are likely to be entitled to just 12 weeks pay instead. The fine people I have met have up to 40 years service and therefore would be entitled to 160 weeks pay. That is what we will see: as agreements run out, this government will use this extreme legislation. It is a surrender of everything that has made this country great-the idea of a fair go and the idea of a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. That is what we are seeing under this government. We have seen a complete surrender on climate change. It is just too hard for the government to make the tough decisions that are needed, for example introducing a national emissions trading system, ratifying Kyoto and being part of the global effort. its There is a complete surrender on water. ToThis day there is less water in the Murray than there has been for 100 years. And what has the government done about it? Mr MCGauran-It is a drought in 100 years.",102
192,Mr ALBANESE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is called ‘climate change', you fool. This government does not even acknowledge that that is the case. On these issues, the Prime Minister is running not so much a government but a farm. Without a doubt, the parrot on the farm is the Minister for the Environment and Heritage. The minister for the environment made a decision that, because one theoretical parrot every 1,000 years might be endangered, he would stop a $220 million development. But of course, once they took legal action, he surrendered. He backflipped again, which characterises this government. The Prime Minister is a rodent according to the Liberal Party's eminent QC, Senator George Brandis. Senator Brandis actually signed a statutory declaration that he only described the Prime Minister as a rodent, not as a lying rodent. That was his defence. So I am glad we have cleared that up. And, of course, there is one person who has been unfairly called a dog from time to time by his party colleagues. But we have seen a transformation: the dog has become a chicken. The Treasurer used to stand up and talk about roosters over and over again. People in the gallery found that very funny, and his colleagues would chortle away: ‘Ho, ho. Isn't it funny? The Treasurer's talking about roosters again.' But you do not hear that anymore. I wonder why that is. Maybe it is because he knows what roosters do to chickens! Maybe that is why the Treasurer has not uttered the word ‘rooster'. He simply will not make that statement. So on old John Howard's farm, we have the parrot, the rodent, and the dog that became a chicken. It is time that this government moved on. This government keeps one eye on Middle Australia-or it used to-but now there is just bungling and backflipping. Today we had questions about the Epping preselection, which saw the internal contradiction within the government-once again, it is a government obsessed with itself. We will chase the Prime Minister. We are going to hound him and hunt him every day until the next election, because Australia needs bold, nation-building plans for the future, the arrogance and incompetence that the Howard government keeps serving up to Middle Australia as it surrenders every single day all the values that make this a great country.",103
193,Mr MCGAURAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Gippsland-Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (3.42 pm)-That is as puerile and asinine a contribution as I have ever witnessed in this House. I say this to the Labor Party-I will give you some free advice-if you hand over your tactics, and therefore your political tunes, to the member for Grayndler, you will stay in opposition for as far as you can see into the future. One of the measures of the effectiveness of an opposition is to judge who is running the show. The member for Grayndler is running tactics and has been for several months now. You can see it in question time. He is the one to the dispatch box, and now in this House we have seen the most banal matter of public importance that is possible to draft, let alone deliver, that we have seen for a long time. It was undergraduate humour, with the member for Grayndler reading his speech. He is such a great comedic wit and talent that he has to read his jokes. Let me tell you: we saw the punch line coming before he got the first phrase out. Talk about laboured, heavyhanded and obvious humour. What it boiled down to was personal attacks on the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. It seemed to me to be a good audition for the Glass House but, quite frankly, it fails the test of parliamentary debate and certainly lacks the substance and the alternative policies upon which people might choose the Labor Party ahead of the coalition government at a future election. My advice to the opposition is to bring back the member for Lalor. I never thought I would say it: let the member for Lalor again assume a leadership position in parliamennot tary tactics. I noticed her quite obviously walking out as the member for Grayndler strode to the dispatch box with his swagger and confidence as he was about to abolish the government and watch the Prime Minister wilt under a barrage of criticism so cleverly worded! The member for Lalor absented herself, and quite rightly so. She knows that she has been pushed to one side. We are happy on this side to see the member for Grayndler assume a position of such influence over the Labor Party. He lacks the poforlitical judgement and wit to bring the government to its knees as they would want us. There was a very instructive comment in the contribution of the member for Grayndler. It was arguably the only one! He said, ‘Industrial relations will see us win the next election.' That strikes me as being somewhat complacent. We on this side do not believe we have won the next election. We do not believe there is a silver bullet that we can lazily rely upon to win office. Talk about underestimating the Australian electorate: to think that one and only one issue will give you office is to completely misread the sophistication and the rightful expectations, even demands, of the modern Australian voter. It is a classic Labor mistake. Mr Hartsuyker-Arrogant!",104
194,Mr MCGAURAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is arrogant. He said, ‘Industrial relations will see us win the next election.' That reminds me of the GST. It was the Leader of the Opposition who, in his previous incarnation as Leader of the Opposition, during 1998 proclaimed, ‘Labor will ride the wave of GST into office.' Mr Bartlett-Surf!",105
195,Mr MCGAURAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"No, he proclaimed, ‘Labor will surf the wave of GST into office.' He relied on that. He did no work. He did not try to combat the government on ideas, beliefs, values or policies. As a result, he was dumped by that same wave. We have seen it all the way through. The Leader of the Opposition will oppose the government for what he and his colleagues, especially the member for Grayndler, think are popular reasons and then do a backflip. The GST was going to be rolled back. We do not hear about the GST being rolled back now. Once the Labor Party fiercely, unrelentingly and deceptively opposed the GST. Now they embrace it, as do their Labor premiers. Try and take the GST off the Labor premiers and see how far you get. This is the track record of the Labor Party. They opposed waterfront reform. When we came to office, the average container movement on the waterfront was 16 per hour. We were told, again by the Labor Party, that it was physically impossible to move more than 22 containers per hour. At present they are moving 27 containers per hour and are increasing that. The wages are higher now than they were before because they are paid on a productivity basis. They opposed waterfront reform. Now that we have had waterfront reform and are helping exporters and farmers across the country, the Labor Party have dropped their opposition. They have opposed almost every budget measure that this government has brought in. We inherited a debt of $96 billion. Now we have no net Commonwealth debt, yet the Labor Party opposed every fiscal initiative of this government. We wiped that debt in the face of the opposition of the Labor Party, especially in the Senate. They have done that all the way through our term in office. They opposed our tax cuts, but now they support them. We do the heavy lifting, as is the requirement of government normally, in the face of stringent opposition and obstructionism in the parliament and then Labor accept the reforms in the national interest. They have opposed policy to make the Reserve Bank independent. They have opposed reforms to the welfare sector to help people find work. Every step of the way they oppose the government, not because they always believe on a basis of conviction in their opposition but because they want to make life more politically difficult and because they want to stir up constituents in the wider electorate. All of that is done on the basis of extortion, deception and at times outright lies. They have opposed our measures to strengthen our borders and to give more powers to our security agencies, to make arrests and make Australia safer. There is one thing the Labor Party have not done a backflip on. They still oppose the government on border protection and on proper and balanced security measures. They have opposed our reforms to Medicare and they have opposed our support of private health insurance through a rebate system. All the way through the Labor Party oppose, yet they put up this for the matter of public importance debate today: The Government surrendering the national interest in favour of its own political interest. You will not sell that in the Australian electorate. Whilst people disagree at times with the government, as is their right, on many of our policies and policy directions, we will explain them. At times we will be responsive to public criticisms but at other times we have to show leadership, win the argument, put the facts, engage in the debate and respect Australians and give them credit for their capacity to have an informed debate. The Labor Party instead sells out Australians. It will not engage in policy debates. This is not a debate about policy. How can it be? The Labor Party does not have any. We do not see a publication from the Labor Party that it believes is worthy of debate in this chamber. Instead, we got ridiculous questions during question time today. It was by and large a waste. To the extent that there were serious questions, they went over old ground. There is no innovation and there is no freshness about the Leader of the Opposition, nor the party he leads. I find it amusing that the Labor Party would attack the government for putting its interests ahead of the national interest. Does everybody remember former Leader of the Opposition Mark Latham? This is a well known poster of the now Leader of the Opposition with the former Leader of the Opposition, on which Kim Beazley writes a letter to everybody and endorses Mark Latham. He says things like: Labor is ready to govern, and Mark Latham is ready to be Prime Minister. It's time for a change in government. Mark Latham and Labor will have a government that solves problems and takes the pressures off families. The Leader of the Opposition gave a ringing and unqualified endorsement of Mark Latham. Either he was selling out the national interest and presenting somebody that the Labor Party themselves now concede was unfit for the office of Prime Minister or he was lying to the Australian people.",105
196,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The minister will withdraw the last comment.,106
197,Mr MCGAURAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I withdraw that. There was no putting the national interest ahead of the Labor Party's interest when it came to that endorsement of Mark Latham. I am concerned also that the Leader of the Opposition is again putting his interests and those of his party ahead of the national interest. In Victoria there is a scandalous situation developing, in which a member of the Labor Party, Khalil Eideh, has been preselected for a safe upper house seat. This is a man who has written to the President of Syria, saying such things asMr Kelvin Thomson- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The matter of public importance is: the government surrendering the national interest in favour of its own political interest. The discussion of a state preselection can hardly be germane to that.",106
198,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Wills would be well aware that there probably would not be any broader matter of public importance put before the parliament than the one proposed by the Labor Party today. It is a very broad matter of public importance. The minister has the call.,106
199,Mr MCGAURAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The reason I am bringing this up is that it is a matter of national interest that this man does not enter parliament. Mr Eideh has written to the President of Syria and declared: ... the danger and threat from the Imperialist and Zionist is increasing on our Arabic world in general, and particularly on our Arabic Syrian country. … … … We owe our complete loyalty to and are working to protect Syria. He finishes by pledging to the President of Syria-a dictator, Dictator Assad: Loyalty, absolute loyalty to your courageous and wise leadership and we pledge to continue to be faithful soldiers behind your victorious leadership. That is a man who, if the Leader of the Opposition is serious about the national interest, will not enjoy Labor Party preselection. That same person gave a speech in 2002, reprinted in the Sydney Arabic newspaperMr Jenkins-Is it a crime?",106
200,Mr MCGAURAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The crime is that he is anti-Semitic-that is the crime-and there is no dissociation of Mr Eideh by the Labor Party. He is a protege of Senator Kim Carr; he has been warmly endorsed publicly by the member for Melbourne. Let me read a bit more about Mr Eideh to show his unfitness for parliamentary service. In a speech in 2002 he said: Satan's brigades are getting ready to enslave the Arab world. We could see the light of your soul in the face the martyrs, the heroes, the greatest of free as-those who carry the flag of dawn from South Lebanon and Palestine. This is a supporter of Hezbollah and Hamas. You talk about the national interest; you stop that man entering public life. Mr Jenkins-Are you accusing him of a crime?",107
201,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Scullin!,107
202,Mr MCGAURAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am accusing Mr Eideh of being anti-Semitic and unfit for office. He has received comfort and support from the Labor Party. Nobody has the courage in the Labor Party to dissociate themselves from him. He is receiving support from the Labor Party in this House. There are other examples of the Leader of the Opposition putting his narrow interest ahead of the national interest. I refer especially to the issue of fuel. Through 2001 and 2002 the Labor Party ran a campaign against ethanol. You had the member for Fraser and the member for Hotham in their leadership positions attacking Manildra as one of the companies involved in the emerging ethanol industry. They proclaimed that ethanol was unsafe for motor vehicles, they scared motorists away from the use of ethanol and, of course, they have the political cheek to attack the government on petrol pricing when as a group and as individuals they have done more than anybody else to destroy, harm and retard the growth of ethanol take-up amongst motorists. Now the Leader of the Opposition has done a U-turn. He has reversed the Labor Party's outright opposition to biofuels such as ethanol because it is more politically expedient for the Labor Party to now endorse ethanol. But the damage has been done. Talk to anybody in the biofuels industry and they will tell you we are several years behind of where we should be on this issue of uptake Ar- of ethanol and biofuel because of the Labor Party's actions. There was no national interest then; there was just grubby, political, Labor interest at that time. But the backflip by the Leader of the Opposition continues. There is no concept of national interest for him. He told the House on 15 February that he would ratify the Kyoto protocol and that he would incorporate into the Kyoto regime a carbon trading arrangement-that is, he would put a tax on carbon emissions. He has told the House this week that he opposes carbon trading. This is a Leader of the Opposition who will say and do anything at any given moment to win votes or attack the government. He is not guided by the national interest. He lacks conviction and consistency and, as a result, the Labor Party lacks credibility. This is a Labor Party without policy. It lurches from opportunity to opportunity and, before much longer, in the absence of any credible policy framework, the Australian people will pass their judgement. (Time expired)",107
203,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This is a government which is increasingly drunk with power. The longer it stays in office the more contemptuous of the national interest it becomes. There is always politics in public life, but this government is always only ever about politics. We have a Prime Minister who wakes up every day thinking, ‘How is it that I can do over the Labor Party?'-a Prime Minister for whom the national interest comes a distant last. We heard a feeble rebuttal from the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. You would have thought he would say something-just something-about how this government may have governed in the national interest or give some defence of the national interest, but we got nothing. He was absolutely threadbare. Why do we believe that this is a government which is not governing in the national interest but only looking after its own political interest? In the first place, there is the of taxpayer funds for Liberal Party political advantage. We have had a massive government advertising binge with over $1 billion spent in the course of the last decade. Indeed, when we examined Senate estimates in May we discovered that a staggering $250 million in advertising was proposed for expenditure in the lead-up to the next election. That includes over $50 million for the private health insurance campaign, $47 million for the smartcard awareness campaign-you can write to every Australian household many times with $47 million-$36 million for child support reforms and $15 million on independent contractors. This $250 million comes on top of a $130 million advertising placement spend for the current financial year, so you are looking at a $380 million campaign all up. This is a breathtaking abuse of taxpayers' money. In the run-up to the 2007 election campaign, taxpayers will be footing the bill for political advertising, not the Liberal Party. The Australian public should brace themselves for wave after wave of propaganda on the scale of last year's IR campaign. That campaign raised the bar of government advertising and the government clearly has no intention of lowering it. The smartcard campaign is supposed to be about reminding people to register. If you sent out reminder letters, we would all get six letters each. Drunken sailors would be dipping their lids at this level of spending. Hundreds of millions of taxpayers' dollars will be torched on government spin and propaganda in order to try to get the coalition re-elected. That campaign has involved Liberal Party advertiser ‘Lucky' Ted Horton and has essentially reconvened the Liberal Party advertising dream team, with the involvement of Liberal advertiser Mark Pearson and also the former Chief of Staff to the Prime Minister, Graeme Morris. This is a campaign which use benefits Liberal Party mates and it is unacceptable. Frankly, with apologies to Winston Churchill, never before in the history of government advertising has so much money been hosed up against a wall by so few in so short a time. We have had a dodgy process associated with government advertising-inadequate tendering and a whole series of arrangements in which proper process had not been followed. FOI documents reveal that the government acted against departmental advice that its Work Choices advertising campaign should not start until after the legislation had gone through the parliament. It is not only about spending taxpayers' money; it is also about the damage that this government has done to transparency and accountability. Over the last decade the government has almost doubled its number of advisers to 445. This has greatly assisted ministers where they have chosen to neglect or abuse their position of trust. Their ing staffs have provided politically devoted service. This sort of development underpins the unaccountable nature of the Howard government. Issues concerning proper conduct can no longer be dealt with by this parliament. Advisers have the capacity to shoulder blame and responsibility for a minister's action or inaction without any fear of real consequences. Parliamentary secretaries cannot be questioned during question time and ministerial advisers cannot be questioned by Senate estimates or other parliamentary committees. What we need is better legislation-freedom of information law being updated so that ministers, their advisers and their departments cannot delay or withhold information on the basis of their political interpretation of public or national interest. The mother of all accountability failures has been the AWB scandal. These failures have included the pitiful response which this government made to the request by the UN Chief Customs Officer, Felicity Johnston, for Australia to investigate allegations that AWB was paying kickbacks to Saddam Hussein and the government's failure to notice the dramatic escalation in trucking fees being paid to Alia. They went up from $US12 a tonne in July 2000 to $US44 a tonne and subsequently $US55 a tonne by December 2002. This was when petrol in Iraq was 10c a gallon and the real cost of inland transportabeing tion was estimated at less than $6 per tonne. There was also the government's failure to investigate the front page of the New York Times, which specifically indicated that Iraq was running a pay-off racket, and, of course, the failure of Australian diplomats in the Middle East to pick up what was common knowledge about the use of Alia to circumvent UN sanctions. The question is: faced with such monumental failures which led to this massive grow- scandal-the payment of $300 million to Saddam Hussein-what action has the government taken by way of response? Ministers say, ‘We were misled by our advisers,' but they take no action to penalise them. The only rational conclusion from such ministerial inaction is that ministers are not sincere. Either ministers did know more than they are telling, more than they are letting on, and will not punish advisers for fear of having the whistle blown regarding their real state of knowledge, or they approve of not being advised and want to maintain this system of ministerial ignorance and plausible denial. If ministerial responsibility and public accountability are to mean anything in this country, this system must be cracked open and the public should no longer be expected to tolerate such miserably low standards of ministerial performance. This practice of the government of putting politics first instead of the national interest has been causing damage to us. It was interesting to read in the Australian recently that the United States says that it now has 72 per cent of the Iraqi wheat market. Prior to the war Australia had 90 per cent of Iraq's wheat trade. The government's desire to put their own political interest ahead of the national interest has led to this debacle-we have basically lost the wheat trade to Iraq. We have Australia's trade and foreign policies steered by ministers whose surplus of hubris and deficit of steering skills are reminiscent of Toad of Toad Hall. Little wonder our trade deficit has grown and our international reputation has shrunk. Finally, we learned in the last couple of days that the government have moved to increase the printing entitlements for members of the House of Representatives from $125,000 to $150,000-again, putting their political interest ahead of the national interest. $125,000 is already too high and this 20 per cent increase is totally unjustified. It worse. MPs will now be able to roll over unspent entitlement to the tune of 45 per cent or $67,500. That would bring next year's entitlement up to $217,500. So 2007 will see a rerun of You've Got Mail-only it will not be starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan; it will be starring a Howard government MP in a marginal seat near you! They have so many leaflets they will probably call out the RAAF to do an aerial leaflet drop. This reflects the determination of the Howard government to use the benefits of incumbency to build a moat around their sitting MPs and turn each government electorate into a fortress. This is consistent with their attitude to the tax deductibility of election campaign donations and their government advertising binge. If it were happening in countries like East Timor or the Solomons, Australia and the rest of the world would be giving them a lecture about democratic practice and culture. This abuse of taxpayers' funds for political advantage is a blot on Australian democracy.",108
204,Mrs MIRABELLA,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Indi) (4.07 pm)Where does one begin? I do have some sympathy for the member for Wills. He obviously drew the short straw today. He ended with some criticism of the printing entitlement. Let me remind him and his Labor colleagues that under the last Labor government there was an unlimited allowance, but they quite conveniently forget that. Methinks this smells a little of the hypocritical meat pie that he must have had for lunch. Let us remember one of the Labor members who lost his seat-the former member for Paterson-who spent over $400,000 of his printing entitlement. The member for Wills also said that the current entitlement was too high. Did he tell the member for Richmond, a Labor member, that she spent too much money when she spent $124,968 of gets her printing entitlement? Why didn't the member for Wills criticise the member for Richmond? In his opinion she obviously did not need to spend that much money. Let us remember that the Labor Party had an unlimited amount and it was this government that actually brought in limits. We heard nothing from the opposition about the obvious Labor hypocrisy when in August 2003 Labor joined with the Democrats and Greens to disallow certain entitlements. They forgot to mention that there were some entitlements that were designed specifically to help the Labor Party and the minor parties, like new charter transport arrangements and more computers, mobile phones and business travel for their staff. We did not hear anything about that. Then again, as I said, I do empathise with the member for Wills. He was stuck with the pathetic, puerile and empty matter of public importance that the member for Grayndler got up today. Mr Bartlett interjecting",110
205,Mrs MIRABELLA,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"No. Obviously there was no policy. There was no comment at all about other significant matters. There was no policy contribution about alternative fuels, no policy contribution about jobs growth, no positive contribution about anything. He also talked about government advertising. The last year that the Labor Party was in power, in real terms, the amount of money it spent on advertising was more than this government spent in 2002 and 2003. The government does need to spend money on advertising. About $25,000 a year goes solely on defence recruitment. Another $20,000 to $25,000 goes on advisory as, recruitments and notices for the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the Australian Electoral Commission and other government bodies. The government also runs campaigns against smoking, alcoholism and the use of illegal drugs. It also urges employers to support apprenticeships and gets people to help environmental projects. That is the majority of government advertising. Since today is the day that the government held its very important and historic history summit, let us remember a bit of Labor advertising history. Remember the $250,000 they paid Bill Hunter for government advertising? And what did we see? The same Bill Hunter turned up in Labor's 1996 election commercials. That is just a bit of the smell of the hypocrisy from the Labor Party. The member for Grayndler talked about the national interest. I have some advice for him-though he may choose not to take it. There is one thing that the Labor opposition can do in the national interest, and that is to be a decent opposition. Any democracy in the Western world demands and deserves an opposition that is hard working, an opposition that is full of members who are representative of the nation they seek to represent, an oppositionDr Southcott-That reads the papers.",110
206,Mrs MIRABELLA,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Indeed. Thank you, member for Boothby. It deserves an opposition that reads the newspapers and holds the government accountable. An operational and working opposition is an integral part of our democracy. But what do we have? We have tokens. What did the former Labor leader say of the member for Grayndler? He said: When I rang him he said, “I know Kim is hopelessly conservative, but I started the campaign against Crean, and I'm going to see it through. I wish we had someone else to run, but that wasn't the case. Beazley was the only one who put up his hand.” I told him the vote might be 46-all, and he agreed. He said if he thought that was the case Tuesday morning, he would vote for me to break the deadlock. Not the sort of guy you would want in the trenches next to you. Crean calls him a habitual liar and I think he's right.",111
207,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Indi will withdraw that.,111
208,Mrs MIRABELLA,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I was merely quoting from The Latham Diaries.,111
209,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,You cannot quote and use unparliamentary language. You will withdraw.,111
210,Mrs MIRABELLA,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I withdraw that comment. But, more interesting perhaps, were the more sober comments from the former, very successful Labor minister who contributed significantly to Australiaformer Minister Button-when he said that factional leaders of the Labor Party have lost touch with mainstream people and the working class. Of course they have. They are overrun by people who are not representative of their communities. They are overrun by people who were put there by factional leaders and by unions that represent everdiminishing proportions of the Australian population. What did former Minister Button say? He called these factional leaders ‘control freaks devoted to manipulation rather than thought'. He said: Those who make it through to parliamentary positions seldom have much impact-as public figures they're about as attractive as Hannibal Lecter. That was the former Labor minister John Button. He said that because he had Australia's national interest in sight. We have a problem. The opposition is crippled in its ability to be an operational opposition. We see that Mr Beazley's approval rating is only 34 per cent in terms of who would make a better Prime Minister. on The reason for that is that he is a reflection of the statement that his father made. As Kim Beazley Sr said, the Labor Party was once full of the cream of the working class but in modern times it is full of the dregs of the middle class. We see these unrepresentative people. We had during question time an interesting exchange and criticism-it was an attempt to denigrate and blacken the good name of Pru Goward because she is standing for Liberal preselection. So what did the so-called feminists in the Labor Party, who are supposed to represent all women, do? They are very selective. They do not really perform as part of an operational opposition because, if you get selected as part of a quota, you are a token. When you come to this place, you must expect those who did the hard yards, who were selected on merit, to treat you as a token. The member for Gellibrand was asked in an interview: You got there through the quota system. Would you have got in without that? She said: I don't think that would have happened without having our rules in place, and I think that that has been a really significant change within the party. Indeed, it has been a significant change but certainly not a change for the better. The Labor Party are so desperate for relevance they cannot even bring themselvesthis is how bad it is on the other side-to use the words ‘mainstream Australia' in caucus because of all the lunatics within their extreme left-wing faction. The member for Grayndler said, ‘Sometimes it's time to move on with regard to leadership.' What do the opposition do? They know they are down in the polls. The member for Lalor looks very depressed. The opposition spokesman for foreign affairs is down in the dumps. They know these figures are bad, but where do they move onto? We could not have the member for Lalor being the Leader of the Opposition. The right-wing faction in Victoria would not let her, and good on them. They could not let someone who was so unrepresentative and so left wing ever be leader of the main opposition party in Australia. So, for the moment, they are stuck with the current opposition leader, Mr Kim Beazley. The member for Grayndler, after all, would know a thing or two about putting political interests ahead of national interest. He was the fellow, as Labor's environment spokesman, who was prepared to trade away Australia's jobs and risk losing millions of dollars in investment by signing the Kyoto protocol. How was this supposed to be in the national interest? He supported Bracks's disgraceful plan in condemning our proud history of alpine grazing in Victoria and consigned it to the dustbin.

214,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Perth has moved as an amendment that all words after ‘That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The question now is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question.,113
215,Ms GRIERSON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I rise today as the representative of the people of Newcastle, a proud daughter of the working class, a former school principal and board director, and certainly a person who has at no time used a quota system to be a representative. The member for Indi perhaps needs some education. I rise to speak on the Independent Contractors Bill 2006 and the accompanying Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Independent Contractors) Bill 2006. I oppose this legislation and I port the amendment moved by the member for Perth. The central philosophy behind this legislation is that the appropriate mechanism for regulating independent contractors is commercial law, rather than industrial law. This is consistent with the central philosophy behind the Howard government-that is, an individual worker has as much bargaining power as his or her employer. But that is just plain wrong and appallingly so. This legislation is another attempt by the Howard government to remove another large group of Australian workers and put them outside the established industrial relations system which has served this nation well for 100 years. That is, of course, the system based on fairness and good faith in bargaining-a system in which everyone is seen as a stakeholder, and an important one, in work and productivity. Estimates do vary as to how many independent contractors we have in Australia, but it is seen to be anywhere between about 800,000 and two million people. So at least another 800,000 workers are being targeted for lower wages and fewer conditions by the Howard government. For these workers, the Howard government's legislation is an absolute betrayal. These are workers who are going out on their own, who are enterprising and who are making their living based on their own skills and resources. These are the people who, as the research keeps telling us, have been shifting their votes to John Howard, as they have shifted away from old-style industrial enterprises and large-scale employers. These independent contractors are now finding themselves totally betrayed by the Howard government, just as all the other workers in Australia who have been caught up in its other set of extreme industrial relations lawsWork Choices-have also been betrayed. They are betrayed through the government's action to override protections provided by supthe state industrial relations systems, which the government did not replace with any appropriate protections under this federal system. Firstly, the bill overrides all existing deeming provisions in state industrial law. These deeming provisions in my state, New South Wales, declare that certain categories of workers are defined as employees even though they may be independent contractors at common law. These workers include carpenters, cleaners, painters, outworkers, drivers, plumbers and many others. In many cases, their working arrangements are little different from those of ordinary employees. The state deeming laws recognise this and offer some of the rights and protections enjoyed by all other employees. But the Howard government has decided, in its treachery, that these workers do not need these protections. It has deemed that these workers should be left vulnerable, in unfair bargaining positions, and at risk of having their pay and conditions further downgraded. How do we know this? We know it because the Howard government has exempted some workers from its new laws. The government has exempted textiles, clothing and footwear-TCF-outworkers and transport owner-drivers in New South Wales and Victoria. For these two groups of workers it has preserved existing protections. While this is very good news for the TCF outworkers and transport owner-drivers in New South Wales and Victoria, you have to ask: what about everybody else? Because in exempting these two categories of workers the minister has admitted that this legislation is definitely going to reduce the pay and conditions of all other independent contractors. To quote from the minister's second reading speech: These provisions in state legislation will given the special circumstances of owner-drivers in having to operate within very tight business margins because of the large loans they have to take out to pay for their vehicles. If this bill is not about reducing pay then why is the government and the minister worried about the tight margins of ownerdrivers? If this bill is supposed to be doing something good for independent contractors, why, as the minister admits, will ownerdrivers go broke if the bill is applied to them? This is not so much the exception proving the rule but the exemption absolutely proving the rule. It proves the rule that the Howard government is all about reducing the pay and conditions of hard working Australians. Do not get me wrong: I welcome this exemption for owner-drivers in my state, New South Wales. By them and for them it has been hard fought and well won. Their margins are tight. Petrol prices are at record highs. Interest rate rises add to their monthly loan repayments. Owner-drivers from my electorate have said that if they were exposed to the new laws they would simply be unable to provide for their families. They would have to spend dangerous amounts of time on the road. In the words of one: ‘We would get screwed.' My electorate of Newcastle has some very distinct characteristics that make this bill very relevant to the people of Newcastle. Over the past decades Newcastle has faced major restructuring of industry as well as the closure of BHP. This has meant that with a tightening labour market, as we have seen, many Novocastrians have decided to create their own jobs and become independent contractors. Their sense of pride and self-worth is very important to them, and they have always resisted being a burden on government. Earlier this year I met with several-about 30, in fact-owner-drivers in my electorate remain, before they commenced work. I thank them for being there at that time, because it was an absolute pleasure to be there and to speak with them. It is true that they purchase their vehicles at great cost. They pay all their insurance and all their costs. They cover their own sick leave. They cover their workers compensation, holidays and super. They drive five or six-some even seven-days a week. Their wife or another family member is often their reserve driver or the person who does the accounts. When I spoke with them and heard their stories, I did ask about holidays and, sadly, no-one had had four weeks annual leave-they just could not afford it. I also asked about their superannuation, and it disturbed me to know that, with the margins the way they are, they certainly were not putting away the correct amount for their future. Margins are indeed very tight and, yes, owner-drivers are already doing it tough. I am glad that they are exempt from this bill. I am also glad TCF outworkers, often some of the most disadvantaged and lowest paid people in our community, and many of whom are women, are exempted. However, the owner-driver provisions are set to be reviewed in 2007. That strikes terror into our hearts. It is fairly clear from the minister's statement that he wants to see the drivers' exemption cut. I fear there is little chance of the exemption for owner-drivers surviving beyond next year, with the minister already announcing what this review would be about: ... rationalising these laws and achieving national consistency if possible ... And let us not forget: if, as the minister admits, this bill is bad news for these two groups of independent contractors, it is surely bad news for all independent contractors. It does not matter if you are a driver, a seamstress, an IT technician, a plasterer or a milkman-you have still got a mortgage, you have still got to fill up the car with fuel, you have still got to pay the interest on your loan and you have still got to feed and clothe the kids and pay for health care and education. You have also got to keep yourself fit for the job. You have got to cover sickness and time out if something goes wrong with your health or if something goes wrong with the tools and equipment you need to do your job. Families are doing it tough, and the Howard government knows it. This legislation will make it tougher for the families of all independent contractors. Indeed, the other so-called protections offered to TCF outworkers will do little for them. The bill provides for a default minimum rate of pay to operate where an outworker is not guaranteed a minimum rate under state or territory law. This wage will be based on the minimum rate application under the minimum wages guarantee in that wonderful Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard. Remember, that is the minimum wage that has not risen in 18 months and which the government thinks is already too high. So that is not much of a guarantee for those people, is it? The bill also ensures that independent contractors can no longer access state unfair contracts laws. It creates a new national unfair contracts regime. Matters will be heard in the Magistrates Court. That is very interesting, isn't it? We read recently of a member of the minister's staff being appointed to the Magistrates Court-just in time, apparently, but certainly an appointment that is being questioned by the profession. Moving to this new regime will create greater expense and lengthier and more complex arguments, and will expose independent contractors to costs orders. In addition, under the federal system there is no ability for employer organisations or unions to apply for unfair contract review on behalf of a party. This is a further step along the path of deregulating contract arrangements, and a further whittling away of the rights, protections and representations available to independent contractors. It also adds to the layers and layers of complexity the Howard government has built up in the industrial laws of this nation. It makes a mockery of one of the Howard government's Work Choices slogans: A simpler, fairer, national workplace relations system for Australia. Remember that one? You would hope you would remember it, because I think the Howard government spent $1½ million of taxpayers' money on market testing that slogan so that you might believe it. Debate interrupted. NA",113
216,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 4.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Telecommunications",116
217,Ms LIVERMORE,ADJOURNMENT,"This speech is for the benefit of the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, in the hope that she and the rest of the government will snap out of their complacency and bring Australia's telecommunications infrastructure out of the Dark Ages. On 8 August this year, the day that Telstra announced that its plan for fibre broadband had fallen apart, the minister went on The 7.30 Report to claim that she had received no complaints about broadband in Australia. Allow me to introduce the minister to Craig Smith of Rockhampton. Here is what Mr Smith had to say about broadband in an email to me on 8 August: In January this year we moved to Rockhampton after six years living in the remote and isolated town of Cloncurry. We made the decision to move as our daughter's education is of paramount importance to us as we wish her to have every opportunity available to her when she leaves school. After moving I contacted Telstra regarding broadband. I was astonished when told that I lived too far from the Parkhurst exchange to guarantee service. We reside at Norman Gardensa very nice suburbthat is 3 and a half kilometres from the exchange. I could have been knocked over with a feather. Here we are spending half a million dollars on a house, top rate for school fees and all the extra costs of living in a metropolitan regional area such as high rates, water fees, home and car insurance is higher etc. and I was being treated like I lived in the sticks. Now our daughter is in the top percentage of grade fours in Australia and over the next couple of years will be doing projects and assignments that will require a fast and reliable broadband Internet access. I now read today that Telstra will be sold even without the guarantee of upgraded broadband. You can guess what we are telling all and sundry about buying in this area. Well, it should not be Mr Smith and his family who have to move on; it should be the minister, for failing Australian families and businesses who deserve better than Third World levels of internet access and speed. It will come as no surprise to Mr Smith, or the other people in my electorate who have contacted me over their inability to access high speed broadband, when I point out how far Australia is falling behind the rest of the world in terms of access and speed. You can take your pick of statistics. The OECD surveyed 30 countries and ranked Australia 17th for the take-up of 256 kbps broadband. The World Economic Forum ranks Australia 25th in the world in terms of internet bandwidth. And the World Bank found that Australia's average ADSL speed of barely one mbps is one of the slowest in the world compared to countries like Britain, the US, Germany, France and Canada. I think that the people in my electorate would agree with James Packer's recent description of Australia's broadband position as ‘embarrassing'. I think the Smiths are entitled to pursue their dreams for their young daughter, knowing that their government shares their hopes and ambitions for all Australians both now and into the future and knowing that their government is committed to providing the vital infrastructure if Australia is to compete on an equal footing with the rest of the world. The Labor Party share their ambitions and a Labor government will make them a reality. We want Australians to have worldclass telecommunications infrastructure so they can compete with the best in the world, not the 18th or the 26th, which is the level to which our outdated IT infrastructure is fast consigning us. That is why Labor has announced a plan to roll out a fibre-to-the-node broadband network across the country: a network that will deliver a broadband system with speeds 25 times faster than what is available in Australia today. We cannot afford for Australia to fall further behind in this important area. While families like the Smiths are investing in their kids' future they need a government doing the same thing and investing in the infrastructure that will equip all Australian kids for the future. While I am on the topic of Telstra, I would also like to raise very briefly another issue a rural part of my electorate, out in the Banana Shire, in the towns of Wowan and Dululu. The people in those towns have been in contact with a company called Clear Networks to provide them with broadband access through the Broadband Connect program. Mr Nairn-That is in my electorate.",116
218,Ms LIVERMORE,ADJOURNMENT,"That is true, actually. The company has sent an email to my state colleague, Mr Jim Pearce, saying that there is a real hold-up thanks to the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts and saying that they have been unable to fulfil services to the towns of Wowan and Dululu at this point. I raise this to say to the people of Wowan and Dululu that I will be following this up with the minister for communications to make sure that they get the services that they have been speaking to Clear Networks about for some months now. (Time expired) Charter of Victims Rights",117
219,Mrs GASH,ADJOURNMENT,"In an earlier statement to the House I spoke about the case of Nicole Robach, whose partner Michael Carey was murdered by Mr Rudzitis on 28 February 2005. Mr Rudzitis is presently incarcerated in the psychiatric wing of the Long Bay Gaol in Sydney at the pleasure of the New South Wales minister. Necessarily, I have had to deliver my statement in two parts, and this is the second part of that statement. Today I speak about the second aspect of her case-the role of the victim's statement-but I do want to revisit the question of mental health and the assessment process at some later stage because this too has contributed to Ms Robach's plight. According to research by the New South Wales Parliamentary Library, the Charter of Victims Rights is an attempt to address in grievances brought about by the process of the courts rather than the outcomes. These processes include delays, unnecessary continuances, risk of intimidation by the offenders, lack of information concerning the process and status of the case, insensitive criminal justice practitioners and victims' lack of standing and voice in proceedings. These are mentioned frequently. In other words, these so-called rights are no more than an emotional sop and have virtually no impact on the case. And there is even some suggestion to the lay person that an expectation is created that their words actually have an impact on the sentence. Nicole Robach has felt throughout that she was not being listened to, that she was alienated from the process and that she continues to be so. To help reach closure, she had sought court transcripts, particularly those relating to tape recordings of statements by the offender. She was able to access limited transcripts but, because the case is closed, she is no longer able to get them. I suggest that, if this is a matter of public record, the New South Wales government should give consideration to making available a full transcript to victims like Ms Robach if this helps with the process of closure. According to the New South Wales government's Lawlink, although fee-free access is available for judgements and written evidence in court proceedings, there is a fee that may be charged for all other transcripts. This is just another hurdle confronting the victim and this too should be reconsidered to assist with the rehabilitation of the victim. In an article in the Law Society Journal of September 1996, it was observed that the provisions of the Charter of Victims Rights only recommended that this information ‘should' be received by the victim, whereas it is argued that this be made mandatory. I am not critical of either the Mental Health Act or the Charter of Victims Rights per se. They have a role to play. But the system is wrong if the victim is expected to relive the killing of a loved one every six months. That is far from fair and just. The responsibility of the New South Wales parliament to their constituency is to ensure that the victims of crime do not become further victimised by the process. In that respect the Charter of Victims Rights has to be strengthened and made more relevant to the case at hand. To paraphrase the previously quoted article: what is needed for the future is for the New South Wales government to follow up on the initiative of the crime bureau by closely monitoring its implementation and making appropriate adjustments where problems arise. There is a problem here, and the New South Wales government should respond accordingly. Whilst this is a state problem, Ms Robach came to see me and I interviewed her very carefully on this matter. As a politician, we see and hear many things, but this case really broke me up. To see this woman, the mother of two children, have to relive a crime that caused the murder of her partner and the father to their two children simply because it is the law that every six months she has to explain why Mr Rudzitis, the murderer, should not be released is inhumane, and the law must be amended. Mr David Hicks",117
220,Mr MELHAM,ADJOURNMENT,"I have spoken in the House on a number of occasions in relation to the plight of David Hicks and his incarceration in Guantanamo Bay. I put a notice of motion on the Notice Paper on 2 March 2006 which has not yet been discussed in the House. Yesterday, I had to update that notice of motion as a result of the decision of the United States Supreme Court in July 2006 that the United States military commission process was illegal and that the treatment of prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay has been in violation of the Geneva conventions. It is a judgement that surprised a number of people but not those of us with a legal background who believe in proper processes when it comes to charging people. Today, along with a number of my colleagues, both senators and members of the House of Representatives, I was fortunate to listen to Major Michael Mori, who spoke to us. He is the military lawyer who has been assigned to represent Mr Hicks. He took us through some of the trials and tribulations that Mr Hicks has had to go through. He also pointed out some of the problems with the military commission that the US government was proposing, one of which was that people did not have to give evidence; they could rely on paper evidence. That could produce grave injustices. But today we saw an absurdity where, in the Australian newspaper, the Attorney General, Mr Ruddock, has tried to compare the trial processes of David Hicks with the trial processes of the Sydney gang rapists on the basis that no-one complained that they were in custody for five years, whereas they are all complaining about Mr Hicks being incarcerated for five years. The Attorney General made a disgraceful analogy, because there is no analogy. For one thing, David Hicks is not undergoing a fair process-and he should be undergoing a fair trial process, with the right to a fair trial instead of being in a kangaroo court-whereas the Sydney gang rapists went through a process. The truth in the case of the Sydney gang rapists is that there was a committal for trial very shortly after their initial arrest and crime. The offences occurred in AugustSeptember 2000, the committal for trial was on 9 July 2001 and there was a trial between 19 November 2001 and 20 December 2001. There were, however, multiple cases and so they had to be tried, and there were appeals et cetera. But you were dealing with people who had charges laid against them and who were properly represented. The best thing that Mr Hicks has going for him is Major Michael Mori. He is a passionate individual. He is someone who has been prepared to stand up, having been appointed by his military superiors. He has not been backward in criticising what has been a flawed process, and the United States Supreme Court has supported him. Major Michael Mori said of Mr Ruddock that Mr Ruddock ‘must be desperate' in terms of his analogy. The article in the Australian continues: ‘There is no comparison,' he said. ‘It is pointing that the highest law enforcement officer in the country has moved away from the basic fundamental values involved in the criminal justice system. I do not know what, if anything, Mr Hicks has done. What I am arguing is that he should be given a fair trial. That is what differentiates us from the terrorists. That is what civilised societies do. They do not produce kangaroo courts and bodgie tribunals to doctor particular outcomes. If the same thing was happening to American citizens, there would be outrage in America. But the interesting thing is that military commissions, under the presidential decree, cannot occur against US citizens. Australian citizens are being treated as second-class citizens. We should have the same standards of justice for all combatants. That is what differentiates us, supposedly, from the other side. It seems to me that the only thing stopping Mr Hicks from being released is that this government knows that if he came back to Australia there would be nothing that he could be charged with. It is as a result of the lack of criminality in relation to the Australian jurisdiction that he is stuck in limbo in Guantanamo Bay with a bodgie process that still has to be thought through by the American congress. So there is going to be further delay. It is unacceptable-five years, currently no charges held against him and questionable in the future. He should be returned to Australia. If he has done something wrong then deal with him according to proper standards of law, not bodgie tribunals. (Time expired) United Nations",118
221,Mr JOHNSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Today I want to speak in parliament on a meeting earlier this week that I had the great pleasure of attending, along with many of my colleagues from both the House and the Senate. I had the great pleasure and privilege of disapmeeting South Korea's foreign minister, Mr Ban Ki-moon, along with South Korea's Ambassador to Australia, Cho Chang-beom. I attended that meeting in my capacity as Chairman of the Australia-Korea Friendship Group and it was a wonderful opportunity for me as someone with a very strong interest in global affairs and international relations. Along with my colleagues, I met with Mr Ban Ki-moon to discuss his interest in and candidacy for the post of Secretary General of the United Nations. As we all know, the tenure of the current Secretary General, Kofi Annan, comes to an end very soon. There are candidates for that position from countries ranging from India and Sri Lanka to Thailand, as well as South Korea's foreign minister, Mr Ban Ki-moon. In my capacity as a member of the government of the day in Australia, as Chairman of the Australia-Korea Parliamentary Friendship Group and as a citizen of this country, I warmly commend Mr Ban Ki-moon's nomination to Minister Downer and to the Australian government. Mr Ban Ki-moon is a very impressive man. His academic credentials are substantial indeed. He is a graduate of Department of International Relations at Korea's most prestigious university, Seoul National University, as well as having spent time at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. But more than that, he has impeccable credentials in the world of diplomacy and foreign affairs. He has served his country in some of the most important positions in the US, in Europe and in Asia. He has also held very important, high-level positions right at the edge of the workings of the United Nations. I commend his academic record. I commend his working history to the government, because I think this is a time when the United Nations needs someone in that very significant post who will bring the United Nations into the 21st century. We all know that this is a massive organisation. It is profoundly important to the peace, harmony and security of the world. It is of course very complex. It is very cumbersome. It has huge flaws, it has setbacks and it has difficulties. But, at this point in time, it is the only mechanism that we know of that has the capacity to make a difference. It is the only mechanism that can bring together all the nations of the world under one roof to not only discuss but address some of the major challenges facing our world. Very briefly, I want to draw to the attention of the House five very important issues that I think will face Mr Kofi Annan's successor-and, for my part, I hope it is Mr Ban Ki-moon. There is global terrorism. Recently, we saw the bombings in India. We have experienced terrorism in our own backyard with the Bali bombings. In 2005 there were the underground bombings in London. Another very challenging issue facing the world, particularly the newer countries, is that of nation building. East Timor, which is right in our own backyard, is a very new nation in the international community. The the economic security and place of Pacific countries in our world structure needs a lot of attention. We hear the word ‘globalisation'. Globalisation needs the focus of the best minds of our world because it can bring enormous wealth, opportunity and economic benefits to the people all over the world. However, at the same time, globalisation frightens good, ordinary citizens of the world who do not fully understand it and who are not experiencing its benefits. There is also the issue of global poverty. We need to address poverty, particularly in Africa, so that everybody is safer. The UN is well placed to do this with the right man at the helm. In relation to natural tragedies, there was the tsunami that gripped our part of the world. We as an international community should be working together to provide relief to those who were affected by such a catastrophe. The environment and energy are bigpicture issues and it will require, as I said, the very best minds of our world coming together, with all the goodwill in the world, to try to address them. We have war and conflict throughout our world. We must solve the problems in the Middle East, including terrorist organisations such as Hezbollah- (Time expired) Battle of Long Tan",119
222,Mr GRIFFIN,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise on this day to take note of the 40th anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan. Firstly, I would like to make a general comment on the Vietnam War commemorations that will be occurring all over Australia in the next few days. These commemorations often invoke mixed feelings for the veterans of this conflict. Apart from the tragic circumstances that surround participants in any conflict, veterans of the Vietnam War were also poorly received upon their arrival back in Australia. I would like to apologise to the Vietnam veterans who were subjected to this treatment. It was wrong then, it is wrong now and it will always be wrong to have serving men and women of this nation treated in that manner. While the politics of any war may be questioned, the bravery, dedication and commitment of the young men and women who served their country should never be. I would also like to say that the debt owed to our veterans for the treatment that they received goes beyond those who opposed the war to those who expressed support in words at the time but who have often since provided only words in support. As the Leader of the Opposition said earlier today, quoting from a letter from the member for Cowan: ... many good Australians opposed that war and not all who opposed that war took it out on troops. … … … Equally it should be said that not all who ported the war supported the troops ... In my view, any apology warrants the involvement of not only those who were unfairly critical of our troops but also those who have often paid lip-service to the needs of our troops since then. In talking about the Battle of Long Tan today, I recognise the huge contribution that all Vietnam veterans made to the war effort. Bravery, dedication, commitment and sacrifice were in no way restricted to those who served at Long Tan, and I therefore thank all those who served their country during that war. Although Long Tan adds dramatically to the symbolism of Vietnam Veterans Day, it is a day for all Vietnam veterans, wherever they served and whatever their contribution. The Battle of Long Tan has become part of the ANZAC legend and the Australian psyche. It was a battle against all odds, fought by young Australians against a much larger and more experienced force. It was a battle in which mateship and courage under fire were defining characteristics. It was on the afternoon of 18 August 1966 that Delta Company 6RAR encountered an enemy force and for three hours, in the pouring rain, amid the mud, trees and mist in the Long Tan rubber plantation in Phuoc Tuy Province, South Vietnam, Delta Company fought for their lives, holding off a force of some 2,500 Vietnamese, including members of the NVA and of the Vietcong. Most of the Australians were young national servicemen, led by a few regulars. They were new to the theatre of operations and had experienced only light and fleeting contact with enemy forces. Many of the Vietnamese, on the other hand, had fought the battles in the region and knew the area thoroughly. They were only one half of a force advancing to attack the newly established Australian base at Nui Dat, only five kilomesuptres away. Fierce fighting ensued as the Australians tried desperately to repel the numerically superior enemy force. Helicopter crews flew through the rain at very low altitude to resupply Delta Company. Artillery back at Nui Dat provided coverage which undoubtedly saved the lives of many of the soldiers in Delta Company. Over the course of those three hours at the Long Tan rubber plantation, the Australians would see many acts of bravery. The young men steadfastly held their ground and defended it as wave after wave of the enemy attacked. With nothing more than the trees of the rubber plantation and a low-lying mist generated by the rain for cover, Delta Company 6RAR held out long enough for reinforcements to arrive, turning the battle around and forcing the enemy to retreat. Sadly, 18 Australian lives were lost that day: 17 from D Company and one from the 1st APC Squadron; 24 soldiers were wounded. On the other side, the Vietnamese forces suffered the loss of at least 245 men and had over 500 wounded. There is no doubt that the actions, bravery, dedication and commitment of the Australians on that day discouraged further attacks on Nui Dat. I would like to take this chance to repeat Labor's long standing policy and support for an inquiry into the Long Tan bravery awards fiasco, and I would welcome a bipartisan approach from the government. The member for Cowan has spoken on this issue on a number of occasions. It has been subject to quite a deal of debate and discussion and I will not go into the detail, but I would like note comments made by the Prime Minister in his statement to the House today on this issue. The Prime Minister said: The difficulty faced by any government in reopening a particular set of recommendations, having regard to changes that might have been made on the original recommendations, is that one sense of grievance might be addressed so many others are opened up. I ask: when has this ever been a reason to not correct a wrong or an injustice? When is it okay to say, ‘We will not reopen this because it is too hard, it is too difficult and it might cause us problems in the future'? This is a completely unacceptable attitude that is completely out of touch with everyday Australians. If we took the Prime Minister's advice never to take on anything that is too difficult, nothing would ever be achieved. It is about time the Prime Minister and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs said that they are willing to act on this issue. The ongoing suffering of many veterans and their families remains an issue for our government and our community. There is no doubt that more needs to be done with respect to the concerns of the families of Vietnam veterans and the circumstances they have had to deal with over the last 40 years in the aftermath of that war. I commend to the House the bravery, dedication and commitment of all our Vietnam veterans. I thank them for their own and their families' sacrifices and I look forward to catching up with many of them at the various commemorative services over the next few days. I commend them to the House. Warnervale Community Centre Central Coast: Coalmining Parliamentarians' Entitlements: Printing",121
223,Mr TICEHURST,ADJOURNMENT,"I have been pushing the Minister for Families, to Community Services and Indigenous Affairs for some time to include the Warnervale Community Centre in a pilot program. However, today in the Main Committee, the member for Shortland was doing the bidding of her Labor factional mate Councillor Warren Welham, who is promoting himself as the as Labor candidate for the state seat of Wyong. Labor has the view that, if the federal government comes to the rescue and bails it out of its obligation, it then becomes incumbent on the federal government to keep doing so. Labor is so dishonest that it will say anything to get into power. The member for Shortland should know that there are two sides to a contract for funding. Two-way negotiations take time: proposals need to be requested and responded to and questions need to be asked and answered. The minister can respond only when answers are received, and this can cause delays. The state Liberal candidate for Wyong, Brenton Pavier, and I have visited the Warnervale Community Centre on a number of occasions to encourage them to get this information together as soon as possible. I want to turn now to another issue. Several months ago, the Central Coast community successfully fought plans by Sydney Gas to mine gas in the Yarramalong and Dooralong valleys. Whilst the project was permitted under state Labor's legislation, I worked with the Australian Gas Alliance and local residents to stall the project because of its likely effects on our local water supply. The win showed just what can be achieved when residents work together to fight proposals that are not in the best interests of area. It was a case of people power against corporate greed and, in spite of Labor's draconian legislation, the people won. Sadly, we are again facing a similar encroachment: Kores Australia, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Korean Resources Corporation, a mining agency of the Korean government, want to mine the Wyong valleys for more than 40 years. The company wants approval to extract up to five million tonnes of coal a year from seams in the valleys between 350 and 650 metres below the surface. Our water catchment is our most precious asset on the Central Coast, and the risk of contaminated water reaching our water supply is a worrying prospect for local residents and community leaders. Whilst this matter is or do under the jurisdiction of the New South Wales government, I have called on the Howard government to investigate the likely impacts of the company's plans on our water catchment. I have made a formal request to the minister for a federal investigation of the project, including the likely impact of coal mining on the Central Coast watertable, the outcomes of similar projects in Australia and abroad, possible steps to ensure that our water catchment is not ruined and whether there are grounds for federal involvement. As the federal member for Dobell it is my responsibility to run a ruler over projects in my electorate that will affect Central Coast residents and future generations. With the New South Wales Labor government set to receive up to $1 billion in royalties and millions in rail freight if the mining goes ahead, I am very concerned that it will self-approve a project that is considered by the Central Coast community to be environmentally unsound. On the ground, the local community is working hard to voice its opposition to the coal mining. A public community meeting our will be held next Tuesday at the Wyong Memorial Hall, and hundreds of people are expected to attend. I understand that Australian Gas Alliance and valley residents have also begun erecting hundreds of protest signs in a bid to get a clear message to the New South Wales Labor government. This fight affects every single resident of the Central Coast, because it is our water supply that is under threat. The valleys represent 50 per cent of the water catchment for the whole of the Central Coast. As demonstrated in the local fight against the mining plans of Sydney Gas, Central Coast Liberal Party members, state candidates and councillors are committed to protecting our natural environment and lifestyle and to supporting local residents. I speak on behalf of the Central Coast community when I say that, with the Central Coast being one of the biggest urban growth areas in New South Wales, and with our water supply at an all-time low, any project that poses even the slightest threat to our water supply should not even be on the table. I call on the New South Wales Labor government to reject this absurd proposal. If the Labor member for The Entrance and Minister for the Central Coast is serious about wanting to retain his seat, I suggest he get on to Morris Iemma as soon as possible. In conclusion, Mr Speaker, I understand that in today's matter of public importance debate mention was made of the printing allowance for members of the House of Representatives. I ask the minister at the table to please comment on what was mentioned in that MPI. Mr David Hicks",122
224,Mr JENKINS,ADJOURNMENT,"This morning I was very fortunate, along with over 30 parliamentary colleagues from both the House and the Senate, to be involved in a briefing by Major Michael Dante Mori, the very brave and intelligent military counsel who is acting on behalf of David Hicks. Major Mori gave a very succinct but full outline of the circumstances of David Hicks since he was first arrested nearly five years ago and the circumstances of his detainment in Guantanamo Bay. I join with the honourable member for Banks in asking that the government either make approaches to the US government and have David Hicks returned to Australia or place pressure on the US government to ensure that a process is put in place so that any charges for any offences that David Hicks may have carried out can be looked at with procedural fairness to him.",124
225,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 5 pm, the debate is interrupted. Mr Nairn-I require the debate to be extended.",124
226,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,The debate may continue. Ministerial Reply,124
227,Mr NAIRN,ADJOURNMENT,"In the adjournment debate, the member for Dobell raised the issue of printing entitlements. It was also raised in the MPI earlier today and through comments by the member for Wills over the last 24 hours. I want to inform the member for Dobell and others that the printing entitlement is a very important tool which allows members to communicate with their electorate. Moreover, I note that when this entitlement was introduced by Labor in 1990 the amount which could be spent was unlimited. I repeat: under Labor, the amount was unlimited. Members of this House, during that period, occasionally spent more than $200,000 in a year, more than $300,000 a year and even more than $400,000 a year. It took the courage of this government to put a limit of $125,000 on that printing entitlement, and that was over four years ago. Costs go up. Recently, I wrote to all members saying that the printing entitlement would be increased to $150,000. The member for Wills has made a number of statements publicly about this. In fact, he made the comment on Perth radio today that $125,000 is already too high. I wonder whether the member for Wills has spoken with his colleague the member for Griffith. I do not think the member for Griffith will think that $125,000 is too high. When I looked at last year's expenditure, I found that the member for Griffith have spent $124,999.99. The member for Griffith had only 1c left from his entitlement last year. I wonder what he could spend that 1c on. Mr Kelvin Thomson-On a point of order, Mr Speaker: if the minister wishes to release the details of one MP, is he willing release the details of all members of parliament?",124
228,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,That is not a point of order. The honourable the Special Minister of State.,125
229,Mr NAIRN,ADJOURNMENT,"The member for Wills made a number of other statements. I wonder whether he has spoken to the Leader of the Opposition as well, who spent almost $110,000 last year. The member for Wills also said in that interview that the previous cap was $62,000. That is absolutely wrong and completely false. There was no cap under Labor; it was unlimited. You could spend all you liked, and that is what happened. Labor drafted the regulations back in 1990 and we all remember Senator Richardson's book about whatever it takes. Unlimited expenditure was all part of it. With all of the commentary over the last 24 hours, let us remind people outside this House who have commented on this that under Labor there was unlimited expenditure. The member for Wills at times has also commented on postage and various other things. I know that the member for Batman at one stage said you would probably need to spend only $30,000. The member for Batman spent a bit more than that. The member for Wills spent well over double that, so obviously there is a conflict there. This has all been cheap political pointscoring. In fact, a couple of years ago when the ALP joined the Democrats and Greens to disallow an increase to allow for inflation, they did not disallow all the things that they thought were pretty good for them-extra charters, business travel for their staff, more computers for them and mobile phones. They were very happy to take all those things, but when it came to this, they took the chance to make a political point. Even the chairman of their so-called ‘waste watch committee' also to spent over $100,000. So contrary to what the member for Wills is saying about it being all too much, so many of his own people were quite happy to do that. Let us look at the entitlement. In my electorate, the increased amount, the $150,000 entitlement for printing in order to communicate with your electorate, works out at $1.61 per elector per year. I do not think that is outrageous. There was also talk about postage. The postage entitlement is 50c per elector per year. So members of parliament will be able to write to each elector once per year. That, in the words of the member for Wills, is excessive. I do not think that is excessive. I think constituents in electorates expect their federal members to correspond with them. In this day and age, there is a lot of information which they are looking for. Certainly members are well and truly entitled to correspond with their electorate and that is exactly what this entitlement allows them to do, to send them information. I know that members opposite have been very busy sending things over a number of years. They were very busy when under Labor you could spend as much as you liked. Members on all sides were busy. Members of parliament send all sorts of information to their constituents. I do not think the general public would be concerned if members of parliament were able to correspond with each of their constituents once per year. That is all the postage allowance provides-50c per elector. I know that members on both sides of the House send appropriate information to constituents in newsletters: government information about pensions, seniors, veterans, child care, all of those sorts of things-the sort of information that ought to be provided. In this day and age people are very keen to receive as much information as possible and it is the role of members of parliament to provide them with the necessary information. The ramblings of the member for Wills on radio, talking about dropping leaflets from aircraft and all those sorts of things, were sensational-and as stupid as the question from the Chief Opposition Whip today about chickens, I suppose. In conclusion, I repeat that this government put a cap on expenditure. Under Labor there was unlimited expenditure, and people need to understand that. This government put a cap on expenditure four years ago and it is now appropriate to increase the amount because it has not been changed since. It probably will not be changed again for a number of years and that is the appropriate way to deal with entitlements. House adjourned at 5.10 pm The following notice was given: Mr Cadman to move: That the House acknowledges that: (1) the cost of housing in Australia is often more than double what it should be; (2) the high cost is mainly due to the huge increase in the price of land and, as a result, land affordability is a problem in Australia, and especially in Sydney; (3) Sydney is the most penalised city in the country, with affordability being worse than in London or New York; (4) the main causes are State and local government planning restrictions and taxes; and (5) State and local governments must play their part to reduce the cost of housing so the great Australian dream remains a reality, especially for future generations.
