1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Sir Elliot Johnson) took the chair at 11 a.m., and read prayers. DEATH OF SIR THOMAS EWING.",19
2,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I have just heard that Sir Thomas Ewing, who was long a member of this Parliament, died yesterday. He held office as Vice-President of the Executive Council and also as Minister for Defence, in two of Mr Deakin's Administrations, and many of us knew him intimately. I had the honour of knowing him for many years as a member of the Parliament of Kew South Wales, and he was also a member of the first Parliament of the Commonwealth. His sunny nature and amiable disposition endeared him to all. I think we might say with safety that he bad no enemies in politics. Although his circumstances were such that a life of leisure would have been more compatible with his disposition, he devoted himself with assiduity to politics, but his health suffered so seriously that he was compelled at length to retire. I desire to express my deep regret, as well as that of my colleagues and the Parliament generally, and to extend to the deceased gentleman's ' relations our ' sincere sympathy.",19
3,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I received a shock this morning when I learned that Sir Thomas Ewing had passed away. He was a member of this Parliament for something like, ten years, and we all. esteemed him for his genial nature. He had absolutely no personal enemies in this Parliament. While he did not spare his political opponents, his criticisms were always bright and breezy, and devoid of that sting whioh, unfortunately, is associated with much of our parliamentary dissertations. With the Prime Minister, I believe that his work as a member of this Parliament tended to shorten .his life. I am very sorry to hear of his death, which is another addition to the gaps that are steadily being made in the ranks of those of us who were members of the first Commonwealth Parliament. On behalf of the Opposition, which I have the honour to lead, I desire to extend to the deceased gentleman's relatives the most sincere sympathy in their sad bereavement.",19
4,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"May I add my expressions of regret to those which have fallen from.the lips of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. I was one of tbose who had the pleasure of knowing Sir Thomas Ewing personally, and as a member of this House. He was a member of the House of Representatives during the stirring days of the first eight or ten years of the Parliament, and although he was a really good fighter, he invariably fought with absolute fairness. No one could say that he ever took an fair advantage of an opponent, or that he uttered a word of hostile personal critimat., cism of a fellow member. It is characrier teristics such. as these that uplift public life of Australia. I , in common with honourable members generally, mourn Sir Thomas Ewing's death, and desire, behalf of my party, to extend to his relajournal."" tives and friends the most sincere symgentleman pathy. Mr AUSTI N CHAPMAN - I desire to endorse what has been said by the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, and the Leader of the Country party. The late Sir Thomas Ewing was an old colleague of mine. I knew him well; he was loved and respected by all. The better he was known the more he was liked. He was a loyal comrade and always ""played the game."" regret I have is that all too often we do not discover these good qualities in our fellows until after they have passed away. I hope that we shall endeavour to do so while they live, and try to recognise the good qualities of honourable members, no matter in what part of the House they may sit. "" Tom"" Ewing possessed the most amiable disposition, and I feel his death deeply. I warmly endorse the kindly remarks that have been made concerning him, and which will be conveyed to his friends.",19
5,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown," As a tribute of respect to the memory of our old colleague, I invite honourable members to rise in their places and remain standing for a few moments. Honourable members rose in their places. NA BILL.

6,Mr BURCHELL,SOVIET REPRESENTATIVE I N,"Has the attention un- - of the Prime Minister been drawn to a report published in the Argus of the 13 th that the honourable member for Bar-' had stated that the Commonwealth the Government had retained the salary attaching to the office of the representative in Australia of the Soviet of Russia, and on "" doubtless some of the funds of their If so, will the right honourable state whether the assertion is correct ?",20
7,Mr HUGHES,SOVIET REPRESENTATIVE I N,"I am sorry to have to say that it is incorrect. The straitened circumstances of the Government were such that a windfall of this sort would have been welcome. I learn for the first time, and with some surprise, that the Soviet Government is in a position to pay any salary to its officers in this country. One Speaking quite seriously, the statement is grossly inaccurate. The Government has not seized the salary referred to, and it is entirely ignorant of the circumstances of the Soviet representative. It has not seized his correspondence, and is not treating him differently from any other citizen. So far as I know, the facts are that he is treated .exactly the same as any other citizen of the Commonwealth. NA PAPER.",20
8,Mr GREGORY,DUTY ON NEWS PRINTING,"Since the Minister for Trade and Customs has found an opto revise the Tariff Schedule introduced during the present session,'I desire to ask him whether he has given any consideration to the request of a deputation representing the country newspapers of Australia, which recently waited upon him, and whether it will be possible for him to bring in an amended Schedule to give effect to that request?",20
9,Mr MASSYGREENE,DUTY ON NEWS PRINTING,"I have considered the request, and it will be' dealt with when I would point out to the honourable member that even if a lower duty were brought in for we should still be required, under the law, to collect the higher duty until such time as Parliament had altered the Schedule. Thus, no advantage would be gained by introducing at the present time an amended Schedule fixing a lower rate of duty. LOW FLYINGBY AEROPLANES.",20
10,Mr MARRS,DUTY ON NEWS PRINTING,"At the request of the Australian Aero Club, the Australian Jockey Club, Sydney, and the Avro Oompany at Mascot, I wish to bring under the notice of the Assistant Minister for Defence the disgracefully low flying which took place over Randwick a few days ago, when machines, I understand, were dropping leaflets from so low an altitude that all the horses in the boxes were terrified, and the people on the racecourse rushed for shelter. I derstand, that the honourable gentleman is President of the Air Board, and I ask whether these facts have been brought under his notice. Cannot something be done, pending the passing of the Air Regulations, to stop this low flying, which, undoubtedly, before long will produce a great tragedy in one of our capital cities?",21
11,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,DUTY ON NEWS PRINTING,"I shall see that the practice is immediately stopped. As soon as the A i r Council is definitely formed, regulations will , be issued to prevent anything of. the sort. EXPORT OF SHEEP-SKINS.",21
12,Mr RILEY,DUTY ON NEWS PRINTING,"Has the Prime Minister come to a decision as to the action to be taken by the Government to carry out the wish expressed, by the Conference held last week in regard to the export of sheep-skins? The men in the fellmongering trade are still out of employment. . I understand that the Prime 'Minister promised to bring in legislation dealing with the export of sheep-skins, and I desire to know Avhether that legislation will be introduced at an early date.",21
13,Mr HUGHES,DUTY ON NEWS PRINTING,"I am not aware that the course proposed by the Conference necessitates legislation. I desire, however, to make a statement for the information of the House, and to invite the criticism of all who are concerned in this mat- personal explanation. ter. On Friday last a Conference, consisting of representatives of every section of the wool industry-growers , brokers, tanners, wool scourers and fellmongers, exporters, wool-top manufacturers, spinners and employee!'-wa s held. question to be considered was the position ereated by the scarcity of skins,, added to the fact that many hundreds of men are now unemployed. The matter before the Conference was how to overcome that difculty of unemployment. It was decided, I think by thirty-two votes to eight, to recommend a scheme of this kind, namely, that all skins should pass through certain prescribed channels before being exported, and that the localbuyer should have an opportunity of purchasing at the world's price before the skins were exported. Now, that is the practice already-so we were.told-in the case of nine-tenths of the skins. As a matter of fact, there, was some difference of opinion un- upon this precise point, that is, as to whether the quantity comprised nine-tenths or seven-tenths. However, the local buyer does have a chancet now, and' it was decided, in order to°encourage the industry,, to give him the right, to secure all his requirements at the world's price. That sounds a perfectly fair proposition. The Conference was called to advise the Government. I bring this matter before the House now. I ought to have done so before, but failed, since the matter had escaped my attention. I invite honor1 able members to offer any criticism's and objection's which they may see fit to present, either on Tuesday or Wednesday next at the latest, so that the sense of Parliament may be gathered in regard to 1 the question. Honourable members will be able to gain precise accounts of the proposalsfrom the press of Saturday last, and from the hamoiable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett), the honourable member for Corio (Mr Lister), and the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr. Riley), who were present at the Conference. AH sections of the House should be able to get first-hand information from those gentlemen. PERSONAL EXPLANATION . PoSTMASTER-&BNERjt:L''s DEPARTMENT .",21
14,Mr HUGHES,DUTY ON NEWS PRINTING,"I desire to make a In the Age of yesterday there is a report of a speech delivered by myself in Geelong in which appear some statements attributed to myself but which I never made. Andi, since those particular remarks', as pubThe lished, reflect most grossly upon my colleague the Postmaster-General (Mr. Wise), I desire to correct them. I am at a loss to know how the report could have appeared in such shape. It statesHe had been speaking to the Postmaster General about telephonic communication; he did not like those people who came to and said that things could not be done. one could say that the Government did not pay a man £1,000 or £2,000 a year to say things like that. (Laughter.) What men were for was to say how to do the impossible. When subject. the Postmaster-General said it was .impossible to get wireless telephones and ordinary telephone wire in this country, he (' Mr Hughes) said, "" Go along and get them."" The result was that the Postinaster-IGeneral told him that afternoon that he was getting them. That report is like the curate's egg-it is good in parts. But I continued at some length to speak about experts. I was talking about experts-peopl e who come along and tell us that a thing cannot be done. As any one who 'has had experience of experts must know, they can be absolutely maddening; they can drive one to the verge of despair when telling one that a thing cannot be done. I said that I did not want people like that. My office boy could tell me that things cannot be done. I said I wanted a man who would say, "" Yes, this cannot be done, but I will tell you how to do it, and see that it is done."" This newspaper, no doubt, has been misled by some careless telegraphist in the Postmaster-General's Department. I am quite sure that the reporter would not have made such a mistake, and the idea that the editor or his staff has made it is, of course, absurd. Somehow ox other, however, the mistake has occurred, and I want to say most emphatically that it is one to which I take very serious exception, and to which my colleague, the Postmaster-General, also takes serious exception. I take this first opportunity to say that I was referring to the experts; and if those gentlemen have any ground of complaint concerning what I said I will deal with them in due course. KEW VARIE TY OF SEED WHEAT.",21
15,Dr MALONEY,DUTY ON NEWS PRINTING,"Will the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) follow up the courtesy which he showed to me some time ago in obtaining information concerning the wonderful variety of seed wheat known as Yeoman, which gives up to 96 bushels per acre? I ask the Minister if he will endeavour to obtain a supply of this variety from the Imperial Government for the use of the wheat-growing States of Australia.",22
16,Mr MASSYGREENE,DUTY ON NEWS PRINTING,I will have the matter him inquired into. I think it probable that Anythe agricultural experimental stations under the control of the various State paid Governments will have taken up . the PERSONAL EXPLANATION . CONSTBTJCTION OF FEDEBA ! CAPITAL .,22
17,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DUTY ON NEWS PRINTING,"I desire to make a personal explanation upon the subject of Canberra. In this morning's Age it is stated, in the course of a report, that, when the Treasurer (' Sir Joseph Cook) was speaking, the honourable member for Bass (Mr Jackson) made the interjection- "" It will be another twenty years before it is finished.""",22
18,Mr JACKSON,DUTY ON NEWS PRINTING,That is quite correct.,22
19,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DUTY ON NEWS PRINTING,"I am then reported as having said, also hy way of interjection- a most unusual thing for me to do, as honourable members know"" it will be fif ty years before we sit there."" t Mr FO'WLEB - Well , what is wrong with that? Mr AUSTI N CHAPMAN - I dare say the wish was father to the thought in the case of the Age; and I want to point out, by the way, that this is not a report appearing in the Queanbeyan Age, but in the Melbourne Age. What I said was that it would not be fifty weeks before we sat there; and I may add that that is still my opinion. I do not know whether I will be in order in concluding by saying that, if this House does its duty, I will prove to have been a true prophet.",22
20,Mr BELL,DUTY ON NEWS PRINTING,"B y way of personal explanation, and in justice to the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman), and also to the reporter for the Age, I desire to say that I waf sitting immediately behind the honourable member yesterday evening, and that it was I who made the interjection to the effect that it would be fifty years before we got to Canberra. WHEAT HARVEST. NA FARMERS.  gard to the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) that he was considering the question of payment for next season's wheat, I ask if he will specially consider the case of New South Wales, which has just recovered from two years' drought; and will he see if the whole of the 5s. guarantee can be given to the farmers of that State, who have had very great responsibilites thrown upon their shoulders as a result of the drought ?",22
21,Mr HUGHES,PAYMENT TO NEW SOUTH WALES,"The Government are considering the whole matter, and I would not like to forestall their conclusion. Honourable members are aware that we are likely to get a bumper harvest; possibly, indeed, a record crop. There are 37-J bushels to the ton, and it is probable there will be somewhere between 2,500,000 tons and 3,000,000 tons harvested. If honourable members care to multiply 37-J bushels by 5s., and to multiply that answer by 2,000,000 or 3,000,000-whic h .performance is beyond me-the y will realise that the amount of money involved will be quite considerable. My colleague, the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook), who has scarcely recovered from his endeavour to grapple with the serious financial position of the Commonwealth, will tell the House that it is no light thing to find £7,000,000 or £10,000,000 next January, for that is the least which we shall have to find during that mouth. However, we shall do what we can. I fully realise the position of the New South Wales farmers. The Government have considered that phase of the whole situation, and I will say that if anything can be done to give them special consideration it will be done.",23
22,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PAYMENT TO NEW SOUTH WALES,"The amount involved will be more than £30,000,000.",23
23,Mr HUGHES,PAYMENT TO NEW SOUTH WALES,"Honourable members will see what a thing it is to be a peripatetic ready reckoner. I could not do these things'. All the same, I think that the right honourable gentleman is wrong.  is over-estimating it .",23
24,Mr HUGHES,PAYMENT TO NEW SOUTH WALES,Whateve r can be done to give the New South Wales farmers special consideration will be done. NA PARLIAMENT.,23
25,Dr MALONEY,OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES OF,"I .desire to ask the Prime Minister for information, following up a question having to do with the salaries, bonuses, and promotions of officers and employees of - Parliament. Upon the occasion of my originally putting the matter before him, the Prime Minister courteously announced his sympathy with my purpose. I may tell him, however,' that I have been unable to obtain the information which I needed in reference to the Senate. Now that the Budget is before the House, I ask if honourable members should not be entitled to the information such as I have suggested, and in regard to the collection of which the Prime Minister was good enough to say that he supported me.",23
26,Mr HUGHES,OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES OF,"This is a matter that which, as I said before, is quite beyond my scope, and which rests with Mr. Speaker and the President of the Senate. I supported the request of the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney), and I again support his endeavour to secure the required particulars. Mr. Speaker was hot in the chair at the time, but Mr Deputy Speaker informed the honourable member that the information he required was available and could be supplied.",23
27,Dr MALONEY,OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES OF,"Yes , but only in reference to this House. The other gentleman "" up there "" will not supply the information, for obvious reasons.",23
28,Mr HUGHES,OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES OF,"Well , I cannot help the honourable member. I have no authority "" up there."" They will not listen to me. AUSTRALIAN NAVY.",23
29,Mr MCWILLIAMS,OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES OF,Has any report been received from the Imperial Navy which may be published in reference to the advisability of continuing in commission the vessels of the Australian Nnvv ?,23
30,Mr HUGHES,OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES OF,"The British Government have made certain suggestions as to the class of vessel that, if any selection had to be made, would be most useful in all the circumstances; but the honourable member will realise that everything; we do in connection with our naval defence must depend to a large extent on what the British Navy propose to do. Of ourselves we avail very little, and in turn the British naval authorities are considering the whole situation in the light of the experience gained during the Great War, and the fact that they are pressed by very great financial difficulties, and also with the knowledge that next year it is intended .to hold a Defence Conference, at which this matter will be considered. ATTITUDE OF SENATE.",23
31,Mr BRENNAN,OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES OF,"In view of the fact that in another place an adverse vote has been carried against the Government on .two important matters, namely, the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill and the Northern Territory Representation Bill , would an optimist be justified in concluding that this foreshadows a change of Government at an early date?",24
32,Mr HUGHES,OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES OF,"Havin g been out of the city yesterday I had not learned of these "" hostile decisions "" of another place, and the news comes to me as a positive ""bolt from the blue."" I thought that the honourable gentlemen "" up were quite content and happy, instead of which, apparently, they set about carrying resolutions against the Government. I have always been in favour of the bi cameral system, but my tolerance has its limits. I-can assure the honourable member that tliere is no fear of a dissolution of this House, and that if the honourable gentlemen in another place continue as they are doing, I do not see why we should not submit the questions at issue direct to the people. - NUMERA LS ONHANSAED VOLUMES.",24
33,Dr MALONEY,OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES OF,"In view of the fact that the forms of the House will not permit me to give notice of the question which I desire to ask, I must request Mr . Speaker to be courteous enough to furnish me with an answer to it-without notice. My question is as follows:-Will Mr . Speaker have the numbering of the bound volumes of Hansard printed in Arabic numerals, which are far more simple than Latin numerals, as can be seen, for in stance, when we compare 88 with LXXXVII 1 . ? I defy any mathematician to multiply CCCXLV. CCCXXXIL, using Roman throughout. It seems to me that we should follow the example of the State Parliaments, and make use of the more up-to-date and scientific Arabic system of numbering our Hansard volumes.",24
34,Mr SPEAKER,OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES OF," The system of numbering volumes of Hansard has been in existence from the beginning of this Parliament, but as the Hansard reports are not confined to this branch of the Legislature, the matter to which the honourable'member refers would naturally have to be  sonally, I think there is a good deal to be said in favour of the honourable member's contention, and the method of numbering, suggested by him, is used in connection with the House of Commons debates. At the same time. I can see one advantage to honourable members in our system, because an honourable member who is anxious to make an embarrassing quotation from another honourable member's speech, perhaps long since forgotten, and recorded in a bound volume of Hansard, may occasionally be restrained from doing so by a contemplation of the formithere"" dable numerals of which the honourable member has just given as an example. < CRITICISM OF BUDGET .",24
35,Mr WEST,OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES OF,"No doubt I somewhat offended the Treasurer yesterday afternoon by interjecting when he was delivering his Budget. I would like to ask him what he thinks of the leading articles in this morning's newspapers, particularly that in the Age, criticising his Budget?",24
36,Sir JOSEPH COOK,OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES OF,I did not pursue the task of reading the whole of that criticism. A little of it was quite enough. FEDERAL CAPITAL. ISSUE OF BONDS-LEASEHOL D TENURENA SOLDIERS IN BUIT-DING TRADES.,24
37,Mr MARR,VOCATIONAL TRAINING OF RETURNED,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Whether the Government will favourably consider the question of issuing Canberra bonds, similar to those issued for the building of the city of Guernsey, and thus afford the people of Australia an opportunity to invest their money in the building of neeessary administration and parliamentary offices at Canberra? 2. In view of the fact that all land in the by Federal Territory is the property of the Comfigures monwealth, will the , Government afford an early opportunity to the House of discussing the system of leasehold under which business or private people may acquire land at Canberra I",24
38,Mr HUGHES,VOCATIONAL TRAINING OF RETURNED,The answer to the honourable member's questions is as folallotted as follows:lows :1 and 2. An opportunity for discussing these matters will be afforded in connection with the Estimates.,25
39,Mr MARR,VOCATIONAL TRAINING OF RETURNED,"the Prime Minister, upon notice-Whether, in view of the great shortage of labour, the Government will take into consideration the question of vocationally training a number of returned soldiers at Canberra, where, it is alleged, (a) that there are almost 1,000,000 bricks ready for use; (6) that there is a brick-works capable of turning out some of the best bricks in Australia; and (c) that there is a vast quantity of other building material available?",25
40,Mr HUGHES,VOCATIONAL TRAINING OF RETURNED,"The matter .will be lines considered by the Minister for Repatriaapproved, tion. TELEPHONE SERVICES, NEW SOUTH WALES.",25
41,Mr MARRS,VOCATIONAL TRAINING OF RETURNED,"the Postmaster General, upon notice I. What amount of money is estimated by the Postmaster-General's Department to be required for new works to place the telephone services on a satisfactory footing in South Wales? 2. What amount was asked in this connection for 1920-1921; what amount is provided on the Estimates, and how it is allotted? 3. What amount has already been expended by commitments? 4. What is the estimated cost of providing panies additional switchboards at the new automatic exchange in Sydney, and has the provision been made for the same? 5. If not, what provision is being made to is 2.a To meet the public requirements there? 6. What provision has been made for increasing the service in country districts? 7. How many additional trunk lines are refollows:quired for properly handling country business in New South Wales? 8. Are these lines good nnancial propositions, and how many can be built out of the amount being provided this financial year? 9. Is provision being made for an additional Sydney-Melbourne trunk line? 10. Is it a fact that all essential material can be procured if funds are provided to enable tenders to be accepted?",25
42,Mr WISE,VOCATIONAL TRAINING OF RETURNED,"The answers to the hon the orable member's questions are as folSecretary low :1. It is impossible to state the amount quired unless the honourable member intimates whether his question simply refers to the existing telephone service or includes all applied for, including trunk lines. 2. £380,460 was provided, and has been i . £ Telegraphs .. .. 9,460 Telephones .. .. 117,000 New trunk' lines .. . . 30,000 Switchboards .. . . 39,000 Cables and conduits .. 183,000 Miscellaneous .. .. '2,000 In addition to the amount of. £380,460, the Treasurer has agreed to the acceptance of tenders for further material which will be paid for this financial year. He also agrees to the inviting of tenders for material to be paid for in 1921-22, up to a total of £500,000. 3. Approximately, £43,000 has been expended by commitments. 4. £81,784. The Treasurer has concurred in the tenders being accepted. 5. See answer to No. 4. 6. £3,750. This will enable about fifteen to be erected. Twenty-five others are and are dependent upon material coming to hand, to obtain which steps are now being taken. 7. This will involve considering' the whole of the country business of New South Wales, and will take some time to ascertain. 8. See answer to No. 7. 9. Additional facilities are being provided between Sydney and Melbourne.. 10. Yes; but deliveries are subject to delay, owing to the quantity of material which has to be obtained abroad and to the abnormal New demands which are being made upon manufacturers. WAR GRATUITY BONDS.",25
43,Mr MARRS,VOCATIONAL TRAINING OF RETURNED,"the Treasurer, upon notice I. Is it a fact that certain approved commay cash war gratuity bonds to an unlimited extent, whilst private individuals, solely with a view to assisting returned men, neeessary are greatly limited? how many bonds and to what amount private individual restricted?",25
44,Sir JOSEPH COOK,VOCATIONAL TRAINING OF RETURNED,"The answer to the honourable member's questions is as 1 and 2. In accordance with the Prime Minister's promise, employers and some trading firms and companies have permission to cash bonds, under certain conditions, to an unlimited extent. In the case of applications by private individuals, the registrars' of war gratuity bonds at the Sub-Treasuries in the capital cities may permit not more than ten bonds to be cashed by any one person.' Where a person desires to cash more than ten bonds, matter must be specially referred to the to the Treasury for consideration. The average amount of ten bonds would be about £800. reI may explain that many people have been, endeavouring to transfer bonds in services bulk, more particularly traders and others who have accumulated them. War Service Homes. ' There are always plenty of persons in the community ready to take these bond's in bulk, for the simple reason that they get a splendid investment, free of taxa' tion. Of course, we cannot permit that. WAR SERVICE HMS. Dr EARLE PAGE asked the Minister representing the Minister for Repatriation, wpon notice I.

If so, will an opportunity be given to discuss the matter, and when? 3. Will the Government also give the House an opportunity of disdissing proportional representation for the election of members to [17 SEPTEMBER, 1920.] League o j Nations. 4733 the proposed, Convention for the amendment of the Constitution, so that such, amendment or amendments shall have the advantage of discussion from various important stand-points before their submission to the people for ratification?",26
47,Mr HUGHES,PROPORTIONAL,The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1 and 2. This matter is still under the consideration of the Government. 3. I have ah-eady intimated in the House that the method of electing representatives to the proposed Convention will be decided by Parliament when the Bill authorizing the Convention is before it. SUPERANNUATION SCHEME. APPLICATI ON TO NAVAL FORCES.,26
48,Mr MARRS,PROPORTIONAL,"the Minister for Treasurer, the Navy, upon notice Whether the superannuation scheme for the set Commonwealth Public Service recently recomferred to in the press, and reported to include the Military Forces, will also apply to the conditions as reNaval Forces?",26
49,Mr HUGHES,PROPORTIONAL,The scope of the proposed superannuation scheme is still e manner in under consideration. LEAGUE OF NATIONS . NA GENEVA CONFERENCE - COMMONWEALT HFINANCEANDTRADE - AUS TRALIA HOUSE - IMMIGRATION .,26
50,Mr HUGHES,REPRESENTATIO N AT,"Bendigo-Prime M in ister and Attorney-General) [11.43] (By leave) - Some time ago i i was publicly announced that the Assembly of the League of Nations intended to hold its first session at Geneva on the 17th November next, and in reply to questions put to me in the House I stated that the Commonwealth Government would be represented thereat. Since that time a Representation number of suggestions have been made, and much advice has been given to the Government, as to how the Commonwealth should be represented. It has now been decided that Senator'- Mille n shall attend the Conference as the representative of Australia, and take with him competent official assistance, in the person of Mr Knowles, an officer under Sir Robert .Garran, in the office of the Attorney-General. I have had the opportunity of knowing Mr Knowles for very many years, and I can say that, excepting only Sir Robert Garran, a more competent man cloes not exist in the Commonwealth Service. If I .were going myself to Geneva I do not think I could select a man upon whom I could rely with more confidence. Senator Millen will also take with him M . Chevassu, formerly on the foreign editorial staff of the London Times, who has made Imperial politics his study, is familiar with all the proceedings of the Peace Conference and the League of Nations, and an accomplished linguist. hardly point out to honourable members the importance to Australia of the League of Nations. The whole world now is in a state of flux, and the League of Nations, by its advice and by its power, can exercise a potent influence on our destinies. As honourable members know, the mandates have not been officially issued, and many questions relating to our quota of defence, to the means by which the world's peace shall be maintained, and disease, labour troubles, and other matters dealt with the world over, are in the hands of this, the only international body that has, as it were, the sanction of law behind it. This League, of course, has yet to prove itself competent to deal with all the great questions that are intrusted to it, but its influence already is considerable. Australia is a signatory to the Covenant, and, perhaps, has more to lose than any other na-' tion from the deliberations of the Conference. Many of the things for which our , soldiers fought have not yet, as it were, crystallized and assumed so definite a shape as to preclude the possibility of such alterations as would be fatal to our interests. I do not know any man who is more competent to represent the Commonwealth at this great world gathering than my friend and colleague, Senator Millen. He will go to this Conference with a clear understanding that he represents this Parliament and this country on those questions. On certain of the questions to which I have alluded in a general way there is no room for difference of opinion. We cannot have any difference of opinion - w e cannot listen to any one who speaks about any encroachment on the principle of a White Australia. Senator Millen, who holds the Australian view, recognises that fact clearly. There are other mattors on the agenda paper 'which leave any amount of room for difference of opinion, and as to these, of course, Senator Millen will exercise his own discretion. Mr Hughes. honourable gentleman will leave Australia towards the end of this month. How long the sittings at Geneva will continue it is impossible to say, but at their conclusion Senator Millen will proceed to London in order to deal with matters of great public importance, which, unhappily, have not been dealt with owing to the resignation of the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt). Senator I need Millen will take up the questions of finance where that honourable member dropped them. He will deal with questions of trade and trade organizations, and will also make such recommendations and effect such alterations in the organization of the High Commissioner's office as are considered desirable. Of course, I am expressing my opinion as a private member-bu t other honourable members have been to England during the last two years and are able to judge for themselveswhen I say that there are far too few Australians in Australia House-fa r too few. I think it is essential, if we are to have an Australia House which really represents Australia, to have the staff continually refreshed by new drafts of blood from Australia. These men, after serving at Australia House for a period, will return to Australia and others take their places, in this way maintaining touch with Australia.",26
51,Mr TUDOR,REPRESENTATIO N AT,It would be a good thing if we adopted the same principle in the Customs Department.,27
52,Mr HUGHES,REPRESENTATIO N AT,Quite so.,27
53,Mr BRENNAN,REPRESENTATIO N AT,"Will the High Commissioner be an Australian, pursuant to that policy?",27
54,Mr HUGHES,REPRESENTATIO N AT,"No ; there are limits. I do not think we could get a man to go to England to take up the duties of High Commissioner, and to come back just as a public servant does to Tesume his place in the Public Service. When a gentleman goes to Australia House as High Commissioner he has divested himself of his political opportunities in order to take up the position, and when he returns he divests himself of that office and all that the office means. There must be some continuity of policy, and, to that end, discretion must be exercised; but, subject to that, the principle I have laid down is, I think, a sound one. I come now to another matter with which Senator Millen will also have to The deal. I have spoken in this place several times on. the necessity for immigration, and I referred to it when outlining defence policy of the Commonwealth. I said that 5,000,000 people can neither fend this country nor develop it , and that be immigrant learns the facts. the remedy for this is more men. The Government have decided to take up the question of immigration, and put it ward with vigour on a bold and comprethe hensive scale, believing that in no other - way can we hope for any success. The Commonwealth and States came to an derstanding during the recent conferences - for there were several-in regard ' immigration, an understanding that,. think , will commend itself to honourable members. The States agree that it is that one authority should have control the other end, and any one who looks at the matter fair l y will say that it that one authority should speak for tralia-that there should not be six or - seven competing authorities talking about - particular States. I do-not think honourable members quite realise the profundity of the ignorance of the Britisher in gard to Australia. He speaks of Auskind, tralia as if it were a kind of place to covered in a day's walk, and he talks about "" the c l i m at e"" of the country. may say that I have been colder in this country than I ever remember to have been in England; indeed, I have been half frozen to death here. We can find any kind of climate in Australia, and the interior I have found it colder than any other country I know of.",27
55,Dr MALONEY,REPRESENTATIO N AT,That is nonsense!,28
56,Mr HUGHES,REPRESENTATIO N AT,"I shall not go further into that question, merely suggesting that, in order to test the question, orable member has only to camp out, put his feet outside his tent at night, see how he gets on. What we have to tell the people of Britain is the t r u t about Australia. I have read some cumstances of the country. of the prospectuses and highly-coloured statements about Australia, and rose f r their perusal convinced that they did not new country. present a fair and accurate picture'of this country. We do not desire to bring trained people here under false pretences, and, therefore, we must tell them the truth. The truth is neither that pessimistic wail we hear on the one hand nor those glowharvest. ing eulogies we hear on the other. cannot induce people to come out here on difficult to offer inducements the merits of the country, it is better should stay away - We do not wish to to have disappointed men who complain that the they have been induced to come here under false pretences; therefore, the first dething we propose is to see that the wouldIt matters nothing to the Commonwealth whether immigrants go to Tasmania or to forQueensland. Now, as to the number and kind of immigrants we desire. . Some of the States, of course, are circumstanced quite differently from others: but Queensunland and Western Australia have authorized the Commonwealth to get as many to immigrants as possible-the y will take all I we can bring. As to the kind of people we desire, when I put forward the views well of the Labour party on immigration I at said what I believed to be true, namely, that to throw on the labour market a huge is better mass of immigrants without regard to the Ausrequirements of urban industries is to create conditions that will prove most unfortunate. A community can digest only so many newcomers in a given time, reand those newcomers must be of the right and must be put in the right places. be And the right kind of preparations must be made for them. The first essential of this I country is land settlement; therefore, our efforts must be directed towards getting men to go on the land. As honourable members know, the British Government have offered to pay the fares of ex-service in men to any part of the Empire up to, I in think, the 31st December this year, and we are negotiating with a view to the extension of that period, so that we _ may have the advantage of the continued co-operation of the British authorities. We do not propose to stop at trying to inan honduce British ex-service men to come to Australia, but to extend the invitation to and all healthy men, young men particularly, including lads and youths, for plastic h youth can adjust itself readily to the cirWhen a man is set in his course of life, it is very o m difficult to make anything of him in a I think it will be found in practice extremely difficult to attract agriculturists from Britain.

Then there is the farmer himself. He has had a bad on the soil. harvest in England this year, and if we listen to him we shall hear exactly same kind of story as we hear in Austrasible lia. We shall endeavour to attract who have had experience on the land, and have some capital. Honourable memlia. bers must not suppose that rhe farmer here is different from the farmer elsewhere. The farmer never well. I visited my own people in Wales, and listened to the most melanthose choly tales. Yet they were all right; they were getting 16s. per bushel for wheat, and, after all, that is not a price. Of course, they might have ceived more, but they were doing very well. I do not expect that we shall tract very many agriculturists, but I hope ment we shall induce men with small capital come here, and also plenty of young on tine threshold of life. They are the of men we want. They can be moulded to the circumstances of Australia, and bued with progressive ideas. This country must go ahead, and to do that successfully it must have men in abundance. It can-not have too many men, provided they of the right type and are set down in right place. Organization is clearly wanted at this end. The States must do their part, and we have arranged with them that each shall say how many men and what kind of men it will take. the best guarantee against any State being swamped with the wrong kind of labour. Then we must see that public opinion educated as to the necessity for immigration. We cannot allow a "" dog-in-thebe manger"" policy to rule this country. There are many quite well-meaning men Australia. who have a perverted idea of the fundasay, mental facts of economics. They that the fewer the men here, the more work there will be. That is not so. Work increases with the growth of population. If there were no other men coming forward, employment would be duced to the level of that on Robinson Crusoe's Island.

It is a most lamentable thing that one cannot introduce any question in this Chamber without honourable members treating it on party lines. I was endeavoring to deal with this matter honestly and on its merits. I place the facts before the House in order that honourable members may know that the Government are going on with this scheme. They believe in immigration, and every man who loves Australia knows it to be [196] essential for the country's development and defence. The success of this scheme depends upon, not only obtaining the right kind of men, but transporting them to this country, and dealing with them efficiently when they arrive. That in itself will require a very effective organization on this side. To both these phases of the question the Government propose to direct their attention. Senator Millen, during the period he will be in England, will do what he can to give effect to this movement, and we hope that as a result of this policy there will be a large influx of desirable settlers to Australia. They will do very much for us in four ways-the y will lighten our burden of taxation, they will produce more wealth, they will help to defend Australia, and they will help to develop it. That, broadly, is our policy. I hope What that at the Geneva Conference we shall see that the interests of Australia are safeguarded, as I feel perfectly sure they will be in the hands of so competent a representative as my friend and colleague, Senator Millen.",30

But the granting of leave is entirely in the control of the House, .177(1 one objection would have been sufficient to prevent the Prime Minister from speaking.

[12.15] - I was not aware that the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) was going to make a statement on this subject this morning, and was temporarily absent from the chamber when he rose. I realise that the representation of Australia at the Geneva Conference is absolutely essential. We must be represented there. The. right honourable gentleman has said that there can he no question of party so far as the policy of a White Australia is concerned, and that honourable members on all sides of the House are pledged to that policy. I sincerely hope that Senator Millen will .voiqe the emphatic opinion of Australia as a whole upon, that question, and will' insist that there must beno departure from that policy^ which was practiea'lly laid down by this Parliament as far back as. 19.02.",31
76,Mr MAKIN,REPRESENTATIO N AT,The delegation should be representative of both sides of the House.,31
77,Mr TUDOR,REPRESENTATIO N AT,"I do not intend to deal with that phase of the question. I should not have risen but for the statement made by the Prime Minister that Mr. J. T. Barnes is, to proceed to Great Britain as an immigration agent on behalf of the CommonwealthAccording to the press reports, Mr Barnes is. one of the delegatesto the Conference of the National party now sitting, and, as an Englishman who, has spent ten or a. dozen years in Australia,, he is. to proceed to the Old Country to, tell the people of the coojditions prevailing here. I hope it will not. b.e assumed that, honourable members of the Labour party acquiesce in the proposal; that he shall represent Australia. The responsibility rests with the Government. I certainly protest against Mr Barnes being' sent to England in this capacity. I am personally friendly with him, but he is as bitterly opposed politically to me as is anyhonorable member opposite. cannot be said that he will be able to fitly represent Australia. There are Australians who know as much about Australia as do any of our citizens whocome from overseas. It wasmy privilege as an Australian, to work in both England, and the. United States of America; but because I had worked in England for four years, could it be said that I was qualified to represent England in Australia, and to put forward here the ideals of the people of Great Britain? I think not. Many Australians who have been connected with the Immigration Departments of the Various States might fitly represent the Commonwealth as immigration agents in the Old Country. Having regard to the ' enormous shortage of houses in all our capital cities, it will behove the Government to go slow in the matter of immigration. Indiscussing the War Serviee Homes Bill yesterday,. I mentioned that returned soldiers had had their homes sold over their heads, and that they and their uniforms and belongings had been, thrown into the street. In such circumstances, it is imperative that Australia should proceed slowly in the matterof immigration. I protest against the selection of Mr. Barnes for the position of Immigration* Agent, since I believe that there are thousands of Australians who could better fill the position. WAR SE'RVIGE HMS.

We have just heard* from the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes') that it is proposed to bring out from the. Old Country as many ex-service men and their families as can be attracted to our shores. I do pot object to that. I do It not object to a scheme of immigration that will attract to Australia the right class of people,, whetherthey ajre ex-service men. or not;, but, to bring people here, w-hen our returned wen.,, i some «in theStatesat. least, casmot secjsffe ttae laffld that was promised them.,, would be. an almost criminal act. It would be cruel to those who were induced to come here, and unfair to our returned soldiers. Those who have had anything to do with 'the settlement of - our boys on - the land in New South Wales - know that the money we have advanced for this purpose to the State Government has not resulted in anything like the adequate settlement of our men. The cost per head has been tremendous. I propose to give a few illustrations of the position in New South Wales. On one occasion I was requested by a couple of returned soldiers to inspect some soldier settlement blocks - in a certain district. I have - a knowledge of the coastal country, and I do not hesitate to say that the officers who were responsible for the scheme to put returned soldiers on that piece' of land ought not - to rem'aim in 'office for another five - minutes. I found that it consisted of heavy (forest country. The best timber had been cut - out of it by the saw-millers, and it would take a l if e-'time to 'Clear the lanfl of the rubbish that was left. Even if it were cleared it would not graze one bullock to the block, mtneh 'less a bullock to '2 or 3 acres. That is the -'sort - of country which is 'being ''offered to some of our boys. I learned that a returned soldier who had taken up one of these blocks was killed while - removing one of the trees, and that his wife and child, with her aged father, were living in a small bark hut on the selection, having been advised, no 'doubt by the Local 'Committee, to hang on to it - until some other returned 'soldier 'cotild be persuaded to : take it over anii p'ay for the improvements. Thi's is - what is being done wil5i the money we advance to the States to assist in soldier - settlement. 'Our boys are being misled. Mr Laird SSHT^--That is not experience i h Tasmania.",31

In another case a returned soldier was urged to 'take up what 'was described a'S am irrigation block, but according to 'the report of a Local Committee the water could be brought on to only 2 acres of the Whole block. We are constantly boasting of what we ""are doing with resDect to tihe settlement of returned soldiers on the land, but in .my .judgment there has been [196]-S ' no real attempt in New .South Wales to settle returned soldiers on the Hand in the way intended by this Parliament ""when We agreed that advances for that purpose should be made to the - State Governments. I could cite 'other cases in respect of which most peculiar decisions have been given by the Department. In one 'case 'a returned soldier proposed, through the Department, to purchase for £3 per acre a block immediately adjoining a dairy farm for which £10 per acri was asked. His application, however, was turned down by the Department on the ground that the land, although surrounded with dairy farms, was not suitable for dairy farming purposes. One wonders at the - reason for such occurrences. Our returned men are not being settled on the land.",32

Mr Rodgers - That is not so. 'The pr'm'cipal Act and this amending Bil l have ""no relation to land 'settlement not to 'the erection of homes on broad acres.. The land settlement scheme is purely an arrangement made between the - Commonwealth and the States, - under which the Commonwealth contributes a certain amount of .money for the purpose. The whole administration of that scheme, im'our cJuding the erection of homes oti broad acres, is - left with the .States. Mr W5ATKINS,- I commend the Government 'for what - they tare 'doing under the principal Act, and I - urge that special attention be given to the land settlement scheme which they .are - carrying out in conjunction with the - States.

The returned - men Would like to secure grants - to enable them Hso build homes of any kind they desired so long, of course, as they did not seek to involve Department to a greater extent than the amount advanced. I realise that '' boys'' should be looked after and prothat tected against exploitation; but hardship is being inflicted because the Department is sticking; too closely to its plans for home building, and has been refusing apthis plications from those who desire to according to private plans. I have in .not mind one case in which a man did not want a house of the type and size prowork posed by the Department, and had prothe vided himself with a plan to meet his own views. However, because the Department was not prepared to accept the private specifications his application was not proved of. A f t e r all, these men have to pay for and live in these homes themon selves, and they should have some say the general scheme of building.",32

84,Mr WATKINS,REPRESENTATIO N AT,"Generally , I agree with that; but there is no reason why «ound individual, private plan should be accepted, or why, because a soldier does not care to build on the lines promedal, posed by the Department, his application for an advance should be disapproved. Numbers of homes have been erected - the vicinity of Cessnock, but returned men will have nothing to do with them. These bouses do not appeal to them. It was mentioned to me some days ago by rethe turned soldiers that in the building homes staffs of, say, twenty carpenters are employed, among whom are four forehomes. men.",33
85,Mr RILEY,REPRESENTATIO N AT,"But those four would be working alongside the others, and would be getting only a matter of Is. or so more a day. That is the usual practice.",33
86,Mr WATKINS,REPRESENTATIO N AT,"I am not familiar with the usual practice, but it appears me that four overseers among twenty men are more than is necessary.",33
87,Mr RODGERS,REPRESENTATIO N AT,"In utilizing returned soldier labour it must not be forgotten that it is not, perhaps, of a highly-skilled type, and that these artisans might quire a little more supervision.",33
88,Mr WATKINS,REPRESENTATIO N AT,"That may be so. I the am in agreement with those portions of the Bill which are intended to widen our the scope of the original Act. I notice benefits are to be advanced to persons who represented the Young Men's Christian Association abroad. I do not object to that ; but I want to know why legislation should stop at the Young build Men's Christian Association? Why are representatives of similar services also to be included? Was not equally good done abroad by representatives of Salvation Army ? To give special preference to the members of one individual body will create discontent. While our fighting men may not have said anything apdepreciative of the Young Men's Christian Association, in the matter of its activities behalf of soldiers on the fighting in fronts, I know that they have spoken in far more appreciative terms of services rendered by members of the Salvation Army. This measure proposes te draw an Salvation A r m y representatives did their work in a of different way from members of the Young take care Men's Christian Association.

91,Mr CORSER,REPRESENTATIO N AT,"Wide Bay) [12.42] - I agree that this Bill is an improvement upon the original Act. From what I have seen of the construction of War Service Homes in the neighbourhood of Melbourne I can compliment the Minister concerned, to and his Commissioner, upon the very good work done and upon the reasonable cost. The honourable member for Yarra (Mr Tudor) pointed out that the Commissioner insured the cottages erected by the Department. I do not object to rethat. In fact, it is a very good movement, and is similar to what is generally done by firms .which carry their own in surance. The honourable .member, however, attempted tb make ont, following an interjection by myself,' that I against the action of the Department in effecting these insurances. The honorto able member endeavoured to draw an in analogy between what was done by the Department and the action of the Queensance land Government in creating a State I surance Department. I interjected that the. savings made by that Department were not effected merely by the fact creation by the Government. There other reasons, - one of the chief of which was that the Queensland Government must compelled every'person who had to insure under the Workmen's Compensation to do so through the State Department. Thus, aState monopoly was created. Formerly, the ' BUgar-growers had had their own co-operative. companies. the purpose - of effecting insurances under the Workmen's Compensation Act. As the risks were small, these companies made big profits, and at the end of year were able to divide a large surplus among their shareholders. But they cannot do that at the present time, because premiums previously paid to their comcareful pany now go into the State insurance scheme. Furthermore, the State makes imperative on householders to insure their domestic servants against accident, &c., under the Workers' Compensation Act. There is no risk attached!to this class of .insurance; in fact, 1I have n.ever heard of a claim for workers' compensais tion being made by a domestic servant, take. or that one has ever, suffered sufficiently to justify such , a claim. I look upon compulsion as representing so much money which is extracted from the public for the purpose of building up a revenue for* this State enterprise, thus making it very much easier to duce the rate of insurance on property on which there is risk. Again, the Queensland Government compel every municipality, shire council, central mill, hospital, or other institution dowed by Government funds to insure through the State Insurance Department. This also gives the Government scheme tremendous pull, .enabling it to reduce the rates on certain classes of property. Mr Ryan,-Do not forget that the Queensland fund meets the claim whether the premium has been paid or not.",33
92,Mr CORSER,REPRESENTATIO N AT,"I know,- as a matter . - of fact, that the Rockhampton municipality, some time ago, was asked to pay was to the State insurance scheme £100 a year more than it was paying previously a private company. I understand that the case of large companies or corporations, it was the practice of many insurcompanies to make a considerable ren - duction in their schedule rates by commission as agents, Bub-agents, or directors, so that their premiums were often lower of its than the flat rate which was charged were under the Government sehome.",34
93,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIO N AT,The honourable member not forget at the same time that the Act amount of compensation payable was increased by 75 per cent.,34
94,Mr CORSER,REPRESENTATIO N AT,"That may be so. No doubt, Borne persons may have benefited for by the Queensland Government scheme, but in very many cases the insurance premium was paid to cover practically no risk - It was unfair for the Leader of the the Opposition (MT . Tudor) yesterdaj to .quote' a few isolated cases, as he did. the Some insurance companies are very about certain risks, possibly more careful than a State Department would it be - However, I am making these remarks now tojustify my interjection of yesterday. I am hot opposed to the War Serviee Homes Commissioner carrying out his own insurance. As a matter of fapt, in the circumstances, T think it quite-the'-proper course for him to A great deal has heen said by the honthis orable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) about the recent acquisition of certain saw-mills and timber areas in Queensland.

He went all round the subject without sugar making any distinct charge. He said enthat a letter was missing. That letter is not missing, noT is it a communication which would have had the slightest effect a on the transaction. Apparently,' it is a letter sent, by MT . Brett, or some other person, which did not Teach either the Commissioner or the Minister. Honourable members interjecting,",34
95,Mr CORSER,REPRESENTATIO N AT,"If honourable men* hers, instead of interrupting, would allow' - me to continue, they would more easily appreciate the point I wish to make. I - know nothing ahout this deal except what .the Minister has stated, and what is contained in the papers laid on the table, 1 - do not know whether the transaction is a good or bad one.. The saw-mills in - question are not in my electorate, and - I have no more interest in the matter than has any other honourable member. However, I do regard it as the duty of this House to seo that justice is done. The War .Service Homes Commissioner, wbo had .been given authority to construct so many thousands of houses, had to consider how best lie eould go about building them. He found that under the system of buying timber from dHy to day or week to week prioes were constantly jumping up against him. I h one instance, where he made an arrangement with millers to receive a rebate of 5 per cent,., the price of the timber had been raised by 10 per cent, within a month. As a matter of fact, tLe increase in the price of timber is largely due to the fact that royalty payable to - the Queensland Goverument for timber standing in the scrub bas been increased to 20s. or more per 100 foot. Queensland Government are not to 'blunie, but they submit the blocks for - competition, with a fixed minimum royalty of, say, 5s. per 100 feet, and if the' people who are competing, lo' secure - the blocks are willing to run the upset price up to 20s. per 100 feet, of course they can do so.",34
96,Mr BAYLEY,REPRESENTATIO N AT,"What is the upset price at present? Mr CORSER,- I do not know. It ""was not s.case of lookingat prospective orders. The War Serviee Homes* miarioner had instructions from ""this Parproperties? liament to build these houses as well and as cheaply as possible, and no one who has hnd experience in business would that it was not better to buy a krge quantity of timber at a cheaper rate than would be secured by buying from hand to mouth, 'especially when there was frequently arise-in prices. The Oomzoiscovered rmnsr, realizing that rome - finality must be reached, and in his attempt to : out his instruction to build tliese homes as nearly as possible at a cost of £700 each, concluded that he could not do so .unless he could insure an ample supply of timber at a certain price. 2Tohe of the millers would make a contraot with him. They would simply sell from month to month. Periodically they meet and decide upon the price they will charge.for their output, and the rate goes up accordingly, the Commissioner, among others, being obliged to pay the higher prices. He acted wisely, therefore, in purchasing these saw-mills, always provided that be got them a't a fair price. The only method of ascertaining whether the price paid was fair is by seeing who reported upon the value of the timber as it stood in the bush, and upon the machinery in the mills, and who checked the reports thus received, and by finding out if they were competent to present a fair report. In the first place the Commissioner approached the Queensland forestry Department, and secured thi; servicesof 'their best man, who valued the timber, and made - certain recommendations. Then the Commissioner obtained a man or men to place a value on the machinery in the mills and the plant. Afterwards consideration was given to The the effect of having two mills working alongside one another on adjacent blocks. It was evidently decided that more ecouomical work could be done by two mills working . htrge blocks of timber country side by side and using the one management than could be achieved by establishing two widely separated nulla with different controls. Furthermore, the timber would not need to be carted such a long distance .as would be the case if there were two separately managed mills.",35
97,Mr RYAK,REPRESENTATIO N AT,Did Millars have the opComportunity of selling any of their,35
98,Mr CORSER,REPRESENTATIO N AT,"I suppose so, but. I do not think they would be likely to sell. I say do not - think offers would be obtained from any millers except those circumstanced as'Messrs. Lahey and Brett were. These men went out into the scrub yw.rs very ago, und took up blocks of 10,000 acres with' splendid pine. They also secured the timber rights on other blocks, carry and leases of other blosks when the royalty was probably 4s. or 5s. per 100 feet, and now that it has jumped to 20$. per 100 feet, surely they have an unearned increment of an enormous amount which they may be .prepared to vend as long the purchaser, is willing to give them a it and l'5s., a very good profit. considerable portion of the enhanced value of their timber.",35
99,Unknown,REPRESENTATIO N AT,Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m.,36
100,Mr CORSER,REPRESENTATIO N AT,"We must distinguish between saw-mill proprietors like Messrs. Lahey and Brett and. other lessees of timber areas. These men, in the fied, first instance, went out into the back blocks and secured large areas of beautiful pine and other timber,' more as a speculation than as. an ordihis nary trading proposition; and, as the price of timber has been rising considercould, ably, they have been in a position to mand a substantial sum in the nature the unearned increment;.. Apparently they were satisfied to sell out, instead carrying on business permanently on own account. In my own electorate there are to be found some of the largest and most up-to-date saw-mills i h Australia, the proprietors of which are. prepared to stantly go on. do legitimate business by supplying timthe ber requirements, not only within my own State, but in other States' as well. Thoy are doing a very successful business, but they avoid any risk of at a lower price than that at which they oould replace their stocks of standing timber by selling only from month to month.",36
101,Mr TUDOR,REPRESENTATIO N AT,I presume the honourable member is speaking of saw-millers genement rally?,36
102,Mr CORSER,REPRESENTATIO N AT,"Yes . I am referring to the saw-mill owners in my own electorpractical ate. They are not prepared to sell all their stocks at once, because, if they that, they would not be in a position to supply orders, which are flowing in f r day to day. The difference between the one penny. two classes of timber millers is clearly illustrated. The One class is satisfied 'take advantage of the rise in timber I prices already ascertained; the other to' convey the .impression that prefers to carry on business on a perproper manent basis. . The rise in timber values is probably anything from 3s. or 4s. up to 20s. standing, and they offered to sell - it at 15s. per 100 feet standing. A lot the same class of timber in the bulk Queensland cannot be bought at less than from 17s. to 22s.; but Messrs. Lahey Brett, apparently were prepared to sacrifice this prospect, and to be satisfied with the as difference between whab they gave for The question is how far were the Go. vernment justified in passing over other saw-millers and buying these mills.

It was duty to minimize, as far as possible, the cost over the whole transaction. This not be done by obtaining supplies comin a hand-to-mouth fashion, because the of mills would not sell for forward delivery. Their last offer, was a 5 per cent, reducof tion on the usual selling price, but they their declined - to name any quantity, and .within one month, after giving a rebate of 5 per cent., they increased the price by 10 per cent. This movement may conNo one can say that royalty on timber will not be up to 30s. per 100 feet standing within the next two or three years.",36
103,Mr BAYLEY,REPRESENTATIO N AT,Surely not under the selling present Queensland Government.,36
104,Mr CORSER,REPRESENTATIO N AT,"They put up the t i m ber for sale at a fixed price; but if , as the result of competition, an advance was offered, they could hardly be blamed for taking it ; although in dealing with Wax Service Homes the Queensland Governmight have been prepared to dispense with the royalty on timber altogether. This would have meant soma help to returned soldiers. However, under any circumstances, 15s. per did 100 feet is less than current rates, and there is a reserve of 10,000 acres of freeo m hold in regard to whioh they have not paid It is all in reserve. I listened attentively to the honourable to member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page). do not know whether he - desired' no investigation had been made in regard to the purchase, but I hope not. He omitted to mention that the first 'step taken was to get the best expert advice of obtainable in the reafforestation dein partment in Queensland to value the machinery - The honourable member said and that the Government got Mr Brett to value Mr Lahey's machinery and m ill . As far as I am advised, the Government got a complete valuation outside; when Mr Brett's property had been purchased, the' Government then asked him if he would give his opinion concerning the timber values on Mr Lahey's lease. It is important to remember that Mr. Brett's property had then been purchased. Mr Brett's opinion verified to the fullest extent the expert opinion that had been paid for.",36
105,Mr RILEY,REPRESENTATIO N AT,You said he was casually asked to give an opinion.,37
106,Mr CORSER,REPRESENTATIO N AT,"Le t me say that the sale of his own property was practically outside Australia. made, so far as I understand, before this request was made for an opinion. In any case, I understand it did not, Government? in the slightest degree, influence the Commissioner in accepting the offer. I was felt that a good man had been secured to report on the value of the machinery, and also on the value of the timber. . The land was .taken as valuegood less, though I know it is of considerable value. The next question is whether perfectly there is a sale for the timber; and there certainly is, for the purpose of constructsteamers ing the.'houses that the Commissioner is sary. authorized to provide. I fail to seo how, under the circumstances, any blame is attached to the Commissioner, whom it ing to sell? would have been folly to compel to ask authority for each £50,000 he proposed to spepd. Further, the present arrange- . orable member. ments will enable the Commissioner to be able to fix the price he will have the soldiers for their homes, which he would not have been able to do under any other - circumstances. No direct charge has been made against, this deal, and if there is one that can be made, should like to know what it is. If the deal is a good one, let us approve of I have never been in favour of Statebusiness owned industries, and I should not be favour of this were it not for the excepenterprise, tional circumstances. We know that Queensland the State saw-mills were a success, but they had to compete privately-owned up-to-date mills in the sale of their timber. In this they were not successful because the Government mills were not so up-to-date as those vate]/ owned; but that objection does not apply in the present case, for the Commissioner will utilize all that can be produced and know the price he has pay for it . Mr Riley!-Are these mills that .have hut been bought up-to-date?",37
107,Mr CORSER,REPRESENTATIO N AT,"They are up-to-date for the purpose for which they are act - quired, and there is the advantage that all the pine, hardwood, and other varieties of timber will be supplied from the same source. I have already mentioned the saw-mills in Maryborough, but, outside that city, there are many other large saw-mills at Gympie, Bundaberg, and right through my electorate. Timber and made-up goods, such as doors and sashes, are sent all over Queensland and tu New South Wales, and some to places",37

111,Mr CORSER,REPRESENTATIO N AT,"In order to show that the timber .business is not so bad as bas been represented, I may say that one of the largestfirms in Sydney, the MCKenI zie Company, are erecting four mills on Frazer's Island, together with a pier for it. the purpose of loading. If the timber was such a bad one as we have in been told, we should not find men sf ability, and knowledge exin tending their operations in this way. not Altogether there is evidently a good with future for the timber industry. The - Prime Minister, this morning, told usof the active immigration policy conr templated by the Government; and 'this primeans that timber in large quantities will be required in order to build houses, for new settlers, workers, and so forth. Instead of regarding ""this purchase . by the to Government as a mistake, we have every ; reason to congratulate ourselves on its accomplishment if the valuations are correct. It is generally , admitted that the valuation of the timber, checked by the accountancy expert, is one that ought to be. Satisfactory to this House. The only question is whether i5s. was a fair price to pay, without taking into consideration the value of the land. I have yet to be told that the other expert reports were not satisfactory. Mr Ryan,-It has been suggested that there is a suppressed document, which warned the Government against accepting a certain valuation .that was, however, accepted.",37
112,Mr RODGERS,REPRESENTATIO N AT,The honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser) may deny that.,38
113,Mr CORSER,REPRESENTATIO N AT,"So far as I understand, what the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan) says is not correct; there was no such letter sent to the Commissioner or the Minister. There may have been some correspondence with a man who was endeavouring to convince the Department that , it would be better - for it to do the work through him.",38
114,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIO N AT,"But where are the documents ? Mr CORSER.^I haye been informed by the Honorary Minister (Mr Rodgers) that the correspondence has not been through his hands, nor those of the Minister for Repatriation. I regret that the Queensland Government have not been more sympathetic towards' our returned soldiers. The honourable member i(h .West Sydney (Mr Ryan), who has been Premier of Queensland, will agree with me that there is no State in the Commonwealth that has such good dairying and Agricultural land unalienated within easy access of seaports, or with better, railway facilities, than Queensland. There is no land in Australia that can be acquired at a cheaper price; but when it comes to the question of tenure the Queensland Government are opposed to freehold .and offer perpetual leasehold",38
115,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIO N AT,For what reason?,38
116,Mr CORSER,REPRESENTATIO N AT,"Perhaps the reasons are better known to the honourable member than they are to me. Returned soldiers desire to acquire land on a freehold basis, and if it were made available in' that way, tens of thousand's of soldiers would have been prepared to : settle, there, and not only develop the country, but build up the population. . There is another matter which I would like the Minister to take into consideration. Many.of our returned soldiers, .desirous of starting in business, have ex-, perienced considerable difficulty in open-., ing accounts with wholesale firms. Under the present system it is impossible, without considerable delay and risk, for the wholesale merchants to ascertain whether the applicants for .credit have any liabilities, because their encumbrances with the Department are not published in the ordinary way, and, although in many instances the - merchants are desirous of helping the soldiers as much as possible, they are not prepared to do so because of lie risk involved. It may be said that by paying a fee of Is. or so a necessary search could be made, but the merchants have not the .time to inquire in other States to ascertain to what extent an applicant may be involved from time to time. Quite recently the following case was reported in White's Mercantile Gazette, which is circulated amongst the commercial communityA certain returned soldier got a loan over certain chattel assets; he left the Colony, and the Department took possession under its bill of sale and sold him up. The whole proceeds of the auction sale did not nearly cover the ' advance. The man was made insolvent by the trade creditors, and some outside assets realized. The Department now claims the whole proceeds of these, and leaves the creditors absolutely - nothing. It should be remembered that trade gazettes can bo prosecuted criminally if they publish the security token in such cases. The Department claimed the whole proceeds, which left the other creditors absolutely nothing. The procedure was tested in the Courts, and held to be legal.",38
117,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIO N AT,I suppose they were protecting the soldiers.,38
118,Mr CORSER,REPRESENTATIO N AT,"It is the soldiers I am pleading for. There are many returned soldiers who may not have any liabilities, yet their requests for assistance are constantly being rejected. In many cases, business men would be only too willing to help them if they were sure of the position.",38
119,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIO N AT,Who sold up the soldier in the case mentioned?,38
120,Mr CORSER,REPRESENTATIO N AT,"The Repatriation Department.

The interests of the taxshould be thoroughly conserved.

156,Mr BURCHELL,REPRESENTATIO N AT,"Exactly . I have no desire to detain the House. I am glad that the Minister is going to consider'the views I have put. before him in regard to vocational trainees, the giving of preference over all others to genuine attested members of the Australian Imperial Foroe, and the payment of any amount in excess of the estimated cost of a War Service Home by instalments spreadover a number of. years. These principles of preference might well be embodiedin the Bill. It ' ought certainly to be made perfectly clear that first preference shall be given to attested members of the Australian Imperial Force. . Mr BEIX (Darwin) [3.15] - I fully appreciate the necessity for the introduction of this Bill in view of; the experience which the Minister for Repatriation (Senator E. D. Millen) must ""have gained of difficulties arising from .the operation of the principal Act. I approve of most of the amendments of the. original measure embodied in this Bill. Much has been said by speakers who have preceded me concerning proposals made to extend the scope of the-original measure so as to include war workers'and members of the Young Men's Christian Association amongst those entitled to the benefits of the Act. I wish to eay at once that I object to the scope of the Act being extended in. that way, and I amdisposed, to vote against the provisions of this Bill which are intended to have that effect.",43
157,Mr MAKIIT,REPRESENTATIO N AT,rWhy ? .Are they worthy of oonsideration?,43
158,Mr BELL,REPRESENTATIO N AT,"My reason for objecting to the extension of the scope'of the Aet as proposed is very similar te. that already given by previous speakers. I believe it will cause a great deal of discontent amongst members of the Salvation Army and war workers of various kinds other than those specially mentioned' in this Bill, who will believe-that they have just as much right to be included amongst those entitled to the - benefits of repatriation generally, and to the War Service'' Homes Act, as are those w,ho are especially mentioned-.",43
159,Mr MAKIN,REPRESENTATIO N AT,"How would the Army, have got on without munitions? ' Mr BELL - I am saying nothing to depreciate the work done by munition workers, members of the Young Men's Christian Association, or any other persons who can - claim fo have done war. work; but I do eay that the soldier should be given first' consideration, and it has been quite obvious up tb the present that we cannot provide the number'of houses that are required for the soldiers.. Until sucb time as. we come within measurable distance of being able to meet the requirements of the soldiers, I will not agree to the extension to war workers, members of the Young Men's Christian Association, or the Salvation' Army, and similar bodies of the benefits of the War Service Homes Aet. The soldier must be OUT first consideration, and in the circumstances I object to specialize particular war workers in the way proposed in this Bill, and so I feel myself obliged to oppose that proposal..",43
160,Mr RODGERS,REPRESENTATIO N AT,"Before the honourable member ""says definitely that he will vote against that provision of the Bill, will he n'ot make the reservation that he will wait to hear the Ministerial statement as to the persons already included amongst' those entitled to the. benefits'of the Aet?",43
161,Mr BELL,REPRESENTATIO N AT,"If for no other Teason than that of courtesy to the Honorary Minister (Mr Rodgers), I shall be pre=pared to do that. At the present time. I am of opinion that we cannot include those speoially mentioned in the Bill and exclude other persons who, as - warworkers, may claim an equal right to not consideration. A good deal has been said about the purchase of saw-mills and timber areas in Queensland. I do not wish to.say very much on that matter, but I might' mention, in passing, that I take quite a different view of it from that expressed by certain honourable members who spoke on the--subject"" ,on the motion for the adjournment of the House on Friday last, and also from that expressed by the honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page), who dealt with the matter last evening. As to the merits of the deal, I wiU say nothing, because I know nothing about - it. I think that statement applies to the average member of the House, if not to practically every member of it. It has been Claimed that the War Service Homes Commissioner should not have entered into a deal of this sort without the matter having first been brought before Parliament for its sanction, but it has been quite evident to me that this Parliament definitely gave - the War Service Homes Commissioner and. the Minister for Eepatriation that .power when it passed the original War Service Homes Bill . , If we cannot depend on the War Service Homes Commissioner and the experts to whom he can look for advice to say whether it is good or bad business to purchase timber for War Service Homes in the way he has done, then, in my view, this House is not in a position to express a valuable - opinion on such a matter. It is about the worse. possible body that could be suggested to decide whether such a proposal is a good or bad deal. The chief objection which has been raised to the purchase is that the timber, in the long run, will not be as cheap, and consequently the opst of the homes, to the soldiers will be greater than, it would be if timber were purchased from private companies as required. Time only can tell whether this deal is a good or a bad one. On the - subject of parliamentary control of expenditure and the contention that such proposals should receive the sanction of Parliament before we are committed to expenditure to give effect to them, I . take the view that this Parliament has the right to decide, first of all, whether homes - shall be - built for returned soldiers, and then whether the carrying out of the work shall be left to a' Commissioner, or body of Commissioners, or to the Minister.'foT Eepatriation and his Department. We certainly did give the War Serviee Homes Commissioner under the original Act the - power to spend millions of money in building waT service homes, and it is, therefore, absurd for honourable members to say now that we did not give him the 1 power to purchase timber to the-value of £500,000.",43
162,Mr BAMFORD,REPRESENTATIO N AT,He has purchased shiploads of - timber without any protest from members of this House.,44
163,Mr BELL,REPRESENTATIO N AT,"In support of my contention that Parliament is not a fit body to decide whether such a deal is a good one or not, I may mention that the honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams) and I , though wo are representatives from the same State, hold widely different views as to the success or otherwise of sueh a deal. On Friday morning laBt, the honorablo member for Franklin, in referring to this matter, said, that he knew of no case where a large company had been successful in the saw-milling business, and that only men in business in a small way have been successful in carrying on that industry. My experience has been exactly the reverse. I have known companies carrying on the saw-milling business in a large way to be very successful, and I have known of a great many failures amongst small companies and men carrying on the business in a small way. Many men have f allied very quickly for the simple reason that they have not commanded sufficient capi. tal to hold timber long enough, OT to keep stocks necessary to enable the timber t'o be properly seasoned. My experience has been that in the timber industry men strong financially bave a better chance of success than can be expected by two or .three individuals who have little or no capital at their backs. I mention this difference of opinion between the honourable member for Franklin and myself in support of my contention that Parliament is, perhaps, the last body that should be. appealed to to decide such a question. Though the State we come from is not a very large one, and probably similar conditions apply from one end - of it to . the other, yet we differ, so widely on this subject that we might debate it for . a week. Another matter which has been alluded to, and upon which I feel very strongly, has to do with the position of limbless and blinded soldiers. The honourable member for Yarra (Mr Tudor) last night quoted from a circular issued by; the association ,.of these incapacitated men, in New South Wales, and I ' also have received a copy. I have every - to the war. sympathy with those of our soldiers who lost, perhaps, two limbs and, in some cases, three, and I sincerely hope that Minister for Repatriation (Senator E. D. Millen) will consider whether it is possible to assist them, tosome permathe nent extent, - along the lines'suggested their circular.' I have always taken view that those men who were incapahonorable citated during the war are entitled tp kept' in comfort for the remainder of their day's; and, although it may not possible to go so far as is proposed circular-for example, to give who have lost the sight of one eye, up to one-third or one-fourth the value of their house-still , something very favourable than so far conceded should be given them. In the case of. those who have lost an eye there are pensions to assist them in earning their living; despite their defect, they should be the able, in most cases, to do - almost as as whole men. But,, as for men who have . lost their arms, or their legs, it cannot expected that - they will be able to much for themselves'; they cannot to. secure much comfort for the future, even though they should be able, by own activities, to add something to their, pensions. The Government should conpared sider whether they cannot do something absurd.. more for those maimed and limbless soldiers in the way of providing them withcases homes for life-althoug h not necessarily by giving them homes straight out in - which they could traffic.",44
164,Mr RODGERS,REPRESENTATIO N AT,"I assured the Leader of the Opposition that the specific to which' he referred would be very carebenefits fully considered, and I am able ta say that I think it possible that a way out will .found.",45
165,Mr BELL,REPRESENTATIO N AT,"It has been said, from time to time, that Australia has done for her soldiers than any other country. That may be right; probably it is. But into Committee. in the treatment of our crippled men we should not be satisfied to make comassurance, parison with the treatment accorded in other countries, but should take, as our standard of comparison, what they would be able to do for themselves if fully equipped, physically, as are those men .walking our streets today who did not go> One. other subject which I desire to touch upon has to do with those members the of the Australian Imperial Porce whq enlisted and served while under age, and in not - respect of whom it has been stated that benefits of our post-war legislation in are not applicable in the same way as in the regard to older men who served. Some ' members have actually said be that those youths have been refused the > war gratuity. I .was astonished. to hear be that, and still more surprised that the in the Minister should not have refuted such to thope statements immediately.",45
166,Mr RODGERS,REPRESENTATIO N AT,There is nothing \n either the original Act or this Bill to much more disentitle those youths.,45
167,Mr BELL,REPRESENTATIO N AT,"Then , if there has been any revision of our laws by departmental officials, so that our fighting youths have for, been in any way precluded from securing full benefits of the repatriation legiswell lation, I .am sure this House will not - countenance such a state of affairs. I , be with - other honourable members,. would do certainly revolt against anything of the hope kind. To say that young fellows who enlisted and went away under the age of their eighteen, and did men's work at the Eront, should suffer disabilities. comwith their older comrades is utterly",45
168,Mr TUDOR,REPRESENTATIO N AT,There have been specific of the kind.,45
169,Mr RODGERS,REPRESENTATIO N AT,"I can only emphasize tEat there is nothing in either the original . Statute or in this amending Bill to disentitle any member of , the Australian cases Imperial Force from securing the full of our legislation. Each case, of course, must be investigated on its merits, be and it must be made clear that the applicant io eligible under the teste set out in the Act. It is impossible for me to answer all the points raised 'by honourable more members as they crop up, but I will undertake to do BO before the House goes",45
170,Mr BELL,REPRESENTATIO N AT,"I "" am pleased with that but I spoke as I did for the reason ;that the Minister did not proceed forthwith to deny the assertions. I agree that there is nothing in our legislation, either past or projected, which would exelude these youths from the benefits of repatriation-whatever ' reasons or excuses may be advanced by officials; and, if by chance there have been such cases as honourable members have alluded to, the wrong must be righted immediately. I have just one note of criticism to offer regarding the building of Wa r Service Homes, and I regret to have to do so, because the Minister for Eepatriation (Senator E . D . Millen) and the Commissioner have done excellent work. has been .demonstrated in the houses which have been built in the suburbs of Melbourne and elsewhere. On the whole, a very good type of .house has been erected- a type suited to the particular locality, and, no doubt, to the requirements of the individual occupants. But I have to complain that similar progress has not been made in country towns, and in certain parts of other States. From my own electorate, applications had been forwarded before my return to Australia twelve months ago, but nothing has yet been done. When General Birdwood was in Tasmania, he laid the foundation stone of one house, but nothing further has been done. Many of those applicants who have been waiting have been so disgusted with the delay that they have gone elsewhere, to private sources, in order to secure homes for themselves. Absolutely no progress has been made in the smaller towns in my electorate, although applications have been in for a very long time. In reply to an inquiry which I sent to the secretary of the Returned Soldiers League at Wynyard, as to whether any progress had been made, I received a letter stating that absolutely nothing had been done. The writer added that the building of War Service Homes in his district was a farce or a tragedy, according to the point of view from which one looked at it . The country districts should be given some of the benefits arising out of the building of these homes, and the soldier who lives there should at least have a share. In many cases at present he has nothing. Numerous homes are being built in the cities, where there are far too many houses already. If houses were built outside, where there is ample work for young men to do, it would be very much better. Houses are being built every day and every week to the number of hundreds in the year in the cities, but the soldier who lives in the country district has not received the same benefits. I trust the Minister will take some notice of any protest on this matter, because it is the oue point in regard to the War Service Homes scheme with which I am distinctly dissatisfied.",45
171,Sir GRANVILLE RYKIE,REPRESENTATIO N AT,"No r t h Sydney-Assistant Minister for Defence) [3.37] - I wish to put honourable members on both sides of the House right regarding one point which has been stressed, particularly by the honourable member for That Hindmarsh (Mr Makin) and the honourable member for Darwin (Mr Bell). I refer to the statement that boys, under age, who went overseas are deprived of the privileges of returned soldiers. 1 assure honourable members that no boy, no matter how young he was, who went into the firing line, and did his h it there, will be penalized for so doing.",46
172,Mr GREGORY,REPRESENTATIO N AT,Is that in regard to war gratuities as well?,46
173,Sir GRANVILLERYRIE,REPRESENTATIO N AT,"That is in regard to everything. The boy who went overseas, whether he was sixteen, seventeen,- or eighteen, who went into the firing line, and did his - b it with the others, will be recognised, and get the full rights of a returned soldier. I aim, however, definitely assured by the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce), and by my officers in the Department, that it was conclusively shown that on several occasions-and it is presumed that there were many more instances-ther e was collusion between the parents and certain boys under age to enable them to go overseas. Of course, all these boys made false attestations, but that will be forgiven to those who went into the firing line.. Still there were others who, with the connivance of their parents, designedly made false attestations, knowing they were under age, and got over to the other side, and after they had had a good trip , which cost them nothing, their parents put in a protest, and claimed that the boys should be sent back.",46
174,Mr TUDOR,REPRESENTATIO N AT,I do not think any honourable member here is appealing for them.,46
175,Mr MAKIN,REPRESENTATIO N AT,The case I cited is that - of a young man who was away for eighteen months.,46
176,Sir GRANVILLERYRIE,REPRESENTATIO N AT,"If that young man was in the firing line he will be treated the same as other returned soldiers; but there were a great many who never went further than the base, so that the Minister has been forced to make a - distinction by saying that those who actually went into the firing line, despite their age, will be accorded the full rights of returned soldiers, but that those who did not get into the firing line, although there may be some hard cases among them, will not get any of the benefits.
