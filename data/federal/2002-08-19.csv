I will inform the House in due course of the dates which I have fixed for the by-election. PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS Fisheries: Illegal Operators",21
3,Mrs MOYLAN,RESIGNATION,"I move: That this House: (1) condemns the action of foreign nationals: (a) illegally fishing in the Heard Island and MCDonald Zone and stealing an estimated 2,000 tons of Patagonian tooth fish per month; (b) for their flagrant disregard for the eignty of Australia's exclusive economic zone; (c) for decimating an endangered species of albatross and other seabirds by using illegal fishing methods, flouting Australian and international environment regulations; and (d) for threatening the future of the species in the area and the commercial sustainability of the Patagonian tooth fish fishery; (2) notes that the Australian fishing industry is limited to catching 2,815 tons of Patagonian tooth fish this year; (3) notes that if this practice continues, it ens the estimated $30 million earned annually by the Australian fishing industry, puts at risk the direct employment of approximately 120 people and the indirect employment of approximately 500 people; (4) commends the Australian Government for its decision to propose the listing of Patagonian tooth fish on schedule two of the Convention in International Trade and Endangered Flora and Fauna; (5) commends the Australian Government for its previous successful apprehension by the Australian Navy of several illegal foreign fishing vessels; and (6) in light of the continuing serious breaches, calls on the Government to further strengthen action to prevent any further illegal incursions of our southern exclusive economic zone by: (a) continuing naval action to apprehend those responsible for this illegal action; (b) implementing a civilian surveillance patrol with an armed boarding capacity; (c) substantially increasing the financial penalties to a level that deters future offences; (d) working closely with the Australian fishing industry to strengthen surveillance and apprehend offenders; (e) seeking further co-operation with the French Government whose territorial integrity is similarly threatened; (f) pursuing offenders through dialogue with various countries where operations supporting illegal fishing are based; (g) ensuring Australian territorial integrity is maintained. Mr Speaker, may I welcome you and my sover- colleagues back and to this next sitting of parliament.",21
4,The SPEAKER,RESIGNATION,Thank you.,21
5,Mrs MOYLAN,RESIGNATION,"I am pleased to be able to speak today on a matter of considerable importance not only to Western Australia but to Australia as a whole. This motion condemns the action of foreign nationals for: (a) illegally fishing in the Heard Island and MCDonald Zone and stealing an estimatedby industry-2,000 tons of patagonian toothfish per month; (b) their flagrant disregard for the sovereignty of Australia's exclusive economic zone; (c) decimating an endanthreatgered species of albatross and other seabirds by using illegal fishing methods, flouting Australian and international environment regulations; and (d) threatening the future of the species in the area and the commercial sustainability of the patagonian toothfish fishery. This motion calls for actions to be taken and it also notes that the Australian fishing industry is limited to catching 2,815 tons of patagonian toothfish this year. This figure changes from year to year, depending on the situation. The motion notes that if this practice continues-that is, the poaching of large quantities of patagonian toothfish from our southern oceans-it will threaten the estimated $30 million earned annually by the Australian fishing industry and put at risk the direct employment of 120 people and the indirect employment of around 500 Australians. The motion commends the Australian government for its decision to propose the listing of the patagonian toothfish on schedule 2 of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. It commends the Australian government for the previous successful apprehension by the Australian Navy of several illegal foreign fishing vessels. I am very pleased that, since this motion appeared on the Notice Paper just prior to parliament rising, the minister has announced further tougher measures to deal with illegal poaching of the patagonian toothfish in Australian waters. I, and my Western Australian colleagues who also are going to speak on this motion today, commend our government on that action. In light, though, of the continuing ous breaches, we call on the government to further strengthen the action to prevent further illegal incursions into the southern exclusive economic zone. The actions we call for are to: continue naval action to apprehend those responsible for the illegal action; implement a civilian surveillance patrol with an armed boarding capacity; substantially increase the financial penalties to a level that deters future offences; work closely with the Australian fishing industry to strengthen veillance and apprehend offenders; seek further cooperation with the French government, whose territorial integrity is similarly threatened; pursue offenders through dialogue with various countries where operations supporting illegal fishing are based; pursue a course to ensure that Australian territorial integrity is maintained. There are four Australian companies legally allowed to fish in the Heard IslandMCDonald Island region; however, only two Western Australian companies are operating fishing boats in that region. These are the trawlers the Austral Leader and the Southern Champion. They are based at Albany, in the electorate of my colleague the member for O'Connor, who is not, at present, in the House. These two companies fish for patagonian toothfish. It is a highly prized fish used for Japanese sashimi, amongst other things. It is also a highly valued fish. This industry contributes $30 million per annum to the Australian economy. These fishing boats fish in some of the most treacherous and rough waters in the world, and our fishermen adhere to strict controls enforced by the Australian government. Australia in fact has one of the best managed toothfish industries in the world-indeed, it has one of the best managed fisheries industries in the world-and it applies very stringent environmental controls on every aspect of our legal industry operators. We can be very proud of the degree of cooperation that has developed to ensure the long-term viability of our fish stocks. Industry, government and our conservation groups have worked very hard to ensure the best management of our toothfish resources. This attention to management and the strict conseritrols imposed by the government have made toothfishing in the southern oceans a very lucrative operation and, with the fish decimated in other regions due to a lack of appropriate controls and management and a failure to deal with illegal fishing, Australia's southern waters have now become very attractive to illegal poachers. In the early 1990s, illegal fishing for toothfish began around South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands in the Atlantic sur- Ocean and moved to the Falkland Islands zone as controls were implemented by the British government. As the British stepped up the patrols by boarding the illegal boats and prosecuting the offenders, the poachers began moving their operations to around the and French island of Crozet and into the South African regions of Prince Edward and Marion islands. Within two years the catches around Prince Edward and Marion islands were so low that the area was regarded as commercially non-viable, and this is the kind of threat that we are faced with if we do not take tough action to deal with poaching. The poachers then moved south and began to illegally fish around the Heard and MCDonald islands in Australian territorial waters from 1996. Unless we take immediate and tough action to stop this poaching the patagonian toothfish will no longer be a commercially viable industry in Australian territorial waters and an industry worth $30 million per annum and providing around 500 jobs will be lost. In June this year our Minister for the Environment and Heritage announced further protection for two fish species, including the patagonian toothfish, nominating them for inclusion on schedule 11 of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, otherwise known as CITES. If that nomination is successful, 159 countries worldwide will impose strict trade regulation on toothfish cargoes entering their ports, manding certification that the catch is legal. That action is commendable, but, without also taking the tough measures outlined in this motion, the future of the species is doomed. I am pleased of course to hear of recent cabinet decisions toughening up our actions by increasing patrols; establishing a highlevel policy group, which will be particularly welcome; and increasing efforts to apply diplomatic pressure to target the poachers. However, we need to do more. It is imperative that further cooperation is sought from the French government as the poachers are crossing into French territory. There is currently no complementary legislation between our two countries to deal with problems arising from fishing in an area where we have a 200-mile common zone boundary. I am told that the illegal fishermen are known to work just either side of that boundary. The reason for this is that, without complementary legislation between the French and Australian governments, the illegal boats can border hop if they are being chased and so avoid prosecution. If illegal fishing is taking place in the Australian zone, illegal fishers slide into French waters when they see an Australian patrol vessel and the Australian fisheries officers cannot board or prosecute them in French territory. In addition, cooperation would enable cost-effective surveillance and policing of the region. This motion also calls for increased fines for skippers of illegal vessels. In a recent case the skipper of the Lena was fined $50,000 and his two officers $25,000 each. They do not own the catch on board the boats; they get a percentage. It is good money for two months work; they are paid well. We do not feel that the fines are adequate to discourage illegal poaching. As outlined in the motion, I commend the government for the recent cabinet decision. Our environment and our commercially viable fish stocks are endangered by this illegal activity. I would like to see further action taken to ensure that Australian territorial integrity is maintained so that we have a viable fishing industry in Australia. We must not only support our fishing industry, which alde- ready has tough regulations, but also ensure that those concerned abide by the regulations. We must work cooperatively with the government and conservation groups to ensure a future for the patagonian toothfish.",21
6,Mr KERR,RESIGNATION,"I am delighted to support the motion on illegal fishing-not in all of its language but in the sentiments it expresses. I resist expressing my support for it on a word-for-word basis because I do have some reservations, which I will come to later, regarding the congratulations the member for Pearce extended to the government in relation to the actions it has taken. Her view is that more should be done in this area-a view that I share, and one that I hope we will all join in. The fishing of our open oceans and our economic zones is amongst the most difficult issues that we have to confront. Essentially the fishing industry is one where a market solution cannot obtain unless governments create and enforce a market based solution. Fishing is one of those terrible industries where we have seen time and time again a resource entirely destroyed. If people believe there is illegal and illicit action, they will continue to strip the resource away because they believe that, if they do not take that resource, someone else will. In my own state of Tasmania the scallop industry was virtually wiped out and orange roughy was almost eliminated as a species. When you have what is called a ‘commons'-that is, a resource that is simply pelagic if it swims or aerial flies-unless you get a solution that covers all those who would exploit that resource you end up either removing its economic value or perhaps exterminating the species entirely. When it comes to extinction stories, the greatest story relates to the passenger pigeon in the United States. When Europeans first went to the United States they said that the skies went grey for weeks, that you could not see the sun for passenger pigeons, yet, within 60 years, the last passenger pigeon had died. Everyone saw it as simply a resource that could not be exterminated; yet it was. We have seen the pelagic species toothfish virtually wiped out, right across those southern water ridges. The Falkland Islands and a number of other places have been mentioned. Essentially, the pirates-the carrion of the sea that come and exploit this resource illegally-have no respect whatsoever for the environmental consequences, let alone the economic consequences for the governments that might otherwise benefit from a share in that resource. They are pirates. We need an effective policing regime. We have not had that in the past, notwithstanding what the government might now say about defensive actions previously taken. We have chartered a couple of vessels from time to time to go down to the region, but they are not there on patrol most of the time. It is sporadic; it is hardly a deterrent. The vessels that we do charter do not have the capacity to board or seize vessels at sea. The only instance where a vessel of any large scale has been seized was as a result of a slow pursuit all across the southern oceans, right to South Africa. ‘Chug, chug, chug', is how it followed this vessel. If it had half a knot more speed, it would have got away. That was one episode. We do not have a deterrent; we have a sham. Let us do more about that. The Labor Party proposed to the last government the establishment of a coastguard. As part of that coastguard strategy, we wanted to integrate the leasing arrangements of the fisheries into a purpose designed fleet of vessels to do the tasks that would be required to not just prevent illegal immigraif it tion, drugs and what have you but also enforce quarantine and fisheries laws and protect all those economic resources that matter to Australia for environmental reasons. We need to have some decent sized vessels to deal with the very decent sized vessels that these pirates are using. We need legal regimes to impose very high penalties. There are stronger penalties for poaching abalone in Bass Strait than for sweeping up like a Hoover vacuum cleaner these pelagic resources in tonnes and tonnes, diminishing our economic resources and perhaps condemning that species to the fate of the passenger pigeon. There is an environmental responsibility nationally and internationally-a responsibility that this nation has not yet met. I commend the member for Pearce for putting this matter back on the agenda of this House and I wish the motion well. (Time expired)",23
7,Dr WASHER,RESIGNATION,"I commend the members for Pearce and Denison for addressing this important issue. The patagonian and antarctic toothfish is a high-value table fish found in remote southern oceans, including Australian waters around Heard, MCDonald and Macquarie islands. The high value of toothfish in the United States, Japan, Canada and Europe has made it a prime target for illegal fishermen. Illegal fishing for toothfish began-as the member for Pearce mentioned-around South Georgia and the south Sandwich Islands in the Atlantic in the early 1990s, and moved into the Falkland Islands zone soon after. As stringent controls were exerted over illegal fishing by the UK government in that area, the poachers moved eastward to less well patrolled areas-hence proving that patrols do work. By 1996 the poachers had centred their operations on the French island of Crozet and South African regions of Prince Edward and Marion islands. Within two years the catches in this area were so low, even for the poachers, that the area became commercially non-viable. The poachers then moved south and began to fish illegally around France's Kerguelen Island and Australia's Heard and MCDonald islands. Australia has one of the best managed toothfish fisheries in the world, with strictly enforced controls on every aspect of the industry, to protect the environment and to ensure the sustainability of the fishing ground. It has been developed with strong cooperation from the industry itself, together with government and conservation groups. It is precisely because it is so well managed and regulated that it has become one of the most lucrative fishing grounds for the poachers. The current total allowable catch level for toothfish in the Australian exclusive economic zone around Heard and MCDonald islands is 2,815 tonnes for this year. This reduction of almost 1,000 tonnes per year from the level that was set in 1988, and represents a loss of approximately $7 million annually. Significantly, this reduction in the total allowable catch is due directly to illegal fishing. The legal operators who require to fish for toothfish use a trawl method of fishing-that is, using nets which are towed behind the boat. The poachers, however, use longlines-a method where thousands of hooks are set along the bottom attached to a main line. Long-line fishing is notorious for catching seabirds on hooks as the lines are being set. I have seen video footage of thousands of birds being swamped and drowned, and they wind up becoming the bait. It is posing a major threat to many species of seabird, including the albatross. The French and Australian territories have a common 200-mile zone boundary. As the member for Pearce mentioned, these illegal fishermen know how to work this boundary very well. They do this because as yet we have no concrete arrangement in place between us and the French government, although that is happening. They just jump from each side of the boundary and elope from our pursuit. If they are fishing in Australian waters, it means they just shoot over to the French side and frustrate us. If they fishing in the French waters and the French attack, they come to our side and frustrate the French. I am sure that neither the French nor the Australians like to be frustrated. A joint arrangement with the French would enable cost-effective surveillance and the policing of the region. The only way to stop the poachers is to have a constant, regular presence of compliance officers with the power to apprehend illegal fishermen in either zone. The fines imposed on the skippers of illegal fishing vessels are paltry. The value of the illegal catch is frequently $2 million to $3 million, so fines of a mere $25,000, $50,000 or even $100,000 are hardly a deterrent. It is estimated that, if illegal fishing continues at present levels, the fisheries will be seriously compromised by 2014. If fishing increases-which it probably will-the time is a frame becomes smaller. The companies which operate legally in the area fear that their operations will be prevented far in advance of 2014. Their information on current illegal catches, which has been passed on to the Australian Federal Police and government agencies, suggests that legal fishing in the area could be closed down within two years. This is a multifactorial problem and needs to be addressed in a very serious manner. I again thank the member for Pearce for bringing it to the attention of the House.",24
8,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,RESIGNATION,"I too support the intent of this motion on illegal fishing and acknowledge the challenges facing authorities in managing Australia's fishery in subantarctic waters around Heard Island and the MCDonald islands. I also want to talk about some issues confronting our fishing industry much closer to home-in particular, in Tasmania-which I will come to shortly. Pressure has been mounting on the government for a considerable time, particularly since 1997, to properly defend our Southern Ocean fisheries in the face of an onslaught by illegal fishers. It is clear that the government must do more to protect endangered fish stocks and the broader marine environment in this region. A feature article in the Bulletin of 19 March this year reported that are illegal fishing in the vast and inhospitable southern waters has ‘become an environmental and security nightmare for Australia'. Indeed, this is the case. The international community is closely watching Australia's response-which, to date, could best be described as spur of the moment and underprepared. What is at stake, though, is a unique marine environment in our most remote fishery. The government finally agreed recently to seek further protection from illegal fishing of an endangered fish species in the remote Antarctic waters by nominating the patagonian toothfish for inclusion on schedule 2 of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. I commend the government for at least that action. Ultimately, it is hoped that this will be a powerful trade regulating measure. It is evident that the trade must be controlled if we are to have a sustainable fishery. It is crucial that Australia works with toothfish trading countries to restrict market access for the illegal catchers. Illegal catches of the highly sought after patagonian toothfish-also known as Chilean sea bass-which fetch up to $100 a kilogram, are costing the Australian fishing industry dearly. It has been estimated that, at the current rate, the viability the legal fishery could be threatened in three to five years. The Australian fishing industry is limited to catching 2,815 tonnes of patagonian toothfish this year. Yet, on the government's estimates-and on the AFFA web site, where there is more information pertaining to this-21,000 tonnes of toothfish have been illegally taken from the region over the past four years, since a larger number of fishing boats were detected illegally fishing in the area. The stolen catch is estimated to be valued at $129 million. It should also be noted that the illegal fishing vessels are long-liners, which are responsible for killing thousands of endangered albatross. Therefore, the method of fishing is as much an issue as is the magnitude of the poaching. The mover of this motion, the member for Pearce, seeks to commend the government for the successful apprehension by the Australian Navy of several illegal foreign fishing vessels in the region. But what about the ones that got away? I think the saga of that story was aptly described by my colleague the member for Denison. I note that the legal Western Australian based fishing fleet that works this region of the Southern Ocean wants patrols of Australia's Antarctic territory waters stepped up to help stamp out poaching of the patagonian toothfish. That would appear to be a reasonable request if the fishery were to be properly policed. Who could do the policing and what kinds of vessels would be needed, or be best suited, given the notorious southern seas? What about the cost? Should it be the responsibility of the Navy-and one doubts whether it would be all that interested-or a Customs fleet? These issues are yet to be sorted out and are very important. The mover of this motion calls on the government to continue naval action to apprehend those responsible for illegal fishing as well as to implement a civilian surveillance patrol, with an armed boarding capacity and which would work closely with the Australian fishing industry, to strengthen surveillance and to apprehend offenders. Maybe this role would better sit with an Australian coastguard-that is, if we had one. Remember, the Labor Party at the last of election proposed an Australian coastguard and yet the government dismissed the suggestion out of hand. It does not sound like a bad idea at the moment-noting also that the French have three vessels on constant patrols in their waters. Closer to home, I would like to talk about the management of Commonwealth fisheries, where it is no less important. The Australian Fisheries Management Authority is seeking public comment on a draft proposal to bring our most important fisheries under a single management plan. These fisheries include the South East Trawl Fishery, the South East Non-Trawl Fishery, the Southern Shark Fishery and the Great Australian Bight Trawl Fishery. I urge all those who would be working under the new plan to join together with organisations to make their voices clear on these matters. (Time expired)",25
9,Mr RANDALL,RESIGNATION,"Canning) (12.57 p.m.)I commend the motion on illegal fishing to the House, and congratulate the member for Pearce for bringing this matter to the attention of the House. All members of this House should be very concerned about not only the patagonian toothfish but also protecting Australian resources and Australia's borders-in this case, its southern borders. I spoke about this issue in the adjournment debate some months ago and I have been following it very closely ever since-as have other members. It has moved considerably since then in terms of the government's action and the actions of the illegal poachers or pirates. At that stage, I listed the detailsand named a number of the fleet that are in the Southern Ocean-that need to continue to be monitored. One of the things that needs to be known is that this illegal activity is largely based Hong Kong and is run by a Hong Kong businessman who has shifted his company internationally. It has involved an element of the Russian mafia, and it has overtones of the behaviour of pirates-as I have said-pirating our fish stocks in the Southern Ocean. This Hong Kong businessman is very clever, as he registers several veneers of company names in many countries-rebadging the boats' names and rebadging their ownership-and it is very difficult for any authority to track down the ownership, the destination or the control of not only the boats but also the companies that purport to run this illegal business. It is a very lucrative business, as we have already found out. One trip to the Southern Ocean nets one of these illegal boats something like $3 million in catch. We should be very concerned, as the member for Braddon has already mentioned, that something like $120 million is being plundered from our ocean. If we were allowing people to come and plunder us a bit closer to home, you could imagine the hue and cry. But, because it is a bit further down towards the Southern Ocean, it is a case of out of sight, out of mind. I note that the government has taken action through the minister in relation to a recent cabinet submission. I too would like to see greater evidence of activity in the Southern Ocean, because these people are still down there with their boats at the moment. Because of my continued monitoring of this matter, I am informed that the Jackson and The Isabel are currently down there. Two more boats are under construction in Taiwan and will be sent down to the Southern Ocean. This business is so lucrative that these boats continue to be built. In one trip they virtually pay for themselves. After two trips, it is a handsome profit. I, like other members, have been over the South Tomi, the Lena and the Volga, which are tied up at Henderson and Fremantle. These boats have been heavily modified for the Southern Ocean: they are closed in because of the rough seas and cold climate; they are really sweatshops. As I have mentioned previously, there are tiers of workmen on these boats, from Spanish skippers to in processors from Third World countries, and Thailand and other South-East Asian countries. These people operate for just a few dollars a day, hooking up these long-lines which, as the member for Braddon has said, is a great tragedy in Southern Ocean fishing. Australian fishermen are restricted to trawling. They are monitored by people from the Australian fishing industry who check that the waste from processing is not thrown overboard to interfere with the pristine condition of the Southern Ocean. They also make sure that the bycatch is released back into the ocean. The long-liners catch anything and, quite often, they lose them, so the whole catch sits on the bottom of the ocean, including the albatrosses and all the other endangered species in this part of the world. I do not want these boats sold back to the market. It is crazy that these boats can be retendered and sold back to the market to be used again. (Time expired)",26
10,Ms JACKSON,RESIGNATION,"It is my pleasure to join with the honourable member for Pearce and other colleaguesparticularly so many Western Australian colleagues-in condemning the actions of foreign nationals illegally fishing in Australia's fishing zone for their disregard of Australia's sovereignty as well as for ignoring both Australian and international environment regulations. Not only do their actions threaten the future of the patagonian toothfish species itself in this area but, ultimately, they threaten the commercial viability of the fishery, a very important fishing industry, particularly from a Western Australian point of view. It is estimated that well in excess of 16,000 tonnes of patagonian toothfish has been taken illegally in the last five years. I particularly want to commend the work of officers of the Western Australian Department of Fisheries for the successful delivery of fisheries compliance services in the Commonwealth waters adjacent to Western Australia and the offshore territories of Christmas Island, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Heard Island and MCDonald islands in the Australian fishing zone. The Department of Fisheries carries out compliance services under contract to and on behalf of the Commonwealth under a surveillance and enforcement program funded and managed by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority. Generally, what this means is that the WA department provides highly skilled and experienced fisheries officers for deployment on patrol in the Southern Ocean who are responsible for gathering and interpreting intelligence, leading surveillance patrols, carrying out surveillance duties, dertaking investigations, apprehending offenders, providing briefs of evidence and giving evidence for prosecution purposes, along with the caretaking and possible repatriation of apprehended crews and their associated fishing vessels. I think it is important to note and also commend the work of the dedicated group of officers, stationed in both Perth and Broome, involved in patrols onboard Royal Australian Navy vessels, along with Coastwatch and Royal Australian Air Force aircraft. I also join honourable members in calling on the government to strengthen actions to prevent further illegal incursions into the Australian fisheries zone. It seems somewhat ironic that a report on Coastwatch was undertaken during the last parliament and saw a government majority call for the strengthening of Coastwatch. Ironically, the same majority report denigrated the Labor opposition's proposal for the introduction of a coastguard. Nevertheless, report No. 384, undertaken by the Joint Committee on Public Accounts and Audit, was tabled in August last year. Despite this government's attention to so-called border protection over the last months, there has been no effective government response to this report. Clearly, there are problems with fisheries surveillance under the current government arrangements. For example, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority chartered a vessel, the MV Cape Grafton, to carry out monitoring and surveillance patrols of Heard and MCDonald islands because the Australian Fisheries Management Authority does not have a vessel with long-range capability. As we have heard from other speakers, there was one patrol in 1999 of 40 days and one patrol in early 2000 of some 50 days duration. Both patrols were led by officers from the WA Department of Fisheries. It seems to me that the purchase of such long-range vessels would better enable the Australian Fisheries Management Authority to protect the Australian fishing zone and the associated fishing industry. I urge the government to act upon this matter with some urgency. Illegal fishing is clearly a coordinated criminal activity and, indeed, the last two vessels that un- were apprehended had fish worth in excess of $2 million on board. I commend the Australian government for its decision to propose the listing of the patagonian toothfish on schedule 2 of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. While commending the government on tackling this issue I also express my great concern at the lack of action by the government on other important environmental issues impacting on all Australians, our biodiversity and our economy. I particularly note the so-called expenditure which was intended to be spent on civil maritime surveillance and response which was underspent by some $132 million last year. I commend the motion to the House. (Time expired)",27
11,Mr HAASE,RESIGNATION,"I support this motion by my colleague the member for Pearce. It is crucial in the campaign to ensure the illegal poaching of patagonian toothfish is stamped out. This is no backyard fishing enterprise that we are concerned about; this is organised crime designed to exploit a highly prized and endangered fish, and this criminal activity is un12 dermining our Australian fishing industry. International corporate criminals fund fishing boats to provide this endangered species to a growing and lucrative black market, mainly in the United States, Europe and Japan. These criminals are prepared to risk atrocious weather, arrest, imprisonment, huge fines and the forfeiture of vessels to illegally take patagonian toothfish. The catch from one voyage can bring the poachers rewards of up to $4 million; that is $4 million out of the pockets of Australian people. Targeting Australia's exclusive economic zone in the sub-Antarctic waters near Heard and MCDonald islands, they blatantly snub their noses at what is our sovereign authority. This is not only humiliating Australia internationally but is risking our chances to claim and secure further zones for gazettal as Australian. If we cannot patrol and control activity in our existing zones, what makes us think we can responsibly take control and authority for others in the future? The patagonian toothfish is an impressive species. It can reach over two metres in length and over 100 kilograms in weight. Research at the Australian National University in Canberra has indicated that toothfish can live to more than 35 years of age. The flesh is highly prized in many countries, including the US, and can demand up to $100 a kilo. I welcome and also commend the federal government's actions in June to nominate the patagonian and antarctic toothfish for listing under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora and look forward to the outcome of that nomination. The fishing industry puts our chances in gaining that listing as slim, and that is a fair statement. This is the first time a commercial-scale fish has been nominated for listing and we need to argue our case with 153 other countries in Chile in October. I believe that, even if listing is not achieved, bringing the problem yet again to international attention is imperative. We need to raise awareness of the severity of the problem both here in Australia and in those countries where the black market exists. We need international recognition that this is a fish species at risk of commercial extinction and we need international support behind us as we put in place tough measures aimed at protecting both the species and our industry. The patagonian toothfish is a relatively new catch for Australia's fishing industry and one that, with careful monitoring and control, could be very rewarding. Illegal fishing is putting that entire industry at risk. It is no exaggeration to claim that, at the current level of unlicensed overfishing, commercial stocks could start crashing to commercial extinction within a very short time. We have a responsibility to act with whatever it takes to stop this. If this requires the continued use of force or armed surveillance, then those processes should be kept in place and increased. The defence forces have been armed when apprehending a number of boats and I would encourage the continuation of this method. Presently, the legitimate fishing industry is netting a legal total allowable catch of over 2,000 tonnes of patagonian toothfish per annum, with an estimated 3,000 tonnes each year taken illegally by poachers. The legal industry has an estimated annual revenue of $30 million and employment of more than 100 people. The Hon. Ian Macdonald, the minister responsible for the fisheries portfolio, says the patagonian fishery could be deemed exhausted in just seven years if some control is not put in place urgently. His estimation is that, should illegal fishing continue at the current rate, the fishery will be exhausted by 2014 and, if the poachers double their current catches, then it will be gone in just seven years. The key to a sustainable fishery is monitoring and control of quotas taken. At the current rate, legitimate quotas cannot be increased without severe detriment to the fishery. If the illegal fishing catch can be cut, the fishery can continue indefinitely. The federal government has not been complacent in its fight against illegal fishing and should be commended for introducing measures to deter, apprehend and punish offenders. Together with increasing patrols, new measures in the Heard and MCDonald islands fisheries include establishing a highlevel policy group, enhancing international agreements and increasing diplomatic pressure to target poachers. The courts also need to ensure that the full force of the law comes down on those who flout our fishing regulations. Of the five boats apprehended in the past few years, some of the vessels have been forfeited and heavy fines have been imposed. But I use the example of the apprehension of the fishing boat Eternal, which was chased for 12 hours in early July this year. This is the second time this year that the particular vessel has been caught poaching patagonian toothfish.

12,Ms GRIERSON,RESIGNATION,"The motion put forward by the honourable member for Pearce is worthy of our support. It addresses the serious economic, security and environmental concerns that are held by the Australian community generally with regard to illegal and unregulated poaching of our flora and fauna, but in particular this motion supports concerns regarding the illegal fishing of the patagonian toothfish within the Australian exclusive economic zone in the Southern Ocean. The concerns that Australians hold are directly related to protecting Australian jobs and local enterprises as well as the protection of our endangered and threatened species. The patagonian toothfish is highly prized and therefore is the subject of a great deal of poaching. It does have a relatively low fecundity rate and so the size of the illegal catches at the moment clearly threaten this species. Currently the value of illegal fishing is put between $250 million and $1 billion per annum, depending on the final retail price of those catches. That to our local industry in our southern waters. That industry currently generates $30 million per year and provides 120 direct and 500 indirect jobs. Environmentally, the illegal use of the long-line fishing method by poachers of the toothfish has a secondary effect, threatening particularly the albatross as well as other seabirds caught in the hundreds of hooks that are used. The motion also supports the government's action in proposing the listing of the patagonian toothfish on schedule 2 of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. This measure is to be encouraged. It is a stronger measure that enables a more global approach to monitoring illegal poaching of the toothfish and enlists the support of many more countries in policing the illegal trade of this species. The motion also notes the success of previous pursuit and apprehension activities by our Australian Defence Force, and it proposes tougher measures to be pursued. It is absolutely essential for the Australian government to take stronger measures against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing in our exclusive economic zone. To enforce that requires strong measures indeed. This motion proposes measures that should provoke consideration and debate rather than disagreement. To be successful, the measures require international diplomacy. That means raising these issues at international forums, entering into trade agreements that are mutually respectful and assisting neighbour nations such as Indonesia, where home porting is frequently an issue. To successfully track the trade in toothfish and locate sales and sources requires strong international cooperation. It seems that this government needs to lift its game in foreign diplomacy regarding trade and international relations. The motion also suggests that we need to build on the successful interception of three vessels over the past year. This raises issues of coastal surveillance, satellite monitoring and the presence of our ships around the Australian coastline. It is important that we be prepared to show our strength in policing our waters. This motion recommends something like a coastguard, to complement a nais a serious threat val presence. Having just come back from a week on a naval vessel in the north of Australia, I am very much aware of the current high level of demand on our Navy. I welcome the call for a coastguard presence, but I also think the government needs to reorder its priorities and to stop wasting funds on the Pacific solution so we can give our Australian Defence Force the resources it needs to effectively deal with the surveillance of our waters and the protection of our species. The other area that requires government attention for successful results is our support for international efforts aimed at better corporate regulation. Multiple front companies in ownership structures, organised crime, reflagging vessels to countries prepared to turn a blind eye to the source of the catch and bogus catch documentation papers are some of the things taking place. It seems to me that this is another area of corporate regulation that the government needs to give attention to. I support the motion and the proposed government action.",30
13,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,RESIGNATION,Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. The honourable member for Newcastle will have leave to continue her remarks when the debate resumes. General Practitioners,31
14,Ms HALL,RESIGNATION,"I move: That this House: (1) condemns the Howard Government for failing to address: (a) the shortage of general practitioners in regional, rural and outer metropolitan areas; and (b) the decline in general practitioners billing in these areas; and (2) calls on the Howard Government to immediately implement a strategy to address the decline and shortages. In moving this motion, I have to say that the Howard government's legacy to the Australian people is a chronic and worsening shortage of general practitioners throughout the country and the collapse of bulk-billing. Both the GP shortage and the decline in bulk-billing have been directly driven by the Howard government's policies-or lack of policies. We only have to look to statements made by the Prime Minister. Back in November 1986 he said: Medicare has been an unmitigated disaster. Then in June 1987 he said that when in government: The second thing we'll do is get rid of the bulkbilling system. It's an absolute rort. You can see that the philosophy and the policies of the government, and the Prime Minister in particular, have been formulated over a long time. They have very strongly held policies that do not support bulk-billing and do not support getting doctors into regional, rural and outer metropolitan areas. The GP shortage is causing a crisis throughout the country, with some communities facing the loss of their one and only GP. People who live in communities that have only one GP, or too few GPs, are having to wait an inordinate time for an appointment to see their doctor. The decline in the number of GPs has been fuelled by the Howard government's policies and initiatives, such as restricting provider numbers and failing to reform the outdated RAMA classification system. This system disadvantages many regional and outer metropolitan areas, such as the area I represent in this parliament. The Howard government has ignored authoritative studies and recommendations from health professionals and from communities trying to survive without adequate access to general practitioners. Instead of recognising that communities throughout Australia are experiencing genuine and real problems that require immediate action, the government has introduced ad hoc reactive bulk initiatives that have not stopped the decline or addressed the systemic problems. The government introduced bonded GPs to rural areas, but this has not changed the situation. In the recent budget, the government said that there would be 150 GP positions in outer metropolitan areas of the large capital cities. None of those doctors have come to the area that I am representing. I will talk a little more about that in a moment. The little town of Merriwa, in the electorate of Gwydir, had two GPs. Now one GP has gone and its last remaining GP is about to leave. There has been a lot of coverage in my local media about the last general practitioner leaving Karuah. There is a crisis in rural and regional areas. Part of the Shortland electorate comes within the Central Coast. The figures for general practitioners overall on the Central Coast come in at a bit below the national average. In the northern part of Wyong shire, in the area that I represent, there is one GP per 2,500 people. The recommended ratio is one per 1,000 people. In Gorokan, there is one GP per 2,154; in the communities of Budgewoi, Halekulani and Buff Point, there is one GP per 3,680 people; San Remo does not have a GP; and Doyalson and Bluehaven, in the Dobell electorate, do not have a GP. On and on it goes. It is an absolute crisis, and the government is ignoring areas like the Central Coast. People on the Central Coast tell me on a daily basis that it is not good enough that they have to wait seven to 14 days to get an appointment with a GP who is outside the area they live in. It is little wonder that you find there is an inordinate waiting period when you go to your local hospital. People cannot get an appointment with a GP, so the next thing they have to do is go to the local public hospital. People are waiting five hours to get access to the accident and emergency section when they should be able to go down and see their local GP. The effect that this is having is that it is shifting the cost of providing those services that should be provided through general practitioners and paid for by the Commonwealth to the states through public hospitals. I am absolutely disgusted with the government's inaction in this area. The Shortland electorate is one of the older electorates. It is the 12th oldest electorate in the country, and it has the 10th lowest median income. In effect, that inaction has forced people into the situation of having to make a decision to go to their local hospital, because those doctors who do remain on the Central Coast are no longer bulk-billing and those doctors in the northern part of the electorate are no longer bulk-billing. If I could just draw the House's attention to the figures that were released earlier this year, they show that the Shortland electorate has 62 per cent of GPs bulk-billing. But when you examine the figures a little more closely, you find that that is not quite true, because GPs are not bulk-billing everyone, they are bulk-billing some people. On the Central Coast, 63 per cent of general practitioners do not bulk-bill at all, 28 per cent partially bulk-bill and, of that 28 per cent, only nine per cent fully bulk-bill. That is hardly a pleasing record. On Thursday of last week, we surveyed 24 doctors in the northern part of the electorate. I think 24 doctors is a reasonable sample. Out of those that we surveyed, one doctor bulk-billed. So 4.7 per cent of those 24 doctors bulk-billed and 95.8 per cent did not bulk-bill. We found that 12.5 per cent of the doctors bulk-bill pensioners. Some of the doctors offered to accept an excess of $5 from their patients, and, if patients could pay up-front, they paid $27. When those patients who paid up-front got their $24.45 back from Medicare, they actually paid a lesser amount than those people who paid the excess because they could not afford to pay the fee. This is a government that believes health care, access to GPs, is there for those people who can afford it. It has adopted some initiatives, but they have not worked. Every time. I ring the doctors in my electorate and check how many of them are bulk-billing, there are fewer. Every time. I check to see what the waiting time for people is, it is longer. Every time. I check the ratio of doctors per head of population, it is higher. Urgent action is needed. It is time for the rhetoric and excuses to stop. The people of regional and rural and outer metropolitan areas throughout Australia demand this. They demand more GPs in their area and they demand a greater level of bulk-billing. The government stands condemned for its inaction, inaction that has led to a crisis in communities throughout Australia. The people of Australia demand a genuine commitment to Medicare, something this government has never given. (Time expired)",31
15,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,RESIGNATION,Is the motion seconded? Mr Martyn Evans-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,32
16,Mr JOHN COBB,RESIGNATION,"Parkes) (1.27 p.m.)The member for Shortland has once again ventured into country, or regional, affairs. I recall that the last time she did this was to protest about how she believed the Regional Solutions Program was being ripped off. It was interesting to note that she was actually right in saying that her electorate had received very little or nothing out of Regional Solutions, because her electorate got exactly what it applied for under her guidance, which was exactly nothing. They had applied for no programs and obviously got none. Likewise on the health issue: while I am the first person to say that country Australia has a long way to go in perfecting health situations, we do have a government that, in six years, has done immeasurably more than 13 years of the Hawke-Keating Labor government ever attempted to do. To totally ignore it was its way of handling it. In fact, under this government $29 billion per annum has been spent on health. Under the HawkeKeating government, $18 billion per annum was spent. That, in itself, says a lot. We actually have a strategy to help and to improve what happens in country Australia in increasing the number of GPs and nurses, registered or otherwise, and in allied health service. Right at this time, $104 million is being spent on helping nurses take the load off doctors, on getting more nurses into medical practices and on getting more nurses into country Australia. Right at this time, million is being spent to support rural GPs, the new ones who may be coming from overseas or who may be coming from metropolitan Australia. In general practice incentives, there can be a financial incentive of up to $60,000 to get into country Australia. I do not call that noring the problems of health in country and rural Australia. Almost $50 million is being spent to get allied health professionals out into country areas, in areas such as mental health, physio and paediatrics. Some $12 million is being spent simply getting specialists to areas like Broken Hill and Dubbo, in my electorate. Our plan-and this was absent for 13 years prior to our government getting office-is to put doctors out into country Australia. With regard to nursing, our aim is to train, educate and encourage our own kids. We all know that the only long-term way to solve the shortage of practitioners in country areas is to train our kids. There is $5.2 million ing spent in the short term to re-educate all those nurses out there now who are not in the work force. There are scholarships-400 of them, at up to $3,000 each-to retrain nurses to get them into our hospitals and our medical services. I do not recall any such program in the 13 years of Labor, when the numbers of doctors and nurses almost faded out. There is $23 million being spent on regional scholarships for nursing at regional universities. In other words, we are doing what we can to train our kids in areas they can get to: regional universities. There are 250 scholarships of up to $10,000. We have $21 million going into courses for aged carers, GP training and clinical schools. In Dubbo, in my electorate, there is a clinical school where city educated kids can come and see what an incredible experience it is to practise among country people. There are kids coming out for eight weeks at a time in the third year of their training. They are doing it around Australia in places such as the Dubbo Clinical School. It is absolutely going to revolutionise what is happening. We did not see that in the 13 years of Labor. In fact, when this government took office, eight per cent of kids going into medical schools $10 around Australia came from regional Australia. That figure has tripled, up to 24 per cent. That does not sound to me like a government doing nothing to enhance medicine in rural and regional Australia. What about the $72½ million being spent over the next few years in establishing six ig- oncology centres for radiation cancer treatment out in country Australia? Six centres at $12 million a pop so that people will not have to travel to Melbourne and Sydney to get radiation treatment. That does not sound to me like a government not looking after country Australia's health problems. There is $100 million for capital upgrading of aged care homes. There is $47½ million for aged care nursing scholarships for carers. There is $69 million for 6,000 aged care packages. That does not sound to me like a government not caring about helping country Australia. I could go on. There is $650 million being spent by this government specifically on rural and regional aged care funding; almost $700 million of new spending on health. As I besay, it does not sound to me like a government which is ignoring rural health. Let me go through a few things that have happened in the Parkes electorate over the last few years. In Condobolin, $1.1 million went towards the Aboriginal health service. In Cobar, $60,000 was spent just on a study into a regional health service centre, which is needed. In Broken Hill, there was $120,000 for the provision of specialist services. In Lachlan shire, there was $350,000 for primary health services. In the far west-in Menindee, Ivanhoe and the very small towns in the far west-there was $400,000 for a wide range of health services. In Dubbo, the biggest city in my electorate, there was almost $700,000 for specialists such as neurologists and psychiatrists, and palliative care, geriatric services and rehabilitation. There was $5,000 for the Macquarie Area Health Service and $800,000 for youth drug detox rehabilitation. There was $150,000 for Dubbo, Broken Hill and Central Darling shires for dementia carers. My electorate has had $21½ million put into it by this government to ease the health burden. There was $43,000 to employ staff with dementia expertise. If there is one electorate in this country that is representative truly rural and regional electorates, it is tainly the seat of Parkes. There was $60,000 for the Far West Area Health Service and $4½ million to the Royal Flying Doctor Service. There has been $19 million or $20 million, going up to $21.5 million. If that is pork-barrelling, I am proud of a government that has managed to put in that kind of money. Let me tell Labor: if we had not paid off the $96 billion debt that you left us with and had had to pay $5½ billion in interest every year, the money would not have been there to do it. That is why you did not put any of it into country Australia over the 13 years that you were in government. Mr Deputy Speaker, Labor swagged so much into debt that they could not do it. This government have paid it back and they are doing it. We are also, I believe, talking about bulkbilling. We cannot force doctors to bulkbill-that is a choice that they make. But we have put almost $700 million directly into rural and regional Australia's health services. We cannot force doctors to bulk-bill. The member for Shortland would do well to think about what she says before she says it again, because in 1990, when her now deputy leader was adviser to the health minister, bulk-billing levels were at 70 per cent. They are now at 75 per cent.",32
17,Mr MARTYN EVANS,RESIGNATION,"I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the member Shortland for bringing to the attention of the House and to the people of Australia the continuing problems which those in rural areas, and indeed in the outer metropolitan areas that I have the honour to represent in this House-in northern metropolitan Adelaide-have with the issues of bulk-billing and of gaining sufficient numbers of general practitioners to provide adequate services to those areas. The reality is that, while you can list as many individual projects as you choose in some electorates, you cannot hide from the fact that medicine is outcome driven. In those electorates, the outcomes as far as the population is concerned are that levels of bulkbilling, of availability, of country GPs, of some services-for example, delivery servof ices for pregnant women-are declining for cerspecific reasons. Many of them can be related directly back to policy decisions by this government. I would relate this to as far back as 1975 when the then Liberal government of Malcolm Fraser promised to maintain Medibank. While this government has made the same commitment, it has honoured it in technical and legal ways but not with the direct policy commitment which the previous Labor government had. That very important policy has been directly and strongly supported by the people of this country since Gough Whitlam had the courage to bring it in all those years ago, back in 1972 after that famous election. The next Labor government of this country will have the honour of reinstating and reinvigorating that policy. The Howard government-and the Fraser government in its day-technically maintained that policy but they have honoured it more in the breach than in the maintenance, so to speak. While they have very quickly found billions of dollars every year to support their crisis in private health insurance, they have not found the billions of dollars necessary to support the obvious ongoing crisis in rural health and in the delivery of health services in outer metropolitan areas. As the people of rural Australia will quickly tell you, and as the people in outer metropolitan electorates like mine will equally quickly tell you, it is becoming very difficult to find doctors who are readily able to provide those services and who are able economically to continue to bulk-bill people whose economic situation demands that they and their families be bulk-billed. The reality is that this government has failed to increase the level of remuneration for doctors who do bulk-bill. They have left those doctors in an economic and financial position where they have no alternative but to decrease the level of bulk-billing which they are able to offer. As is so often the case with financial crises in this country-be they in the corporate sector, and we have only to look at One.Tel; in the insurance sector, with HIH; in the line sector, as with Ansett; or in the health sector, with the doctors' fiduciary insurance crisis, which we have seen with the medical defence funds recently-the government only acts, if at all, at the eleventh hour. We are running up against a further ongoing crisis in the medical indemnity insurance field which will again leave doctors footing the bill and passing that bill on to their patient clients. It is that kind of situation which is leaving country doctors in particular, and in obstetrics especially, with a crisis of their own in delivering babies in country areas, which is one of the most significant areas of concern in the bush. I know from my own experience as a former state health minister that, when you go out into those areas, people like to receive holistic care from their GPs and from their medical service providers. This government has failed them in so many ways, be it in the lack of indemnity care, in the lack of specialist services or in the lack of GPs. GPs are no longer able, because of their declining numbers in those districts and because of the lack of backup, to offer the complete care which they long to offer and which they were once able to offer. They can no longer offer this care to their clients and friends in the bush and in the outer metropolitan areas because of the policy failures of this government and because of the declining numbers of doctors who find it possible to work in that preferred environment. (Time expired)",34
18,Mr BARTLETT,RESIGNATION,"Like so many motions from the other side, this one fails to consider the facts. This is clear in relation to the issue of bulkbilling, as the member for Parkes has already pointed out. Currently, 75 per cent of GPs' services are bulk-billed. In 1990, under Labor, it was only 70 per cent. Rather than a decline, there has in fact been an increase of five per cent. However, I want to focus on the issue of regional, rural and outer metropolitan services. Yes, there is a shortage of medical services in many regional, rural and outer metropolitan areas. We are experiencing the effects of that in parts of my electorate, and I have been working for some time to have those services improved. However, the air- members opposite missed the two critical points. The first point is that the shortage of services in rural and regional areas is not a recent phenomenon. It has not happened overnight. There was a long-term decline for the 13 years under Labor. It is dishonest for Labor now to suggest otherwise. Secondly, unlike the other side, the coalition government is trying to do something about this. In recent years, this government has introduced the biggest package of initiatives to address these issues of any federal government. During its time in office, the Labor Party sat on its hands. Ms Hall-You are in office now.",35
19,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,RESIGNATION,The member for Shortland has had her opportunity.,35
20,Mr BARTLETT,RESIGNATION,"It did nothing and now its members want to somehow complain that the changes are not happening quickly enough. I will outline the coalition's measures to improve the level of health services in rural, regional and outer metropolitan Australia. In 1999 the government implemented a rural retention program-$60 million to help rural communities retain their GPs-to reverse the drain which had been occurring for years under Labor. In the 2000-01 budget, a $562 million four-year strategy was announced to improve the level of health services in the bush. This included $102 million to increase the number of GPs in rural Australia; $48 million for the Medical Specialists Outreach Assistant Program to provide greater access to specialist services; $49 million to fund increased allied services such as nursing, physiotherapy and psychology; $32 million to fund 100 new scholarships for new medical students, in return for a commitment to work for at least six years in rural Australia; $14 million for a chronic disease support package for small communities to target illnesses such as asthma, heart disease, stroke and renal failure; $42 million to assist pharmacies in rural areas; and $30 million to help revitalise bush nursing and small regional hospitals. In last year's budget, the government introduced a $104 million package to provide support for practise nurses to assist those regional and outer metropolitan areas. In year's budget, the government announced another $80 million over the next four years to attract GPs to outer metropolitan areas where there is a shortage.",35
21,The SPEAKER,RESIGNATION,"Order! It being 1.45 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 101. The debate may be resumed at a later hour and the member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA Roads: National Highways Network",36
22,Mr LATHAM,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Werriwa) (1.45 p.m.)The most contentious transport issue in my electorate concerns the federal government's failure to fully fund the M5 ramps at Ingleburn, even though this project is part of the National Highway Network, a very clear federal government responsibility. The transport minister, Mr Anderson, announced last month that he was only willing to meet two-thirds of the estimated $7 million cost. This is an example of federal government cost shifting onto state and local government. The government has an inquiry into cost shifting; this instance should be exhibit A. Instead of attacking Campbelltown Council over this issue, the member for Macarthur, Mr Farmer, should be fighting for full federal funding. As he admitted at a public meeting on 3 July, the Howard government did nothing about the ramps for six years. The member for Macarthur said that he was the first federal MP from Campbelltown to personally approach Mr Anderson on this issue. This is a terrible reflection on his Liberal predecessor in the seat of Macarthur, Mr John Fahey. According to Mr Farmer, John Fahey sat at the same cabinet room table with the minister for transport for six years, and never raised the issue of the M5 ramps-an essential piece of infrastructure in south-west Sydney. They reckon that I am tough on the Liberal Party; here is one of their own attacking his Liberal Party predecessor, John Fahey-someone who is recovering from the trauma of lung cancer. He has been pretty hard on his own side, but I suppose, at one level, there is some truth in what he says: the government in did nothing for six years about the M5 ramps this at Ingleburn, and now we have a lame-duck announcement from the Minister-just two-thirds of the funding-(Time expired) Aviation: Industrial Action",36
23,Mr BAIRD,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Today, Australia's air services have been paralysed by a strike brought on by the Australian Services Union. They have called their members to strike for a five per cent increase in salary this year and a five per cent increase next year-three other unions have agreed to a three plus three-and this is in addition to the bonus, already received, based on the level of performance over the past 12 months. It really is irresponsible for the ASU to take this action now. I notice that it is being supported by less than 30 per cent of its members, many of whom live in my electorate. I have more airline employees living in my electorate than anybody else in the House. This is a time when United Airlines have notified its creditors that they plan to apply for chapter 11 bankruptcy, US Air has gone into bankruptcy procedures, Swiss Air and Sabena have fallen over as airlines because of the level of debt following September 11, Alitalia has asked for government assistance, as has Malaysian Airways, and Air New Zealand is now 80 per cent owned by the New Zealand government because of their problems. So, with the monopoly they have of almost 90 per cent of the Australian market, comes responsibility. Disrupting air services without a significant alternative airline, as we had before, means that we should consider the situation. (Time expired) Tasmania: Elections",36
24,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I would like to congratulate Jim Bacon, Paul Lennon and the Labor team in Tasmania-particularly those new members-on their very successful recent electoral victory. In my own electorate, I would like to congratulate Bryan Green on his elevation to the ministry as minister for primary industries, Steve Kons as the Cabinet Secretary and spokesperson for the Treasurer in the Lower House, my colleague Brenton Best, and also a candidate who unfortunately was not successful, Michael Gaffney, but who made a very good showing. He certainly has a future in politics and serving his community. The Bacon government's success was the result of stable government, progressive policies and the fact that we are a united party. We get a lot of press on the modernisation of the Australian Labor Party, particularly at a federal level; we have just had Lynton Crosby go through Tasmania and its Liberal branch, with 94 recommendations on how to modernise itself. He effectively said it was replete with personality politics, personal agendas, a right-wing rump, particularly located in southern Tasmania-I will not name names, they know who they areand massive disunity, even in my own electorate of Braddon. So they have got a lot of work to do, as they do in Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia. One of the things I would like to say about the victory in Tasmania is that they have pilfered one of my staff. Matthew Sullivan, thank you for all your good work, and farewell. (Time expired) Hurley, Mrs Jessie",37
25,Mr LLOYD,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"It is with some sadness that I report to the parliament on the passing of one of my constituents, Mrs Jessie Hurley. Mrs Hurley was, until her death, Australia's oldest living dent. She was a constituent of mine, but she was also a lady that I classed as a friend. A grand old lady of the Central Coast, she passed away quietly on 6 August this year, and I was able to attend her funeral on Friday, 9 August. Mrs Hurley lived at the Terrigal House Nursing Home and, prior to that, at the Terrigal Glenn Retirement Village. She had a very large family. She was born Jessie Stubbs in Riverstone on 15 June 1890, and she was married to James Hurley. They had eight children and, at the time of her death, her legacy, which is quite extraordinary, included 20 grandchildren, 47 great-grandchildren and 56 great-great-grandchildren. I was very pleased that our Prime Minister, John Howard, was able to send a personal note of condolence to Mrs Hurley's daughter young Jessie Hurley, who is herself in her eighties and also a friend of mine. I am very privileged to have known Mrs Hurley. She visited me on a number of occasions. (Time expired) Green, Mr Bernie",37
26,Dr EMERSON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I want to use this opportunity to pay tribute to Bernie Green. Bernie was a good friend of mine and a good friend of a very large number of people in Queensland. His position was as a very close adviser to Lord Mayor Jim Soorley but he died recently at what is really the tender age of 53. Bernie showed wonderful generosity of spirit. Whenever we saw him he got us laughing. He had a wonderful attitude towards life and was able to attract around him true support and friendship. He worked very hard for the St Vincent de Paul Society and it was a mark of the man that he gave so much of himself. I want to express our sadness to his wife, Heather, and to his mum, also both great people. We all lament and are very saddened by the passing of Bernie Green. Australian Rail Track Corporation",37
27,Mr MCARTHUR,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I wish to raise yet again the important meeting that was held at Cressy in the heartland of Corangamite on 8 August relating to the Australian Rail Track Corporation. Mr David Marchant is the CEO of the corporaresition, and he came to that meeting. He became aware of the potential for fire in the region between Inverleigh and Cressy, and we gave him a briefing on related matters on the rail track-the problem of the rolling stock that might create fire, the problem of burning off and the possibility that the holders could be burnt out in the forthcoming fire season. I place on the record the landholders' great satisfaction that Mr David Marchant turned up, looked at the track himself and undertook to take further action in relation to spraying of the phalaris and ensuring that the possibility of a major fire taking place in the forthcoming season be much lessened. It demonstrates that there new era of railways: the ARTC control the track and private sector operators move from Melbourne to Adelaide using their rolling stock. There are problems of public liability insurance and problems of controlling the track and burning off and ensuring that the independent private sector operators have world's best practice. (Time expired) Telecommunications: Mobile Telephone Towers",37
28,Mr MURPHY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I wish to bring to the attention of the House today a serious health and environmental issue affecting my electorate of Lowe. I speak on behalf of over 1,000 residents and small business people from Wareemba, Abbotsford and Five Dock in my electorate of Lowe. They are angry about the recent installation of a so-called low-impact mobile phone facility by Hutchison Telecom at 286 Great North Road, Wareemba. Local residents and local businesses deserve to be properly notified and to have an opportunity to object on health or environmental grounds, regardless of empty assurances from mobile telephone companies. The Telecommunications Act 1997 and the current telecommunications code of practice allow mobile telephone companies to install so called low-impact mobile telephone facilities without the need for a local council development application or any written notification to affected local residents and local businesses. This is special treatment for mobile telephone companies while the rights of local residents and local businesses are ignored. Residents have had enough of this kind of arrogance, and Australians feel sick every time they witness the cosy relationship the government has with the big banks and the telecommunications carriers and the sweet landdeals, such as the one made by the government with the new owners of Sydney airport. Today I will table a petition from over 1,000 residents and business people in Lowe, calling for changes to the telecommunications code of practice to stop mobile telephone companies treating people with contempt. I refer the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator is a Richard Alston, to my question No. 667 on today's Notice Paper. (Time expired) Roads: Scoresby Freeway",38
29,Mr BILSON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Mr Speaker, you would be disappointed if I had not returned after seven weeks to give you an update on the Scoresby Freeway. We have some good news: a small step forward, overseen by the Bracks government, will see about 1,000 holes dug in the 40-odd kilometre length of the freeway. We are doing soil tests as part of the application of the funds the Commonwealth has provided to the project, but we still do not know when actual construction work will commence. The community of Dunkley and those at the southern end of the freeway are still unclear about when work will commence and when the Scoresby Freeway infrastructure will be available to support the development of our community. Almost one-fifth of all the available industrial and commercially zoned land in Greater Melbourne is in the greater Frankston city area. That great resource, available to promote economic opportunities, employee opportunities and further investment and also to improve living standards for our community, sits idle while we wait for the Bracks government to get off their backsides and start working on the project. They continue to shop around, looking for funding and pursuing private resourcing. They still have not made a commitment to the project. (Time expired) Youth: Blacktown Youth Orientation",38
30,Mr MOSSFIELD,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I rise to speak about the second annual Blacktown Youth Orientation youth forum that was held in my office on Saturday, 17 August 2002. Like last year's BYO, the thought behind the day was to gauge the concerns of the youth of my local area and see what we could do about those concerns. This year we had very enthusiastic participants from Blacktown Girls High School, Nagle Girls College and Mitchell High School. One of our guest speakers was Ehsan Fallahi, who again was able to address the group about his experiences on the Prime Minister's Youth Roundtable and his recent trip to England as one of only two Australian representatives at the global youth summit. Ehsan also works tirelessly promoting a positive image of the youth of the area. Angela Humphries was our second guest speaker. She is a representative of the New South Wales Premier's Youth Advisory Committee. She was able to highlight the programs and the committees in place for the youth of New South Wales. Overall, the day was a great success. Like last year, the students who had participated in the BYO presented me with a private members' statement that they drafted. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the participants in the Blacktown Youth Orientation 2002. I look forward to bringing their concerns to the attention of this federal parliament. Education: Funding",38
31,Mr TICEHURST,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Dobell) (1.58 p.m.)Last week I had the pleasure of being involved with some school openings in our area on the Central Coast. There are a number of schools which the federal government has contributed funding to, including Lake Munmorah High School, which received more than $15 million, out of a total project cost of $17 million, from the federal government. Further, we have another public school in the Dobell electorate where the federal government has contributed $12 million, in a project worth $23 million-in this case, the state government put in $10 million and the Wyong Shire Council put in $1 million. This really goes to show that the government is serious about education-serious enough to commit large capital funding to local public schools. There was $15 million put into Munmorah, $12 million into Wadalba and, in addition, we had a further opening of extensions at a school in Chittaway Bay, where the federal government contributed to new classrooms and new computer facilities. It was certainly interesting to be there as the local member and to see the way these people are being educated.",39

38,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Is the minister aware of an article by the national security adviser to former Republican President George Bush, Mr Brent Scowcroft, in which he stated: An attack on Iraq at this time would seriously jeopardise, if not destroy, the global campaign against terrorism we have undertaken.

As a general rule, there the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and of each department reflects that of the portfolio Veterans' Affairs in the Defence portfolio. Does the minister agree or disagree with the former national security adviser's position?",41
39,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I have had the opportunity to read Brent Scowcroft's article, and I think that, at the end of the day, these are balance of judgment arguments about a hypothetical proposition. The important thing to understand here is that, first of all, the international community, including the United States, needs to maintain as much pressure as it possibly can on Iraq to comply with the United Nations Security Council resolutions and to allow in United Nations inspectors from UNMOVIC to ensure that all weapons of mass destruction capabilities within Iraq are destroyed. The task at the moment is to make sure that everything is done to achieve that. If the United States eventually comes to a conclusion that it has no alternative but to take military action-and that is, of course, a hypothetical proposition-and when that time comes, if it ever does come, then I do not doubt that the sorts of issues that Mr Scowcroft and others who have been participating in this debate have raised will be taken into account. But obviously, at the end of the day, these issues are always difficult issues and always boil down to a very complex balance of judgment, and the judgment about a question of going to war would be one that no doubt the United States administration, in particular the President, would weigh very heavily. No doubt there would be substantial consultations with allies. All of this, if that situation were to arise, would arise in circumstances where it was perfectly clear that United Nations efforts, which are still going on, would irretrievably have broken down-there is no question of that. Today, in August 2002, efforts are still being made fervently by UNMOVIC, the United Nations agency which is responsible for the inspections in Iraq, and by the Secretary General himself, so we wish them well. Trade: LNG Contract with China",41
40,Mr HAASE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Would the Prime Minister inform the House of Australia's LNG contract with China and the implications for our standing in the region?,42
41,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for that question. It is appropriate that a question on this matter should be asked by a Western Australian member of the House of Representatives. The decision to award this very important contract to the Australian consortium is a major trade milestone for this country. It is the largest single trade deal ever entered into by Australia. a major win for Australia's energy industry and also for a combined Australian commercial and diplomatic effort. I would like to pay tribute not only to the leaders of the companies but also to the pioneering work carried out by Richard Court, the former Premier of Western Australia. Also let me compliment the Premier of Western Australia, Dr Gallop, on his contribution. Can I say that, in the 6½ years I have been Prime Minister, I have seen no better diplomatic effort than that carried out by our ambassador in Beijing, David Irvine. I do want to record my thanks to him. I took the opportunity, after the news came through, to telephone him and thank him very warmly. I want to record in this parliament that this country is served very well in many of its sensitive posts by high-quality diplomats, and David Irvine is certainly one of them. The work that he did on this was quite extraordinary. May I also thank the Leader of the Opposition for the support that he gave to the project, and also, while I am in this kind of mood, can I thank the former Prime Minister of Australia, Gough Whitlam, who visited China in connection with the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Australia and the People's Republic. This outcome highlights the maturity of Australia's bilateral relationship with China. It demonstrates the capacity of this country in the early years of the 21st century to have a close relationship with nations that in other respects are very different one from the other. Australia's exports to China nearly doubled to $7.6 billion in 2001, since the government was elected. China is now our fourth largest export market and our third largest trading partner. It is not just trade which has been a mark of the maturing of that relationship: it has been in many other respects as well. It also highlights the importance, when dealing with countries such as China, of high-level political contact. I have no doubt that the high-level political contact between me and the Premier and the President of China were elements in the decision that was finally taken. But in the end you do not win a It is commercial contract unless you have a good product at the right price, and the Australian companies and the other companies that put together this bid deserve our congratulations. It is something that all Australians can feel pleased about. It will be important in underwriting the future strengths of the commercial relationship between Australia and China. It is a reminder to those who would argue otherwise that this country has a mature and full capacity to relate to major powconcern ers in all parts of the world, and suggestions that this country under this government has downgraded our relations with China, or indeed with any other part of the Asia-Pacific region, are what they have always beencompletely unfounded allegations. Foreign Affairs: Iraq",42
42,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Is the minister aware of a recent statement Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, Republican secretary of state to former President George Bush, that, ‘Unless the President can make a very compelling case that Saddam Hussein has his finger on a weapon of mass destruction and is about ready to use it, I do not think this is the time to go to war against Saddam Hussein. I think we have other targets, terrorist targets, that we ought to be paying attention to'? Do you agree or disagree with the former Republican secretary of state?",43
43,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I appreciate his interest and the consideration in asking that question. There are lots of different views that have been expressed in the United States. I do not want to set myself up as a commentator on every view that has been expressed by every person in the United States, but I noticed, in my case in quite some detail, quite a lively debate in the United States expressing different views about this whole question of Iraq. I repeat what I said in answer to the previous question: of course the President of the United States has not yet made-if he ever will make-a decision to take military action against Iraq. The United States have said that they do not have a plan on the President's desk at the moment, but obviously the President and the administration are deeply concerned-and I think rightly deeply concerned-about not only Iraq's refusal to accept its obligations under the United Nations Security Council resolutions by denying access to Iraq by United Nations inspectors but also about weapons of mass destruction capability in Iraq, and particularly chemical and biological weapons. The other issue that I know is of great in the United States is that Iraq, it is said, provides support to terrorist organisations operating through the Palestinian territories into Israel. It is believed that the Iraqi administration provides $US25,000 to the families of suicide bombers who kill Israelis in places such as discotheques, shopping centres, restaurants and so on, and obviously that is a matter of enormous concern as well. I think the point here is that this is an exby tremely serious issue because of Iraq's record, the capabilities of Iraq and its defiance of the international community. In those circumstances obviously in the United States there will be a good deal of discussion over the next few months about what the United States could or could not do in the event of diplomacy breaking down. Everybody hopes that the efforts of the United Nations, the Security Council, UNMOVIC and the Secretary-General will be successful, but it is hard to know whether they will be because the record of the relationship between the regime in Iraq and United Nations inspectors has not been a happy one. As members will recall, Richard Butler-very well known on the other side of the House particularly-was the chairman of the United Nations special commission responsible for inspections in Iraq. His inspection regime ultimately foundered in 1998 on the grounds that UNSCOM- Mr Butler and UNSCOM generally-were unable to fulfil their obligations under Security Council resolutions. I really do not have anything more to add to that. It is an issue that in the context of the United States will be debated, and we will see what happens over time. If United Nations diplomacy finally fails, I suppose in those circumstances the debate will take on a different nature. Trade: Wheat Exports to Iraq",43
44,Mr FORREST,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Trade. Would the minister inform the House of the successful outcome of the quarantine dispute between the Australian Wheat Board Ltd and the Iraqi Grains Board? Is the minister aware of any alternative view?,43
45,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question and recognise his significant interest in the activities of the Australian Wheat Board and their success in their export effort on behalf of Australian wheat farmers, a lot of whom are in his electorate. In response to the question, I can inform the House that over the weekend the Australian Wheat Board and the Iraqi Grains Board reached a successful outcome in the quarantine dispute over Australian wheat exports to Iraq. Members would be aware that there was a dispute over an alleged contamination issue, and a question about the quality of a number of shiploads of wheat en route to Iraq waiting to be unloaded. That issue has been resolved, which is excellent news for the Australian Wheat Board and for Australian wheat farmers and their families. The outcome that has been achieved with Iraq has certainly vindicated the federal ernment's faith in the AWB and its ability to successfully manage its commercial dealings with the Iraqi Grains Board. Historically, Australia has exported around two million tonnes of wheat per year under the United Nations oil for food program. This latest come means that Australian wheat farmers will have sold almost 1.8 million tonnes of quality Australian wheat to Iraq this year, only some 200,000 tonnes short of what accurately gets recorded as wheat exports to Iraq each year. I take this opportunity to inform the House-on top of the good news that broke yesterday-that the Australian Wheat Board has also recently secured an order for a further 50,000 tonnes of Australian wheat to Jordan, the first order since 1996. More importantly, following the recent trade delegation that I led to Libya, which included the Chairman of the Australian Wheat Board, the Wheat Board has secured an order for 50,000 tonnes of wheat to Libya. That is a result of that visit in the last month to Libya. Those two new orders are worth roughly $A25 million. These announcements vindicate our government's support of the Australian Wheat Board in its efforts to successfully manage those commercial dealings with the Iraqi Grains Board, and in working to open up much needed new markets for the Australian wheat farming community. Foreign Affairs: Iraq",44
46,Mr LEO MCLEAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Minister, are you aware of statements by Congressman Richard Armey, Republican majority leader of the US House of Representatives, on 15 August arguing against a US military attack on Iraq? Do you agree with the position articulated by the Republican majority leader or is he just appeasing Iraq?",44
47,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not know that I have a great deal to add to the answers to the two previous questions which were about statements made by Americans. There are different points of view being put in the United States on this issue, some by Democrats who disagree with each other, some by Republicans who disagree with each other. I govsuppose ultimately the policy of the United States will be determined by the United States administration, made up obviously first and foremost by the President himself and by the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense and the National Security Adoutviser. They have all expressed views of one sort or another on this issue as well-many have in recent times. We look forward to hearing all sorts of different views coming out of the United States. Economy: Performance",44
48,Mr SOMLYAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Would the Treasurer provide the House with an update on developments in the international economy since the House last sat in June, and the implications for the Australian economy?",44
49,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Fairfax for his question. Global economic conditions remain weak, and there are increasing risks to the outlook. The United States continues to record slow economic growth, expanding at nearly 0.3 per cent in the June quarter. Growth in Europe is subdued, with the German, French and Italian economies recording little or no growth. The Japanese economy remains in recession, contracting by 1.6 per cent in the year to March 2000. Since the House last met, there has been enormous volatility on international markets. The Dow Jones industrial index is now around 25 per cent below the peak that it reached in January 2000. In Europe and Asia markets are around 30 per cent below their peak. The risk in those countries is if the financial market volatility and the equity market volatility were to feed back into the real economy, bruising consumer and business confidence. The Australian economy, however, continues to grow, notwithstanding the fact that the drought appears to be worsening, with some 82 per cent of New South Wales drought declared, with a further 10 per cent at risk, and 16 per cent of Queensland also drought declared. There is now a serious situation developing in rural Australia which will impact on domestic growth here. Notwithstanding that, retail trade increased a very strong 6.3 per cent over the year. Dwelling investment appears to be holding up. Whilst there is some softening, in today's ACCI small business barometer conditions appear to be stronger than they were around 12 months ago. No doubt the weak international situation is now feeding back into businesses' perceptions in relation to prospects for the forthcoming year. The recent Economist averages poll forecasts Australia to be the strongest growing economy in the developed world in both 2002 and 2003. Australia's prospects will be affected by developments overseas, but we are able to cope with developments overseas because of important economic reformsincluding the reform of the taxation system, which has taken taxes off our exports and given our exporters a fairer go on world and international markets. More needs to be done. More needs to be done on fiscal policy, where the government's budget measures should be passed by the Senate. More needs to be done in relation to international tax reform, and the government will shortly announce a program in relation to that. More needs to be done in relation to labour market reform. If there is one thing that could have direct and immediate impact in this country on improving Australia's economic prospects and the prospects of tens of thousands of small businesses throughout Australia, it is labour market reform. If the Senate would anticipate and hear the cries of small business in Australia in relation to unfair dismissal laws and other labour market reform, this would be a great development for Australia. We appeal for some responsibility from the Australian Labor Party in relation to those measures, which could make the Australian economy stronger. Foreign Affairs: Iraq",44
50,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Does the minister recall being asked a question in an ABC interview on 18 July as to whether he was concerned about the possible use of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction against any invading US military force? Does the minister recall answering that question: If I may say so, it is an extraordinary thing to think that that was a critical issue. Is the minister further aware of the observation contained in the Wall Street Journal article by former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft of 15 August that, in the event of a US invasion: Saddam would be likely to conclude he had nothing left to lose, leading him to unleash whatever weapons of mass destruction he possesses. Minister, do you still stand by your statement of 18 July that you do not regard the possible use of weapons of mass destruction by Iraq against a US or allied military force as a critical issue, or will you now withdraw those remarks?",45
51,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not have the transcript of the interview with me, but the critical issue is Iraq's possession of weapons of mass destruction. Without trying to recall exactly the details of that interview, my point is that that is the central question. That is why this is a very grave and very serious issue. Anybody who understands the economics, the politics and the geopolitics of the Middle East, and in particular Iraq, and anyone who has a good understanding of the modern history of Iraq and of the behaviour of the government in Iraq knows that the possession by Iraq of weapons of mass destruction, of chemical and biological weapons and possibly Iraq developing yet again a nuclear weapons program-of course, they originally worked on a nuclear weapons program and there is some debate about whether or not they are, but assuming that they areis the central issue. Questions about what would happen if the Americans launched a military strike against Iraq are questions very much about the details of military tactics and military strategy. There are a lot of different ways that action could be taken against another country if a decision were made to take that action. For me, there is no doubt about it. I think this whole question of weapons of mass destruction is a profoundly serious and a profoundly important issue. So seriously has this government taken this issue-and, by the way, I think the previous government took it very seriously as well; to be fair, my predecessor took that issue very seriously-that I as the foreign minister and the government took to the United Nations General Assembly in September 1996 the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. We got the United Nations General Assembly to adopt the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and that treaty is one the benchmarks in the world for nuclear non-proliferation. The possession of weapons of mass destruction is an enormous issue, particularly the possession of those weapons by an administration which has, as has been said on many occasions, used those weapons. It used them against Iran in 1984. Ironically, for the purposes of this discussion, it was after the use of those weapons of mass destruction against the Iranians-and I think something like 5,000 Iranians were killed on that occasion by chemical weapons-that the Australia group was established. It was designed to stop the trade in precursors for those weapons where it was felt that trade existed. Iraq has used chemical weapons against its own population, as I know the House is well aware. That is the central and most serious issue. Hypothetical questions about what might and might not happen in a war and so on are questions for military tacticians. If Iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction, it could not use them. That is the central issue. Mr Rudd-Because of the foreign minister's uncertainty, I seek leave of the House to table a transcript of his extraordinary remarks to the ABC on weapons of mass destruction. Leave granted. Rural and Regional Australia: Airline Services",45
52,Mrs HULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Would the Deputy Prime Minister update the House on recent developments in regional aviation in the Riverina and in Australia? Is the minister aware of any alternative policies or recent actions which could undermine the aviation industry in this country?,46
53,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Riverina for her question and place on record my appreciation-and I think that of all who depend on Kendell and Hazelton, as they were, for their aviation services-for the work that she put into securing their future over what has been a very of difficult nine or 10 months. I am delighted to be able to report to the House that, after a very difficult period in regional aviation, on 6 August I was able to help launch a new airline, Regional Express, which will fly to some 30 towns and centres across eastern Australia with a total of almost 1,300 flights weekly, operating a fleet of Saabs and Metro 23s. The new airline will be known as Rex, short for Regional Express. I know that the towns that they service are delighted to have a future for those airlines and for their services. I know, though, that no-one is more delighted than the very good people who work for those two smaller airlines, Kendell types of and Hazelton, now combined as Rex. The government sought to play an active role in this. We extended the Hazelton deed of company arrangement in a way that prevented premature liquidation. Indeed, I commented a couple of times that, in this case, it was agonisingly slow-but better a slow deal than no deal. We also provided some $5 million to the new outfit, having already provided substantial financial resourcing to Hazelton and Kendell while they were in administration, because of our commitment to services in regional areas. The grant that we have made is conditional upon that new airline maintaining services to centres previously served only by Kendell or Hazelton in the past. Nonetheless, I am delighted that we have made this progress and indeed also glad to acknowledge that the CEO of Rex, Mr Michael Jones, has publicly stated that, without the government's support, there would have been no sale. While on matters of aviation, and in stark contrast to the support that we have provided for regional aviation, I do want to take this opportunity to roundly condemn today's strike action by the Australian Services Union, which will disrupt hundreds of Qantas flights today and further destabilise an industry that is just beginning to find its feet and, in particular, help service those industries that are still seeking to recover from upsets of last year, including September 11. Most of all, that involves the tourism industry. The tourism industry is just beginning to get its numbers back again. I would have thought this sort of action by members of the Australian Services Union is unwise in terms of its impact not only on the aviation sector but also on the jobs that the tourism industry provides. I do call on the member for Batman and the Leader of the Opposition to join with me in condemning this irresponsible action, to provide a bit of leadership and distance themselves from this union action, because it is not in the interests of the people who work for Qantas or the 500,000 or so Australian jobs that depend on tourism. Foreign Affairs: Iraq",46
54,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to my letter to you, Prime Minister, of 16 August, calling for the government to make a full parliamentary statement on Iraq, and your response rejecting that approach. Prime Minister, are you seriously suggesting that the only parliamentary debate you will allow on Iraq is after you have committed Australian troops to war? Why won't you take the Australian public into your confidence and allow a parliamentary debate on this important national security matter now?",47
55,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question. The request that was made of me by the Leader of the Opposition was that I should make a full parliamentary statement within the next two weeks. It is that request that I rejected. The Leader of the Opposition might have acknowledged in more precise terms what his request was, and then I would have acknowledged in equally precise terms what my response was. For the benefit of the House, let me read some excerpts from the response I gave to the Leader of the Opposition. I said this: I have your letter of the 16th of August requesting a parliamentary statement on Iraq and raising the expectation that it might be made by me in the next two sitting weeks of parliament. I responded that I thought a full statement of the type he requested within this period of the two weeks would, for the reasons I set out, be premature. I did go on to say this: The government has every intention of fully involving the parliament in this matter. Whilst, for the reasons given, a parliamentary statement of the type you have sought is premature at this time, the evolving character of the issue means that the parliamentary handling of the situation will be kept under constant review by the government. What that means, if I can just take the narrative on a little, is clearly that, if a decision were made-and it is quite hypothetical-to commit Australian armed forces, then of course that matter would be brought before the parliament, but that does not preclude the possibility of there being parliamentary debate on this issue in advance of any decision. I have not sought at any time to rule that out. What I did rule out was any statement being made in the next two weeks. I made that very clear, for the reasons I explained in my letter. If the Leader of the Opposition had read the letter carefully, he would have seensurely-the second last paragraph, and he surely would have acknowledged that what I was simply doing, for very good reason, was ruling out a full parliamentary statement in the next two weeks because plainly that would be premature. No decision has been taken by the United States. The debate in the United States is underway. I do not believe any decision will be taken by the United States either way within the weeks immediately ahead. I have said that, if the Americans were to take a decision to take action, I believe it likely that they would approach Australia for assistance. It would then be for the Australian government to consider the matter in accordance with the normal constitutional processes. I might remind the House of some words used by Mr Hawke when he was Prime Minister, when he moved a motion committing Australian forces to the Desert Storm operation on 21 January 1991. What he said was this: The decision to commit Australian armed forces to combat is of course one that constitutionally the prerogative of the Executive. Now they are not words I have used; they are words that the former Prime Minister of Australia used on that particular occasion. I would expect if-and I underline the word ‘if'-a decision were taken to commit any Australian forces consequent upon an American request, and it would be a decision only taken by this government if we thought it to be in the national interest to do so and we would want to be completely satisfied that it was in the national interest to do so, then I would follow the same procedure that was followed by Mr Hawke on that occasion, and the procedure that was followed by me as Prime Minister when a decision was taken to commit forces to East Timor. In the time. I have been Prime Minister this country has committed military forces to significant combats on two occasions: one to East Timor and one to the war against terror. In relation to East Timor, I kept the then Leader of the Opposition fully informed. I stand ready to continue keeping the current Leader of the Opposition fully informed. I have always taken the view that the most serious thing any government does is to commit military forces to a conflict, and I would want, as far as humanly possible, to achieve bipartisanship in relation to any decision this government ever takes to commit military forces. I say to the Leader of the Opposition that if there is any further information he wants of me, he only has to come and see me and I am happy to make it available. Intelligence briefings have been made available. They will continue to be made available in accordance with the conventions that operate between government and opposition. We do have an opportunity, because of our alliance with the United States, to have an understanding of American thinking, particularly the military. We have personnel placed within the US command structure and we have had them there since the start of the war against terrorism. One of the advantages of that is that we are able to have a knowledge of the thoughts of the American military not only in relation to existing contributions but also in relation to future contribuis tions that the American military might make to the pursuit of American foreign policy objectives. It is no secret that the United States military is probably looking at options in relation to Iraq. But it is equally no secret that the administration is far from taking any decision about this. When it will reach that conclusion I do not know, and I suspect at this stage the American administration does not know. But we will be in a position to be as abreast of their thinking as probably any country in the world and will therefore be in a position to take a very informed decision if we were to receive a request. I assure the Leader of the Opposition that I will, as far as it is possible to do consonant with my own constitutional responsibilities, inform him and include him. I did that in relation to Timor with the member for Brand when he was Leader of the Opposition and I did it in relation to the war against terror. This is a difficult situation. Nobody wants military conflict. Nobody in this House wants to see Australian forces ever sent abroad again, certainly not sent unnecessarily, if that can be avoided. Nobody wants war-we all hate it. And nobody has a monopoly on the detestation of military conflict. We ought to put that aside once and for all. I certainly deplore it, and all members of my government do, as I am sure all members sitting opposite do. But there are always occasions when some kind of military action becomes unavoidable. I hope that does not arise on this occasion. I can say-I hope without any contradiction from anybody in the House-that the one thing that would transform this situation overnight would be a willingness by Iraq to comply with the resolutions of the Security Council. That is the kernel of the problem. That is the clear, unambiguous reason for the difficulty: that Iraq continues not to comply. If Iraq were to comply, overnight this situation would be transformed. That is the government's position. What I have said to the Leader of the Opposition-and I repeat it-is that it is not appropriate and it is entirely premature to seek to have a full parliamentary statement from me on this issue in the next two weeks. That does not preclude statements further down the line in advance of any-what is still, of course, completely hypothetical-commitment of Australian forces. I simply repeat something else I said in my letter to the Leader of the Opposition, and that is that I am available each day, as is my wont, to answer questions; as is the defence minister, as is the foreign minister. The normal processes of parliament will continue. I think we all hope that military conflict can be avoided; but I think that we are all instructed by history that, despite our hopes and aspirations, on occasions sometimes they are not realised. And I am sure that the parliament will have the responsibility to exercise good judgment on this issue, if that were to happen, as it has in the past. Industrial Action: Secret Ballots",47
56,Mr SCHULTZ,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Is the government committed to the principle of secret ballots before legal strikes? Is there growing support for this kind of democracy in the workplace? Are there any alternative positions opposing secret ballots and what is the government's response to them?,49
57,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Hume for his question. Let me make it very clear that this government believes that there should be no strikes without secret ballots first. That is our position, and we believe that that position is utterly in the national interest. Strikes cost jobs, strikes damage Australian companies and strikes hurt Australia's reputation abroad. The real victims of strikes are invariably rank and file shopfloor workers, who risk losing hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars out of their pockets to satisfy the political agendas of union officials whose pay packets are not at risk. Secret ballots are supported by the German socialist government. They are supported by the British Labour government. Secret ballots have been supported by the Beattie Labor government in Queensland. Secret ballots should be supported by this parliament and I call on the Senate to support the government's secret ballots legislation. When the Beattie government faced a serious run of industrial disputation by nurses in Queensland, what did Premier Beattie do? He called for a secret ballot of those nurses. That is what he wanted-until he was monstered by big Bill Ludwig of the Australian Workers Union. If Bill Ludwig can intimidate the Queensland Premier, all the more reason why ordinary workers should get secret ballots, so they are not intimidated by union heavies. Bill Ludwig said, ‘Secret ballots in the labour movement are abhorrent.' It is hardly surprising that, when Steve Martin quit-because the Leader of the Opposition had squibbed party reform-there was no secret ballot of the rank and file members of the party. The matter is being dealt with by the administrative committee of the New South Wales Labor Party-the modern faceless men. Mr Swan- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order.",49
58,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,49
59,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! When those on my right have quite finished instructing the member for Swan! Mr Swan- Mr Speaker, my point of order is under section 145. The minister is not being relevant to the question-he is not remotely relevant to the question. I ask you to bring him to order, particularly given your advice to him to tone down his abuse of question time.",49
60,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Perhaps I should point out to the member for Lilley, and to all members of the House, before I respond to his point of order that I did address a convention on constitutional reform in South Australia, convened by the South Australian Attorney-General's Department. It was in response to a question from Matt Price that I made the comments there. I have at no time had cause to chasten the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations during the recess. I would point out furthermore that, on the issues for parliamentary reform that a number of people in this House have been keen to pursue, he has been one of those anxious to promote them.",50
61,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,50
62,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me deal with the point of order. Unless the member for Lilley has a further point of order, I should deal with the point of order currently before the chair. Mr Swan-Have you advised him over a cup of tea?",50
63,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Lilley will resume his seat. Question time today has been the model of what Australia expectsthat is, questions have been asked seeking information, and information has been given. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations was responding to a question. I thought his language may have been provocative, but I could not accuse him of being no longer relevant to the question.",50
64,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On the topic of secret ballots, the behaviour of members opposite in the seat of Cunningham demonstrates that they use the rank and file; they never listen to them. Foreign Affairs: Iraq",50
65,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Prime Minister. I thank him for his earlier answer. It was very refreshing, Prime Minister, and it stands in stark contrast to the earlier remarks by the foreign minister in relation to Iraq. I ask the Prime Minister: is he aware that the United States Congress has already initiated public hearings into US policy on Iraq? Why is it appropriate for the US Congress to debate this serious issue now but not for the Australian parliament? If it is good enough for the US Congress to consider this matter, why not the Australian parliament?",50
66,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition. Can I say that I have put aside what I regard as his completely unreasonable comments about the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Let me go to the question the Leader of the Opposition asked. I would have thought that it was a common understanding of members of this parliament that there are significant differences between our constitutional system and America's. Our system, in a situation like this, makes senior members of our government far more accountable to the parliament far more immediately than is the case in America. President Bush is not questioned by the Democrat leader in the Senate or the House of Representatives. Indeed it is my understanding that, at the congressional committee hearings that were held in the United States, no members of the administration appeared. Further, it is my understanding that senior members of both the defence department and the state department were prevented from appearing. There will be plenty of opportunity for debate on this issue. Mr Crean-Will there?",50
67,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Of course there will be opportunity for debate in parliament-plenty of opportunity. I simply remind the opposition leader that he asked me to make a full statement in the next two weeks. He will have to acknowledge, if he is in the spirit of the refreshing candour on the subjectMr Crean interjecting",50
68,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, this is a serious issue. I have paid the Leader of the Opposition total courtesy. I would like to point out to the parliament that the Leader of the Opposition asked for a full statement in the next two weeks. He then implied that if that did not happen there would perhaps be some move to establish a parliamentary inquiry. The Leader of the Opposition and those whom he leads, both here and in the Senate, will do what they choose in relation to the committee procedures of the parliament, but I would have thought that, at this stage, such action would fairly be seen as political rather than in the national interest. Let me simply say that I am available to answer questions. There will be a full parliamentary debate if any decision were made. I have also, both in this answer and in earlier answers, not ruled out having both statements and other debate. But I simply repeat that to make a parliamentary statement within the next two weeks is entirely premature, in my view. If we are interested, as the Leader of the Opposition professes to be, in a serious examination of this issue, I do not think that is gained by a purported full statement within the next two weeks. But I can assure him that the procedures that I follow in relation to this matter if ultimately military action were to involve Australia will be no less respectful of the constitutional processes of government in this country and the processes of the parliament than the approach adopted by former Labor Prime Minister Hawke. Environment: Greenhouse Gas Emissions",50
69,Mr BILSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage. Would the minister inform the House of the steps being taken by the Howard government to combat the effects of climate change? Would the minister compare the success of these initiatives with any previous actions?,51
70,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Dunkley for his question, and I acknowledge the very significant contribution that he makes to the government's consideration of environmental issues. Global warming has the capacity to inflict very significant costs on Australia. While Australia contributes about only one per cent of global emissions, the government is determined to put in place effective measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Kyoto protocol, under present circumstances, unfortunately fails to provide the framework for an effective global response and promises to deliver only some one per cent emissions abatement over the commitment period of the protocol. By the end of this century, the globe will need greenhouse gas abatement of some 50 to 60 per cent, and that is why Australia is looking beyond Kyoto already. But, first of all, we will be aiming to reach the target we agreed at Kyoto of 108 per cent of 1990 emissions. The government to date has committed some $1 billion to abating greenhouse gas emissions, and I am very pleased to say that these measures are proving to be exceedingly effective. Indeed, they are estimated to produce an abatement of some 60 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent a year, the equivalent of taking every passenger car off the road and removing the emissions from those vehicles. This abatement is an 11 per cent reduction in business as usual projections for 2010 and has already helped to put us within striking distance of our target. The government's measures are already beginning to decouple economic growth and greenhouse gas emissions. Over the decade to come, greenhouse gas emissions per dollar of GDP are estimated to decline by some 43 per cent. The government will be holding discussions with all parts of the Australian community, including industry, to determine the most cost effective means of achieving the further three per cent reduction in emissions that we require in order to reach our target. We will also be continuing to work for an effective global response, because combating climate change is a matter not just for Australia but for all the nations on earth. As the Australian said very sensibly in its editorial this morning: A sensible international agreement on global warming is needed, but Kyoto is not the answer. Kyoto does not include the developing countries. Kyoto does not include the United States. It is very regrettable that the opposition has taken the attitude, as it usually does, that, if there is a treaty, then sign it, regardless of whether or not it is going to be effective, and regardless of whether or not it is going to disadvantage Australian industry and impose a cost on jobs. This government will not ratify any treaty unless it is in Australia's national interest and in the interests of the strength and competitiveness of Australia's economy. This is much more obvious to the CFMEU, which strongly opposes ratification of the treaty, than it is to the Australian Labor Party. The Labor Party has absolutely no idea on greenhouse. It has nothing to say about greenhouse. It did not have anything to do with greenhouse when in government. It has done nothing in opposition to give it any credibilcompanies ity whatsoever, whereas this government's actions are constantly looking to help position Australia and the world for an effective global attack. I might just mention the greenhouse impact of the government's latest contract with China-the $25 billion contract on LNG. This contract will have the effect of lifting Australia's greenhouse emissions by 1.5 million tonnes a year but abating China's emissions by seven million tonnes a year, which is a very significant contribution to global greenhouse gas abatement. The opposition simply takes the very easy route of saying, ‘Sign up and everything will be right. Sign up to the treaty and we'll solve the problem.' The Australian community knows differently. The Australian community knows that it takes hard work, and this government's measures are actually achieving what Australia's responsible international commitments require. Business: Executive Remuneration",51
71,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Is he aware that a recent survey in the Australian Financial Review showed that the chief executives of the 150 largest companies earned an average cash remuneration of $1.3 million but, further, that the gross value of options held by chief executives and executive chairmen was more than $1.08 billion, with an average of over $10.5 million for each executive? Prime Minister, will the government join Labor in calling for the expensing of options in company accounts so that shareholders are fully aware of the huge costs of executive options and so that earning figures are not distorted? If not, won't it just be another case of you going soft on the top end of town?",52
72,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question. I do not think expensing of options was thought of by Labor. It is one of a number of issues that is under consideration by the government. There are a number of things that ought to be said about the general field covered by the Leader of the Opposition's question. I think some executive remuneration packages in recent years have been outrageously generous. This has been particularly the case with that have got into financial difficulty. I have said before that nothing sticks in the craw of an Australian more than witnessing a company going down the drain and the former managing director or chief financial officer or whatever walking away with not only very generous remuneration but also a very big package. I can think of a couple of spectacular examples of that in recent times. It is one of the areas that needs to be addressed. I think it is also very important that, in the process of doing this, we do not make it impossible for companies to pay what is necessary to attract the best managing directors. This country will pay a very heavy price if we do that. My view on this is that we should not be stampeded into dumping a whole lot of extra regulation on honest business men and women just for the sake of appearing a bit Rambo on the subject. I thought appearing Rambo on anything was certainly undesirable in the eyes of the opposition. The opposition, of course, is no doubt riding a little bit off what has happened in the United States. I encourage the Leader of the Opposition not to draw too many parallels between Australia and the United States. To start with, in the United States the positions of company chairman and managing director are often confused; they are often one and the same person. There are different accounting procedures. The Americans have a far more black letter law approach. The philosophy in the United States is: ‘Show me the words that say I can't do it,' rather than encouraging a more principles based approach, which has been the case in Australia. I think the great bulk of men and women who run companies in this country are honest, ethical people. I do not share the negative view of them peddled by the Leader of the Opposition. We will make changes that are necessary. We will certainly wait until we get the report of the HIH royal commission. It is a very important report. As the Leader of the Opposition knows, we are carrying out a review of the Trade Practices Act at present and we will be interested in what Mr Justice Dawson has to say as a result of that review. Immigration: Request for Asylum",52
73,Mr SECKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. Would the minister inform the House why some people remain in detention for long periods of time and why the government will not allow their release into the community until it is possible for them to be returned to their home country?,53
74,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Barker for his question. He seeks information in relation to what has been happening to those people who have made claims for, in the main, refugee status, when they have arrived in Australia unauthorised, principally by boat. It perhaps is useful to know that at this stage, without having had any substantial boat arrivals in Australia now for some 9½ months, we are now dealing with a residue of the large number of people who had, before that time, arrived without lawful authority. Currently, there are 594 unauthorised boat arrivals in detention centres. Of those, only four have not received a primary decision. In relation to those four, it is because of unre- as? solved character and security issues, on which I assume no-one would want us to compromise. There are 263 who are before the courts challenging decisions in relation to refusal by the department and the Refugee Review Tribunal to grant them a visa. There are 283 who have exhausted all appeals and are awaiting removal. I looked at the figures in greater detail: there were 24 who were still before the Refugee Review Tribunal, and I saw in a letter the chairman of the tribunal gave me today that the average finalisation time for the tribunal has been 66 days, which is the same period that it took in the previous year to finalise decisions. In other words, if you look at the system that is in place, primary processing and appeals before the administrative body, the Refugee Review Tribunal, occur quite quickly in the main-not always, but quite quickly in the main. The reason people are detained, and detained for any period of time, is that they want to test to the limits their entitlements in our system as it operates. That does mean that some people have been able to take matters before the courts for a first-tier decision, a second-tier decision before a full court, and the High Court of Australia, and in some cases we even have people applying to international bodies, complaining that they should not be removed after all of that decision making has taken place. There are the larger group of people who are awaiting removal. People say, ‘Why haven't they gone?' The principal reason is that some countries persist with a view that, even in relation to their nationals, they should be volunteers in coming back. I hope that that can be addressed fairly shortly, but there have been countries that have taken that view. It has certainly been the case in relation to the Afghans-where a package has been offered to encourage them to go backthat it has been foreshadowed that removal might be possible later but it is not encouraged at this time. So there are those sorts of situations, but nobody is stopped from going. If they wish to leave, they can leave at any time. Ms Gillard-What about the Palestini",53
75,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Lalor!,53
76,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me make the point that in relation to these matters it is very rare for there ever to be a circumstance in which a person cannot make arrangements to go. In relation to those cases, we believe in time that the arrangements can be made. I am not prepared to accept that-even in relation to the case in which there was a decision last week-given time, a country would not come to an arrangement with us to obtain transit rights for somebody to be able to go home. But let me make it very clear: I am not beyond intervening in such cases where detention would become arbitrary. The important point is that we are not being capricious in relation to these matters. We are in a situation where those people detained in Australia today are not refugees. In the main, they are readily able to go home and, in our view, in almost all cases will be able to go home. That is a system which ought not to be undermined by people taking the view: ‘It has all become too hard. Just open the doors and let people go.' Inevitably, if you have had a system to determine whether or not people are refugees and if you were to undermine the credibility of it, you would simply be encouraging people to get into boats again. Our process has been creditable, it has been fair and it has been just. It is one which the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has tried to encourage other countries to adopt. I know that many are not prepared to, having looked at the way in which it operates here, particularly in terms of timeliness in finalising these matters. I wish to conclude by saying that, if you want to look at what happens if you compromise in relation to these matters, you need look no further than what has been happening in Europe. In France, 95 per cent of asylum seekers who have been released into the community and who await processing of their claims fail to report when those claims have been processed. In the United States, 89 per cent of people who are the subject of orders to surrender for removal fail to surrender. Even here-and I think we have been particularly effective in relation to those people who are in the community and whose claims are being assessed, and we have been more effective than the European experience-something like 40 per cent of those people who are rejected remain in Australia. As we have seen in some other litigation in relation to class actions recently, very large numbers of them use legal proceedings to obtain bridging visas and to maintain themselves in the Australian community. I say to those members of the Labor Party who from time to time feign an interest in the unemployed that, in relation to these matters, our experience has been that most people who are unlawful in the Australian community and who use these systems to remain lawful, even though they may not be entitled to obtain work, inevitably are in work and are taking jobs from those who are least able to get them in the Australian community. Business: Executive Remuneration",53
77,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister, and it relates to a previous answer he gave. Prime Minister, why do you continually pretend to be concerned about executive remuneration but do nothing about it? Do you recall in November 1999, in an interview with Kerry O'Brien, you said: What I would say to corporate Australia is that you've got to exercise a degree of restraint and self-surveillance. Prime Minister, is it not the case that greed and self-interest flourish when matters are kept secret? Why do you continue to allow these enormous pay packets to not be disclosed to shareholders? When will you accept that self-regulation cannot overcome greed?",54
78,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thought the basis of the earlier question was a request that the options be expensed. I think in your question just now you asked me why they are not disclosed. The reality is that they are disclosed. Mr MCMullan-That is what expensing means.,54
79,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Fraser!,54
80,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It does not mean that at all.,54
81,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,54
82,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Treasurer, Leader of the Opposition: the Prime Minister has the call. The member for Griffith!",54
83,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"For the benefit of the opposition leader, I point out that the Corporations Act requires that the details of the options granted as part of the remuneration of directors and the five most highly remunerated officers of a company be disclosed in the directors' report. Expensing, as I understand it, is a reference to the inclusion in the accounts of a company. So the Leader of the Opposition's first question was right. His second question was different from his first question and therefore wrong. My first answer stands. The answer to the most recent question is: it is already required. If the Leader of the Opposition had an elementary understanding of the law, he would not have asked the last question. Mr MCMullan-You are wrong. Disclosure of fair value to the shareholders is what they want.",54
84,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Is the member for Fraser seeking the call or merely seeking to interject? Tourism,55
85,Mr TOLLNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Small Business and Tourism. Would the minister inform the House of progress in the tourism industry and its recovery, particularly since September 11?",55
86,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Solomon, who I spent a bit of time with over the break. We visited the Mary River and were down at the Corroboree Billabong. We met some small business and tourism constituents of his and other constituents. As the member for Solomon well knows, the tourism industry has been doing it toughMr Snowdon interjecting",55
87,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Lingiari!,55
88,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"since both September 11 and September 14. I will come to you over there in a moment. The industry has been doing it tough for a number of reasons: obviously, the collapse of Ansett had quite a significant impact, particularly on domestic tourism; and perhaps just as significantly, particularly for Darwin, the decline in the number of international services in various parts of Australia. So the tourism industry has been doing it tough and will continue to do it tough in volatile times. Aviation is obviously key infrastructure for the tourism industry. International operators expect a reliable aviation service. They also expect regular servicing and they expect regular services. They will be profoundly disappointed by the action of the Australian Services Union today in holding a strike. Qantas now represents over 80 per cent of the domestic tourism industry in Australia in terms of aviation services. So when there is a strike at Qantas, it is not just a strike against one company-it is a strike against the entire aviation industry; it is a strike against coach operators; it is a strike against taxi drivers; it is a strike against bed and breakfasts, motels and hotels. A strike held at Qantas by the ASU should be condemned by all parties, not just on this side of the House and not just by the travelling public but by the Labor Party as well. We fully expect the Labor Party to support us in condemning the Australian Services Union for their bloody-minded action in holding a strike today. We look forward to the Leader of the Opposition calling the head of the ASU and saying, ‘Listen, comrade, we want to get people around the country. We want to support the tourism industry. We want to support all those small businesses. Comrade, can you get back to work?' I am sure that the Leader of the Opposition will not take into account the fact that the Australian Services Union has donated $1.3 million to the Labor Party since 1996. That will have no bearing whatsoever on his communication with the ASU. It will have no bearing whatsoever on the thoughts of the Leader of the Opposition that five members of the Labor caucus here are members of the ASU. That will have no bearing at all. The member for Lalor will be ringing the ASU and asking them to go back to work. The member for Bruce, the member for Burke, the member for Chifley, the member for Melbourne",55
89,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister will come back to the question.,55
90,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,We condemn the Australian Services Union for calling this strike today; we condemn them for inconveniencing tens of thousands of Australian travellers; and we condemn them for holding the Australian travelling public to ransom. HIH Insurance,55
91,Mr MCCLELLAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Attorney-General. Mr Tanner interjecting,55
92,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the member for Melbourne is keen to enter into a conversation with the minister, he might care to entertain him with coffee at Aussies, not in this House. Mr Tanner interjecting",55
93,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Melbourne won't strain the chair's patience. The member for Barton has the call.,55
94,Mr MCCLELLAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can the Attorney confirm that his department has not refused any application for financial assistance from witnesses appearing before the HIH royal commission? Can he advise whether Ray Williams, Rodney Adler and Brad Cooper have received financial assistance? How much has the government spent to date funding legal representation for witnesses appearing before the HIH royal commission?",56
95,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Barton for his question. I cannot provide the detail of the information that he would like me to provide, but I will, consistent with the practice of successive governments, advise of what I can. There is a scheme of some long standing-Financial Assistance for Legal Costs before Royal Commissionsand it applies in respect of both the HIH commission and the building and construction industry commission at the moment. It has been established to enable all people who have a central role in the proceedings to have access to legal representation, and to assist the royal commissions in their tasks. Applications for financial assistance are carefully assessed to ensure that public funds are provided to those people who have a central role in the royal commission, are likely to be prejudiced by the proceedings or where cross-examination of the individual is likely to assist the commission in its task. Applications are assessed to determine whether it would be reasonable for assistance to be provided and, if so, on what conditions. This assessment ensures that limited public funds are spent in the most efficient and effective manner. In some cases, the applicants pay the costs themselves or some of the costs themselves. This scheme of assistance is not means tested; it has been established ensure that royal commissions can effectively report to the government. Given the coercive powers of a royal commission, it is considered appropriate that people appearing before it should be adequately represented. As far as individual applicants for assistance are concerned, there is a long standing practice, endorsed by successive holders of my office, to treat applications for financial sistance in confidence. This practice extends to neither confirming nor denying that particular applications have been received. Consequently, it would not be appropriate to provide information in relation to the names of the persons mentioned by the member for Barton. Health and Ageing: Aged Care",56
96,Mr MCARTHUR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Ageing. Would the minister inform the House of the government's progress in implementing its strategy for the nation's aged care work force?,56
97,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. I had the opportunity in recent weeks and months to address an aged care forum in Colac in his electorate and also to participate in a round-table for aged care providers in Geelong, in part of his electorate. This year's budget contains a significant investment of some $47.5 million in Australia's aged care work force. This includes an amount of $26.3 million over four years to fund up to 1,000 nursing scholarships, commencing with 250 scholarships next year. These scholarships will be an important component of the aged care work force in coming years. They are particularly directed at those who would work in the aged care work force in rural and regional Australia. They will be valued at up to $10,000 each. In addition to that, there is a further $21 million over four years to fund training of aged care staff in smaller aged care homes, and this will provide necessary skills and training for some 10,000 aged care workers throughout Australia. This comes on top of the delivery of $211 million in additional recurrent funding, the first $51 million of which flowed to from 1 July this year to the aged care sector, and also on top of ongoing work on an aged care work force strategy, looking at the current and future work force needs of aged care in Australia. In addition to that, the government is working on a report on the recruitment and retention of nurses in residential aged care and on some ongoing work to simplify and asdecrease the burden of paperwork under the resident classification scale, and there is a national review of nursing education which has examined the education and training issues of nurses at a national and professional level. In addition to that, over the next 12 months the government will carry out an inquiry into the underlying pricing issues in aged care to ensure that we have an efficient and viable aged care sector into the future. This stands in contrast to Labor's confusion on the issue. On the one hand, we have the member for Grayndler issuing press releases from time to time, talking about an aged care crisis. On the other hand, I was surprised to read just a week or so ago that he says he does not subscribe to such a doomsday scenario about an ageing crisis. It is just another example of one message for one audience and another for another. No wonder Noel Pearson described the member for Grayndler as an example of the progressivist confusion of the latte Left. Taxation: Bankruptcy Laws",56
98,Mr MCCLELLAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Again my question is to the Attorney-General. Attorney, can you confirm that your task force on wealthy barristers using bankruptcy laws to avoid tax provided its report to you on 18 January of this year, some seven months ago? Why, after seven months, have you failed to make the report public or to provide a response? Will you now table that report, or has the government decided to go soft on tax avoidance at the top end?",57
99,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I can confirm that the government did receive the report at approximately the time the member for Barton mentioned. Since then, there has been considerable work done on what are some very complex issues. The task force was originally appointed by the then Assistant Treasurer, Senator Rod Kemp, and me. It comprised representatives of the Attorney General's Department, Treasury, the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia, the Australian Federal Police and the Director of Public Prosecutions. The most difficult issues raised by the report relate to the availability of taxation information. It is that that has meant that the report has not yet been responded to. We are working very hard on it-in fact, I spoke to Senator Coonan only last week about the government response, and we hope to see one very soon. Workplace Relations: Reviews",57
100,Mrs GASH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Would the minister inform the House of recent reviews recommending greater power for organisations registered under the Workplace Relations Act than is already allowed for? What is the government's response to this recommendation and what effect will it have on Australian workers?,57
101,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Gilmore for her question. I am aware of a recent report-the report of the Hawke-Wran review-which, naturally enough, wants to take Australia back to the good old days of the 1980s when the ACTU was more important than the federal cabinet. Not surprisingly, Greg Combet, the ACTU Secretary, says, ‘I am very pleased with the overall thrust of it.' That is not surprising because, according to the Sydney Morning Herald, there has been a secret deal. Mr Swan-I rise on a point of order relating to standing order 145 about relevance. Nothing the minister has said is remotely relevant to any of his ministerial responsibilities.",57
102,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am sure the Manager of Opposition Business is aware that that particular restraint applies to questions. It is important that the minister be relevant, and I would like the minister to draw his remarks back to the reviews affecting registered organisations and relating to greater powers under the Workplace Relations Act.",57
103,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is right, Mr Speaker, and this report wants to make registered organisations under the Workplace Relations Act much more powerful than at present. Under the Hawke-Wran report, union representation might drop from 60 per cent to 50 per cent at state conferences but it will increase from zero per cent to 50 per cent at the national Labor Party conference. Mr Swan- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order on relevance, standing order 145. The Hawke-Wran review has nothing to do with the act whatsoever-nothing.",57
104,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat. It is not a matter of relevance.,58
105,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The real problem is that it is not the 60 per cent rule or the 50 per cent rule; it is the 100 per cent rule, as the member for Hunter well knows, because the member for HunterMr MCMullan-Further to the point of order raised by the member for Lilley, Mr Speaker, I want to put it to you that, if the minister, in the drafting of the dorothy dixer, can give himself an interpretation of the standing orders so he can speak about the internal affairs of the Labor Party, it would be open for us to ask questions about registered organisations under the Electoral Act and ask questions about the",58
106,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Fraser has raised his point of order. Mr MCMullan-But they are organisations under the Electoral Act, and therefore we could ask questions about that.",58
107,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Fraser will resume his seat. Mr MCMullan interjecting,58
108,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"One moment! I have asked you to resume your seat. I will hear further the member for Fraser's point of order, but I first point out to him that the standing order to which he refers refers to questions, and what I am dealing with right now is an answer. Mr MCMullan-I understand that, Mr Speaker, but what I am saying relates to your interpretation of the relevance rule with this answer, because your interpretation leaves it open to people to ask questions about the internal affairs of all the political parties in this House, which you have, until now, always ruled out of order. We are really quite happy to make that",58
109,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Fraser has made his point of order and will resume his seat. Mr MCMullan interjecting,58
110,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You have made your point. I will hear you out, but I would have thought you hadMr MCMullan interjecting",58
111,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have one standing order for answers, as the member for Fraser is well aware. Had the question asked a question of a minister over which he had no ministerial responsibility, I would have ruled it out of order.",58
112,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As the member for Hunter said, the problem is the 100 per cent rule; the rule that gives members of registered organisations under the Workplace Relations Act 100 per cent control over the membership of the Australian Labor Party. For instance, the member for Hunter quotes rule 5AB of the New South Wales partyMr Swan- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order and it relates to relevance. The minister is clearly defying your earlier ruling. If I could just make this point. Standing order 142 says: Questions may be put to a Minister relating to public affairs with which he is officially connected ... The minister is pretending that a question to him about registered organisations has something to do with an organisation that is not relevant to that act or registered organisation; that is, the Australian Labor Party. He is clearly out of order on the grounds of any rulings that have been given in this House for the last 80 years.",58
113,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Lilley is well aware that the question was not out of order. The House would be facilitated if the minister would bring his remarks closer to the Workplace Relations Act.,58
114,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, the Workplace Relations Act is my portfolio responsibility and it regulates the affairs of trade unions. In turn, trade unions have 100 per cent control over the Australian Labor Party, a control that they are tremendously embarrassed about. As the member for Hunter has pointed out, the New South Wales Labor rules say: No-one will be allowed to join or remain a member unless he or she is a paid-up member of the union covering his or her work. The next rule goes on to say",58
115,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The minister will bring his remarks back to the act. Mr MCClelland- Mr Speaker, the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party is registered under a different act",58
116,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Does the member for Barton have a point of order? Mr MCClelland-Yes, Mr SPEAKER - a point of order on not being relevant to the question, which was in respect of the Workplace Relations portfolio, not the Special Minister of State portfolio. Clearly the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party is registered under the Electoral Act, the minister's other portfolio responsibility, but the Workplace Relations portfolio responsibility.",59
117,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I confess to the member for Barton that I was, for a time, struggling with his illustration. I understand what he is saying about a point of order, and I vite the minister to return to the Workplace Relations Act.",59
118,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I do represent in this House the Special Minister of State, so I am very happy to talk about the role of the Electoral Act. But the fact is 40, 50-50-what does it matter? The only thing that counts is full internal democracyone vote, one value-and that is the one thing that the Leader of the Opposition will never deliver.",59
119,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. I hope your throat mends itself.",59
120,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Prime Minister for his consideration. Can I indicate to him that, loyal to my industry, I am consuming gallons of citrus juice in the hope that it will. NA Standing Order 152",59
121,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"There is a statement. I want to make to the House before we move to any questions to the Speaker. On Thursday, 27 June I was asked a number of questions about the application of standing order 152, relating to the addressing of questions to the Speaker at the conclusion of question time. I was specifically asked if a question addressed to the Speaker on that day constituted a precedent and, if so, the implications of that. There are many precedents since the provisions of the standing order became operative in 1994 of a minister or parliamentary secretary asking the Speaker questions. These precedents cover members of both political persuasions. The questions have related to the Speaker's administrative functions, which are within the strict application of standing order 152, as well as being on procedural matters. Again, Speakers originot nating from both sides of politics have allowed the application of standing order 152 to encompass procedural as well as administrative matters. In raising the issue, the members for Fraser and Brand cited House of Representain- tives Practice, pages 520-521. This section deals with questions without notice and points out that ministers and parliamentary secretaries may not ask such questions. As I understand it, this stipulation relates to the convention of collective cabinet or ministerial responsibility, mentioned at pages 47 and 60- 48 of House of Representatives Practice. Such questions should not be openly addressed during question time. I believe that many of us have a suspicion from time to time that a particular question may be what is colloquially called a ‘dorothy dixer'. To permit ministers to address questions to each other in question time would raise dorothy dixers to an art form. Pages 177 and 525 of House of Representatives Practice address questions to the Speaker understanding order 152. The commentary states that such questions may be put by ‘Members', and there is no suggestion that ministers or parliamentary secretaries are excluded. The fact that standing order 152 provides that questions to the Speaker occur at ‘the conclusion of the question period' clearly indicates that these questions are distinguishable from questions without notice. The prohibition on ministers and parliamentary secretaries in relation to questions without notice does not apply to questions put to the Speaker. QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: NA Taxation: Bankruptcy Laws",59
122,Mr WILLIAMS,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS," Mr Speaker, I seek the indulgence of the chair to add to an answer.",60
123,The SPEAKER,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,The minister may proceed.,60
124,Mr WILLIAMS,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,"Inadvertently, in listing the members of the interdepartmental committee task force that dealt with the bankrupt barristers issue, I think I omitted the Australian Taxation Office. Obviously as members they were included. NA Question Time: Conduct",60
125,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I have a question to you, Mr Speaker. During question time you indicated to the House that, after a conference at which you had spoken, you had responded to questions, including a question from the Australian journalist Matt Price as to a conversation you had had with the Leader of the House about question time conduct. You might recall, Mr Speaker, a question I asked you on 29 May about a conversation you had had with the Leader of the House about question time conduct. In reply to me, you said: ... yes, I did have words with the minister. do not intend to canvass the matter any further, any more than I would any other conversation I had had with any other member of this House. Given your comments at question time, does this mean a change of approach on your part? If asked, are you now proposing to detail to the House conversations you have with the Leader of the House with respect to question time conduct, and, if not, on what basis do you propose to answer questions to the Australian but not to the House?",60
126,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"The member for Perth I know asked the question with good intent. There has probably been some confusion as a result of my hurried response to, I think, a point of order from the member for Swan. First, I should say that the conversation with  the conference I had just addressed. I was returning from the conference when he called me on the car phone and he was asking about question time procedure and things like that, in view of the opening of the spring session.  proposals that I had discussed with the Manager of Government Business. I merely indi proposals I had had casual conversations actually with the member for Lilley and with the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and that the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations had been supportive of standing order changes that would allow changes to occur to question time. There was nothing more precise or specific than that. I can understand, given that the conference preceded this, and given my earlier reply, that it may have implied that whatever I had said in answer to questions at the conference had been followed up by Mr Price. Questions on Notice",60
127,Ms JANN MCFARLANE,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"3.42 p.m.)Under standing order 150, I request that you write to the Treasurer seeking reasons for the delay in answering the following questions that I asked on 19 February: question Nos 154, 155, 156 and 157; and the questions that I asked on 15 May, question No. 363 and question No. 367, question No. 367 having No, I been addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer. There was a further question to the Treasurer, No. 486.

129,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I have a question to you, Mr Speaker, based on the statement that you just made to the House. Because you revealed all those facts in the course of your statement, they must of course be true. However, there is still a gap in the standing orders. I ask you to consider referring to the standing orders committee the ruling which you just made, because a reading of House of Representatives Practice and the standing orders would leave a reasonable position to be argued that ministers do not have a right to ask questions of anyone in the place by virtue of the fact that parliamentary secretaries, when being ruled out of the capacity to ask questions of ministers, have specifically ruled in for them the capacity to ask questions of you. There is no similar provision provided for ministers, which would seem to suggest that they are excluded from that possibility. I think what you say, from my recollection, is indeed true: that ministers, including former leaders of the House, have asked you-or at least Speakers-questions from time to time. In the circumstances it might be better that the House of Representatives standing orders reflect the ruling that you have just given.",60
130,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I am not being pedantic; I am presuming that the member for Brand's reference was to the Procedure Committee, unless he had a more appropriate body in mind. Short of a more appropriate body, I will consider raising the issues he has mentioned with the Procedure Committee, a facility that is of course available to him as well. I shall tell him if I am not prepared to do so on reflection. I thank the member for Brand for his vote of confidence. NA",61

133,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I do.,61
134,The SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,The member for Perth may proceed.,61
135,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"My attention has been drawn to comments by Adelaide Advertiser journalist Samantha Maiden on the ABC TV Insiders program on Sunday, 14 July this year, where she said: I think missed opportunity of the week must go to Opposition spokesperson on health, Stephen Smith, who was mad as a hornet over a Hep C scare and blood banks ... and nothing to say at all over the HRT scare that would have affected half a million women nationwide and their families. Mr Speaker, the facts are these: on Tuesday, 2 July, I welcomed the announcement by the minister for health of an inquiry into the use of potentially contaminated blood products as an appropriate and necessary response to concerns that potentially contaminated plasma was used to make medical products. On Wednesday, 10 July, it was reported that a US clinical study had concluded that there was an increased risk of breast cancer for women receiving long-term combined hormone replacement therapy. On that day, the minister for health referred the issue to an expert committee of the Therapeutic Goods Administration for consideration. On the same day, I publicly welcomed that decision. It, too, was an appropriate and necessary response, directed at resolving uncertainty about the benefits of long-term combined hormone replacement therapy. My approach in both these matters has been to support the government's efforts to investigate and resolve doubts about the efficacy of medical treatments and procedures in accordance with proper processes and drawing on appropriate medical expertise. I am not sure what missed opportunity Ms Maiden was referring to, but these matters cannot be characterised as on the one hand being mad as a hornet over blood products and on the other having nothing to say over hormone replacement therapy.",61
136,The SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I will simply add that, as the member for Perth and all members would be aware, the member for Perth was on this occasion granted a good deal more licence than would sometimes apply, because he needed only to have indicated that he had been misrepresented. His remarks, however, were in no way partisan or provocative, and I would want members to bear that in mind in terms of the liberty extended by the chair.",61

140,The SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,The honourable member may proceed.,62
141,Ms HALL,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I claim to have been misrepresented by the member for Parkes, the minister for regional services and the Newcastle Herald. Earlier today, the member for Parkes referred to a statement made by the minister for regional services in an article printed the Newcastle Herald, saying that within Shortland electorate there had been no funds allocated to the Regional Solutions program because no-one in Shortland electorate had actually applied for funding and that that my fault. I would like to correct the record. There have been some applications from Shortland electorate via Lake Macquarie council. One was unsuccessful, one was sent back for more information and one was in combination with a number of other local government areas for bus shelters. Yes, I think we got a bus shelter.

150,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"In the last sitting the member for Denison and the member for Canberra asked me questions relating to sound levels in the House. The member for Denison was concerned that excessive levels were occasionally generated during question time, while the member for Canberra advised that she had difficulty in hearing some members. During the recess, technical staff from the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff lowered all four speaker clusters suspended from the ceiling and tested the 76 speakers and 14 amplifiers. All were found to be fully operational and within the technical specification. To address the issue raised by the member for Canberra, some of the speakers in the clusters to the rear of the chamber have been adjusted to slightly increase the audio level. I hope that members in those parts of the House will notice an improvement in the sound as a result. To address the concern of the member for Denison, a technical adjustment has been made to the chamber microphone circuitry to limit excessive sound volume peaks. This change will be monitored during this sitting fortnight.

Health: Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House: - That increases to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme in the 2002 budget will hit those that can least afford it, families and pensioners. - That this Government should remember the commitments made before the 2001 election in regard to the cost of prescription drugs. We therefore pray that the House oppose the Howard-Costello plan to increase the cost of prescription drugs for Australians. by Mr Martyn Evans (from 82 citizens), by Ms Hall (from 15 citizens) and by Ms Vamvakinou (from 582 citizens). Telstra: Telecommunications Infrastructure To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of the State of New South Wales of the street of Fischer in the area of Goonellabah in the city of Lismore draws to the attention of the House: The particular residents have Internet connection for the further education of themselves and their children, these telephone connections are of such a state that the downloading of a home page of the compliance quality as set out on 5 May 1999 at the Southern Cross (www.scu.edu.au) is not possible, neither is the downloading of the Prime Minister's home page, or the downloading of this Honourable House of Representatives home page all of which should be available, one would think, to all good residents of Australia. The lines in the ground are of such quality and/or the exchange is of such quality as to cause an inequitable effect to the residents of Fischer Goonellabah. Our petition therefore requests the House to instruct the carrier Telstra Corporation to improve the line quality to a download specification as is perceived by the community as of fair quality, that a 56K modem as commonly advertised by the carrier, ISP providers and Phone Companies will operate at its preferred efficiency level and not at the present low level being offered. Our present line capacity is said to be 64S4D/16S-4D, one line at present is operating at 21.6Kbps which will not download any home pages particularly those noted above. by Mr Causley (from seven citizens). Health: Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives. A petition of Australian pensioners and superannuants residing in the Newcastle and Hunter Region who bring to the attention of the House that hardship and deprivation will be created to pensioners and superannuants by the proposed increase to pharmaceutical prescription charges. We, the undersigned petition the House of Representatives to reconsider the intended increase of the cost of prescriptions to pensioners as this severe impost will cause extreme hardship to most of Australia's senior citizens who are already experiencing difficulty due to the large monetary gaps in health care. by Ms Grierson (from 85 citizens). Taxation: Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth that certain citizens of New South Wales request that you exempt the RSPCA of the Goods and Services Tax (GST). The imposition of this tax on the RSPCA will severely limit its operations to provide care and attention and rehoming of ‘all creatures great and small'. University Your petitioners pray that the Legislative Assembly pass the necessary legislation to ensure that the RSPCA is GST free. Thank you. by Mr Hatton (from 903 citizens). Australian Defence Force: Military Compensation Scheme To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the Street House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: This petition of citizens of Australia calls on the House to recognise: 1. that defence and war service are unique and due to the nature of this service that private insurance for defence personnel is often difficult to obtain; 2. that Government has an obligation to adequately support members of the Defence Forces who are injured or wounded in the course of duty; 3. that Government has an obligation to adequately support families of defence force personnel killed on duty; 4. that current Defence compensation is inadequate and fails to provide financial security and certainty to Defence personnel and their families in the event of injury or death; 5. that members of the Defence Forces are entitled to the certainty that they and their families will be adequately compensated in the event of injury or death; and further calls on the Parliament to ensure that the proposed new Military Compensation Scheme rectifies the current inequities and anomalies which severely disadvantage members of the Australian Defence Forces and their families in real and financial terms. by Ms Hoare (from 49 citizens). Health: Magnetic Resonance Imagining To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of the state of Western Australia draws to the attention of the House, the need to grant an MRI Medicare licence to Western Australia's Fremantle Hospital. An MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) machine is an essential diagnostic tool for a range of medical conditions. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to ensure that the Commonwealth provide residents in the south-west metropolitan area of Western Australia with access to Medicare MRI scans at Fremantle Hospital, since there is no public MRI facility in the entire region. by Dr Lawrence (from 2,243 citizens). Telecommunications: Mobile Phone To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws zens). to the attention of the House the threat to the public interest and public health from the failure of the Telecommunications Code of Practice 1997 to include a requirement for all telecommunications carriers to properly notify nearby residents and small businesses of the installation of a low impact telecommunications facility. We believe the government should protect residential and commercial areas across Australia from exposure to electromagnetic radiation (EMR) generated by mobile phone towers installed without adequate community consultation. Your petitioners therefore respectfully request that the House protect the public interest and public health by amending the Telecommunications Act (1997) and the Telecommunications Code of Practice 1997 to include a requirement for all telecommunications carriers to properly notify nearby residents and small businesses of the installation of a low impact telecommunication facility. by Mr Murphy (from 1,069 citizens). Science: Embryo Stem Cell Research To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House our strongest opposition to embryo stem cell research. Machines We ask you to oppose all stem cell research which involves the destruction of human embryos. There is ample evidence of the greater effectiveness of stem cells from ethically acceptable sources, e.g. adult and placental tissues et cetera. Therefore your petitioners humbly pray that the House oppose embryo stem cell research which involves the destruction of human embryos. by Mr Neville (from 394 citizens). Telstra: Service Charges To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of pensioners and low income earners in the City of Greater Geelong points out to the House that we object to Telstra's increase in line services as we feel that this extra cost would be an additional burden on pensioners and low income earners who can ill afford to pay this. Towers Your petitioners therefore request the House to reconsider this proposed increase and instead maintain the current level of charges. by Mr Gavan O'Connor (from 163 citiSocial Welfare: Disability Support To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in the Parliament: The petition of certain recipients and associates of the Disability Support Pension in the State of Victoria draws the attention of the House to the item in the budget brought down by the Honourable the Treasurer on 14 May 2002 in regard to the eligibility criteria for the Disability Support Pension, so that it is payable to people who are capable of less than 15 hours of work per week, instead of, as at present, 30 hours. Your petitioners regard this proposed change as detrimental to current recipients of the Disability Support Pension. The proposed change will create unnecessary fear, suffering and financial hardship to these people, in addition to that which they already endure because of their disability. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to leave the eligibility criteria for the Disability Support Pension unchanged. by Mr Gavan O'Connor (from 16 citizens). Australian Defence Force: Military Compensation Scheme To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: This petition of certain citizens of Australia to the attention of the House the absolute inadequacy of the level of compensation awarded to families of our Armed Forces killed in the course of duty. We cite the example of the Blackhawk disaster and more recently the officer killed in Afghanistan. Your petitioners therefore request the House to review as a matter of urgency the compensation paid to the families who have supported the commitment of these dedicated members and in this instance have paid the ultimate sacrifice. by Mr Somlyay (from 93 citizens). Petitions received. PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS Environment: Great Apes",64
155,Mr HAWKER,PETITIONS,"I move: That this House: (1) notes with alarm the serious decline in the Pension population of the Great Apes–gorillas, bonobos, orangutans and chimpanzees, which could lead to their extinction in the next 10 years; (2) recognises that habitat destruction due to illegal logging, mining and associated activities including poaching, are all contributing to this threat of extinction; (3) acknowledges that war, civil unrest and a breakdown in law and order also contribute to the problems in many of these habitat areas; (4) notes Australian Government participation, principally through zoos and also with the Humane Society International, in the conservation of the Great Apes; (5) notes the support of the UK Government for the Great Apes Survival Project, which is backed by the UN Environment Programme; and (6) calls on the Federal Government to increase its support for the efforts of the UN Environment Programme to help save the Great Apes. I think this is a very important motion. This has been brought to my attention by a constituent of mine, Dr Selby King. When you look at what is happening with the great apes in the world, it is extremely disturbing. By way of background, the great apes are made up of chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas and draws orangutans. I will go through them one by one. Firstly, there are two species of gorillas-the eastern and the western-and these are further divided into several subspecies, the Eastern Lowlands Gorilla and the Mountain Gorilla. These are severely threatened by habitat loss and poaching. Both inhabit Africa's Great Lakes region, which has endured more than a decade of armed conflict. It is estimated that there are currently around 650 Mountain Gorillas in existence. The Eastern Lowlands Gorilla is threatened by bushmeat hunters and by encroachment. The Western Gorilla species is divided into two subspecies-the Western Lowlands Gorilla and the Cross River Gorilla. The exact number of Western Lowlands Gorillas is unknown but has been estimated to be around 111,000; however, the hunting of these gorillas for bushmeat as logging companies have opened up major forest areas may have significantly reduced the numbers. There are far fewer Cross River Gorillasthere are possibly only 1,000 left in the world-because the restricted habitat of this ape places it under pressure. There are four subspecies of chimpanzees, and some sources have suggested that chimpanzees may number up to 200,000; however, the actual figure is probably closer to 100,000. Separate populations range in size from 12,000 Western Chimpanzees, which are distributed from Nigeria to Senegal, to around 80,000 Central Chimpanzees, which are found mainly in Gabon, Cameroon and the Congo. All the species are listed as endangered on the 1996 International Union for Conservation Red List of Threatened Animals. Along with bonobos, chimpanzees are our closest living relatives. They live in complex communities and are believed to be extinct in five African countries. Their numbers are declining over most of their range. The orang-outang fits into two subspecies-those living in Sumatra and those living in Borneo. Their numbers in the wild are currently estimated at less than 25,000, which is a decline of between 30 and 50 per cent over the last decade. That is quite disturbing. The estimated population in the Gunung Leuser National Park and the surrounding area was 9,200 in 1993. Since then, the numbers have declined by 45 per cent. The destruction of their rainforest habitat placed them in great danger of extinction. This habitat has been subjected to illegal logging and to conversion for use by humans. Bonobos are sometimes referred to as pygmy chimpanzees, and their habitat is, unfortunately, limited to the war-ravaged Congo. There are indications that these apes are being killed for bushmeat and that their orphaned young are being sold to the pet trade. The question is not only why do we want to see the great apes preserved but also why do we see them as being so special? There are many reasons. Significantly, chimpanzees and bonobos share 98.4 per cent of our human DNA, gorillas share 97.7 per cent, and orang-outangs share 96.4 per cent. They are our closest cousins in the animal kingdom. As I have said, considerable pressure is being placed on their habitats, and their populations have fallen dramatically. The threats that now face ape populations include all of what I have said before as well as war, conflict, human expansion, mining, agriculture, logging, forest fires, hunting for bushmeat, and the capture of live specimens for sale. It is interesting to note that significant scientific studies over the past 50 years have substantially improved our knowledge of the great apes. Studies show that they possess self-awareness, remarkable intelligence and an ability to communicate by using signs and symbols. It seems quite ironic that the great apes are legally protected in every country they inhabit but that this legal protection is not matched by enforcement in many of these countries. It is also important to note that international trade of the animals for primarily commercial purposes is banned under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora and yet high prices still lure illegal hunters and traders. There are a number of reasons for the decline in numbers of the great apes. According to the World Wide Fund for Nature there are six categories, and I would like to elaborate on them. The first category is habitat loss. The destruction of tropical rainforests is the biggest threat to the survival of the great apes has in both Asia and Africa. Even where apes such as gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos adapt to selective logging by using small clearings and secondary forests, they can be at greater risk from hunting. In the case of the orang-outang, mining and logging have resulted in greater hunting pressure. The second category is illegal hunting, which is of great concern. Despite the fact that hunting of the animals is illegal, it is still occurring widely. The third category is trade in live apes. Despite the ban on international trade under the CITES convention, it is estimated that, in the 20 years up to the late 1980s, between 40,000 and 90,000 animals were taken for this trade-which is quite staggering. In 1990 it was estimated that at least 230 orang-outangs were kept as pets, as part of nightclub attractions, or in private zoos in Taiwan. The fourth category of threat is disease. According to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature Veterinary Specialist Group, the great apes display scant resistance to some of the pathogens which affect their human relatives. The fifth category is medicine. Body parts of great apes have been used for medicinal purposes in Africa and in Asia. Where great ape populations are small, killing of individual animals can be significant, such as in Nigeria, where Western Lowland Gorillas are critically endangered. Uncontrolled use of gorilla body parts for medicine could threaten survival of the whole population. The sixth category is civil unrest. For example, Mountain Gorillas were killed by soldiers during civil unrest in Rwanda and Zaire. What is being done? The United Nations Environment Program and the Great Apes Survival Project are very important. In September last year, the UN Environment Programme welcomed a pledge by the United Kingdom for substantial support for an international effort to save the remaining great apes. The UK government, the first government to formally support the Great Apes Survival Project, is to be congratulated on that. There are a number of other programs, but in the time that remains to me I want to quote from a letter I received from the Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Program, Mr Klaus Topfer. The letter stated: The Sydney Olympics, which have been described as the ‘greenest Olympics ever', illustrated to the world how environmentally aware Australia is. Recent surveys have shown that the great majority of Australians consider environmental protection to be at least equally important to the rate of economic growth. Australia would be a powerful and much needed member of the GRASP alliance. Mr Topfer also pointed out in his letter that our minister for the environment, Dr Kemp, has already recognised and supported the Great Apes Survival Project. I hope that we can see more done. I commend the motion to the House.",68
156,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PETITIONS,Is the motion seconded? Mrs Moylan-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,70
157,Mr WILKIE,PETITIONS,"I commend the member for Wannon for bringing forward this motion on the great apes. The opportunity to speak on this motion reminds me of the nature of the work we do and the range of issues we concern ourselves with as members of the House of Representatives. For me this motion has particular relevance and interest: it allows me to make some comments about the work being undertaken at Perth Zoo, which is located within my electorate of Swan, and their efforts to protect one of the species of great apes-the orang-outangs. I commend the work of the zoo; in particular, the work of the curator of the endangered species section, Mr Leif Cocks, whom I had the pleasure of meeting last week. Orang-outangs are one of our closest biological relatives, with around 97 per cent human genetic make-up. They are so close to humans that I have been informed that, when they have a surgeon perform operations on orang-outangs, they use a surgeon for humans. Often, they use the operations in demonstrations to medical students without advising the students that they are actually watching an ape being operated on; they think it is a human. Orang-outangs' organs are organised in such a way that it is very hard to tell the difference. The intelligence level of orang-outangs is quite dramatic: it is equivalent to that of a fiveor six-year-old child. It was suggested that, if the Liberal Party seconded some to the front bench, they might double the IQ of cabinet! But the great apes are wonderful creatures. The Sumatran orang-outang is a critically endangered species and faces extinction in the wild within five years due to illegal logging, land clearing, forest fires and poaching. Only 3,000 orang-outangs survive in the wild in Sumatra and 10,000 in Borneo, with an average of 1,000 lost each year. At this rate orang-outangs will be extinct in the wild in Sumatra by 2005 and in Borneo by 2010. Perth Zoo is a world leader in the captive breeding of Sumatran orang-outangs. Its breeding program is one of the most successful in the world; since 1970 a world record of 24 orang-outangs have been born at Perth Zoo. The orang-outang colony presently comprises 10 Sumatran orang-outangs; the one male and nine females include some of the oldest captive-breeding orang-outangs in the world, and Puan is the most successful captive-breeding female. On World Environment Day this year, Perth Zoo unveiled its state-of-the-art orangoutang enclosure. This enclosure is a world first in design, boasting a 12.5-metre climbing structure and an elevated public viewing area. It is the first stage in the redevelopment of Perth Zoo's existing 20-year-old orangoutang exhibit. I recently had the opportunity to inspect this new enclosure and see the level of planning that was undertaken prior to its construction. Sumatran orang-outangs are powerful, intelligent, inquisitive and agile, capable of picking locks, undoing nuts and bolts, and unscrewing fasteners. Their destructive habits mean that man-made trees, complete with moveable branches, have been used in this new enclosure to mimic the way a rainforest functions. Climbing structures have been used to increase the interior vertical space, and complement above-ground horizontal pathways and platforms. They incorporate swaying poles and food dispensing devices so the enclosure recreates the orang-outangs' natural environment. Play items such as a water cannon, and environmental enrichment such as hoists, dip tubes and puzzle boxes designed to encourage mental and physical exercise, have also been incorporated into the enclosure. The new enclosure employs design principles unlike those of any captive orang-outang facility in the world. For the orang-outangs the new exhibit is a more natural environment; it allows them to live in a way more like that of the wild. They will even appear more natural than they do in existing enclosures, because of the types of movement and behaviour these enclosures restrict them to. The new enclosure and future phases of the redevelopment will provide facilities for Perth Zoo to breed its third generation of Sumatran orang-outangs. When I was there I noted-we were on the roof, looking at the way the enclosures were set out-that, when the orang-outangs are up in their trees, they can look across and see each other, which is quite a unique facility. It generates a feeling very similar to that of the wild, because there they do not congregate as a group-females will usually be separate from the males-but they like to see each other across the treetops. They can actually do that at this zoo. The Western Australian government is to be congratulated for funding this important project-along with support from a number of private sector organisations. Unfortunately, there are serious doubts about the long-term survival prospects of the remaining small and fragmented wild populations of orang-outangs in Sumatra and Borneo. Captive breeding programs, such as the one undertaken by Perth Zoo, are a lifeline for these magnificent creatures. Perth Zoo will be playing an important role in preserving the gene pool of the orang-outang, which will help to keep declining wild populations healthy. The Sumatran orang-outang is representative of what is at risk if this generation does not act to protect the environment. Environmental protection is the responsibility of all of us. The Sumatran orang-outang's evolutionary span can be tracked back four million to five million years. It has managed to survive tumultuous environmental and climatic change, but it now faces its greatest threat: mankind. But we can be part of the solution. I fully support paragraph (6) of this motion and additional funding to the United Nations Environment Program towards efforts to save the great apes. Australia should be doing much more to save orang-outangs from extinction. In September 2001 the United Kingdom announced its commitment of expertise and financial support to the United Nations Environment Program Great Apes Survival Project, known as GRASP. GRASP will target a number of projects in Asia towards tackling the different threats to wild orang-outangs. The United Kingdom government has committed the equivalent of $A500,000 towards this project in addition to its other funding of the United Nations Environment Program. The United Kingdom was also the first country to endorse the GRASP project and has backed its words with actions by providing this funding. Australia's total contribution to the United Nations Environment Project is just $600,000 for 2000-03. This inadequate funding is characteristic of the government's inadequate approach to the environment. Despite its success and international reputation, the orang-outang program at Perth Zoo is receiving no Commonwealth funding. If we are to be serious about saving this magnificent creature, government funding will play a vital role in our efforts. In addition, the government should be using its influence with our Asian neighbours to persuade them to implement change that will end some of the practices that threaten the survival of the orang-outang in the wild. The funding from the United Kingdom will largely go towards projects in Africa, which is not surprising given its strong historical relationships with many countries on that continent. In South-East Asia, where the orang-outang is most at risk and where Australia has similarly strong ties, we should be taking on the same sort of leadership role as the United Kingdom has done in Africa. We should be using our diplomatic influence to work for change and we should be backing this up with financial support for projects such as GRASP to show that Australia is still serious about the environment. It is this sort of commitment that is necessary to save these endangered great apes and one that the parliament should support. I commend the motion to the House.",70
158,Mrs MOYLAN,PETITIONS,"I am very pleased to be able to support my colleague the member for Wannon and I congratulate him for bringing this motion forward in the House today. I support most of the comments of my colleague the member for Swan. It seems to be our day for looking after the species in Western Australia, with the patagonian toothfish similarly being debated-but for slightly different reasons-earlier today. Scott Palley of CBS 60 Minutes reported that ‘the woman who discovered how the great apes live must now watch helplessly as the apes, who seem so human, lose their last place on earth'. He was reporting on the orang-outangs, who were formerly found in China and throughout the world and today are confined to two islands in IndonesiaBorneo and Sumatra. His comments highlight the serious issues that are the subject of this motion today. That 60 Minutes program, which highlighted the work of Dr Birute Galdikas-work which has spanned 30 years-posed a question to the public: ‘Should world governments do more to help save the habitat of the orang-outangs?' Ninety-eight per cent of the respondents answered positively: ‘Yes, governments should do more to help preserve the habitat of the orang-outangs.' There is deep public concern; we see it all over the world. Individuals such as Dr Selby King-whom the member for Wannon mentioned-and many people in my electorate are concerned about what is happening to these creatures. So it is ironic that our modern consumer oriented world is mostly responsible for some of the serious problems facing these animals. Who would have thought that our favourite way of communicating, mobile phones, is a big contributor to the problem? According to an article in the East African Wild Life Society magazine, the mining of coltan, a key component in the manufacture of capacitors and other essential components used in cell phones, computer Playstations and video games, is a significant contributor to the destruction of the habitats of the orang-outangs, particularly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. According to the article, as the demand for mobile phones has grown, the value of coltan has increased twentyfold and has produced a gold rush style boom in mining which is causing immense problems for wildlife in the world heritage listed Parc National in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. War, habitat destruction due to illegal mining, illegal logging and, of course, illegal poaching have pushed the great apes to the very brink of extinction, according to the UN environmental officials. The UN announced a major international initiative to save the great apes, which has been referred to earlier in this debate. The UK government was one of the governments quick to back the initiative and has been taking active steps to assist. This has raised awareness of the threat to the continuation of this species-the great apes. I congratulate the member for Wannon and I acknowledge Dr Selby King, who has raised the awareness of many members of parliament on this issue. Finally, I would like to quote from Klaus Toepfer, the UNEP Executive Director. He said: Rescuing the great apes is not just about saving these important and special creatures. It is a print for sustainable development. In conserving and guaranteeing a future for the great apes we must also tackle the poverty and the environmental degradation which is blighting the lives of the people in Africa, Sumatra and Borneo where the great apes live. And he made the point: The clock is standing at one minute to midnight for the great apes.",72
159,Mr QUICK,PETITIONS,"It is appalling to think of the possibility of the next generation of Australians not having the opportunity to share our planet with the great apes. Imagine no chimpanzees, no bonobos, no gorillas, no orang-outangs. Then, the only opportunity to see these creatures would be as exhibits in museums or on film and in photographic records. Some listening will say that this is quite fanciful. Let us stop equivocating and accept that this will happen unless governments such as ours intervene and increase their moral and financial support for the UN environment program to help save the great apes. It is ironic that today, as we near the 66th anniversary of the last Tasmanian tiger dying in captivity and as we debate this topic, the Tasmanian Mercury newspaper highlights the sale of a rug made from the skins of eight thylacines. The Great Apes Survival Project, or GRASP, is an integral part of the effort to save these creatures. The great apes, as we have heard, are not distant or irrelevant. Orang-outangs inhabit some of the areas of our closest neighbours-the islands of Sumatra and Borneo. Helping the great apes not only is of benefit to these creatures but also will save other plant and animal species. As one campaigner put it: The great apes are the gardeners of the African and South East Asian Forests. Local impoverished communities that live in the vicinity of the great apes will also benefit from the Great Apes Survival Project, as it will deal with issues of poverty and environmental degradation affecting villagers in the areas the great apes inhabit. The benefit these creatures have provided mankind by way of medical research should not be forgotten, and has already been mentioned by previous speakers. Like most blue things, education is an important factor in the survival of the great apes. Local people need to be made aware of the benefits these creatures provide living in their natural habitatbenefits with respect to the environment, eco-tourism and community development. The great apes are a protected species but the enforcement ability of authorities in the countries that they inhabit is limited. Great Apes Survival Project's funding would include equipping rangers, linking fragmented patches of habitat and educating villagers in the area about just how important apes are to their communities. Education, enforcement and environment protection are projects needed for the survival of the great apes, but unfortunately these involve considerable cost and someone has to pick up the tab. As previous speakers have mentioned, and I would like to reiterate, the federal government needs to follow the lead of the United Kingdom government. This government, the first to formally support the Great Apes Survival Project, is committed to providing expertise and financial support to the project. Ian Redmond of the Ape Alliance said: UNEP's leadership offers a chance for governments, NGOs and individuals to act together now, to reverse this decline-not only for the apes' sake but for the sake of their human neighbours who benefit from their presence. Australia does contribute, primarily through zoos and the Humane Society International, to the conservation of apes. However, it is time for Australia to answer the call to play a larger part and help fund the United Nations' program. The Great Apes Survival Project has formed alliances amongst various charities and wildlife groups, such as the Ape Alliance, Born Free Foundation, Fauna and Flora International, and the World Wildlife Fund. Governments from across the globe should follow the United Kingdom's lead in joining a UN-led campaign to conserve the great apes. The federal government needs to increase its support to the program, which is striving to bring worldwide attention to the ape crisis, raise funds for conservation and develop a global conservation strategy for all great ape populations. The importance of contributing to saving an endangered species cannot be overstated. Man has caused the rapid decline in the numbers; it is time to support the UN program and help the Great Apes Survival Project save these creatures. As stated on the United Nations environment program web site: Every local extinction is a loss to humanity, to the local community and a hole torn in the ecology of the planet. I am an optimist, but as Carol Bristow of Dynnyrne said in today's Mercury: Asia is covered by a noxious brown gas. Europe is flooded. Many of the Pacific islands are facing extinction. Will the Australian government continue to turn its back on the problem of global warming? If the Kyoto protocol is not good enough for Dr Kemp, then stand up for something stronger. Why not stand up for the great apes?",73
160,Mr BALDWIN,PETITIONS,"I wish to speak on the great apes motion. These creatures are magnificent animals, and are described so in many documentaries throughout the world. We all remember that movie with Sigourney Weaver in it, where she sat down with the apes and talked to them. Their value to our environment, to the structure and to nature needs to be observed by all in this country and by this federal parliament. One of the saddest points when watching the news on Saturday night was seeing a dead ape from a zoo in Europe being washed down through the floods. These are, as I said, magnificent animals. These creatures have a high level of intelligence and, indeed, social integrity in the way that they address the family unit.",74
161,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PETITIONS,Order! The time allotted for this motion has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Community Services: Local Libraries,74
162,Mr LATHAM,PETITIONS,"I move: That this House declares its support for: (1) the role of Australia's 1700 municipal libraries in providing information services and community-based learning throughout the nation; (2) Federal responsibility for assisting the development of the local library network, especially with new IT services; and (3) ensuring the National Library of Australia's Kinetica database is affordable for local libraries. a loss One of the great changes in this parliament over the past 30 years has been the development of federal responsibilities for the education system. We have now almost full Commonwealth funding responsibility for universities, substantial funding for vocational education and training, increased funding for non-government schools and the ongoing public debate that is attached to that issue. Incredibly, however, little has been done to provide federal funding support for Australia's most important community learning resource-the nation's network of 1,700 municipal libraries. If young Australians are to get a good start in life, they need access not just to good local schools but also to good local libraries. If lifelong learning is to be more than just a slogan then older Australians need to be able to draw on a wide range of library resources. Recently there was an ANTA study that showed that not everyone was comfortable with the idea of returning to an education institution; they were not comfortable with the formality of the learning process. Indeed, they were scared away by the image of sandstone universities and big formal learning institutions. A significant proportion of Australians who do not return to learning after school hold these particular views. The study said that one in four Australians do not go back to any sort of learning after they have left school. Mostly they are big boofy blokes like me; they think they have got through the education system and that is it. They do not engage in any form of lifelong learning. What they are saying, and what the ANTA research indicates, is that we need to develop convenient, comfortable, casualalmost informal-learning settings where people can take up these educational opportunities. We need to provide learning opportunities for pleasure and for self-satisfaction, not just for qualifications. Of course, libraries ideal for this purpose. Australian people are saying, ‘If you want us to engage in lifelong learning, establish the convenient and comfortable places of learning.' Libraries are absolutely perfect for this purpose. We should think of them as our street corner universities: local, convenient, informal opportunities for self-improvement. Libraries provide an outstanding agenda for developing the lifelong learning opportunities of the Australian people-not just 75 per cent but all of the Australian people. Australia gets exceptionally good value for money from its libraries. There are 1,700 local facilities for a national expenditure of less than $600 million. For about the same cost as one large university, Australia has 1,700 local libraries that provide a magnificent network and set of opportunities for learning around the nation. Libraries have become our most popular cultural resource. More Australians visit libraries every year than even the cinema. It is estimated that 60 per cent of Australians use public libraries on a regular basis-some 90 million visits per annum. They are our most visited and our most valuable public institution at a local level. I have moved this motion to recognise the role of local libraries and to thank the librarians, the volunteers and the supporters who provide such a valuable service to our nation. I have also moved this motion to mount the argument for federal funding support. Despite the size and the value for money that we get out of the library network, we still have a paucity of federal government resourcing and support for these valuable institutions. Our local libraries are a wonderful resource, but they are provided unevenly across the nation. There are public libraries with just one qualified librarian serving Australian communities of 30,000. There are some libraries in small country towns with no qualified staff. It really is an outrage at this time to have libraries without qualified staff. Imagine the outcry if we had country schools without qualified teachers. This is a deficiency that we need to correct. We need to even out the provision and to make sure are that all libraries have the qualified staff and improved resources. State funding and provision are very uneven. In New South Wales, just 15 per cent of public library funding comes from the state government compared to 40 per cent in Victoria, Queensland and South Australia. Moreover, there is no minimum standard of local government support. The degree of local government resourcing varies from 0.3 per cent of the council budget in one local government area to 11 per cent for a rural library in South Australia. Local government funding is unevenly provided and state government funding is very patchy across the nation. The poorest communities suffer most: they have the oldest library buildings, the weakest Internet access and, very often, the poorest book supply. Through the years there have been various arguments for federal responsibilities for libraries. There have been numerous reports and recommendations: the Munn-Pitt report going back to 1935 and the Horton report in the last year of the Whitlam government in 1975. In 1995 the Keating government provided $11.4 million of federal funding for Internet access but, unfortunately, this was reduced to just $2.2 million in the next Howard government budget, the 1996 budget. Unhappily, there is still no national standard or network for library Internet access. It is a very patchy set of arrangements indeed. You can tell the nature of federal neglect of municipal libraries: there is no minister or department that takes responsibility for this valuable learning resource. In this place, responsibility for libraries is spread over four ministers and four portfolios-education, communications, local government and the arts-and none of them is really taking the sort of responsibility that is needed to support local libraries. We need a national strategy to develop our library services, to bring poor services up to an acceptable national standard and, importantly, to upgrade Internet access throughout the nation. We also need an affordability strategy in some of the centrally provided services for libraries. The Kinetica search charges levied by the National Library, for instance, in cataloguing interlibrary loans and reference services are very expensive at a local level. I see that the member for Richmond is in the chamber by chance. The statistics I have relate to one of the libraries in his electorate. The Richmond-Tweed Regional Library pays more than $12,000 per annum in these Kinetica search and database charges from the National Library. This is an obvious area where the federal government could bring those charges down and improve the viability and the networking services for each of the 1,700 libraries in this country. We should support our libraries. We should also support the adult and community education services that can be attached to them. ACE in this country has been under-resourced and libraries are a natural hub for the delivery of adult and community education services. At one level, it is hard to know why libraries have been so undervalued and so under-resourced out of Canberra. It is hard to know why there has been such an absence of federal responsibilities for such an important local resource. One theory is that as parliamentarians we are all spoilt by the wonderful services of the Parliamentary Library and that we have not paid enough attention to those Australians who do not have such a good service available to them in their local community. My commitment, my own personal experience, has always been one of supporting the valuable work of libraries. I agree with the American author, Saul Bellow, who once said that ‘books are a poor boy's arsenal'-a beautiful quote, a beautiful summary, of the work of libraries. If you want to lift yourself out of a poor community, out of a struggling family, there is nothing better than access to a good school and a good local library. I have seen the importance of that in my own electorate. I have been a beneficiary of that experience in my own life. I want this parliament to bring those opportunities and advantages to all Australians in all parts of the country. Municipal libraries are no less important to the quality of education and learning in Australia than child-care centres, schools, technical colleges and universities. Just as the national government plays a role in funding these services and establishing acceptable national standards, it should play a positive role-a liberating role-for libraries, particularly in disadvantaged local government areas. Residents of affluent areas have better access to books and the instruments of learning through their higher personal incomes. The role of this parliament is to bring all libraries, particularly in poor communities, up to an acceptable national standard to discharge our proper federal responsibilities for this vital learning resource. This is a challenging time in education policy. There are many opportunities to broaden the scope and horizons of lifelong learning. I would hope that the parliament across the political divide could provide stronger support for libraries. There is a very strong argument for federal responsibilities. I urge all members in this place to be more supportive of libraries, to salute the work of librarians, volunteers and supporters, but, most importantly, to back them with a larger share of federal government resources.",74
163,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PETITIONS,"Is the motion seconded? Mr Sidebottom-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.  ber for Werriwa has moved: That this House declares its support for: (1) the role of Australia's 1700 municipal libraries in providing information services and community-based learning throughout the nation; (2) Federal responsibility for assisting the development of the local library network, especially with new IT services; and (3) ensuring the National Library of Australia's Kinetica database is affordable for local libraries. There would be little argument from members on either side of the House on the first limb of his motion. Municipal libraries should be a prominent feature of every community. A local library is a place of learning, personal enrichment and entertainment. For young people, libraries can accelerate the learning process, broaden educational horizons and help develop research and inquiry skills that will aid their future educational opportunities. Encouraging young people to use local libraries should be a priority for parents and school teachers alike. At the other end of the scale, municipal braries should provide an environment that encourages retired Australians to participate in receiving not only library services but also service delivery. This could take the form of volunteer work, filing and cataloguing library items or involvement with children's book clubs, including work as a reader or being in charge of a discussion group. For a community, municipal libraries can provide a focal point for local people-a point of common interest. An established and well-run library reflects the interests, aspirapotential tions and priorities of the community. But there is a large body of anecdotal evidence which suggests that in recent times the role of the municipal library has declined in contemporary society. There are several explanations for this trend but certainly the advent of the Internet has, for many people, usurped the role of the public library. I would never discourage the growth and use of the Internet as a learning resource. For many people, the Internet resembles an accessible and convenient research tool, particularly for young Australians and those people living in remote localities. The Internet has opened a world of opportunities for education and research, yet we have only scratched the surface of its potential. As a research tool, the Internet is without parallel. Users are able to access large amounts of information in mere seconds through the use of any reputable search engine. That information can be further refined through the use of narrow word searches and sophisticated filtering systems. Unlike library users, Internet users can access their research information from the most remote parts of Australia at any time of the day or night. Nor is the Internet encumbered by any borrowing procedures or restrictions. The Internet should not be taken as a surrogate for libraries. The Internet performs a different but complementary role to municipal libraries. Much of the information typically contained in both public and private libraries is unavailable on the Internet. To that end, it is important that local governments continue to maintain community libraries and ensure they are responsive to people's requirements and expectations. In licertain communities, local libraries are able to provide for a niche subject or learning market that may be particular to that community. Although the primary function of municipal libraries is to provide a community service, there is, under the social contract, a reciprocal obligation on local governments. There is an onus on local governments, as the administrators of public libraries, to continue evolving the functions of the library so they remain appealing to its members and users. In my electorate of Sturt, there are some excellent local libraries. The new library facility at the Burnside Community Centre is one such institution. The Burnside Library has recently been renovated, including the addition of a special children's library, extra books, community meeting rooms and accessibility to Internet terminals for library patrons, and people in the community in the eastern suburbs of Adelaide have voted with their feet. According to figures compiled by the Burnside council, the new improvements at Burnside Library have resulted in increased attendance and a higher number of book borrowings. This result is testament to the ability of the Burnside Library to cater for and respond to the needs and requirements of their market. I am glad to say that my wife sat on the Burnside Library consultative committee of local citizens to determine whether it was a good idea to continue with the Burnside Library renovation and was one of those who recommended that it did. Their success is indicative of the fact that local governments are best placed to provide library services which local people want and need. This is not a service that can be successfully provided by a centralised body making decisions removed from the local community. These are decisions best made by local people at the coal face. As all members of this House are aware, the Commonwealth government provides annual funding to local governments to provide specialised services at the community level. In addition, specific grants for the vision of particular services are also accessible. The Commonwealth government is also helping to fund the development of other services which will be of benefit to municipal libraries. Perhaps one of the most innovative developments has been the National Library of Australia's operation of the Kinetica database-a nationwide library network serving over 1,100 Australian libraries. The Kinetica database contains more than 11 million bibliographic records, including over two million contributed by Australian libraries. There are over 33 million locations for material held in Australian libraries. The National Bibliographic Database is Australia's largest single bibliographic resource with millions of entries for books, periodicals or resources such as films, audio tapes, video recordings, maps, pictures, CDs, computer files and electronic journals. This database helps locate material held all over Australia. As a result, Australian library users enjoy greater accessibility through the provision of intraand inter-library lending in Australia. The Kinetica database is available for subscribers on a charge per transaction basis, with the standard cost being 70 cents per search-which I think is the member for Werriwa's concern. Any cost-benefit analysis would indicate that, for a user wanting a specific title, a typical search charge of 70 cents is not just competitive but also an extremely efficient use of resources. As an economic rationalist, I would have thought that the member for Werriwa would have been delighted with such a charge. It would be difficult to put forward a persuasive argument that a search charge of 70 cents, to be paid by the user, is exorbitant or prohibitive. Indeed, as the demand for the Kinetica service continues to progressively increase, the marketplace would seem to be indicating that it is prepared to absorb that cost. In keeping pace with the demands of the Kinetica database market, the National Library conducted a progress review of the operations of Kinetica at the Kinetica annual users meeting in August 2000. The report's key findings revealed that there is a high prolevel of client participation among Australian libraries. The assessment also identified that Kinetica is continuing to improve its coverage of the collections held in Australian libraries and that the demand was increasing rather than decreasing or remaining steady. To ensure that Kinetica remains at the cutting edge of library research practices, the National Library has an ongoing program to develop the Kinetica database with new and improved services. In particular, there are plans to increase the size of the database, to deliver faster response times for research requests and produce greater options for copy cataloguing and reference citations. Networking our libraries to provide better services and learning opportunities is an initiative that deserves the support of this parliament, but it is also a project that needs to be sustained by individual communities. Federal governments can provide infrastructure, but they cannot force communities to embrace and become involved in local libraries. Individuals working together towards a common goal build communities.",76
164,Mr QUICK,PETITIONS,"Libraries: what wonderful and remarkable institutions. Australian libraries are one of the most important tools that impact on our lives. Their purpose is to provide access to knowledge, information and creative literature. Many young families use public libraries to obtain educational and relaxation journals for themselves and their children, as the cost of buying such material-especially for low income families-is far beyond their reach. Libraries also provide programs which enhance the needs of their local communities, such as volunteers, teaching computer studies, school holiday programs, recorded books for people with visual impairment and, in some libraries, a home library service. Our libraries have evolved as the community's needs have changed and broadened. No longer are they dwellings for just books; we now find a plethora of electronic equipment, visual and aural arts and aids. Books and multiple other resources available to us through our libraries foster communication and knowledge. Knowledge fosters understanding, and understanding hopefully creates acts of wisdom and compassion. As a society we are privileged to have access to a service that has become so integrated in our daily existence. Most of us, unfortunately, take it for granted and give little if any thought to the valuable asset we have available, let alone the daily contributions within its reach. It is critical in a nation like lia, with our population spread over a vast area, that our libraries continue to provide pathways between our homes, our businesses and the rest of the world. We all agree that computers are the way of the future, and libraries across Australia have recognised this, especially the possibilities the Internet has to offer subscribers. It is the Internet and our ability to access it through our library services that provides this nation with the ability to function. No matter what you need to know, you can ask at a library. If they cannot give you an immediate answer, they will endeavour to find it on your behalf. One can now access the entire world via the Internet in a warm and inviting, friendly environment, supported by an enthusiastic and supportive staff only too willing to guide you into the infinite treasures housed within the Net. The library buildings themselves provide a safe place for both community and informal meeting. For the low income earner, they can represent access to daily newspapers and, in extremes of weather, a comfortable environment-a safe haven where you are allowed to be. Libraries have to be one of the biggest rewards of the civilised world and possibly one of the most important ways of guaranteeing civilised responses in the future. From a newborn baby through to a PhD student, you can find a niche for yourself at your community library. Libraries are the closest sacred place we have, free from the influence of colour, creed and race: the only world where you will find an answer. As a parent, I felt passionate about my children learning to read. There was no television in our home for the first eight years of my daughters' lives. Both learned to read at age four. Every Friday night the family wandered down to the Glenorchy Library, and each family member took out their allowed quota of books. To keep our libraries alive and vibrant and to ensure that our local library is able to keep abreast of the entire range of modern technological support for its clients, the federal government must ensure adequate resource funding is made available. When one looks back at history, to the Greek, Roman, British, AustraSpanish and French empires, to name but a few, their libraries were national iconssomething to be treasured forever. We must ensure that our community based libraries are placed at such a level of importance, sensibly funded and readily accessible to each and every community member. I congratulate the member for Werriwa for raising this important issue in the House today.",78
165,Mr BALDWIN,PETITIONS,"It is a pleasure to rise today and speak on the importance of municipal libraries to local communities. It is also fitting that the importance of libraries be recognised this week, during National Book Week. I need look no further than at libraries in my own electorate of Paterson for proof of the value of these municipal libraries. Take, for instance, the example set by Dungog Library. Managed by Leslie Fisher, this library is not only promoting National Book Week but also planning to take part in the National Simultaneous Storytime. This event, where selected books are read simultaneously across the nation, promotes literacy amongst youth as well as encouraging children to see books as entertaining and educational parts of their lives. At Gloucester Library, Sharon Lyall as manager not only provides the services typically associated with libraries but also is currently playing host to an impressive and very informative display from the Department of Land and Water Conservation. Libraries demonstrating this type of initiative are of real value to their communities. Speaking of initiative, it would be remiss of me to fail to mention the tremendous initiative shown by Carol Collard, Library Services Manager for Port Stephens libraries. For instance, under her supervision and under the management of Joanne Smith, Raymond Terrace Library has recently arranged for the respected children's author Morris Gleitzman to come to the library and read his books directly to several hundred children. In giving children the opportunity to meet first hand the author of the books they are reading, this library encourages children to see books as a living reality. Tomaree Library, managed by Sue Leverington, is conducting a great initiative called the Smart Science Show. This is where staff from the University of Newcastle actually come to the library and explain the scientific principles underlying everyday events. This introduction to science at an early age is likely to stay with these children for their lifetime. We also have Port Stephens Mobile Library, which is run by Jan Shaw. This services the areas of Medowie, Williamtown, Tilligerry, Salt Ash, Seaham, Karuah, Fern Bay, Nelson Bay and Wallalong. This is providing services to those communities that have troubles with distance and it removes distance as the inhibitor to visiting the library and borrowing books. Thornton Librarywhich is opposite Thornton Public Schoolis managed by Michelle Pala and operates from Wednesdays to Saturdays. It has just celebrated its third birthday. To celebrate Book Week, the library is holding a Harry Potter display in conjunction with the Maitland Library. Beresfield Library, managed by Kim Smith, has made a very big effort in promoting National Book Week. They have done this while also running an extremely valuable Introduction to the Internet Program. I might add that Beresfield Library is currently undergoing some renovations, and I wish them well with these changes. Libraries from the north of my electorate also play a vital role in their community. The Forster, Bulahdelah, Hawks Nest and Nabiac libraries, all under the excellent management of Chris Jones, host a writers festival in March of each year. This great event brings writers of international note to the Great Lakes community. I have focused to some degree on the role of libraries in providing services to our youth, but libraries do of course provide important services to all members of our community. The Great Lakes area, for instance, an area with a high proportion of aged people, has the highest turnover of library stock in all of New South Wales. This wide appeal can only be achieved by providing valuable services to people of all ages. This appeal is proven by the simple fact that around two out of three residents of the Great Lakes area are members of the library service. The libraries not only provide services to local residents. Many of the area's seasonal tourists take advantage of the free Internet access provided by the library to keep in touch with loved ones whilst holidaying away from home. Continuing to provide these types of services will ensure the continued relevance and worth of libraries to their local communities. The library services in Paterson are also a testament to the wonderful work of the staff of all libraries, including the volunteer staff who give of their time freely for their community. Travelling around my electorate of Paterson I have been privileged to meet wonderful people in all of these libraries. Continuing to provide people with friendly advice and continuing to provide services which enrich the lives of people will ensure that libraries continue to hold the important position that they do today. I have no hesitation in affirming the value of municipal libraries to our communities.",79
166,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PETITIONS,Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. NA Question proposed: That grievances be noted. John Valves: Closure,80
167,Ms KING,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I want to take the opportunity today to talk about the closure of one of the manufacturing companies in my electorate, John Valves. I want to take the opportunity to put on record my anger at the behaviour of the American owned company Lunkenheimer and its owner, Dr Da Silva, and the unprofessional actions of his representative in Australia, a Mr Roy Pack. These two individuals alone are not responsible for John Valves being placed into the hands of administrators but they are responsible for denying 150 workers the opportunity of being offered ongoing employment. I also want to put on record my concerns about the administration process and the way in which the administrators, Carson and and MCLellan, handled their responsibilities. About 18 months ago alarm bells started ringing in regard to John Valves when the AMWU claimed that the company was unable to guarantee that funds were available for redundancy payouts that had been offered. The company directors agreed that they would provide the AMWU with ongoing information as to the profitability of company and any future plans. The company seemed to be turning the corner and as early as 2001 John Valves had won a major contract. It caused some surprise then that in December 2001 the directors announced the company was to be put into voluntary administration and that Carson's had been appointed. I met with Ian Carson on the day of the announcement and was told that on initial information provided the company seemed to be in a reasonable trading position and that funds had been set aside for workers' entitlements should the worse case scenario of the company having to fold occur. The initial decision that Carson's made not to liquidate the company was welcomed by the workers. Advertisements for prospective buyers were placed and information packages sent out. By February to March things started to go astray. I started receiving calls from workers who were concerned that the administrators had no evidence to confirm that their preferred bidder for the company had the capital he was claiming. It was claimed that the administrators had started to turn customers away, including long standing customers who had large contracts with John Valves. I was also receiving calls from the administrators' preferred bidder asking for contacts at state government level to put the capital together. Referrals were made but the preferred bidder cancelled one appointment set up and only in the final week of his bid being withdrawn took the opportunity to talk to state departmental officials about purchasing the company. During this period I am told that the administrators consistently gave assurances to the AMWU that they were certain that their preferred bidder had the $12 million he was offering to purchase the company. John Valves was at this stage losing $50,000 to $60,000 per week-add to this the administration charges and the fact that no new contracts were being entered into and claims that new business was being turned away. After several weeks of delay and continued requests from Mr Cooper to extend the sale deadline, the administrators, at the request of the AMWU, asked Mr Cooper to put the half a million dollars on the table to be drawn on on a daily basis to keep the company operating while he finalised his capital. Mr Cooper provided a letter, which I am told he claimed to be from a lawyer, confirming that Mr Cooper had half a million dollars in the bank. This letter has since proven not to be from a lawyer; rather it was from a stockbroker who is now unable to be contacted. Carson's accepted the letter on face value and again assured the AMWU that they were confident that their chosen bidder was genuine and had the capital to purchase the company. I understand that a dispute then arose between the administrators and Mr Cooper that resulted in Mr Cooper finally withdrawing his bid. I think it is clear that, despite his intentions, Mr Cooper did not have the capital to purchase John Valves and was not in a position to raise the capital. I think there was clear evidence of this within the first week of Mr Cooper having made this offer. Why the administrators continued to give assurances that Mr Cooper did have the capital is unclear. Why they continued for over six weeks to pursue an offer that would never come to fruition, why they appear to have failed to investigate the financial viability of their preferred bidder, why they failed to confirm the validity of Mr Cooper's letter claiming to be from a lawyer and why they did not attempt to pursue other bids is extremely concerning. Following the withdrawal of Mr Cooper's bid, the administrators appeared from the outside to have determined to liquidate the company. This is despite a bid from Norvil Foundry still being on the table. Although not able to guarantee all workers' jobs, it was the only bid left on the table which would guarantee that some jobs were saved. The AMWU staged a rally outside the administrators' office and put pressure on the administrators to continue to try to keep the company viable. I want to turn now to the role of Lunkenheimer and Mr Roy Pack in the eventual closure of John Valves. Lunkenheimer is a US company that patented a slurry valve which they had issued John Valves a licence to manufacture some 40 years ago. John Valves have been manufacturing this valve for all of this time and have made significant changes to the original design. According to Lunkenheimer, the licence agreement that it had with John Valves was cancelled when John Valves was placed in the hands of the administrators. Lunkenheimer was apparently angered by the fact that the administrators had included information about Lunkenheimer in the information pack they sent out. It would appear that the administrators were of the opinion that the licence contract between John Valves and Lunkenheimer was not cancelled on the advent of voluntary administration and that inclusion of Lunkenheimer's name in the information packs was legitimate. There are some questions as to why the administrators did not at this stage seek an injunction against Lunkenheimer cancelling the licence. The administrators, on advice from a patents lawyer, a patents engineer and their own lawyers, determined that they would sell John Valves as a going concern to Norvil, the only remaining bidder for the company. They notified Lunkenheimer of their intention to sell, and right up to the last minute Mr Roy Pack was assuring Ballarat community leaders that he had the best interests of John Valves' workers at heart. At the same time, Lunkenheimer commenced legal proceedings against the administrators, seeking an injunction to stop the sale. An injunction was eventually granted on the basis that a case would need to be brought to determine the status of the Lunkenheimer-John Valves licence agreement and the intellectual property rights of Lunkenheimer. Lunkenheimer were asked to put forward a surety to the court as to their intentions to proceed with this case. I understand that to date this surety has not been received and that the court action to determine the status of the slurry valve licence is in limbo. The actions of Lunkenheimer and their representative in Australia, Mr Roy Pack, have been quite unbelievable. They took every action possible to prevent the sale of John Valves. I can understand their wanting to protect what they saw as their legitimate intellectual property, but what I cannot un heimer intended to save John Valves and the workers' jobs by buying the company, claiming to be approaching merchant banks with the capital to purchase John Valves alongside other operations they were currently working on. Needless to say, no bid for the company ever eventuated from Lunkenheimer. There were claims that other bidders for the company had been offered inducements of over half a million dollars from the federal government, when no such offer had ever been made; there were allegations that the administrators-and I quote from emails to me-were their enemy and not their ally, and had committed a criminal act in attempting to sell John Valves. I cannot understand engaging the original bidder, Mr Cooper, and then referring to him in emails to me as a fraudster who never had the capital; failing to acknowledge that there were contrary legal opinions in relation to the licence; the failure of Mr Roy Pack to attend meetings he had set up; and threats of legal action to any party that questioned the valid You have only to read some of the emails that came from Dr da Silva and Mr Roy Pack during May-and that continue to come-to see the level of misinformation and libel spread by this pair. They managed to stall the sale of John Valves as a going concern to the point where administrators took the decision to fold the company, terminate the employment of the work force and commence liquidating all assets. After all of this, no funds were left for workers' entitlements, and many of the workers who have been employed by John Valves all of their working lives have lost thousands of dollars. It is unclear what the  actually was. I can only assume that their ultimate aim was to ensure that the Lunkenheimer slurry valve was manufactured by anyone other than John Valves and that they were pursuing the opportunity to resell the licence at a higher price, potentially to an offshore manufacturer. In the end, no-one has won. Lunkenheimer's claim to be able to on-sell the licence agreement is tied up in court; John Valves has ceased operations; workers have lost their entitlements; and creditors have received some, but not all, of what they are owed. The one light in this has been that the second bidder has now bought the John Valves name and the assets, and is, hopefully, going to be able to employ some of the workers who have lost their jobs. I want to commend the work of Victor Jose from the AMWU and Ben Davis from the Australian Workers Union in their extensive efforts to keep the company open. I also want to commend the efforts of the Ballarat manufacturing community, which has offered many of the workers employment. The way in which our current laws relating to administration operate means that there is no incenchange, tive for administrators to try and save jobs, expedite the administration process and limit the amount of fees that they draw from the administration. Despite his answer to me in question time in my first weeks in this House, the Prime Minister has not introduced legislation to employees' entitlements before those of secured creditors when companies fold. He promised this in the election campaign, and in February he promised to look into this issue. The workers are now reliant on GEERS to fund the minimum of their entitlements. I call on the government to make sure that they apply this scheme in the broadest sense. There are certainly limitations with the scheme. I am particularly concerned that the family of a worker who died during the period of administration will not be able to access his entitlements. There are also 12 other workers who terminated their own employment due to the uncertainty of the conditions they were experiencing during this period. Gilmore Electorate: Youth",80
168,Mrs GASH,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I want to outline what is mostly a positive story, with only a little bit of grievance. I am very pleased to see that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is at the table and will hear some of these positive messages. During the break, a number of events highlighted the lessons to be learned from young people in my Gilmore electorate. The first was when 56 representatives from a third of the schools in Gilmore came to have morning tea with me in my office. It was a bit of a squash, but not just physically: it was also difficult to get all of those amazingly inquiring minds into one room. Every year I invite all the primary and secondary schools to send representatives to meet with me to discuss current affairs and how we can use leadership to change the world around us. Because so many come, we have to do this in three or four rounds. The work of the teachers is obviously paying off. The calibre of the students' participation was excellent. They quickly picked up the theme of leadership and how to make and they certainly ran with it. In that room we worked on all sorts of issues, and I was impressed by the breadth and depth of knowledge and ideas. Everyone listened to what others had to contribute and, instead of pulling their ideas down, constructively commented on what might improve each idea. We actually had a discussion that put looked at many sides of each topic and gave them all the same weight. There was almost no polarisation in debate because there were rarely only two sides to any question. I was astounded at their knowledge of both local and national issues. We in parliaments, at all levels, could take a lesson from these young people. Whilst this kind of debate does indeed go on in our committee work, the public rarely get to see or understand this work: all they see is the spectacle of parliamentary question time each day. Everyone in my office last Friday morning learned some things and everyone got something to think about. However, rather selfishly, I probably got the most. Since that morning tea, Master Erin James, the male school captain of Avoca Public School, which is in the Southern Highlands part of my electorate, sent me a note of thanks saying that he had been inspired to do great things. Hopefully he might turn out to be a politician. We talked about how every person can lead through their own actions, regardless of their appointed position in an organisation or society. We agreed that it was up to all of us to encourage right behaviour, right thinking, respect for others' points of view and responsibility for both ourselves and our community. However, there was one disappointment: not one in the group wanted to become a politician. Reasons given were that no-one likes you when you become a politician; you have to work too hard; the hours are too long. They really did not know much about what a politician actually does. There is an opening for us here: we need to tell them more about what we do. If we do not, no-one may be coming on to replace us as politicians in the future. The very next day I went to watch a game of rugby league in Gerringong, another part of my electorate. The Gerringong Lions is a club that involves the entire community. The community provides uniforms; it also provides insurance for the players, the coaches and the trainers and their staff. But nobody paid. Everybody is a volunteer. Everyone is of equal importance and of the same value. Mr Deputy Speaker, you could say that they all get the same pay: the satisfaction of a well done. They also get the support and camaraderie of the hundreds of people who make up the Gerringong Lions as well as that of the wider community. There must be something in it. We have players driving sometimes hundreds of miles back to Gerringong to train and play every week. Each level of player supports those playing at levels above and below him. For instance, it is great to see the first graders make the effort to come and watch the under-sevens play and stay all the way through to the game of the under-18s. They all support one another on and off the field. They give good advice and shout encouragement from the sideline. The emphasis here is on teamwork at every level and all through life in the community. This can be seen at their social functions, where the senior players make sure that the juniors and their partners are included in their conversations and are not seated separately from them. There is also a strong sense of right behaviour in the club. Players and anyone else associated with the Gerringong Lions are always polite, considerate of others and well dressed. This is part of the reason why I actually sponsor the under-18s in particular and support the Gerringong Lions in general. To the game. What a lesson in persistence the under-18 Gerringong Lions gave us. Players from the electorate of my colleague the member for Eden-Monaro were huge in comparison with ours, and a lot of the time they played the man rather than the ball. Our southern opponents were ahead for most of the match-but, each time they scored, the Lions fought back. Given my lack of football knowledge, it is unusual for me to get too involved. But by this time. I was there on the sideline with everyone else, riding the emotional roller-coaster with them. Towards the final siren the other team got another try. Our heads went down and we were disheartened and sure that the Lions were out of time. But no, these under-18s regrouped and went on is with the game. They were rewarded for believing in themselves and they scored again right on the bell. The score was good also because teamwork won out over brute force. job Our young men believed in themselves to the end, after many of us adults had given up. They reminded me to keep going and never give up until you hear the siren and make the final score. The third incident that involved young people was a public meeting I attended last Thursday night. The meeting was called by a group of people eager to make a point on the immigration policy. I went along to give another point of view. After the initial speeches, it was time for questions and/or comments from the floor. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would expect, some of those questions and comments were directed at me as the local federal representative and highlighted particular issues of concern to the organising group. What surprised and disappointed me was one young fellow who asked a question that was specifically targeted at scoring points. Rather than asking for or offering information to the meeting, this young person saw himself as quite cool for asking a question to score a supposed hit. Unfortunately for him, his question was quite foolish and it was easy to point out for the audience the context which he had chosen not to take into account. But I was saddened that he had been encouraged in some way to think that the right way to act was to work with halftruths and innuendo to score a political point. Surely we have more than enough of that here in this place, and I would hope that young people would do it better when they get here. I believe there is a message that we need to get out into the community, and that is good decisions can only be made after excellent information is well debated and thoughtfully considered by as many people as possible. We need to encourage well informed debate and discussion skills at all levels out in the community. We also need to assist our voters in seeing themselves as decision makers and to encourage them to participate in democracy on a regular basis. We need the open-mindedness, teamwork, respect for others and dogged perseverance demonstrated by Gilmore's young people in the last week. We do not need more of the ugly personal attack, cynicism and apathy that exist today in far too many governments and communities. Congratulations to the young people coming on in Gilmore. I look forward to working with you in government and in the community well into the future. Defence: Parliamentary Program",83
169,Ms GRIERSON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"It is a pleasure to stand up and talk about some of the things that parliamentarians actually do. During the recent recess, like several of my colleagues, I had the opportunity to participate in a joint defence parliamentary program. That program was aimed at increasing the knowledge of members of parliament about our defence forces; and, as we spend almost 50 per cent of our budget on defence, it seems to me that it is essential that we know with certainty what is happening and that we are well informed. That program was of particular relevance to Newcastle, the electorate I represent. We are skilled shipbuilders and are short-listed on the tender to construct the new patrol boats. I have spoken in this House before about Newcastle's success with Australian Defence Industries and the successful completion of the minehunter project on time and on budget. This program was a chance to find out more about the operational requirements and the specific design needs of patrol boats. It was also complemented recently in Newcastle by the emergency visit of HMS Nottingham. Certainly we are a defence capable and defence friendly port, city and region. I would like to pay tribute to the personnel and the organisations of the Newcasthat tle Port Corporation, RAAF Base Williamtown and the Singleton Army Base for their support for the Nottingham in its time of need. So on Monday, 29 August, I joined the crew of HMAS Warrnambool in Darwin to spend five days in work experience-what they jokingly referred to as ‘an adventure cruise'. Certainly it is not a cruise for Navy personnel. The captain of the Warrnambool, Lieutenant Commander Mark Sorby, his officers-Lieutenant Michael Jagger, ex-Royal Navy; Lieutenant Anita Sellack, a Newcastle navigator; and Lieutenant Danny Hughes, also a navigator-his senior sailors and his junior seamen made sure that my visit was a genuine one which gave me the opportunity to see our naval forces at work. That was a new experience for me and certainly one that I learnt from. The activities I was involved with were ones that they do every day: the safety of life at sea and the boarding party operations. I saw them acting in diverse roles. On a patrol boat with only 25 crew they certainly had to be multiskilled and take on many roles. During that visit-that five-day expeditionwe did eight hours of operations with the frigate HMAS Sydney. With a boat exchange, I was able to meet with Commander Bates, who was very generous with his time in answering my questions about the operations happening in northern Australia at the moment. I also observed the integration of women on the Sydney and thank the women of the seamen's quarters for sharing their experiences with me. At the end of the sea journey, I was able see the whole operation by visiting FIMA, the naval dockyard and Northern Command. In every one of those venues our personnel were frank, realistic and shared honestly their experience and information with me as a member of parliament. My hosts at Larrakeyah Naval Base- Mr Ray Perry, who coordinated the program, and Lieutenant Commander Samantha Jackman from Canberra-made sure that everything went very well. At the end of that expedition I visited the Darwin ship and engineering yard and the Northern Territory Director of Business, Industry and Resource Development in the Northern Territory government. I also visited the Director of Defence Industry Australia to understand the ADI position with respect to patrol boats and to look at the NT training needs and the opportunities for us to work well with them. From that time on the HMAS Warrnambool and from talking with our ADF personnel three firm themes emerged. The overriding one was service to the country. That is a fairly abstract concept to me and many Australians but to the naval personnel I dealt with that was their primary focus. They were proud to serve their country and they were particularly intent on doing that well. The other theme was their absolute commitment to training and to continuous learning. I found a culture that was very much about skill and professionalism. Another theme that came through very clearly was the constant quest for the best equipment, state-of-the-art equipment, so that an adequate response may be possible. Communications, surveillance and weaponry certainly absorbed many of the defence personnel I spoke with. They particularly wanted equipment that supported their primary operations. On the patrol boat the boat party and the boarding parties were not interested in comfort at the expense of their operational effectiveness-I praise them for that. Other issues emerged from that experience, and one was the great need for coastal surveillance across the north of Australia-it is a big ocean. Patrol boats and an expanded coastguard presence were discussed. I was able to test that against the to Coastwatch surveillance system that integrates a civilian role with a Defence Force role. The other issue that emerged was the role of the ADF in the Asia-Pacific region. Concerns about instability and insecurity in that region with some of our neighbours were shared with me, and I share those concerns. These are neighbours with whom we need to strengthen our relationship. We certainly need to increase our diplomacy efforts, our foreign aid efforts, our partnerships and joint programs with those neighbours. I was also able to speak to many people who had served in East Timor. Supporting stability in our region came through as a major role for our defence forces. The integration of the Australian defence forces across all services-Navy, Army and Air Force-was also something that people were discussing quite openly. There is much to be gained from integration-there are effectiveness gains; there is better management of our costs and resources and some improved understanding across the forces when they do have shared operations. That is something that is happening, and I was very pleased to see that aggregation happening that enhances and frees up our resources and services in a positive way. At the moment, the high level of operation was also an issue that became very evident. Families are not seeing their loved ones quite so often. They are faced with moving and the sorts of burdens that we just expect our defence personnel to take on. But with the high level of operation, our resources are stretched and there is some strain on our equipment and our personnel. Another issue that was evident and which enabled me to do a little more research was the use of our Reserve forces. They had an exemplary role in East Timor and that continues. They were very proud of their contribution, and it was spoken of very highly by all forces. I also spoke to people who had to leave the Regular Army, Air Force or Navy because of their career, family or personal needs. Many wished to stay. One of the challenges is to make it attractive for them to stay, but if they do need to leave we must make sure that our Reserve forces are adequately resourced and serviced as well. Recently at a joint public accounts committee we looked at the Reserve forces expenditure. At the moment, it is $1 billion per annum. I think we need to know that that is being efficiently used. In concluding, what shone through that whole experience was the excellent men and women who are dedicated and resourceful and who constantly adapt unquestionably to the changing demands in the environment that this country currently experiences. We ask more of them, we ask more of the equipment and we place pressures on them and ask them to make some compromises in regard to their personal life. The absolute commitment, professionalism and dedication of our armed forces were things that I know need to shape our decisions here. They certainly are considering the prospect of war. They have no hesitation in saying that that is what they train for and that the ultimate end sometimes. They are very committed to being very well prepared for that role, but they balance that with an understanding of what that means. That is something perhaps I have explored too. It means a long-term commitment; it means a strain on our current resources; it has some human costs, both here and away; and it requires substantial government supportthere is no room for tokenism. Our defence forces were also very much aware that there were other solutions that they would like this government to explore. They are diplomatic solutions, they are solutions in our own region to improve stability and security, to effectively resource our ADF and, certainly, to collaborate and consult with the wider community and the international community. In ending, I thank all that were involved with the program and particularly pay tribute to HMAS Warrnambool and her crew. Canning Electorate: Forest Industry",85
170,Mr RANDALL,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Canning) (5.23 p.m.)My grievance this evening is the abandonment of the value-adding timber industry and its workers by the Australian Labor Party in Western Australia. In my electorate of Canning I have three predominant mills: Colli and Sons at Mundijong and the associated mill at Dwellingup, Maclean's Timber Industries also at Mundijong and Heritage Sawmillers at Jarrahdale. The incredible thing about these three mills is that they are all mills that value-add: they are not mills that just go in in a computerised fashion and hack away at a log and get low yield; they are mills that actually take on second-grade and third-grade logs and seek higher yield by examining each log for its best possible cut. The timbers from these woods are then put into the industry for value-adding in such areas as floorboards and furniture making. The sad part about this is that people in Western Australia-and maybe Australiado not see the timber industry in the northern part of the forest, the jarrah forest, as being as important as the south-west; yet it is. There are significant jobs and industries is which are associated with this activity that could really do some good, not only for the workers and those wanting to be employed in this industry but in terms of growing the industry in its value-adding operations. This is my grievance this evening: that they are not getting a fair go, and they are not getting a fair go-as I explained in an adjournment debate here not so long ago-because of the timber allocations that they are receiving. The timber allocations had been on hold for some time until last week when Judy Edwards, the state conservation and environment minister, announced the draft plan for the Conservation Commission's management for this industry. The industry had sat in limbo since the state government was elected back in February last year with a promise from the state Labor government that it would not see the workers out of a job, that it would not see them in trouble and that it would look after them. They made some incredible statements that they would-knowing that they would miss out on jobs-actually turn most of them into forest rangers, guides and all this sort of stuff. Well, none that seems to have happened. The sad part about all this is that the timber allocations have sat, as I have said, dormant for so long. Terry Keogh from Heritage Sawmillers in Jarrahdale, which specialises in she-oak, would have gone into the forest, if allowed, and taken fallen logs and dead standing timber, but he has been stopped from doing this. If that is not conservation at its best, if that should not suit the Greens right down to the ground-that they would go in and pick up fallen logs and dead standing timber-I do not know what is. But he has not been allowed to do that. You have got the case of Maclean's, who completely retooled their mill operation to take small jarrah logs. These small jarrah logs were to come off the mining site from Alcoa-and other mining operations and sand mining in Western Australia-because they are small and they are not commercially viable to the large timber mills. So they retooled to take in these small, bent jarrah logs. Were they allowed to have them? No. Of course, there is always a complication with these things, and one is that the Forest Products Commission, headed by Dr Biggs, could not see his way to negotiate debts for both of these companies. And you would say, ‘Why have they got debts?' They have got debts because they have not got any timber to trade their way out. So it reached an impasse. I have been out to Maclean's and have seen their operation in Mundijong, and there is this huge mill just sitting there, waiting take in these logs that they generally burn on mining sites and they cannot get any because the Forest Products Commission and the state government, until then, could not get their act together to allow these people to get access to this sort of timber. So we have come to a pretty parlous state. We have got the state government-who won the election on a number of things, they claim, but one of them was that there would be no logging of old-growth forest-saying that there would be no logging in old-growth forests. I have got to tell you that around Dwellingup and around Jarrahdale there are no old-growth forests-they are all forests that have been harvested in the past. As these of timber millers will tell you, they have a vested interest in making sure that they actually look after these forests, that they maximise their care so that they have a resource for the future. This argument about, ‘You can't touch the timber because it's an oldgrowth forest,' is just a furphy. One of the standouts of this value-adding in my electorate is the School of Wood in Dwellingup. It takes on apprentices, both male and female, and turns out excellent craftsmen and excellent examples of jarrah but also she-oak, wandoo and blackbuttparticularly Western Australian timbersfine furniture. Yet, what sort of future will these people have if the restrictions they are suffering continue? Last week, the state government announced in their 10-year plan that the lower end of the allocations is 106,000 cubic metres of timber, and the top end is 164,000. I know it is a draft plan, but they had two bob each way-106,000 and 164,000. Most people who are aware of the industry in Western Australia say that anything under 200,000 cubic metres is not sustainable. As a result we have seen jobs go in the south-west and in my electorate. The state government have also said that they would make available 300,000 in some ethereal sort of allocation over 10 years, should it become available in the quota. What sort of value can you put on that commitment when they took 1½ years to get their act together in the first place? I see that the opposition environment spokesman, to Mr Thomson, has come into the House. He might be interested in looking after these environmental concerns, even though they are not in his electorate. The industry is in a pretty bad state, but what has possibly saved people in my electorate is the fact that Simcoa, a large mining consortia, is going to grant smaller boutique millers access to the timber off the mining sites, particularly jarrah. The trouble with this is that it is second and third grade timber, and it takes a lot more work to get a decent yield out of those sorts of logs. At least it is something. There is a possibility that it could be up to $60,000. Why am I saying all this? The federal government have been criticised for not coming up with $15 million in its Forest Industry Development Assistance package. Why would they, when the state government would not give a straight answer on their allocations? They just want the money; they are not telling us what they are going to do with it. Maybe now, because we cannot get any certainty, honesty and transparency out of the state government on this issue, we should look at timber mills like Colli, Heritage and Maclean's and help them value-add their timber in my electorate so that they produce jobs in the area and do something for the resource. I am told that the tourism minister in Western Australia, Clive Brown, is a bit of a lightweight in Western Australia-in fact, wasn'the the one who walked out of a Labor Party conference over there because he has a problem with Brian Burke? He is obviously not in the inner sanctum of the state Labor government and he is coming out and slamming the federal government's role in this, but it is very transparent: ‘We have an agreement with you, and when you tell us what you have got, we will do it.' We have Kim Chance and Judy Edwards, who cannot carry much weight in the state cabinet. The upshot is that the timber workers are very much in need of a champion in the cabinet. They have not got it in those ministers, and Geoff Gallop is too scared to go out into the electorate and talk to the timber workers. They have been abandoned. (Time expired) Veterans: Vietnam",87
171,Mr EDWARDS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I want to remind the House that yesterday was Vietnam Veterans Memorial Day, and I was fortunate enough to attend two services yesterday. Vietnam Veterans Memorial Day is held on 18 August, the day that we remember the Battle of Long Tan. It was an excellent day, and there was an excellent turnout at the two places I went to. It is indeed coming a very significant day for Vietnam veterans. I am sorry to say that I have heard from my old mate Bob Buick up in Queensland that the 6RAR diggers are still being refused permission to wear the Vietnamese awards which were to be presented to them by a very grateful Vietnamese government. They were prevented at the last minute by the Australian government, which said, ‘No, we have not got permission from the Queen for you to receive these awards.' A very embarrassed group of Vietnamese officials had to slip down to the local market and buy dolls and cigar boxes, which they presented to these very brave diggers in lieu of the medals. As you are very well aware, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, approval was given for veterans to wear awards from overseas. Unfortunately, can despite the fact that Vietnam veterans can now wear Vietnamese awards, this group of veterans, because the government of the day has fallen, are still refused permission to wear the awards. They do not have the paperwork, although they have all the evidence. I think that is a very unfortunate situation. It will change, but it will not change under this government. I recently had the opportunity to take part in a very interesting trip as a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade-along with you,",89
172,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"to Kuwait, the Persian Gulf, Bishkek and Bagram. It was tremendous to have that first-hand contact with our troops. Like the previous speaker, the member for Newcastle, I came away with a very high regard for our troops. I have always had a high regard for them, but the young men and women of the Australian Defence Force do us proud. They have some needs, and I do not want to go into them too much, because the committee will be preparing a report, but I do want to encourage the responsible minister to have a look at the reason our troops are having to wait so long for their medals. I have a view that recognition delayed is recognition denied. These people are deserving of recognition for the job that they are doing. There is a bureaucracy in place which is slowing down the awarding of these medals. Indeed, some members of the ADF have to be- wait many months before they get the award. I think it would be tremendous if the medals could be sent up to them so that they could be presented as a ship's company, a squadron of soldiers, or as a group of RAAF personnel, before they come home. I think that that would ensure some recognition for them, and I urge the government to have a look at that situation. The issue of compensation was raised with me by a number of our ADF personnel. I am currently supporting a group called the Coalition of Australian Veterans, who have a petition circulating in the community. That petition calls on the parliament to do five or six things. One of the points made on the petition is: That defence and war service are unique and due to the nature of this service that private insurance for defence personnel is often difficult to obtain. It seems to me that some people in the bureaucracy cannot differentiate between warlike and non-warlike service. They ask, ‘What is the difference between a public servant and a soldier getting a certain level of compensation?' Let me tell you a couple of differences. Members of our ADF are often in dangerous situations where other people are trying to kill them; they are in war zones, where they cannot get insurance; and, if they do get insurance, in the main there are war clauses which prevent them from getting coverage while they are in war zones. Members of the ADF also spend immense time away and separated from their families and loved ones. There are a number of differences. I think we have to recognise that there is such a thing as warlike service and that it is different from the experience of other people covered by compensation. Point 2 of the petition states: That Government has an obligation to adequately support members of the Defence Forces who are injured or wounded in the course of duty. We have an obligation as a nation-it should be a strong obligation-to ensure that, when members of the Defence Force are injured or wounded in the course of duty, they are adequately looked after. The next point says: That Government has an obligation to adequately support families of defence force personnel killed on duty. That should be the No. 1 priority for any nation, and for any government, but we know that that is not happening. We only have to look at the case of Kylie Russell, a recent war widow, to know that families are not being as well looked after as they should be. I want to pay tribute to Kylie Russell. She is a young woman with a very young baby, grieving the loss of her husband, but she is determined to do something to ensure that other members of the ADF community are better looked after than she was. She was the first person to sign this petition, knowing that she would cop a fair amount of media attention. She braved her way through that and did an excellent job. I must say that I am very upset about her treatment by the office of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs: they were embarrassed at the revelations and fudged the figures on war widows payments. The Coalition of Australian Veterans put out a media release headed ‘Minister's figures on war widows payment misleading and tricky'. In the release, they say: Minister Vale's office continues to push figures to the media and the defence community in response to the war widows payment which are grossly misleading. These figures contradict her own department's web site They include double counting They include a pre tax assumption, which does not exist They include two small lump sums as an indexed pension As we now find out, the figures that the minister's office put out also included an amount of $8,000, which was to cover the cost of the gold card. The release goes on to say: The figures that the minister's office has released which cause most anger to the defence community include two payments under superannuation as two separate indexed pensions. Not only does this paint a false picture, but also it includes a soldier's own superannuation contributions. There is no doubt that the Minister's office is trying to fudge the figures. This is because the Government is embarrassed at the inadequacy of existing compensation and its lack of action to fulfil its own promises made since the Blackhawk disaster in 1996. There is currently a review of the Military Compensation Scheme. Hopefully, this petition, which already has many thousands of signatures-but, of course, there is room for more support-will be presented to the parliament before that military compensation group introduces its legislation. The government has set up a process of consultation involving various ex-service organisations. These ex-service organisations are doing a great job: they are working very hard and are very committed to this task. One group that the minister has not put on to the working party is a coalition of younger veterans made up of Gulf War veteranspeacekeepers and peacemakers. They are probably one of the most relevant groups and they ought to be consulted. I call on the minister to ensure that this group are brought onto this working party, because I am sure that the knowledge they have is very recent. They have worked under the current situation; they know its strengths, its pitfalls and its weaknesses. Above all, we should be looking after our Defence Force families. Health: Parkinson's Disease",89
173,Ms GAMBARO,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Petrie) (5.43 p.m.)The incidence of Parkinson's disease in our population is increasing. Australian researchers believe that the number of people suffering from this debilitating disease may be double that which was previously thought and could be costing the community as much as $1 billion a year. The Medical Journal of Australia states that the very latest estimates put the number of people with Parkinson's disease at nearly 80,000-that is an increase of 100 per cent since 2000. Parkinson's is no longer a disease that simply affects older people; more and more young people are being struck down by it. With an ageing Australian population, we know that the prevalence of this disease will continue to grow. We need to understand how this disease impacts on our entire population-from sufferers, their carers and families right through to the costs and how it affects our whole community. Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological condition that causes difficulties in the coordination and control of physical movement, such as talking, swallowing and walking. It can also affect the way a person thinks and reacts on an emotional level. Parkinson's disease is a result of a loss neurotransmitter dopamine from the brain. Presently there is no cure for Parkinson's, but it is not contagious. A cure is a long way off. We need to develop a national coordinated strategy for people with Parkinson's disease. We can no longer ignore the needs of people who are sufferers of this disease. We also need to understand how many Australians are living with the disease, how it affects them, how it affects their carers and families, and how much the disease is costing the community. To find the answers to these questions we need to undertake a prevalence study of Parkinson's disease in the Australian community. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme cost for Parkinson's drugs is estimated to be around $30 million per annum. This does not take into account the cost of associated therapy, such as the treatment of depression, incontinence, falls, fractures, hospitalisations and so on. All of these costs are borne by the federal and state governments and the taxpayers. Many people wrongly assume that Parkinson's disease is only about tremors-but it is not. People in my electorate who are sufferers of this disease frequently speak of how the disease makes life difficult not only for them but also for their families and carers. They talk about how upsetting it is for them to see their loved ones denied a normal life. Not all of the people I have spoken to are older Australians; many of them are much younger Australians who have had to drastically change their lives to cope with the treatment of this disease. When actor Michael J. Fox publicly declared that he had Parkinson's disease and that he had been a sufferer for a very long time, he changed that whole public perception about the disease. The public shock with which his story was greeted demonstrated many of the misconceptions about Parkinson's disease. His story showed that even young people are not immune from the disease. One of the biggest problems is that Parkinson's disease is very rarely diagnosed. Many people may not even consider that their malaise could be the result of Parkinson's disease. Too often it is equated with old of the age or growing old. A prevalence study would be the first of its kind ever undertaken in this country and would attempt to collect comprehensive data on Parkinson's-data that has not been collected for more than 40 years. At present we do not know the answers to basic questions such as how much it costs Australian taxpayers and how much we could save by improving diagnosis, intervention and treatment. The study will not only establish the cost of Parkinson's but also help develop improved diagnosis and measure the cost efficiency of intervention techniques the experts hope to develop along the way. I am informed by local expert neurologists that the study would cost $1.5 million over a duration of, say, three to five years. Although the treatment of Parkinson's disease costs the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme $30 million per year, that is only a drop in the ocean compared with the overall cost to the health system and the community. Using US data, neurologists involved in treating the disease in Australia have suggested that a tentative figure of up to $1 lion per year is what we are looking at. If latest estimates are correct, the indirect cost of treating associated conditions such as depression and anxiety, hospitalisation from falls or accidents, surgical techniques-including implantation-and lost productivity, could run to thousands of millions of dollars. From a government perspective, we need to know how to treat the disease, how much it is actually costing and how it will impact on future health budgets. The government has already made healthy ageing a major priority and is working with state and territory governments on a strategy for health and ageing. It has made the improved health and well-being of older Australians its major goal over the next five years. In the Intergenerational Report in the federal budget, the Treasurer outlined his and the government's goals. The report showed that over the next 30 years the number of Australians over the age of 65 will grow from 2.4 million in 2001 to 5.4 million in 2031. In my electorate of Petrie, 20 per cent of the population is aged 65 years and over. The average for this age bracket is around 14 per cent. This age group suffers from a number of age related diseases, of which Parkinson's is a significant one. A recent study by the University of Technology in Brisbane found that Parkinson's disease was second only to Alzheimer's disease as one of the most common degenerative diseases of the nervous system. The study concluded that the significance of Parkinson's disease in an ageing population will be a major factor in future health policies and budgets. The results of this study send the very clear message that, without the prevalence study to determine the extent of Parkinson's disease in our communities, we can no longer effectively predict the impact that it will have on future health policies and budgets. It would be unwise to ignore the obvious growth of this disease in Australia. As quoted previously, the Medical Journal of Australia suggests that, in the last two years, the incidence of Parkinson's disease nationally has increased by 100 per cent-a 100 per cent increase in two years. This rapid increase may suggest a rise in the incidence bilof the disease along with improvements in its the diagnosis. Either way, it demonstrates the need for a study to be undertaken to help us understand the disease and design treatments to make the lives of sufferers, carers and their families much easier. Without this sort of study, we cannot accurately predict the impact of this disease on our population and how to spend the health budget to cope with the disease. As a government we have demonstrated our commitment to making decisions that will impact on future health policies and budgets. The Intergenerational Report highlighted the forward thinking that will be necessary in this millennium to cope with changes in our demographic and the changes in the needs of this demographic. We are committed to ensuring that Australians have some of the best access in the world to medicines and to care. As a member of the government I am very proud of the track record that we have in this regard. But if we are to ensure that our future is adequately catered for, we really must make decisions now. It is therefore vital for the future of this nation that we undertake a prevalence study to collect comprehensive data on Parkinson's disease in Australia-data that will provide answers that we need for the future. Therefore, I call for a prevalence study into Parkinson's disease. We can no longer ignore the needs of our older Australians. We really need to ensure that we have the future of our Australians, particularly our older Australians, at heart. Education: Advanced English for Migrants Program",91
174,Ms GEORGE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I take this opportunity to raise concerns on behalf of my constituents about the loss of the Advanced English for Migrants Program, known as AEMP, previously conducted by the Illawarra Institute of TAFE. As I understand it, for the past 10 years the Commonwealth has funded the AEMP and, until very recently, this had been successfully conducted on behalf of many migrants to the Illawarra and non-English speaking people in that region. The course was highly valued. It had three streams: an introduction to studies, retraining for workers, and the bridging and refresher courses for overseas qualified workers-and this one in particular is sorely missed. TAFE had previously managed the funding and ran courses locally to meet industry requirements and also provided a series of work opportunities for the students engaged in this course. As part of the course, the AEMP ran a work placement component that gave students the opportunity for real workplace experience before going on to full-time employment. In the Illawarra region the AEMP courses were conducted at a number of campuses, including Wollongong, Wollongong West, Dapto and Shellharbour. In 2001 this program was sent out to tender in line with the fallacious views held by this government that the private sector can provide some measure of competition to public provision. Regrettably, that philosophy has resulted in a very precarious situation for the many students who had previously availed themselves of the course conducted by TAFE. This year the funding went from the TAFE institute to a small, local provider. I must say that I do not have any problems with this provider-it does a very good job in a range of courses locally-but the point is that it is not the appropriate vider for the full range of AEMP courses previously conducted by the TAFE institute. I have had a number of submissions from students who have written to me outlining the problems with the new provider, which is unable to meet the full range of courses previously on offer, particularly those courses geared at students looking for work or the appropriate bridging courses for those seeking to upgrade their skills and qualifications to make use of local employment opportunities. The previous AEMP program seems to have completely fallen off the shelf. For example, there is no specific English for vocational purpose courses on offer. It seems amazing to me that the federal Department of Education, Science and Training would opt out of such an important program considering the successful outcomes from the courses previously conducted under the TAFE auspices. The TAFE institute locally in the Illawarra has well qualified teachers, up-to-date resources, including a new state-of-the-art language laboratory, and extensive networks and local contacts with industry and employers-in other words, all the preconditions to ensure that we offer the best we can to people from a non-English speaking background and the many new migrants who settle in our region. I have to ask why it is that we are tendering federal funds to private providers when previously high quality courses had been conducted through our public TAFE institution. I take this opportunity to urge the federal minister to urgently supplement the funds to the Illawarra Institute of TAFE so that it can once again provide the high quality courses that are in great demand by a high proportion of our local population which comes from a non-English speaking background or are newly arrived migrants. While I am at it I also urge the minister, as well as meeting the needs of the local courses, to consider the very parlous financial state in which the TAFE system nationally finds itself. Regrettably, public investment in vocational education and training in this country has been falling rather than rising. This surely is a matter of serious naprotional import. As we are well aware, as local members of parliament with the many complaints we receive, funds to the TAFE system were frozen for several years following the election of the Howard government. This freezing of TAFE funds occurred at the same time that enrolments rose by almost six per cent a year. It is a national tragedy that in the year 2000, 40,500 students were unable to be accommodated in TAFE courses. The current ANTA agreement is providing some measure of relief-that is, a meagre $230 million over three years to meet increased pressure-but falls well short of what the state ministers were urging. They were urging a funding supplement nationally to the tune of $900 million to meet the unmet demand that continued to rise while TAFE funds were frozen. The vocational education system in this country is one that all members of parliament I think wholeheartedly support, but it is one that the Howard government has failed. There are over one million students now studying in TAFE institutes nationally, and in my state of New South Wales over half a million students are in the TAFE system. We hear a lot about the need for Australia to compete increasingly in a globalised world economy, and we know that fundamental to that is the investment that we as a nation make in our people: in their knowledge, in their skills and in the upgrading of their skills. Surely, if that is the case, there can no argument that there is a need to rapidly enhance the commitment by federal government to the funding that is necessary to ensure that all students who desire to enter a stream of vocational education and training are able to find their place in many of our wonderful institutes. On behalf of the local students, I use this opportunity to bring to the minister's attention the fallacy in contracting out courses to the private sector which clearly are unable to provide the breadth and depth of courses that are available through our public institutes of TAFE. Secondly, it is important to bring to the attention of the minister and the public the wasteful duplication of resources that occurs in this process of tendering or contracting out. We have marvellous facilities at our local institute: a new language laboratory and highly trained and skilled staff who could conduct the courses previously conducted through their institutes. At the same time, we have students complaining to local members of parliament about the inadequacy of the service that is being delivered by the provider that won the tender-those desperately needed Commonwealth funds. If we are serious about investing in our people, then there is no option other than to urgently upgrade the funding for our national TAFE system. In the meantime, we need to urgently supplement the funds for the Illawarra Institute of TAFE so that it and its staff can continue to provide the full range of courses so vitally needed for the many newly arrived migrants in my electorate and to those people of non-English speaking background who are desperately seeking to upgrade their skills and qualifications so that they can get meaningful employment and contribute to our regional economy. Sugar Industry",93
175,Mr NEVILLE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I would like to talk about two issues today, namely, the ongoing drought within Queensland and the ramifications for families that make a living from the land. It is important that we extend emergency aid to droughtaffected farmers in the form of home support and an interest subsidy. This may even require advances for planting. If the recombe mendations of the Hildebrand report are to take root, there must be farmers in place to implement them. These matters have particular relevance to the southern end of the Hinkler electorate where towns such as Childers and Bundaberg have grown and prospered on the back of agricultural industries such as sugar and small crops. Today's scenario is alarming to say the least. Along with many other parts of Australia, we have received very little rainfall and are now witnessing the decline in the fortunes of our farming families. The entire Queensland coast has received well below average rainfall this year. While it may not be a worry in the wet tropics, in other districts cane and other crop production are suffering severely. Although our communities have obtained little relief with falls of 145 millimetres in June, rainfall since the beginning of the year has averaged only 40 per cent of the long-term average. The situation is so dire that cloud seeding has been discussed and special prayer services for rain have been held in the hopes of divine intervention. In May, Queensland Sugar, the industry's marketing arm, indicated that the initial advance crop payment would be $150 a tonne of sugar, equivalent to around $12.50 a tonne of average quality cane. The final price is expected to be around $240 per tonne of sugar, below the break even point for many growers. When I addressed the Main Committee on this matter on 16 May, I pointed out that the four Bundaberg-Childers sugar mills could be expected to crush 5.1 million tonnes of cane in a good year. At that time, the 2002 estimate was down to 3.2 million tonnes and, as of today, it is down even further to 2.85 million tonnes-just over half a reasonable year's crop. While harvesting is now in full swing, final tonnages will depend on how much of the crop farmers decide to plough in or leave standing, the yield of the crop in total and its commercial content of sugar. While crushing has got under way for this season, there is a great fear that of these mills will not operate in our next harvesting season. So it is easy to understand the anxiety which plagues the industry today and haunts the streets of Bundaberg and Childers. The economic effects of this downturn are evident and will really bite in the fourth quarter of this year. The human dimension of this situation is plain to see and is compounded by another problem: cane growers, who do not have a water allocation, may not wish to gamble on planting a paddock for the next season. Less cane equals less revenue which equals a dramatic fall in employment in the district. We can only anticipate the devastating effect this will have on local communities-businesses will collapse, farms will be lost, families and relationships will disintegrate and there will be personal breakdowns. The immediate future weighs heavily on the minds of many in Bundaberg. This has been recognised by the federal government in its recent Men and Family Relationships Program. I am pleased to say that $84,000 in funding from the Department of Family and Community Services was made available to Lifeline Bundaberg to extend this program into next year. Since 1998, the coalition government has spent $22 million on this program and 53 agencies across Australia have been funded to deliver a similar program for 2002-03. In hard times like these, it is often the man of the family who suffers in silence. This funding will help local men navigate their changing role in the family unit and develop better relationship skills. Around 250 men in the wider Bundaberg region-not all of them are people from rural areas-accessed the service during the past 12 months. Bundaberg Lifeline manager Richard Johnson predicts that the numbers will rise due to the tough rural and economic conditions. He could already use more counsellors in his services. The cornerstone of community life, the key to surviving the vagaries of life, is the security of a strong family unit. I commend Mr Johnson and his team on their valuable work in supporting families in the Bundaberg region. This counselling aspect should not be forgotten in the crafting of any one or other new sugar package. Returning to the economic side of the equation, water is the key local determinant in the survival of cane and small crop industries in the Bundaberg and Childers areas. This situation highlights the need for a bag on the Burnett River Weir at Wallaville. The federal government has endorsed water storage and water storage modification at seven locations on the Burnett River and an EIS has been undertaken with respect to the Walla Weir. The Walla Weir was promised in 1993 by both major political parties as part of similar sugar packages, but, despite this, in the remaining three years of the Keating government and the final four years of the Goss Queensland government, little or no work was undertaken. In 1996, the Borbidge government announced that the weir would proceed and I was personally involved in negotiating with the then Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Hill, to see that two questionable environmental objections were dealt with. They were-and it is history now-that the construction then went ahead promptly, with state and federal government contributions of approximately $8 million each. The weir was designed to take a two-metre, inflatable-deflatable bag which would lift the capacity in times of peak requirement from 29,000 megalitres to 43,000 megalitres. For the benefit of the House, a bag is a huge bladder made of very thick plastic, which can be inflated and bolted to the top of the dam and can lift the water catchment capacity, as I said, from 29,000 to 43,000 megalitres. It was planned that the bag could be deflated in good seasons or if environmental or flood considerations required it. In October last year, the Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson, pledged $2 million towards provision of the bag, but it could not proceed because the EIS was still with the Queensland Coordinator-General and hence had not been submitted to the Commonwealth government for endorsement. I would be the last to suggest anything environmentally cavalier, but it seems to me that the deflatable nature of the bag and the fact that, with the incremental amount that the weir could deliver-that is, about 14,000 megalitres on top of its static position-the dam could be filled two or three times a year in difficult conditions, such as those we are in at present, and make a reasonable compromise and a flexible option in anticipation of the major storage planned at Paradise west of Bundaberg. Walla Weir is unquestionably an excellent balancing system and was described by one natural resource executive as ‘rolled gold'. provides additional water at times when it is required, can be lowered when necessary and will generally enhance the irrigation potential of the region. It is also very important because it is a demonstration to potential investors, be they investing directly in agriculture or in the secondary industries that might flow from agriculture or other services in the region, that our government is serious about provision of adequate water supplies. Some farmers have said that they would be happy if the bag on the Walla Weir was deflated when the Paradise and Monduran dams-Monduran being the existing dam; Paradise being the proposed dam-were full and inflated only in emergency situations thereafter. The planned Paradise dam is located 10 kilometres west of Dallarnil in the Burnett hinterland. It offers a long-term ray of hope for our drought stricken cane farmers and small crop producers. However, on the best-case scenario, the Paradise dam will not be completed until 2005-06 and will not be filled until 2006-07. The future of the district for the next four or five years leading up to that important event is absolutely critical. That is where the bag on the Walla Weir comes in. Therefore, I call on the state government to reconsider the bag enhancement to the Walla Weir as a top priority. As I said before, it is critical to our district. I remind the state government that the federal government has already pledged $2 million to that purpose.",94

178,Ms HALL,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"This is a unique experience for me. I am continuing my remarks on the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2002 and the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002, having commenced my speech at 3.39 a.m. on 28 June and finished at 3.45 a.m. on 28 June. It has been some considerable time since I put my mind to this legislation but the issues are still the same. This legislation will, as I said on 28 June, generally benefit the higher education sector, but we do have some concerns on this side of the House. I rise to support the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Unfortunately, this government's philosophy and 1950s thinking are very damaging to Australia and Australians, leading to inequity. This occurs because education is about opportunity. A good education creates opportunity. People with a good education are the ones who get the good jobs and earn the high incomes. Where you have a two-tiered system of education, you end up with a twotiered society, with people who have the education getting the jobs and earning the higher incomes. This government has moved more and more along the line to where education becomes a privilege, not a right, and that has enormous ramifications for us as a society. People who are educationally disadvantaged are disadvantaged in life. They are socially disadvantaged and they cannot enjoy a higher standard of living-the high standard of living that people with an education have. All of us want our children to succeed. It is not right that my children should have more of an advantage than the children of a person who is in receipt of, say, the disability support pension, of somebody who has been injured at work or of a single parent. They have to battle just to put food on the table and are not in a position to pay large legislaamounts of money for their children to obtain a higher education. As I have been saying, education is the key to success; success not only for individual Australians but for Australia as a whole. We are now part of a global economy, and to succeed in that global economy Australia must have people who are highly skilled, people who have knowledge and people who have a high quality education. That education, as I have said, should not be for just a few people, not just for the chosen ones within our society. Rather, it should be something that all people in our society have: work skills and an education that lead to meaningful employment. Education, knowledge and innovation are the keys to the success and prosperity of any country. As within our own society in Australia, where it is the people with education who can succeed, within the global economy it is those countries that have the highly skilled, highly cated work forces that succeed and prosper. Countries that have that knowledge and innovation enjoy the higher standards of living. Unfortunately for Australia and Australian students, the Howard government has pursued a policy of neglect-a policy that has seen $3 billion slashed from the cumulative operating budgets of universities since 1996. This is a government that has pursued a vendetta against universities, and this can be seen from figures released by the Australian Vice Chancellors Committee that reveal the dramatic rise in the student to staff ratio. This has a detrimental effect on young people's education. It means overcrowded lecture theatres, lack of student-teacher contact, compromises to learning and teaching, and overstretched staff. These have all become increasingly common features of our universities. In New South Wales in 1996, the student to staff ratio was 16.2; in 2001, it was 19.6. In Victoria in 1996, it was 17; in 2001, 20. In Queensland in 1996, it was 16.9; in 2001, 22.1. In Western Australia in 1996, it was 15.3; in 2001, 19.1. Every state that you go through shows a similar increase in the student to staff ratio, which impacts and impinges on the quality of education our young people are receiving. It is understandable that when Australia is compared to other OECD countries we cannot measure up. When you have such a decline in and erosion of the quality of our education, it is going to take its toll. The comparison with other OECD countries shows that the inequity created by this government is really coming home to roost. The government's policy of defunding our universities, its pursuit of policies designed to attract fee paying students and its changes to HECS are acting as barriers for young people not only from disadvantaged backgrounds but also from ordinary Australian families. This government is attacking our universities and pursuing policies that are making it very difficult for all students attending university. It is only those who come from very wealthy backgrounds-very privileged backgrounds-who are able to access higher education in the same way that I was able to. The government's higher education policy eduis one that promotes inequity and leads to exclusion. Education is not a privilege; it is a right. Whether or not a person undertakes higher education should be based on their ability, not their bank balance-something this government has sought to change. Fee paying students who do not achieve a TER or university entrance score that is high enough to give them access to university-they are not bright enough to get there on their ability-are now able to buy a place. And the government wants to progress this even further so it becomes a situation where it is the students from families that have the money to pay for the education of their children who will get the places in universities, the knowledge and the good jobs. As a result of that, Australia will suffer. The government has planned a voucher system, and this can be seen from some of the answers from the government in question time. On 20 June, the Prime Minister signalled that there were measures in place to increase charges students are forced to pay for university courses and that the government backed that agenda. That has enormous ramifications for all those young people attending high school at the moment who feel that they want to go on and achieve a higher education and want to go to universities. Some of the measures that are being considered-and that will be embraced by members on the other side of the House-are things such as the deregulation of fees, real interest rates for student debts, vouchers for postsecondary education, a loans scheme to replace HECS and new processes for agreeing to the number of government funded places. That can end up in a situation where, say, a student studying veterinary science-that was a degree that was being talked about at the time-would be paying up to $113,000 a year to be able to undertake that study. It really is setting up a situation where it is not your ability but the size of your bank balance that determines whether or not you can access the education that you need to secure a future in which you know that you will receive an income and security throughout your life. The other issue that concerns me greatly is the proposal to create elite universities. Once again, this is a government that is pursuing its 1950s philosophy that the best people-or should I say those with money-deserve to go to the best universities. It would be fair assume that the elite universities would charge elite-or should I say exorbitantfees and at the end of the day entry to these universities would only be available to those who attended the elite category 1 private schools on which this government is lavishing funds. What would this policy mean to other universities-the so-called equity universities, which has become a catchphrase for the minister? It would mean that they would become second-class universities. In the region I come from, the Newcastle University has a campus both in Newcastle and on the Central Coast at Ourimbah. Both those campuses undertake cutting edge research, have high quality courses and attract people from all around the country. The medical degree at Newcastle University is a highly sought after degree and one that is very difficult to obtain entry to. It has been recognised for its innovative nature. Student access to these courses and to university is going to be severely curtailed with fees and loans. What it is going to mean is that when they are coming to the stage of starting a family and having mortgages they are going to have to think twice about it. It may come to the situation where they have to choose between an education and immediate security and looking a little bit further down the track and saying, ‘By undertaking this study and investing now in the future I may be able to enjoy a higher standard of living.' And young people are not always in the position to make that decision. The government should be about developing all our universities and ensuring that all students have access to a higher education. The Howard government should be pursuing a policy that ensures regional universities like Newcastle thrive and that the Central Coast campus of the university eventually becomes a university in its own right. Unless the Howard government recognises the importance of higher education to Australia's future, unless it recognises that it is important for all Australians to be educated and have a higher level of skills and knowledge, Australia is facing a grim future. I implore the government to abandon its to elitist approach to education and join with other OECD countries and pursue a policy based on equity, not exclusion; a policy that will ensure a higher standard of living for all Australians. (Time expired)",97
179,Mr ZAHRA,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"I begin my speech on the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2002 and a related bill by stating that we recognise in our region that a big part of our future is higher education, and at the centre of that in the Gippsland region is Monash University's Gippsland campus. There has been a lot of change at Monash University's campus in Gippsland over the last two or three years in particular but really it has been a period of substantial change over the last eight or nine years. On balance, these changes have meant that we have a much better level of university education on offer to the people of Gippsland than we had before. The changes have not been easy and I know that there has been criticism from some people as the institution has made the transition from being the old Gippsland Institute of Advanced Education to being Monash University's Gippsland campus. We have seen in the last two and a half years, I think, the employment of Professor Brian Mackenzie as the Pro Vice Chancellor of the Gippsland campus. He has been a tough leader at the university at Gippsland and he has been a leader who has been able to secure more resources for our campus of the university. He has been an inspiration to many of the staff there and many of the community leaders who look to the university for leadership in a whole lot of different ways. It is all well and good for people to talk about education but the test in public life is how much you are prepared to commit in terms of resources. The Howard government have, sadly, not seen fit to properly fund and resource the university sector in Australia, and in particular it has been those regional universities and regional campuses of universities which have suffered most as a result of the cutbacks which the Howard government have put in place. We understand very clearly in Gippsland and in the Latrobe Valley in particular that we have no future, we have no way of getting ourselves out of some of the circumstances that we confront, if we do not have the resources which we need to improve people's access to university education and to encourage people to participate fully in all of the opportunities that university education can provide. I am conscious of the time and conscious of the fact that there are only a few minutes remaining in this debate until the dinner break. At the resumption of the debate at eight o'clock I look forward to continuing my remarks, Deputy Speaker Scott, and I will allow you to stop looking at the clock and to close the debate for the purposes of letting people get on with their dinner this evening.",99
180,Unknown,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 8.00,100
181,Mr ZAHRA,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"I am glad to be given the opportunity to continue to address this important topic. It is good to see you in the chair, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams. As a country member of parliament, I think you will be able to understand the things that I will address in my remarks tonight. I was saying how important Monash University is to the Gippsland region. We have in Gippsland a fine campus of Monash University, and it is based in my electorate in the Latrobe Valley. Last year, Simon Crean and the entire shadow cabinet came, and it is the first time in our history that a cabinet or a shadow cabinet meeting has been held in Gippsland. It was a big deal for us, and, to underscore the importance of the university and how important we think the university is to the future of our region, that shadow cabinet meeting was held at Monash University's Gippsland campus in Churchill. It was an important occasion and an important opportunity for people from the university to talk directly to people in the shadow cabinet about some of their aspirations for the university campus into the future. As I mentioned earlier in my remarks, we have been fortunate at Monash University Gippsland to have strong leadership through Professor Brian Mackenzie. He has been a tough leader who has been prepared to fight within Monash University structures for resources to come our way; that is, for resources to not be lost from Monash University Gippsland's campus to other campuses based around capital cities. It has allowed us to not only keep what we have but also look at opportunities within Monash University structures to expand the range of courses and programs which we offer and to better engage with the community and to use the university as an important lever for economic development. Often people talk about universities in some sort of esoteric context. The importance of moving retention rates to year 12 and the importance of getting people into universities, for example, are often talked about as statistics to be achieved. In our context in the Latrobe Valley, it is all about moving us from the old economy to the new p.m. economy in relation to some of those jobs which have been for so long a part of our community. I am talking particularly about jobs in the power industry, pulp and paper manufacturing and textile, clothing and footwear-some of those industries which have very often been characterised, unfairly, as smokestack industries. Those industries are unquestionably in decline, and that has meant an enormous loss of jobs in the Latrobe Valley and in other industrial communities just like it. We need to find our way into some of the new jobs which are being created in Australia; some of the new jobs associated with growing industries, with the services sector and with the growth in higher education. The university is our bridge to that opportunity; it is our bridge to those new jobs. Importantly, Monash University Gippsland is also a part of the social and cultural renewal of the Latrobe Valley. We get many new staff from Melbourne, from other parts of Australia and from overseas. People come to our region with new ideas, new initiatives and different ways of doing things than what we have done in the past. As a community going through transition, we need that. We need people to come to us with new ideas and initiative; we need people to come and to look at opportunities to participate within our community. Historically, the Latrobe Valley has been its best when it has been associated with change. It has been its best when we have gone through transitions. It has been its best when we have embraced new people. I talk particularly of the massive changes which took place in the Latrobe Valley in the course of the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, when we had literally tens of thousands of new migrants arriving in the Latrobe Valley to assist in the development of the enormous SECV infrastructure that is based in the Latrobe Valley. Many power stations and roads were built, and many railway lines were put in place, developed and expanded. New housing was put up. There was an enormous need for new labour, new skills and new ideas. That was a really exciting time in the Latrobe Valley's history, and we were in many ways the premier point of new settlement for migrants in Victoria-in much the same way as Footscray probably is today. In the Victorian context, the Latrobe Valley was thought of in that way in the 1950s and 1960s but less so in the 1970s and 1980s. Those were exciting times, and we think that Monash University Gippsland can be a part of taking advantage, in the same way that we did then, of some of the new ideas which are out there-and not just ideas within our own population. Sure, the university will play a part in harnessing those ideas, making sure that we get the best out of them, and using our own resources. The people involved in developing those ideas will, I am sure, be encouraged by the university to participate through the programs that they offer. More particularly, new people coming in will be part of the Monash University academic staff, the administration, the economic development component or the leadership group within Monash University Gippsland's structure. These are people you come across regularly in a Gippsland context working with community groups and with various agencies in our district to ensure best practice and best integration between what the university is trying to achieve in our region and what agencies, local government and other groups within our community are trying to achieve as well. The university is playing an enormous part in our economic and cultural renewal in the Latrobe Valley. Similarly, the state government is making an enormous contribution in the Latrobe Valley, and Gippsland more generally, to the economic and cultural renewal of our region. Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, you would know better than most people in the parliament that this region has gone through tough times. As I drive around my electorate I really enjoy seeing, at the front of schools, state government signs announcing massive increases in funding and new school buildings being erected-a new commitment being made by the state government for additional resources and for new facilities at our local schools. There are a lot schools in my district, as there should be, because we are a region of substantial educational need and disadvantage, a region that has been substantially neglected in the past, most notably by the Kennett government. It is great to see the state government investing in the Trafalgar High School, a fantastic school in my region that runs an outstanding accelerated learning program, which now has some 120 students participating in it. It is a magnificent program which offers a real alternative for families who have gifted children and do not want to feel pressured to send their kids to a private school. They are very comfortable with and fully support the outstanding accelerated learning program offered at Trafalgar High School. It is a real tribute to the school; a real tribute to the coordinator, Ms Aniko Kariko; and a real tribute to all the parents who showed faith and confidence in the establishment of that program in a community like the Latrobe Valley and made it such a fantastic success. Similarly, it has been great to see the commitment the state government has made to Warrigal Regional College and Pakenham Secondary College. The state government is also committed to another important and exciting project in the Latrobe Valley: the education precinct. Simon Crean and the shadow cabinet were briefed about the education precinct project by Monash University at a shadow cabinet meeting on the university grounds in Churchill. It is not an entirely new concept. I am sure that many members of the House will be familiar with the idea. We have a number of secondary colleges in the Latrobe Valley, and the idea is to have a consolidated senior secondary campus of year 11 and year 12 students based at the university, so the link between the university and the year 11 and year 12 students would be obvious. There would also be an opportunity to share resources and to develop the connection between the aspirations of those year 11 and year 12 students and the higher education system. This is a project that the state government has not just talked about; there has been a lot of planning involved. The Gippsland Department of Education and Training, which is based at Moe, have done a lot of very hard work on this project. I commend all those involved for their patience and diligence in the development of this concept as it moved from an idea to something that will be up and running in the course of the next few years. Similarly, I think a lot of courage has been shown by local families, who understand the importance of making this change. The great majority of people have been prepared to put aside a lot of the parochialism involved in considering education matters based on towns rather than educational outcomes. The state government are not just talking; they are putting $11 million towards this project. And so they should. This is an important project for an area which, unfortunately, still has one of the lowest year 12 retention rates in the state, if not the country. That is improving and it has improved every year for the last three years, which is a real tribute the efforts of Steve Bracks and his team. These are important outcomes and not just statistics for us in the Latrobe Valley. We are talking about people's lives, about opportunity, about people feeling that they should go on and that, if they do go on, they will be able to achieve, participate and get a job. We have weathered the bitter storm of restructure in the Latrobe Valley for so long that a lot of people lost confidence. Through a number of initiatives associated with the Latrobe Valley Ministerial Task Force, established by the state government-some $104 million worth of projects-people have had that confidence restored. That is exactly the type of combination communities like the Latrobe Valley need to encourage people to participate more in higher education-not just for an abstract reason, but so they can take advantage of some of the new jobs being created in their local community. We have a resilient community in the Latrobe Valley, made up of people who have been through tough times. Though these tough times, people have maintained their commitment to education. They want a better life and more opportunities than they had themselves. There has been a lot of talk in this place-probably too much talk-about people's aspirations. Terms like ‘aspirational voters' have suddenly become very popular around the place. We have always had people with aspirations in the Latrobe Valley-aspirations for a better way of life and better opportunities not only for themselves but also for their children. That is borne out by the high rates of participation in those educational opportunities offered to workers in the Latrobe Valley. People have been prepared to undertake more education as mature age students-to go to an adult literacy class and participate in the ongoing development of their skill or trade. We talk a lot about the concept of lifelong learning. We in the Latrobe Valley feel proud of our neighbourhood learning centres, our TAFE institutes, our university and, of course, our teachers and schools, which have promoted and encouraged a culture of learning in the Latrobe Valley through difficult times. I often hear people talk about the to needs of regional Australia and about its future. They talk about different things that work in different areas. From my viewpoint-and, I think, from the viewpoint of the majority of people in the Gippsland region-the university is not just one part of our future; it is the greatest part of our future. Higher education, as it involves both TAFEs in Gippsland-Central Gippsland Institute of TAFE and Gippsland Group Training-is a big part of having a high-wage, high-skill future for our region. We in the Gippsland region are not interested in being second-class citizens. We are not interested in mowing the lawns of rich city people, as the Treasurer suggested not that long ago. What we want is an opportunity to participate in the jobs associated with the new economy. We want our opportunity to be able to share in the growth and development of those new and exciting sectors, to be able to be in industries that are growing not declining. The university, the TAFEs and group training are all ways in which we can do that. These are all important ways in which we can take our share, get our bit, of the opportunities associated with that new and fast growing part of the economy. We recognise as well the importance of these institutions in strengthening our existing industries. A lot of people have the wrong view about manufacturing and do not understand that the fellows at the PaperlinX plant at Maryvale are some of the most skilled plant operators anywhere in the country, if not the world. They use computers to drive that machinery; they are not just turning valves like they used to maybe 20 or 30 years ago. There has been a lot of change, and workers in our district have been prepared to change as the needs of industry have changed. This is exactly the approach that government needs to promote and encourage. We need to see communities like the Latrobe Valley, which are working hard to find their own way and get their own future, not having to rely on other people to find a future for them. The Latrobe Valley has been gutsy in difficult times. Education and training in the Latrobe Valley is going to be a big part of our future and will make an enormous difference to us being able to access the opportunities associated with new jobs and new industries in the future.",100
182,Ms PLIBERSEK,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"Sydney) (8.17 p.m.)In speaking tonight on the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2002 I want to commend to you, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, and to the House the shadow minister for education Jenny Macklin's amendments which you may have seen some time ago. I particularly want to focus on parts (a) and of the amendment that she proposed: firstly, that the House condemns the government for its shameful neglect of public universities in Australia and its inadequate indexation of increases in universities; and, secondly, the increasing financial burden it is placing on students and their families. I see a lot of university students in my electorate. In my electorate I have Sydney University, the University of Technology, a number of TAFE colleges, the College of Fine Arts and a number of university campuses. I have living in my electorate a lot of students, a lot of academics and a lot of people who are affected by the cuts to higher education that this government has made every day. Since 1996 this government has ripped $3 billion out of Commonwealth funding in cumulative terms from the tertiary education sector, and student contributions have increased by 60 per cent. They are quite stark figures when we consider that it has always been our mission to increase access to university education, not decrease it by pulling the funding out of it and making it more and more once again the preserve of the wealthy. Fees and charges in 1989 represented 5.9 per cent of university operating revenue and now represent over 16 per cent-again, very stark figures. The reliance on student contributions has continued to increase in that time. At the same time, Commonwealth funding has gone from 65.7 per cent to 50.8 per cent of the revenue for universities. Some of that, of course, is not just increased student fees; some of it is the sorts of sponsorship arrangements that we have seen with business. Some of those arrangements are very productive. Some of them are very useful for universities. Some of them, quite frankly, are not, and have a number of associated issues relating to who owns the intellectual property in the research arrangements that people enter into. This government's reduction in spending on higher education may seem like a saving to government, but it is a very short-term saving. It is like using the credit card to pay off the mortgage. There is a reduction in the impost on today's budget, but in years to (b) come we will see the results of these cuts. Just this week, at the beginning of Science Week, we have heard scientists talking about the fact that the cuts to science funding will not be noticed this year or next year; the cuts that are being made now will be noticed in 10 years time. The stark contrast of course is with funding to private schools, which has increased quite dramatically under this government, not on any basis of need and not to the schools that really need help-and there are some non-government schools that are very poor and in need of help. We have seen the greatest funding increases go to the schools that need the least help. Increased fees is one of the ways that universities are coping with the cuts to their operating grants. The fee system has been deregulated in a number of ways that have allowed universities to increase the number of full-fee-paying students and increase the charges to those students. The results of that have been interesting to monitor. I have certainly had in my office-as I am sure you have had in your office, Mr Deputy Speaker-distraught students saying, ‘I don't know what to do; I've missed out in getting into vet science by two marks, and they've said I can get in if I can find $30,000 a year.' A particular case I am thinking of is that of a daughter of a single mother on a disability pension. That family probably would not have seen $30,000 in their whole lives, let alone be able to find $30,000 a year for the next five years. I am happy to report that, in that particular case, the girl eventually did get into a nonfee place, but there was a substantial amount of discussion with the university about the particular merits of the student before they found a place for her. Yet if she had had that $30,000 a year, she could have had 10 or 20 marks less in the HSC and it would not have made any difference; she would have got the full fee paying place. It is a dreadful shame that once again we are returning to a situation where, if you are wealthy, you can probably find a place for yourself in university-a situation where it does not matter so much what your results are like at high school; if your parents have got $30,000 a year to cough up for your university degree then you will get one. We know that there is substantial pressure on universities not to fail students who are paying full fees, and we saw the problems that Wollongong University had with one academic saying that he came under pressure not to fail full fee paying students. The resultant decline in academic standards is not difficult to imagine. If there is pressure on academics to pass students because they are paying big money and they are not going to be happy about having to repeat a year, then the sorts of results that the doctors, the vets, the scientists and the lawyers of tomorrow are getting do not inspire one with a lot of confidence. Today, however, there was something very interesting in the newspapers about the University of New South Wales actually deciding to abolish up-front university fees. I certainly welcome this move. The University of New South Wales's governing body last night voted to abolish up-front fees because of the system's inequity and the fact that it had caused ill feeling amongst many students and was lowering academic standards. It is not just me who is suggesting that these full fees are lowering academic standards and causing resentment among students; the University of New South Wales's governing body has decided that for itself. The decision followed reports earlier this year that upfront fee payers were able to buy a place at the University of New South Wales with entrance scores nearly 20 points lower than other Australian students. It is a very significant gap that you can avoid if you have got the cash. It would be terrific if we saw other universities follow this lead. The University of New South Wales always has had a very good reputation as a good university and I think that its efforts in this respect to protect its reputation, the reputation of the university, will certainly be met with applause in education circles. The cuts that I have mentioned have displayed themselves in a number of ways. University students and academics tell tales of squeezed resources, and the way they are making do really is quite alarming. At the beginning of every academic year recently there have been stories about overflowing lecture theatres, lectures that are so oversubscribed with students that, for health and safety issues, students are blocked from going into the lecture theatre. They are told that, eventually, in several weeks or months time perhaps enough students will drop out so that the lecture theatre will be able to contain the number of students doing the course. This is not a timetabling anomaly that happens every now and again; we see this year after year. It has become standard for many universities to oversubscribe courses in the hope or the expectation that students will drop out and that the lecture theatres will eventually be able to cope with the number of students doing the course. These sorts of occupational health and safety issues would not be tolerated in any workplace in the country. They do not let you sit in the aisle or stand up the back at the picture theatre. If a fire breaks out in a place like that is packed to the rafters, you have got significant safety issues. The physical environment of universities has declined. You can see that by just going for a walk in most universities these days. They do not have the sort of money that they had for upkeep. Libraries at universities are complaining that they can afford about half the subscriptions to overseas journals that they used to be able to afford. In part that is due to funding cuts, of course; in part it is due to the fall in the Australian dollar. But it is being made up for by some libraries being much stricter with the charging and collection of late fees. Students are noticing that they are paying many more late fees than they used to at much higher rates for each day that a book is late. Perhaps the area that is most affected though is face to face teaching. Most students will tell you that their face to face load has dropped dramatically. I know of one course where the standard full-time load is 33 hours. In that course they have 11 hours of what they euphemistically call ‘student centred learning'. ‘Student centred learning', of course, is students sitting around having a discussion, doing a study group. Fine, there is nothing wrong with that method of study but the idea that students should be paying HECS fees for 11 hours of discussions amongst themselves each week is wrong. And even worse in some universities, tutorials have gone from a class of 12 to maybe 20 at the outside to now regularly 40 to 50 people. Tutorials are becoming what lectures used to be. Lectures are often taped and are available electronically because students cannot fit into lecture theatres, as I was saying before. The opportunity for students to actually ask questions of lecturers is almost non-existent when you are dealing with that sort of learning environment, and it is having a substantial effect on the quality of learning for most students. In many cases students are not complaining about the drop in face to face hours because they have to work full time to afford to go to university anyway. If they had more hours of face to face teaching, they would have problems with their attendance that record because most students you talk to now are working a lot more than 20 hours a week to afford to go to university. They need to supplement the $145 a week from Austudy, particularly in an area like mine where it is pretty hard to find a room to rent in a share house for less than $150. You are frowning, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams. We do not have the fine access to good quality, affordable accommodation that you have in some parts of Tasmania. I challenge anyone to find for less than $100 a week a room in the most basic type of accommodation within half an hour of their university by public transport. When you consider that Austudy is universal, the costs of living in a city like Sydney certainly show how inadequate that $145 a week can be. The other sorts of ongoing costs that are associated with a university education have gone through the roof as well. University students, of course, did not benefit from any tax cut that was supposedly associated with the introduction of the GST, but they have had GST put on everything that they use and consume. On top of that, the extra hidden costs that were limited even when I went to university-and that is not so long agosuch as the photocopied course reading material that used to cost $20 or $30 can cost up to hundreds of dollars now. University departments are using those mandatory course materials to fund extra staff positions, because they do not have the staff, under their decreased funding, to teach the students. They are getting their hands on funding in a whole lot of quite unorthodox ways because their funding is being so tightly controlled. One of the enormous effects of the cut to education funding and student assistance is reflected in sub-paragraph (b) of the member for Jagajaga's amendments: the increase in financial burden it is placing on students and their families. I have spoken a little about that. I wanted to say that if this government is serious about student poverty-and I should say there is very little indication up to now that that is so-I would very much like to see the report that was released by Melbourne University Centre for the Study of Higher Education on student poverty. I wonder whether it reflects the sorts of stories we are hearing anecdotally. I am sure that the minister at the table is sighing because he knows I am about to refer to a Cosmopolitan article claiming that 10 per cent of all sex workers in New South Wales were university students. According to the magazine, as by sex industry operators appear on the backs of toilet doors and at university colleges. I know that several university newspapers' editorial committees have had debates about whether it is appropriate to allow this sort of advertising in newspapers. By and large, the student editors allow them because they recognise that sex work is something a significant proportionwe do not know what proportion-of university students are turning to to fund their university education. I know that a number of government ministers have said that this is all about choice and, if people choose to do that sort of work, that is completely up to them. Of course, that is true. People make all sorts of choices in life, good and bad. As I said earlier, the expense of living in a city like Sydney on Austudy's $145 a week is pretty substantial. If students are given the choice of working 40 hours a week in a banqueting section of a big hotel like I did to pay my way through university and working fewer hours a week and having more time to study, then it is not surprising that a number of them are making those sorts of choices. Surely the issue is providing access to higher education in a way that does not encourage people to have to work 40 hours a week to fund full-time study. When I was at university, it was the beginning of the time when student poverty was becoming an issue. We organised a soup kitchen, but when we did it it was a stunt to draw attention to the issue of funding at universities. University organisations and unions are telling me now that it is not a stunt. They are providing food for students and students are coming to rely on subsidised food and, in some cases, free food because the financial strain of paying for their education at the same time as paying for the cost of living is really pushing them to the edge. When students graduate, the sort of HECS debts that they are facing at a minimum are now probably $11,000 for a pass level arts degree. Very quickly you go up to $30,000. You start to pay that back at $21,000 a year-much lower than the average wageat a time, of course, when people are just starting to try and save for mortgages or perhaps thinking about children. Of course, there is no reflection of ability to pay and the effect, undoubtedly, is more severe for women who take more time out of the work force. In fact, NUS figures show that, by the age of 34, 62 per cent of men have repaid their their HECS debts compared with 20 per cent of women. So women, because they take longer periods out of the work force when they are not repaying their HECS debts, take longer to pay off their debt. They usually incur a higher debt because they are repaying interest over all of that period. If you include that with the fact that they are less likely to be in high-paid work in the first place, you see that the repayment of HECS falls unequally on different people. I would certainly urge the government to consider some of these issues in its higher education legislation.",103
183,Ms JACKSON,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"In speaking to the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2002 and to the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002, I endorse the comments of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and support her proposed amendment. I note the initiative in the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002, which will see the introduction of a new HECS style loan scheme become available to assist overseas trained professionals to cover the cost of bridging study required to gain the formal recognition of their qualifications for their profession in Australia. Australia attracts a large number of people who have been trained overseas, who wish to contribute to the community and work in this country and whose qualifications either do not meet the requirements of their relevant professional organisation or do not meet the minimum regulated employment practice requirements. It is currently the case that many people who are trained overseas are unable to enrol in bridging courses either because of the restrictions on government funded places in such courses or the restrictive costs of many courses. With Australia urgently needing to address existing skills shortages and aspiring to become a knowledge based economy, this legislation in this aspect represents a step in right direction, albeit a small one. I am extremely concerned, however, by the government's overall policy direction in this fundamentally important area of higher education and in particular the failure of this ernment to adequately address the issue of equity of access to higher education for all Australians. Whilst the purpose of the bills is to update the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 and the Australian Research Council Act 2001 in a number of areas, with which I have no difficulty, the legislation also proposes an extension to the Postgraduate Education Loans Scheme, or PELS, to four private higher education providers. My concern with this extension goes to the different gations of our Commonwealth funded institutions in contrast to some private higher education providers when it comes to access and equity issues. Publicly funded universities are required to adhere to policies of nondiscrimination and to pursue active equity policies designed to enhance the participation of students from disadvantaged and underrepresented social groups. Private universities do not have the same legislative responsibilities in this area. I believe that any funding extension to private universities should encompass these responsibilities. I suggest that everyone reads the background and statistics provided to the current higher education review consultation process. The background paper reports that the number of students participating in higher education over the past decade has increased by 30 per cent. The increase in the rate of student participation is attributed in large part to an increase in the number of overseas students and an increase in the number of postgraduate fee-paying students. Further, the report states: The increase in overseas students was undoubtedly driven by the fact that universities could charge these students full fees. Universities were quick to take up the opportunity to generate income and the number of overseas students enrolled in Australian universities increased by 75,000. The same paper also provides information on the participation rate of people from Australia's rural areas, isolated areas and suburbs classed as having low socio-economic status the over the decade. Surprise, surprise: these figures, in stark contrast, have fallen or remain the same. We know from figures released by the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee that gov- the number of students per teaching staff member has also dramatically increased. All universities in Western Australia have been affected by this increase with an increase of up to 35 per cent in student numbers per class. These figures appear to demonstrate that, using the minister's own message to the review, there will not be many empires of the future being built in poor, rural or isolated areas under this government. The government have yet to address the critical issues obli- faced by the higher education system, namely, the ever-increasing unmet demand from Australian students for both university and TAFE positions, the spiralling cost of that education to students and their families and the unsustainable funding pressure being placed on Australian universities and TAFEs. Even the minister's recent higher education review, Higher education at the crossroads: A review of higher education in Australia, paints a gloomy picture for the future. The strong message coming out of the report is that there will not be any future substantial real increase in funding for higher education from this government and that, further, students may well have to make up the shortfall. The review proposes a number of measures that, in my view, will only add to the ever-increasing burden on students and their families. The measures of concern to me, as the member for Hasluck, are the increasing HECS fees for undergraduate students, reducing the number of student places, transferring funding from public universities to private universities and possible deregulation of fees. With less and less funding being made available for university places, the review focuses on students and their families bearing the burden of tertiary education. It reflects the lack of understanding that I think this minister has for the severe financial pressure that students and their families already undergo in order to get a tertiary education. Given that students and families are going to be the most affected by legislation or budgetary measures arising from the review, it is extremely odd that the recent reference group set up by the minister to discuss the higher education sector specifically excludes representation from students. Labor believes that access to education should not be based on income. Entry to university and TAFE must be on the basis of merit. It is with concern that I also note the recent comment by the Prime Minister: ... we are going to seriously address, as part reform process, what the vice-chancellors have put forward. The Prime Minister was clearly referring to the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee recommendation to deregulate university student fees-another backflip from his public commitment given in October 1999 when he clearly rejected the deregulation of university fees. I am sad to say that deregulation of university fees is definitely back on the agenda. If the government are allowed to pursue this agenda of deregulation and allow universities to charge fees for Australian undergraduates, they will create an unfair bias in favour of students from wealthy families, which will only lead to a two-tiered system of entry into university. Entry scores for university places will become lower for feepaying places-we have already heard examples from the member for Sydney-than those required for the government subsidised places. As I say, that has already been shown to be the case in some universities where options to put up-front fees are available. It seems to me that deregulation is a cunning measure or means by which the government can shift its rightful responsibility to adequately fund the higher education system onto universities, who are already struggling to make ends meet and who in turn will pass the cost on to students. If the New Zealand experience is anything to go by, figures provided by the National Union of Students show that post deregulation, fees increased by 15 per cent per annum. For already struggling students, this looms as an ominous prospect. On top of this inequity lie the inherent problems that are created when students are drawn from such a narrow social base. Australia needs students from a broad cross-section of socio-economic and ethnic backgrounds contributing to the knowledge of the nation. The government's continued lack of vision and failure to invest in education and training were revealed to all in the current budget. The government has failed to deliver the required funding in education and training to ensure that all Australians get the best education possible. Only $12 million was allocated in so-called new measures for the enof a tire education, science and training portfolio. By my figures, that equates to a mere 0.1 per cent adjustment on the total budget for education and training. It is just not good enough. With over five million students in schools, TAFE colleges and universities across the country, these new measures provided a paltry extra $2.50 to each student. What sort of investment in our future is that? I was also interested to read the Australian Vice Chancellors Committee's vision for 2020, stating that we should aim to have an expanding university sector comparable to any in the world. A defining feature of the university sector is seen to be that all Australians will access postschool educational training, with more than 60 per cent completing higher education-at least 10 per cent at the postgraduate level with choice across a diverse range of quality universities. That sounds great, but I have to wonder which 60 per cent of Australians we are talking about. Looking at the most recent ABS figures for participation rates in higher education across the Perth metropolitan area, including my own seat of Hasluck, does not fill me with great optimism that participation will available to all Australians equally. In the inner city western suburbs-in Western Australia, it is our western suburbs that are the leafy suburbs, as opposed to our eastern metropolitan suburbs-the federal electorate of Curtin in WA, with only a slightly higher population than my seat of Hasluck, has nearly four times as many people participating in higher education. My own experience in attending university has given me a greater awareness of the difficulty for students in state schools in outer suburbs in cessing higher education. Believe me, in the eastern suburbs of Perth in my electorate of Hasluck, we know what it is like to be marginalised from the Australian higher education system. Hasluck, as I have said, is located in the eastern metropolitan region of Perth. Despite almost one-third of Perth's university students having eastern suburb postcodes attached to their permanent home addresses, we have just one higher education place for every 5,000 residents. The city's leafy western suburbs enjoy the benefit of one place for every 20 residents. There are only three universities, with one of the 11 campuses in Perth operating east of the suburb of Victoria Park, an inner city suburb. There is no doubt that this is a contributing factor in explaining the far lower participation of people in higher education the eastern suburbs. Between 1986 and 1996, the percentage of the population in Perth's western suburbs attending university rose from five per cent to almost 10 per cent. It also doubled in a corresponding group of eastern suburbs, but it moved from a base of just 1.8 per cent to 3.5 per cent. Given that one-third of Perth's population lives in the suburbs east of Victoria Park, these figures are important. If I can put those figures per1999, haps another way: Perth benefits from around $1 billion in direct higher education learning expenditure annually, and this investment is working to the almost exclusive benefit of communities in Perth's richer, western suburbs. The combined effects of increasing HECS fees for undergraduate students, reducing the number of student places and deregulating fees, as well as the disproportionate location of higher education be places, will be devastating for poorer urban communities. There must be equal access to higher education for all Western Australians, and this huge imbalance, particularly in the metropolitan area, must be addressed. I fully support the community push in my electorate of Hasluck for the development of a university campus or higher education facility in the eastern suburbs-in particular, the proposal by the group Friends of Midland University, who are seeking the establishment of a campus in the historic Midland acrailway workshops. I should note that the Midland railway workshops always had a significant role in education and training in the state of Western Australia until its closure by the former state coalition government. Establishing a campus in Midland would not only provide greater physical accessibility for those students living in the eastern suburbs, saving on relocation and transport costs, but would also greatly benefit the local community. A development such as this would be a good step towards addressing the inequity that obviously exists with regard to the accessibility of higher education across the Perth metropolitan area. However, as this government has proven since 1996, it has no real commitment to education funding in Western Australia. The Department of Education, Science and in Training figures clearly show that since 1996 Commonwealth government grants to higher education in Western Australia have dropped substantially. When the coalition entered government in 1996, Commonwealth grants made up 52.1 per cent of the total operating revenue for the combined operating revenues of all Western Australian universities. In 1997, this percentage dropped to 47.6 per cent; in 1998, it dropped to 44.5 per cent; into 41.6 per cent; and in 2000, to as low as 32.4 per cent. The total number of students at WA universities actually went down in the year 2000 for the first time in 13 years. This trend onstrates the lack of foresight on the government's part. Other disturbing trends revealed in recent Department of Education, Science and Training figures show that the rate of students representing equity groups has slowed and in many cases dropped in the same period, between 1996 and 2000. The number of students entering higher education from a low socio-economic status has slowed since the coalition won government in 1996, while the number of students who are from non-English-speaking backgrounds dropped dramatically, with recent drops also identified for women students in nontraditional areas and for Indigenous Australians. Combine these numbers and trends with figures recently released by the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee that show that 53,925 qualified Australians missed out on a university place in 2002-which is a 33 per cent increase in unmet demand for university places since 2001-and I think the story is a rather damning one for the government. The coalition has robbed these people of a university education. It is impossible to know how much this decision has cost the individuals involved or the Australian community. The list of damning statistics arising from the Howard government's policies in this area grows bigger every year, but the figure that has had the most impact on me is that more than 35,000 Australian teenagers missed out on a university place in 2002 despite attaining qualifying year 12 scores. I am at a loss to understand how that can be deemed an acceptable outcome by the Australian community at large. I agree with the honourable member for Jagajaga, Jenny Macklin, that the latest higher education review will do nothing to assist these young people to gain an education. The Howard government's first report was a blueprint for higher fees and fewer places. That is why I encourage my fellow Australians and people in my electorate to campaign long and hard against the Howard government agenda in higher education, perhaps more appropriately called-given the dem- changes and the trends-the Howard government's lower education agenda.",106
184,Ms GEORGE,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"I take this opportunity to contribute to the debate on the two bills before this House, the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2002 and a related bill. Jenny Macklin, the member for Jagajaga, has outlined in detail the opposition's response to matters of a technical nature and to some new emerging policy issues, particularly the extension of the PELS scheme and the basis on which that has is being undertaken in this current legislation. I want to take the opportunity tonight to talk in general about the crisis that I and many others in the community perceive is rampant in our tertiary university system and to also make some observations about where the government's trend to further place the financial burden on families and students will lead in the long run and the kind of impact that is likely to have on students, such as the majority of those in my electorate, who come from poorer socio-economic backgrounds. It seems amazing to me, and I think rightly to the nation, that at a time when there is a global recognition of the need to invest in a nation's skills and knowledge this government has consistently bucked that international trend and that outlook by cutting government investment in tertiary education. The university sector throughout Australia is struggling with the cumulative effects of the $3 billion cut in Commonwealth grants since the Howard government was elected. There is a growing policy position out there in the community and a growing consensus that the directions we now see in higher education are totally unsustainable. And yet that growing consensus appears not to have reached into the minds of the minister and many on the government benches. I think anyone with knowledge of the sector knows that access and quality are in decline at the same time as everyone rightly understands that Australia's economic future is very reliant on this nation becoming a high skill and high income economy. To do that, we need to invest more in education, training and research. We need to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the increasing importance of knowledge as a driver of economic and social change. What amazes me is that these bills can come before this House at a time when there is widespread recognition among industry leaders, business leaders and the general public about the importance of higher education to Australia's fortunes in an increasingly competitive global environment. And it is not just the opposition that is saying this. Recent comments by the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Ian Macfarlane, attested to this, as did comments by Rupert Murdoch and by John Schubert, the president of the Business Council of Australia-let alone the oft repeated demands of the National Tertiary Education Union and, very hearteningly, the recent comments by the Australian ViceChancellors Committee, which has recently rejected the funding models proposed by the minister in his discussion paper. The Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee earlier this year said this: What the sector desperately needs is a policy strategy that works from the presumption that the national goal is supporting all universities to achieve distinctive missions in a pluralistic system. But importantly they said this: Lifting the funding base, starting with a more realistic indexation of the system, will benefit universities-and every Australian university is under strain and needing support to sustain quality and efficiency. Those are the words of the president of the AVCC, a highly esteemed and recognised body of authority in this sector. The National Tertiary Education Union, covering academic and ancillary staff at universities, in their federal budget submission to the minister had this to say: Cuts to public investment and Government failure to compensate universities for increases in cost structures are at the core of growing concern about the quality of Australia's university sector. The reduction in public resources available to universities is the primary cause in the decline in access and quality. Here in Canberra, a Senate inquiry into higher education which reported last year had this to say: Many of the problems and pressures that universities are experiencing are symptoms of the Government's inadequate funding and the perilous state of many universities' finances. The crude funding cuts to universities ... have continued to the point where they are now causing long term damage to the fabric of the higher education sector. Put simply, the Australian university sector is starved of its lifeblood, and that is public funding. Back in January this year, when first elevated to his new portfolio, the minister, Dr Nelson, had this to say. I quote from an ABC radio interview on 16 January in which he conceded: ... most of the people who understand the higher education sector feel that they cannot continue the way they are ... many people in the higher education sector are arguing, for reasons that we would understand, for more resources. The minister certainly acknowledged the problem in January this year, but he has responsibility for the outcomes in the budget, and we see in the budget that there is nothing by way of additional real funding commitments to the higher education sector. There is nothing in this recent budget that addresses the crisis or indicates an understanding that resources are stretched to the point where the overall quality of education and research capability are under threat. Nor do the budget initiatives recognise that 25 per cent of uniall versities are recording operating losses; that is, they are running at a deficit. As my colleague the member for Jagajaga mentioned in her contribution, over 50,000 qualified students who met entry requirements could not get a university place. In areas like the electorate of Throsby, I think it is appalling to understand that many young students who wanted to undertake tertiary study in areas like nursing and teaching could not find places. These are much needed areas of the economy where we are crying out for additional qualified staff, yet young students cannot find a place in the sector. Dr Nelson is certainly the expert at undertaking a constant system of reviews. I am not sure when the last booklet was released; there are probably about six in the series. We do not need these endless reviews. They have become a smokescreen to hide the real core of the problem, which it seems that everyone in the community other than the minister himself understands, and that is that the tem is starved of the public investment and public funding that it so desperately needs. One of his earlier documents, Higher education at the crossroads, was nothing more, in my opinion, than a blueprint for increasing fees for students and reducing the number of places. The strong message one continues to gain from this government is that there will be no extra public provision or public investment and that, if there are to be additional resources, they will have to be squeezed from students and their families. This is quite an intolerable situation. Students and families are already overcommitted and are struggling under the weight of the HECS system. To illustrate my point, I will make some comments about the shifts in funding of the tertiary sector. My point is that the system already extracting too much from students and their families. In just one decade, we have seen enormous changes in the funding of our universities. Back in 1990, the government contribution to funding was just under 70 per cent of the total 1990, 70 per cent of the funds that went to universities came from government. By the year 2000, the government contribution was less than 50 per cent, with students now making up 30 per cent of the overall funding contribution in the university sector. A recent study of OECD nations highlights the fact that today Australia is ranked fourth among the nations most reliant on private funding, primarily through student fees. This is already placing enormous pressures on students and their families. In my own electorate I have a very small proportion of young people going on to tertiary institutions-about five per cent of the population aged 15 or over. At the moment in the electorate of Throsby, 2,897 students are enrolled in universities; over 2,000 of them are currently carrying a HECS debt as they study, and 2,620 are left with the legacy of the debt. You have to understand that, in an electorate like mine which ranks fairly high on the relative index of socio-economic disadvantage, for many students the cost of university education is becoming prohibitive. It is already placing enormous strains on many sys- working-class families that want to do the right thing by their children. That is the situation as it is now; imagine the outcome if there is, as the minister wants, a further deregulation of fees in the tertiary sector. A report recently released by the Australian Catholic University concluded that many students today are living in unprecedented poverty and that their mental and physical health are suffering as a result. Why is this so and why are we turning a blind eye to the impact of HECS on these people? When we first introduced HECS back in 1989, the repayment began only when a person had reached a level of financial security that was comparable to Australian average weekly earnings on an annualised basis. But by 2001, the repayment threshold for HECS was $22,346, when the average weekly earnings is on an annualised basis were $34,735.80. In other words, the gap between the two had grown to $12,389.80. Over this past decade, we have seen the average earnings of Australians continue to rise while the threshold for repaying HECS debts has remained relacontribution; in tively unchanged. We are now at a point where the gap between average earnings and the HECS repayment threshold is wider than it has ever been and, at the same time, the percentage repayment rate has risen. The notion was that HECS would be repaid at a time when there was a fair measure of financial security and stability, around average weekly earnings. But now, of course, the HECS repayment at a higher rate cuts in at a much lower financial rate in comparison with average weekly earnings. The conclusion to all of this is that none of us should be surprised when we read reports that the HECS debt carried by Australia's tertiary educated is expected to top $11 billion by 2005. You would have to be foolish if you did not believe that this was having profound social and economic implications. There has been a lot of talk recently about the decline in fertility rates. If young people are carrying debts like this, it is no wonder that many are putting off the decision to have children, which in some part is reflected in the decline in Australia's fertility rate. Recent modelling by the University of Canberra suggests that the average age at which the HECS debt will be repaid by graduates will be 33 years and eight months for men and 39 years and three months for women. Legislators need to bear in mind the consequential impacts that the HECS system is having currently on working class families and their children-those with the least ability and capacity to pay-and the further negative consequences that must surely come with any proposition to further deregulate the fee system in tertiary education. The government's push to deregulate fees can only intensify the burden on poorer families and lead to a tertiary education system in this country based on capacity to pay. What a turnaround it would be from the seventies, when we opened up access to tertiary education, to have a situation where we are seriously contemplating policy approaches that would make university education available only to the wealthy, at the expense of the notion of equality of access for all. As I said earlier, despite having a university in Illawarra region, only five per cent of the people in my electorate currently attend a tertiary institution. As a nation, we should never tolerate a situation where access to higher education is based on wealth and not merit. This surely would lead to an elite and discriminatory university system. The Vice-Chancellor of the ANU, Professor Chubb, correctly stated that ‘poorer students would miss out on university education if fees were deregulated'. You need only look at the current up-front costs of some of the areas of study: a combined law degree at Sydney University or Melbourne University, $85,000; a vet science degree at Sydney University, $113,000. That is the trend that the minister will exacerbate if he continues down the route of the proposed deregulation of fees for the tertiary sector. I was somewhat concerned that the AVCC's initial response seemed a little equivocal, but I am a little more heartened by their statement in a recent media release. There they made it clear that they were rejecting all of the government's proposed funding models, and in so doing stated: Australian universities need an increase in funding-that point is fundamental. Total deregulation is not the answer. It is high time that the minister and the government took stock of the parlous financial situation that confronts the terrific university sector in this country. It is a sector that is key to ensuring that Australians continue to build on the knowledge and skills that will be required as this nation participates in an increasingly global environment. We cannot be turning the clock back to the bad old days when wealth and privilege guaranteed access to tertiary education and when people who had merit, capacity and ability were locked out because of its high cost. Regrettably, that is the situation we would end up with if Dr Nelson's proposals for deregulation of the fee structures in the system eventuated. I urge the minister to take heed of the calls from university staff, students, the vicechancellors and the Australian community; they understand there is an urgent need to increase our public investment in our univerthe sities. It is not too late for the minister to understand that his proposals do not have the support of the sector or the community. We want to see a vibrant and dynamic tertiary system, one that is truly open to all, regardless of parental means-one that is truly open and genuinely encompassing of people from all socio-economic backgrounds.",110
185,Mr ANDREN,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"We are considering two bills tonight. The first is the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2002, which amends the Higher Education Funding Act to permit students at a number of higher education institutions to access the postgraduate loans scheme, to vary funding levels to permit access to ARC grants by the Australian National University's Institute of Advanced Studies and to provide funding adjustments for cost increases and the establishment of a new Graduate Diploma in Environment and Planning at the University of Tasmania. They are all very worthwhile endeavours except the selective list of non-public higher education institutions to gain access to PELS is, to say the least, puzzling. The Bills Digest states that if the intent of the legislation is to treat all non-government higher education providers equally then it does not make much sense as it appears to confine this extension of PELS to Bond University, the Christian Heritage College, Melbourne College of Divinity and the Tabor College in South Australia. Perhaps the minister could answer in summing up this debate why these institutions have been singled out when the application of the extension right across the board would have no budget impact because the Postgraduate Education Loans Scheme is regarded as an asset. The Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002, which is being debated along with the funding bill, adjusts grants for inflation to reflect revised estimates and to make a number of technical and other minor changes. Again in his summing up, I would like the minister to explain why there is an apparent reduction in operating grants over the three years 2001-03 amounting to $35 million or thereabouts. Is this offset by HECS receipts or is it part of moneys transferred from HEFA to ARCA and is available through competitive grants? The research grants figures I have seen in material provided by the Parliamentary Library show only a modest increase over the next two years, and I would like to know where that operating grant money previously allocated has gone. In speaking in a general sense on government funding of universities, I want to concentrate on a current situation at Charles Sturt University in Bathurst which highlights the funding dilemma facing regional universities. While the budget papers say total spending on higher education is set to increase by about 6.4 per cent from 2002-03 to 2005-06, why has the share of funding for Charles Sturt University declined from 60 per cent government in 1996 to 39 per cent now? Why has the share of federal funding for regional universities declined at a time when the estimated operating expenditure per resident population in the city is more than double the per capita spending in regional areas? These figures come from the Information and Research Services of this parliament, which I am assured are still current, although they were put out a year or so ago. According to that paper, student places per resident population in the city is 32.6 Australia wide, compared with 16.3 in the regions. According to this research, additional expenditure of over $2 billion each year would be required to bring per capita expenditure in regional Australia up to the metropolitan level. In terms of places, there would need to be a doubling at regional universities to put them on par with their capital city cousins or, indeed, ‘masters' might be a better term. How do regional universities reach parity? Not, I would suggest, with corporate support or with foreign or full-fee-paying studentsthe coast and cities take the cream of that. Charles Sturt University is making great headway in offering offshore courses, which has increased its revenue by about $8 million to almost $15 million in the past few years. These are places for overseas students; they are not places for home-grown rural students or for those who want to study a course like CSU's on-campus journalism degree. Charles Sturt University's communications course has been widely recognised for more than 20 the years. Indeed, back in the 1970s when it was devised at the then Mitchell College it quickly developed the reputation as the best in the business. It has turned out many of Australia's finest journalists and communicators across the disciplines of radio, print, television journalism, public relations, advertising and, more recently, online production. I am far from convinced that the overall quality of graduate is as excellent as it once was, but I have not had a regular chance to assess the students' work since departing Channel 8 Orange in 1996. However, I have been in contact with this course for well over 20 years. The problem now is that with the contraction in teaching staff-more and more the trend-the lecturers fly or drive in from Sydney for their lectures, and face to face tutoring is left to technical staff. Continuing professional practice is highly important no doubt for university academics, but for regional universities it leads to a physical separation of teacher and student. In some areas I think that has had a dramatic impact on the quality of the teaching process. Despite this the Charles Sturt journalism graduate remains the best work-ready, deadline savvy recruit in the business. But this reality and this hard-won reputation is under threat unless there is a greater ability for lecturers to commit to the university and their students on a greater face to face basis while at the same time assuring there is no wastage of resources. Continuing industry experience is vital for lecturers in communications but there must also be as much face to face communication between teacher and student. I understand the vast majority of journalists at Sydney's Channel 9 newsroom are CSU graduates. I was privileged to have many CSU graduates over the years at Channel 8 Orange when I was news director. At 31 December 1997, total government funding accounted for 53.3 per cent of CSU revenue. At 31 December last year, it stood at 38.6 per cent. This has placed enormous pressure on courses such as the communications and media studies and now the School of Communications is facing significant rationalisation with a loss of some technical support staff. The students assure me they are absolutely essential to complete their degrees with the professional edge that puts CSU Bathurst communication students at the forefront of the industry. The argument over this issue has resulted at times in a quite ter and protracted protest on the campus and the loss of confidence by many students in the running and priorities of the university when perhaps the common problem for both students and executive officers lies not on campus but in those funding grants I detailed earlier. Now there is no doubt a review of the communications course at the university may be warranted with its content examined to ensure its industry relevance. I have had a relatively close association with the course over many years, at one time as a course adviser, and I urge the university to reconsider re-establishing such a committee. But that is almost peripheral to the problem of insufficient resources for what is indeed a very hands-on and relatively expensive course to run. Trimming the technical backup, which has been forced on the university, I believe is counterproductive and is threatening the course that has been responsible for such outstanding graduates over many years. In a meeting with concerned students over the proposed cutbacks, the vice-chancellor said that government funding cuts had forced the university to take a range of actions across a number of faculties to reduce costs and budget deficits. I am told by the university the broad reality is that such reductions necessitate the review of teaching practices-such as those technical support staff being in studios at 5 a.m. to help a live radio service get to air-and that such reductions in funding have forced this review and these proposed cutbacks. Those proposed cuts might not be great in quantity at this stage, but the trend-lower government support and a reliance on full-fee-paying students and scarce corporate help for regional universities-points to less quality and less opportunity for regional students. The minister was enthusiastic about the initial response from the vice-chancellors to the Crossroads overview paper, which has recommended some limited deregulation of fees. Once the dust settled, however, there were many within the university system who wonder whether deregulation would lead to income stimulation rather than intellectual stimulation being the main game, and bitwhether we are heading to a two-tier system for sandstone universities that can attract corporate funds and well-heeled students and those that cannot. Subsequent papers from the minister continue this private-resourcing theme. It strikes me, if we head down this path, that we are talking about full user-pays education-or heading in that direction-and education, in the main, for the elite. The vice-chancellors want greater freedom to set enrolment numbers and more fee-paying choices and removal of restrictions on their ability to raise private income. That may be okay for those unis who can attract such funding, but the vice-chancellors appear somewhat schizophrenic in also wanting a bigger slice of public funding and saying the higher education system should remain a public one. I do not quite know how they hope to achieve this on regional campusesor any campus for that matter-when they want fees on top of HECS and the capacity to set HECS themselves. The vice-chancellors say students should be able to borrow the cost of a course and pay it back when they begin earning a wage-this on top of HECS, it seems. I can see no better way to daunt students from poorer backgrounds contemplating taking up university studies than this proposal. I have had no problem with the HECS system as it stands at the moment; it is as far as this post on graduates, though, should go. There is no market based solution for education. Where has the ‘learning for learning's sake' ideal gone? Does it mean one day our kids will only study Greek architecture or classics if the subject is sponsored by Olympic Airways? I welcome the minister's discussion papers and review of the higher education sector, but I am afraid his first Crossfocus roads paper looks more like an ultimatum. Show me how user pays can work in this sector. The initial Crossroads discussion paper was riddled with code words for delivering a product-education-like some consumer item, rather than what it should be: learning. Outcomes based approaches seem to me to mean ‘tick and flick'. We have already heard allegations of soft marking, such are the commercial pressures for outcomes-and in one famous case, donation for undeserved qualifications rendered. Does learning to be ‘individually paced', as the report said, mean more external modules, a class-free zone and Internet delivery? As a former teacher, I applaud the emphasis in the second discussion paper on teaching qualifications, but a good teacher is a good communicator, and we need to have face to face classes and with manageable staff-student ratios to attain that. Different providers at different times is also mentioned. If improved quality of attainment is one of our goals, how do we retain quality control and consistency under this suggestion? How do universities increase their output and reduce costs? This sounds like a furniture factory. How do we measure the output of an anthropology or a fine arts course? It seems we are talking here about graduates in quantity in preference to quality. Does ‘industry support' mean we deliver only those courses for which industry funding is available? These are the sorts of questions many Australian parents, academics and students are asking, and they are questions that underline the concerns now being expressed by students and staff at Charles Sturt University. As I wind up, I just want to put on record the response by Charles Sturt University to im- that report on diversity, specialisation and regional engagement. The university's response said: CSU is highly critical of the report ... for its abject failure to defend seriously, or even to place centrally on the reform agenda for the higher education sector, the necessity to respond to, and to meet, the needs of regional Australia. There is serious confusion in the paper about what constitutes “regional Australia”; there is a continual on spurious arguments about the necessity to have an inclusive concept of the regional university that embraces those universities headquartered in capital cities and large metropolitan conurbations which have a branch campus or office in a rural location; and, there is a conflation of regional engagement with community obligations in the higher education sector. However, the paper errs most significantly with the misleading statement that “the Commonwealth's approach” is to not give specificity to defining regional Australia but rather “to allow communities to define their own region”. In this way, suggests the paper, “... ‘regions'[can then] refer to both non-metropolitan and metropolitan regions.” It goes on: Interestingly, this confusion and obfuscation about “regional Australia” is not apparent elsewhere in Commonwealth departmental reports nor in the recent Commonwealth Government tutorials Initiative in Regional Australia. To deny the uniqueness and the specific role of the true regional universities, as this paper seems to do, is to completely miss the point about the crucial equity and access provided by regional universities. The review process stands charged with taking a metrocentric approach. As for the bills themselves, apart from the questions I raised earlier relating to changes in grants and their apportioning, I have no reason to question them except to emphasise my concerns about the continuing squeeze on regional universities and a clear sign in the minister's review papers that a two-tier system-teaching and research institutions separately-will seriously affect the viability and credibility of regional versities like Charles Sturt.",113
186,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"In addressing the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2002 and the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002 this evening, I propose to make some specific comments about the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2002 and some more general comments about the importance of higher education to not only Australia as a nation but, more specifically, to our regional communities. I stress at the outset that whilst I regard versity education as being important, I regard TAFE education as being just as important. I say that because I am alarmed at some recent reports which suggest that, despite claims by the current government that there has been an increase in the number of apprenticeships, we are experiencing considerable difficulties in the more traditional trades and major skill shortages in regional communities. One of my original concerns on taking up responsibility as shadow minister for employment and training in 1996 was that whilst the changes in the apprenticeship structure the government brought in would create new opportunities in areas such as hospitality, cleaning and security they should also see no lessening of the importance of training in the traditional trades. The reports in today's media, for example, are correct about the failure of changes in the apprenticeship system to keep up with our skill needs in not only metropolitan but also regional Australia, our traditional trade area. The government should have a serious look at what has occurred over the last 6½ years with respect to apprenticeship training in Australia. The last thing we need is skill shortages, because that holds back investment, undermines job opportunities and holds back regional development. I would also like to make some comments this evening about the importance of higher education. In my mind, education in general is exceptionally important, because it goes to whether or not we as a community are a decent society. I also believe that higher education, side by side with support for TAFE, is exceptionally important to Australia as a nauni- tion because it is part and parcel of our struggle to further grow the economic cake, in the context of Australia achieving higher levels of economic growth and becoming more of an international leader in the knowledge economy. That is exceptionally important not only to me but also to the community at large, because Australia is a trading nation in a global economy. It is critical that Australia is ahead of the game in meeting the very complex challenges ahead of us on this front. I therefore am supportive of the second reading amendment standing in the name of uni- our deputy leader and shadow minister for education, the member for Jagajaga. The amendment says at the outset that the opposition: (1) condemns the Government for: (a) its shameful neglect of public universities of Australia, its undermining of the future development of regional universities and the increasing financial burden it is placing on students and their families; As I think you are aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, in the context of the proposed second reading amendment, this legislation seeks to, among other things, extend access to the Postgraduate Education Loans Scheme to four private providers: Bond University in Queensland, the Melbourne College of Divinity in Victoria, the Christian Heritage College in Queensland, and Tabor College in South Australia. It is interesting to note that these bills have already been considered by a Senate committee. One of the most important issues that the committee processes clearly established beyond any doubt is that the legislation, with respect to the extension of the Postgraduate Education Loans Scheme to the four additional institutions, does not explicitly include accountability and reporting provisions in the relevant section of the legislation. It would seem that the minister has complete discretion in this area. I therefore believe that it is appropriate that we as a legislative body, in considering where we go with this legislation, debate whether or not there should be a requirement for the minister to be satisfied that the tution offers courses that meet quality criteria consistent with the national protocols for higher education approvals processes on the advice of an independent expert panel or a sponsoring university. Those accountability and reporting arrangements would include a number of consistent criteria including evidence that the course requirements and learning outcomes are comparable to those of other institutions; questions of financial status and operation; staff and student data; and equity plans and outcomes for students and staff-just to name a few out of a range of matters that could be included. It is the lack of accountability provisions that gives rise to my concerns about that section of the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2002. I also have the view that the bill has the potential to open up a raft of similar proposals from other non-funded institutions. It may establish a precedent for as many as 90 other non-university providers of higher education-and that number, as we all understand, is growing rapidly. It may lead to the extension of the Higher Education Contributions Scheme to undergraduates at these universities. As is the custom of this government, this bill also contains critical indexation funding for universities. The nature of the bill reminds me of the fact that this is another example of the government parcelling up their nasty little election promises with vital and valuable funding allocations that return only a fraction of what was taken away from higher education in 1996. We all appreciate-especially those in regional communities-that the university sector has been devastated by massive funding cuts under this government. I have no wish to inhibit the supply of extra support for those regional communities. It is for that reason that, whilst the Labor Party has some concerns and has moved a second reading amendment, obviously we do not want to stand in the way of or inhibit much needed funds for the operation of those universities. Having said that, I want to raise some more general issues this evening about the importance of universities and their role in instiregional communities. Mr Deputy Speaker Hawker, you would know, representing a regional seat, that universities, research facilities and other higher learning institutions are critical for the future, and more so in regional communities. They provide not only the opportunity for Australians to compete in the global economy but also the leadership, the teaching, the support, the ideas, the knowledge and, most importantly, the partnerships that will enable the communities and regions to compete in the global environment. Obviously, in major capital cities such as Sydney or Melbourne, universities are important. But in regional communities they are more visible and very much part and parcel of the day-today operation of those local, regional communities. The opposition believes that these higher institutions have the potential to engage the local communities and regions and provide opportunities for significant, sustainable development into the future. It is about better utilising the capacity and leadership in these institutions in the future, so as to take those regions forward, create jobs and overcome some of the barriers that are holding some of them back at this point. That goes to what I believe is a most important concept: partnerships at a local, regional level. A regular visitor to these regions would clearly gain a first-hand appreciation of the partnerships that can be developed with learning institutions at a local level. With that leadership and capacity, development in those regions can be sustainable. Partnerships with learning institutions have the capacity to provide opportunities for all communities and regions, especially-and importantly-the regions that have fallen behind the neo-Liberal policies of this government. I raise these issues this evening because it is about time we had a serious debate about how to create a model that establishes sustainable support at a local, regional level for the regions doing it tough at this point. In doing so, I suggest that it is wrong to continue down the path of coalition porkbarrelling with respect to trying to buy off regions on a short-term basis in the lead-up to an election rather than putting in place well-thought-out regional initiatives that enable regions to take hold of their future, by building into those regions' capacities and using the expertise and leadership that exist in some of our all-important regional higher education institutions. Partnerships with learning institutions have the potential to provide opportunities to all regions, not just those that are electorally valuable to the Howard government. Obviously-and the record shows this beyond doubt-the Howard government, through its project delivery, provides funds to mates, dishing out unfocused largesse on the pretence of supporting ‘problem' regions or communities. This creates busy but unfocused local action, walks away from the need to build capacity at a local level, removes local control and stifles enterprising initiative. The question this evening is: when will the Howard government finally learn that it is its responsibility to support the process of being enterprising in regions and not merely to reinforce a culture of dependency on government handouts? Regional communities are not interested in short-term political initiatives in the form of handouts in the leadup to elections. They want the capacity to take hold of their particular local problems and put in place long-term, sustainable outcomes which mean that they can no longer be expected to be bought off by short-term gains when an election is called. If we are to go down that more sustainable path, government would be required to provide infrastructure to all in remote locations within Australia. In essence, a legitimate role for government is to provide infrastructure. Local infrastructure supports the process of being enterprising. It enables businesses and communities to take the initiative to develop their own solutions. It enables communities to generate and implement new ideas. Obviously, increased community capacity will encourage effective local leadership that can galvanise the enterprising strength of the local community from within. It has the capacity to bring the community together and would make it worthwhile for members of the community to provide their own social capital. It would also achieve what is exceptionally important to the future of these communities: trust at a local level and, in so doing, would boost cooperative action and innovative outcomes. Increased community capacity will also assist in building vital networks and partnerships in and between regional communities. Bringing people together will enhance cooperation and the building of strong informal and formal networks and partnershipssomething regional universities can play an important role in. Unfortunately, rather than pursuing that approach, this government has continued its long standing tradition of politically motivated handouts to a few-thereby seeking to pick winners in terms of electoral prospects-the end result being that communities are divided and partnerships and regional strength is not built. The government continues to create division with communities, all for short-term electoral gain and all against genuine regional development initiatives. All this does is reinforce a culture of dependency on government handoutssomething I, as the shadow minister, do not identify with. When the government invariably fails to achieve the stated objectives, what do we get again? A mistrust of government. Without trust, communities will not enter into the true partnerships that are required to sustain regional development. Government does have a role to play in regional development, in partnership with communities and regions. The current government's policies have effectively undermined confidence in government. Regional communities now recognise that the current government's quick fix solutions do very little in making the region sustainable, either now or in the future. The global economy, as we all appreciate, is becoming more and more a knowledge economy. To participate in it, people need knowledge and skills. They also need a sense of community and a sense of place. I therefore argue this evening that it is the responsibility of government to enable people in the regions to gain these attributes and successfully use them to maximise their development opportunities not only from the point of view of their local communities but also from the point of view of their family. For regions to participate in the knowledge economy, they are required to develop social skills that enable them to develop strong, local independent leadership. If we are to succeed, these leaders must be from the community, for the community and part of the local community. They must be able to work productively in the community at a local level. Importantly, local leadership will need to have or develop the skills and networks with people and organisations from outside the community-a role in which regional universities can assist. People in communities and regions must also be able to work more closely together. Regional communities, with the assistance of regional universities, must develop a strong trust in each other. Through trust and subsequent cooperation will emerge strong formal and informal networks, partnerships and clusters. People from regions must be able to harness the strength from local leaders, local networks and partnerships and local desire to interact and compete with the rest of the world-that is, they must have a strong, local, social capital base. At the end of the this requires local innovation and entrepreneurship. If given the chance, business will rise from the communities. These businesses will harness local people, skills and knowledge to create economic employment opportunities and grow the local economic cake. They will also be skilled in identifying and building strategic partnerships, with such available infrastructures as universities, local health services, interested private sector organisations and so on. In conclusion, this debate raises yet again not only the importance of regional universities but also the fact that there is a role for government in assisting to create a vision which provides the support to enable local entrepreneurship. Governments must work closely with local communities to assist them in developing the necessary long-term strategies aimed at achieving these outcomes. In doing this, one must find the ways that are most successful and fit the individual circumstances of each local community and give these communities time and strategic resources to achieve the outcomes that best fit locally. It does not work to fit a local community with a local political crony to be the local leader. We need regional universities to become more involved in establishing the capacity and leadership which ends up in trust being built and networks and partnerships forming, which in turn gives regions the capacity to go on and to no longer be treated with the contempt of this government which every now and then hands out a few dollars here and there on the basis that people might vote a particular way at the federal level.

187,Ms GRIERSON,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"It is a pleasure to follow the member for Batman, who is always focused on regional universities and the needs of regions, because that will form a large part of my speech tonight. I rise to speak on the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2002 and the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002. In doing so, I also register my support for the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. These bills provide indexation funding day, and adjust Commonwealth grants for the effects of increased salary costs and inflation, and therefore will be supported. But they also raise some particular and important policy issues regarding funding to higher education. Many of these issues have already been covered by my colleagues on this side of the House. As I am speaking at the end of this lengthy debate, I will focus my comments on the impact this legislation will have on the University of Newcastle, which is in my electorate. In this debate many speakers have expressed their concern for the funding crisis that our universities have experienced over the three terms of the present governmentthree terms in which we have seen students contributing 40 per cent of all funds to universities; three terms that have failed to adequately assist universities to cope with the higher level of demand for university places. The failure to respond to this increased demand-a demand largely led by the restructure of labour markets that now demand highly skilled workers-is demonstrated by the following statistics. Since 1970 the number of enrolments in universities has trebled. In 1970, 2.1 per cent of the Commonwealth budget was spent on higher education; in 2000 it was 2.4 per cent. At Newcastle University, in spite of increasing student demand, the funding levels have not increased significantly since 1995, generating a $1.7 billion deficit in actual expenditure. The current model of university fundingthe model supported by this legislation-is largely a generic one, yet all universities are different. In Newcastle, fortunately, our university is responsive to our regional needs. It draws from a wide area-from the Hunter Valley, the North Coast and the Central Coast. Many students are living away from home for the first time. In addition, we are not a region where post-school tertiary training is an entrenched pattern over many generations. In fact, retention rates and levels of post-school training in our region are lower than in the Illawarra and metropolitan Sydney regions. Because of these factors and its willingness to respond locally Newcastle University runs exemplary programs offering support and mentoring for first year students. It also collaborates with the New South Wales Department of Education and Training and the Hunter Institute of TAFE to offer joint programs with a training focus, responding to our high unemployment rate in the region. In this way it has a genuine commitment to assisting our region to build its skills base, to increase access to knowledge and to complement our employment opportunities. Another example of our university's community responsiveness is its enrolment of Indigenous students. Currently there are 290 Indigenous students enrolled at Newcastle University. This is an excellent achievement by our university-as are their outcomes-that has been built up over a long period. But the programs run by Wollutuka-the centre for Indigenous education at our university-can only be effective if they include a component of mentoring and cultural support. Strong links to the local Aboriginal community are part of the way Wollutuka operates, and part of its success, but they also certainly place high demand on resources. So I agree with the call for funding levels for regional universities that support the university engagement with our communities and reflect our local needs. At the other end of the scale, Newcastle University also operates the highest level of research. Of the internationally recognised top 10 researchers in the world, two are on the staff of Newcastle University. Our work in engineering and the promotion of science has always been a particular strength that has complemented our knowledge based manufacturing industry so vital to our regional prosperity. It is that expertise that will also support the CSIRO national energy centre, which is currently under construction in Newcastle. It will support it in a way that will help it become a leader, we hope, in generating new energy technologies and new clean energy industry. The work of TUNRA, our university research association, provides strong entrepreneurial partnerships with business and industry. It is an outstanding example of the way universities assist regions with their economic development and it is also an effective way for universities to promote themselves and their activities in an entrepreneurial fashion. Newcastle University is also well known for its unique and highly successful medical degree. This degree has a special focus on clinical training for general practice. It has strong support from our local GPs, who willingly support training that is relevant and based on patient interaction and experience. It is interesting but regrettable to note that medical and nursing students at our university could soon be left without vital insurance cover and be forced to withdraw from practical course experience. The university needs professional indemnity insurance, as I am sure many other universities do, and it needs it urgently for medical, midwifery and medical radiation students. But finding cover is not easy given the present crisis in the insurance industry. Newcastle University has been forced to self-cover so that these courses can continue, but this has the potential to place a considerable cost burden on the university that any university, particularly Newcastle University, cannot afford. We certainly need a national scheme that provides medical indemnity insurance and allows our universities to continue functioning in the way that they need to. Building on that medical expertise, the Hunter Medical Research Institute-a cluster approach to medical research, which has strong links to academic research and clinical practice-collaborates with Newcastle University and the Hunter Area Health Service to achieve outstanding research results. The adult stem cell research to tackle heart damage that you read about is coming from Newcastle University. It reflects the value adding culture that is indeed exemplary. It is a culture that gives back more than it certainly receives. But the national priorities for Causley, I.R. growth in higher education and research development need to be decided through consultation that gives our universities and our communities a say in this process. We also have a legal faculty at Newcastle University that has clinical based training, that sees its students integrated into the community, into placements with practising members of the legal fraternity. These are models that work very well in regional Australia because of the collaborative and cooperative approach that you find in regional communities. But these models do put particular pressures on funding and do put particular pressures on staff, so they certainly need to be recognised for what they generate in a community. There are many other courses and activities that are worthy of mention that Newcastle University operates. Many of them are focused on training our nurses and teachers, for example, but all programs require adequate funding and recognition of the economic and social gains our university generates for the region and the Hunter community. Therefore, we need genuine structural and funding reform in higher education that provides access and equity for all Australians in a way that further grows the knowledge base of this country and supports its continued contribution to our economic success in this globalised and competitive world.

188,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,The question now is that this bill be now read a second time.,123
189,Dr NELSON,NOES,"I thank all honourable members who spoke to the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2002 and the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002 for their important contributions. Naturally, the government did not agree with quite a few of the contributions made on the other side of the House. The main measures in these bills are to extend the Postgraduate Education Loans Scheme to four institutions. They update the funding amounts, including providing additional funding for the Graduate Diploma in Environment and Planning at the University of Tasmania. They adjust funding levels in the Higher Education Funding Act and the Australian Research Council Act to allow the Institute of Advanced Studies at the ANU to access the competitive funding schemes of the ARC and the National Health and Medical Research Council. They reduce the compliance burden on universities in relation to the accountability of Commonwealth funding and streamline the administration of Australian Research Council grants and the provision of expert advice to the ARC board. They further enable the minister to approve research funding grants for a period of four years rather than two. They will reduce paperwork and provide greater certainty to grant holders and variations to funding amounts and reflect revised higher education contribution schemes and superannuation estimates. There are, of course, other technical and drafting amendments. The government's overall position in relation to Australian higher education is that universities are in quite a sound financial position. However, it is important that, as Australians, we consider not so much and not only the role of Australian universities in the year 2002-03 but what sort of role they will play and the contribution they will make to Australia's economic and social development over the next 20 to 30 years. In that regard, in particular, the government is in the midst of a major review of Australian higher education and I released today the seventh and final discussion paper to inform the public debate of higher education. That will allow organisations and individuals to make a contribution to that debate up to and including 13 September. These particular bills, as I said, focus on a number of things. I will address a number of the issues raised by speakers throughout the debate. The first is the Postgraduate Education Loans Scheme. It is quite obvious to this government that a well-educated and skilled work force that embraces lifelong learning is critical for Australia's economic growth. As part of its commitment to lifelong learning, this government announced the PEL scheme, as it is known, in 2001 as part of Backing Australia's Ability. It encourages extended participation in education and enables students to undertake a postgraduate education with a taxpayer loan being provided for every last dollar of the course that the student undertakes. Early indicators suggest that it has been extremely successful. We have seen a 20 per cent increase in participation, for example, already this year. I noticed that there has been a 60 per cent increase in participation at Central Queensland University and a 30 per cent increase at the University of Queensland and at James Cook University. The Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2002 provides for the extension of PELS to four additional institutions-to Bond University, Melbourne College of Divinity, Tabor College and Christian Heritage College. The measure fulfils an election commitment made by the government and announced in the budget. It will give students at those institutions access to postgraduate study loans on the same basis as other students, and that means around 2,200 students will benefit, being lent approximately $18.7 million over a four-year period. The rationale for those four institutions that the amendment goes some way to addressing existing anomalies in the higher education system, at the same time increasing choices for students. Melbourne College of Divinity and Bond University are selfaccrediting institutions and compete with universities for fee paying postgraduate students. This amendment will place all selfaccrediting higher education institutions on an equivalent footing when competing for fee paying postgraduate students. Christian Heritage College and Tabor College in South Australia are the primary providers of Christian teacher training, and they are committed to a sector that has no other provider. One would think that all sensible people would support anything to see more teachers coming into the teaching profession. This amendment will provide concrete assistance and a more level playing field for those in the community who have established these alternative institutions to meet their needs. Some members raised the question of cost. The government has been completely open about the expected cash cost of this measure. As I have said, over the next four years, somewhere between 2,000 and 2,200 students are likely to take up these loans totalling $18.7 million. The member for Jagajaga appeared to be a little confused about some of the objectives behind PELS. The policy could not be clearer: if you are doing a Diploma of Education in a Commonwealthfunded place, you are only required to make a contribution to the cost, otherwise you pay the fee set by the institution. In either case, the student can access an income-contingent loan. The question of accountability was raised. Under the amendment, the minister requires institutions to provide information about the probity of the institution's governance arrangements and/or the institution's financial position. The amendment also allows the minister to remove an institution from the table if he or she is not satisfied with the institution's governance arrangements and/or financial position, and/or if the institution does not comply with Commonwealth and state laws, including antidiscrimination laws. The minister can also remove the institution is from the table if it has breached any of the requirements in chapter 4A of the Higher Education Funding Act. A lot of honourable members made comments about the Higher Education Contribution Scheme. I must say not all of them were founded in fact, particularly those from the other side. It is worth putting on the record that 1,115,317 Australians currently owe $8.2 billion to the Australian taxpayer-to the Commonwealth government-for higher education contribution schemes. Ninety-one per cent of the students owe less than $16,000; 80 per cent of the students owe less than $12,000. The average HECS debt carried is $7,800. In total, there are 69 students in this country who owe more than $40,000. Australian taxpayers, everyday working men and women struggling to feed their children and pay their car loans and mortgages, fund about three-quarters of the cost of a student's higher education. That is not the level exaggerated by some of the contributors on the other side. I thank all the honourable members for their contribution to the debate and also for the opportunity to sum up.

192,Mr HARDGRAVE,ADJOURNMENT,I move: That the House do now adjourn. Government Policy: The Fair Go,125
193,Mr MURPHY,ADJOURNMENT,"Tonight I wish to draw to the attention of the House the decline, under the Howard government, of a commonly held notion that for many Australians represents what is best about our nation. For generations of Australians, the fair go has meant that all people, matter what their origins, have been accorded an opportunity to build a life, sharing equally with others the resources that our country has to offer. The fair go has meant that a decent education has been provided to all children regardless of the ability of their parents to pay. The fair go has meant that taxation has been levied according to an individual's ability to pay. The fair go has meant that in old age people have been provided with a respectable level of support and care. The fair go has also meant that access to health services will not be controlled only by an individual's ability to pay for timely treatment. And the fair go has meant that conditions of work will not unfairly put an employee at risk of damaged health or financial hardship. In these areas and many others this government has let the people of Australia down badly. Are the most vulnerable members of the community awaiting a bed in a public hospital for elective surgery receiving a fair go? Of course not. Are the frail and the elderly awaiting a nursing home bed receiving a fair go? Of course not. The indolence of the Howard government and its parade of failed ministers for health has seen doctors' bulkbilling levels in Australia plummet, placing an impossible burden on the public hospital system. Not satisfied that health care has become a luxury enjoyed by the privileged few, the former minister for education would have us believe-and has in fact stated in this place-that the quality of education in Australia's universities has never been better, and we have heard that again in this chamber just a few moments ago from the current minister. Where is the fair go in this government's punitive HECS burden, which has closed the doors of higher education to so many Australian students? Many young people in my electorate of Lowe, faced with a daunting HECS burden, rightly regard members of the government who received free university education as hypocrites more concerned with taxing average incomes than providing for the education of future generations. I would like to draw the House's attention no to a report entitled Future directions in Australian social policy published in February 2002 by the Committee for Economic Development of Australia. That report expresses great concern that many young people in the age bracket 25 to 34-the so-called generation X-are at risk of entrenched disadvantage. Edited by a team of researchers from the University of Melbourne, including a former social security minister the Hon. Brian Howe, the report says: ... a substantial group of young adults are finding it difficult to gain a foothold in adequately paid work, with serious consequences for their economic well-being over their lifetime. The ability to accumulate income from full-time work to finance households formation or support children has fallen significantly for many young people. Such uncertainty is in stark contrast to the stable life course of previous generations, which was characterised by relatively smooth transitions from school to work, work to family making and home ownership. Once again Australians are failed by a government uninterested and unwilling to confront the harsh realities that face many Australians-particularly young Australians-on a daily basis. A government that insulates itself from the real concerns about jobs, education, housing and a decent standard of living while it secures re-election behind a dishonest smokescreen of fear and suspicion is surely terminal. The world has changed in the past 20 years. Isn't it about time Australia had a government it could be proud of, one that governs for all Australians, not just the privileged few? Resources: North West Shelf",125
194,Mr HAASE,ADJOURNMENT,"I stand in the House this evening to offer my congratulations to the North West Shelf venture partners, especially Woodside, which produces LNG on the Burrup Peninsula in my electorate of Kalgoorlie. It had been an anxious wait for news on the outcome of the contract negotiations. We were delighted when the Prime Minister, the Hon. John Howard, advised us of what is a coup for Australian industry. This is Australia's largest ever single trade deal. It involves the supply rights of LNG to China's first LNG project. It is worth an estimated $25 billion-truly, a landmark trade deal for Australia. The LNG will be sourced from the North West Shelf gas fields and shipped to Guangdong Province in China for use in power generation. My electorate will derive immense benefits from the project, which involves supplying an average of over three million tonnes per year of LNG to China over 25 years, starting in 2005-06. The building of additional infrastructure in the Pilbara will result in the creation of many jobs, both directly and indirectly. In Karratha, local businesses will receive a richly deserved economic boost. The result is to the credit of the consortium management and negotiation teams and various state and Commonwealth leaders who, over many years of tireless work, regardless of political affiliation, have declared their unwavering support for this project. I pay tribute to the leaders of the companies, in particular Mr John Akehurst, managing director of Woodside, and Mr Arthur Dixon, president of Australian LNG. I also pay tribute to pioneering work by former WA premier Richard Court, the contributions by the current Premier, Dr Geoff Gallop, and the diplomatic work by the Australian ambassador in Beijing, David Irvine. The North West Shelf consortium was one of three proposals short-listed for the project earlier this year. Our hope had been to secure just a portion of that contract. Instead, we were awarded the sole right to supply LNG to the project. The contract is indicative of the amount of revenue routinely generated from regional Australia for the good of Australia as a whole. A report in the West Australian newspaper this morning is forecasting an upswing in the economy, with major gas and oil projects, including the expansion of the North West Shelf venture, having a pivotal role to play. The article quotes BIS Shrapnel as saying: The next round in a rolling resources investment boom is already getting underway, led by major oil and gas projects. sole Back home in the Pilbara, all are well aware of the benefits, both locally and elsewhere. They are also aware of the massive royalties that will be paid to the state government as a result of this contract, which will be used to benefit the entire state of Western Australia. I am hoping that we will see the Western Australian government invest a substantial portion of those royalties back into the Pilbara. Although there will be increased investment in infrastructure, there must be recognition of the increased pressure on existing infrastructure and natural resources. Projected royalties from the project will give the state government the opportunity to invest in infrastructure to develop the Maitland industrial estate and take pressure off the unique environment of the Burrup Peninsula. I am also hoping that there will be a push to employ locals, or at least encourage relocation to the Pilbara, as opposed to relying on the convenience of a fly-in fly-out work force. This would create a more stable turnover for local service providers and even out the boom-bust cycle. Fly-in fly-out is the bane of regional Australia, which struggles to attract permanent families and skilled workers to often isolated areas. This is a great milestone in the development of Western Australia and the resource rich place that it is. I am reminded of the words of Captain William Dampier back in 1696 when he visited that north-west coast and considered it the most unfortunate, inhospitable and worthless place in the world. Every day when I am conscious of the great achievements of Western Australia and the Pilbara-the Kimberley included-I reflect on those words from William Dampier and think how wrong he was. Once again, I congratulate everyone involved in this truly magnificent success. Banking: Branch Closures",126
195,Mrs CROSIO,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to place on the public record my complete disgust at recent actions by the management of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. On 26 July 2002, a representative of the Commonwealth Bank delivered notice to my office that their branch in the Greystanes shopping centre would close on 6 September. The notice was given through a standard letter under the heading ‘Politician Letter' in the top right-hand corner, followed underneath by my name and office address. The letter urged customers to use branches in other suburbs, such as Merrylands, Pendle Hill and Wentworthville, to take their banking to post offices or to take advantage of electronic banking facilities. The closure of the bank would have forced some small local businesses in the centre to shut up shop, travel to the nearest suburb with a bank branch that offers face-to-face banking, find parking and queue up for long periods just to deposit their takings for the day and get change for their tills. Many residents and business owners complained to my office about the lack of concern shown by the bank. It remains a fact that people of all ages enjoy the security of facecame to-face banking where customers receive a bank receipt which is dated and stamped by the bank as a confirmation of their transaction. That style of banking, it seems, is disappearing out of our local area at an alarming rate. The businesses and people of Greystanes who have given their custom to the Commonwealth Bank for many years needed a branch in their local area where they could take their money and safely and securely deposit it. The residents of Greystanes were not going to take this lying down: we were going to fight this bank. And fight we did! With the help of some local residents and business owners, within two weeks more than 4,500 people of Greystanes and surrounding suburbs signed a petition which urged the Commonwealth Bank to reverse their decision. This is an amazing response, considering that there are around 8,000 households in the entire Greystanes area. On average, at least one person in every second household signed the petition. An extra special mention must go to Bob Anderson and Walter Gonzalez, two people who gave up their time and made the effort to take on the bank and urge more than 4,500 local people to sign the petition. I wrote to all householders in the Greystanes district urging them to sign the petition and attend the rally on Saturday, 17 August, when it was planned to present the petition to the management of the Commonwealth Bank. I also pledged that I would send the petition to the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition to show our nation's leaders how my constituents in Greystanes can rally together. True to my word, the petition was hand delivered to both the Prime Minister's office and the Leader of the Opposition's office today. By Wednesday, 14 August, after more than 4,000 signatures had already been received and the branch closure had received the attention of the local and metropolitan media, the bank announced, through a media statement to the ABC radio news in Canberra, that it had reconsidered its decision and that the Greystanes branch would remain open for business. As you can imagine, this as fantastic news to all involved. ‘WE WON' were the words that Mr Anderson wrote across the petition, and he opened a bottle of bubbly to celebrate. Everyone who signed that petition should feel extremely proud of their efforts in putting their heart and soul into the campaign to save their bank. However, the Commonwealth Bank conducted itself appallingly throughout the whole event. At no stage did it provide justification for the proposed closure of the branch. There was an absolute minimum of communication between the Commonwealth Bank, the community, the media and my office. The only public comment from the bank appeared in a newspaper, which reported the bank as saying the decision was ‘not negotiable'. Finally, when the bank did become aware of the community concern and decided to reverse its decision, the way in which it handled itself was no better. The first my office heard of the bank's backdown was when one of my colleagues rang me from Canberra to say that ABC Radio in Canberra had broadcast that the Greystanes branch of the Commonwealth Bank would remain open. That morning, after many calls from my office to the Commonwealth Bank had proved unsuccessful, my staff had to ring ABC Radio in Canberra and ask for a copy of the statement issued by the bank. At 10 a.m. a faxed copy of a five-sentence statement from the bank confirming the reversal of the decision arrived in my electorate office from ABC Radio in Canberra. It is disgraceful that the bank could not even give my office the courtesy of confirming its decision. What is even more disgraceful is that the staff of the branch itself were not even consulted before Canberra radio had broadcast that the branch would now stay open. Surely the bank could have given its staff the respect they deserved by telling them first before issuing a media statement to ABC radio news. The bank's hard working employees and families, in an era of widespread concern, deserve nothing better than to be first informed of important changes that will affect them. Bank staff now are concerned about their future with the bank, as many have now been given notice of transfer. We are now awaiting the final outcome of this development. The planned rally still went ahead last Saturday. It was a great opportunity for Greystanes residents and businesses to thank everyone involved in fighting the bank and making it back down on its decision. I congratulate the people of Greystanes for their determination and willingness to take a stand for their community and successfully fight one of the biggest financial corporations in Australia. David Wenham, in the recent Australian film The Bank, probably best summed up the feelings of many of my constituents when he said, ‘At the end of the day it's really quite simple-I just hate banks.' After observing the attitude displayed by the Commonwealth Bank to the people of the Greystanes area, to our local businesses and to its own employees in the branch, it is little wonder that many other Australians agree with this sentiment. Again I congratulate my community people for all their effort. I am particularly proud, as I said, of Bob Anderson and Walter Gonzales, who said, ‘Janice, we're not going to take it lying down; fight we will'-and fight we did. Our branch now remains open. Robertson Electorate: Woy Woy Police Station",127
196,Mr LLOYD,ADJOURNMENT,"Robertson) (10.40 p.m.)Tonight I wish to raise a matter that is of concern to all residents in my electorate; it is an issue on which the Carr Labor government has failed miserably. The issue is law and order, safety in the community and, particularly, police numbers in the Woy Woy peninsula area. The Woy Woy peninsula has a population of about 38,000; it has increased from 33,000 in 1996. Yet in that time, while the population has expanded, the police presence has contracted so severely it is virtually non-existent. No longer are there any general duties police stationed at Woy Woy Police Station. Uniformed general duties police deal with residents at the local level and are the front line of the New South Wales police. The Carr Labor government and the member for Peats, Marie Andrews, have failed the coast on law and order issues. There used to be general duties police stationed at Woy Woy. These police provided a highly visible local police presence. While stationed at Woy Woy, general duties police would gain important local knowledge of the area. Local residents would be able to report matters directly to them at their local police station. When these police apprehended a suspected offender, that person would be taken back to the local police station at Woy Woy and charged. This no longer happens. In addition to the suburbs of Woy Woy, Ettalong Beach and Umina Beach, general duties police stationed at Woy Woy were the nearest and, as such, able to provide services to other suburbs like Koolewong and Tascott and isolated communities such as Pearl Beach and Patonga, as well as some of the areas in my own region, the Hawkesbury River region, such as Mooney Mooneytheir nearest police station is Woy Woy. Also for a number of suburbs on the other side of the Rip Bridge such as Killcare, Hardys Bay, Wagstaffe, Saint Huberts Island and Empire Bay, again the police station at Woy Woy is closer than that at Gosford. So we are talking about a police station that services both the peninsula and a much broader area. Despite the need for an effective general duties police presence at Woy Woy, the station is currently used as a base for highway patrol police. While you might occasionally see a police car or two parked out the front or maybe even a police officer within the immediate vicinity of the station, it is important to remember that the main responsibility of highway patrol police is the enforcement of traffic laws and road safety. General duties community policing is not their primary role. At present the nearest general duties police are based at Gosford. This is at least a 20-minute drive from Woy Woy and is much further from some of the other peninsula areas. When general duties police are told that their shift for the day will be on the peninsula, they have to clock on at Gosford and then drive to Woy Woy to undertake that shift. If there is an urgent call for police sistance, those extra minutes of travel could make all the difference in preventing a tragedy or ensuring the arrest of an offender. On a more general level, it means that important community policing functions such as having local police on the beat in the CBDs of Woy Woy, Ettalong and Umina are hindered. If you ask local shopkeepers when they last saw a uniformed police officer in the area, most would say they have not seen a police officer on the beat for many years. Law and order is a primary concern of residents in the Woy Woy peninsula. Indeed, I know that it is a primary concern for all Central Coast residents. Recently a petition was circulated on the Woy Woy peninsula, calling for the return of general duties police to Woy Woy. More than 8,600 local residents-that is more than a quarter of the total population of the peninsula-signed it and it was subsequently tabled in the New South Wales parliament, such is the depth of community feeling over this important issue. I congratulate Gosford City Councillor Debra Wales, who has worked tirelessly to collect these signatures and to highlight the Carr government's failure in this area. In fact, Debra Wales is so concerned about the Carr Labor government's lack of action and the failure by the member for Peats to recognise the community's concerns that she is now the endorsed Liberal candidate for Peats. Debra Wales is determined to make a positive difference to her community. The Carr Labor government are always the first to call on the federal government for assistance when it suits them. However, when it comes to looking after this issue, which is their responsibility, they have failed the Woy Woy peninsula and the Central Coast. The current member for Peats seems incapable of recognising that a problem exists. In 1999 the member referred to the upgrading of the Woy Woy police station by saying, ‘Woy Woy now has a police station of which the police officers, staff and local residents can feel proud.' However, local residents, including myself, wonder why there are no general duties police. It is not much good spending all that money on a poaslice station building when the Carr Labor government will not provide general duties police to staff it. I could provide the House with many examples, but time prohibits me from doing so. The Carr government truly has failed the Central Coast, and not only on the peninsula. The Umina shopfront was a farce. The Kincumber Police Station is a complete sham. The Terrigal Police Station is no longer a 24-hour police station. When the New South Wales election takes place in March, I know that Central Coast residents will send a strong message to the Carr Labor government that they are fed up with the lack of police numbers on the Central Coast. (Time expired) Bankstown District Cricket Club",128
197,Mr MELHAM,ADJOURNMENT,"On Friday, 19 July this year at the annual general meeting of the Bankstown District Cricket Club, four players were presented with life membership. This club has a fierce commitment to the Bankstown district. Perhaps the most well-known of those players to receive life membership were Mark and Steve Waugh. However, I would like to speak first of the achievements of the two other players who have also contributed so magnificently to this club's history. Wayne Holdsworth has played cricket for 19 years at all levels. In his last club season he took 35 wickets. Wayne is the leading first grade wicket taker for the club, with dismissals. He also played in four winning first grade finals for the club. He represented Australia on the 1993 Ashes tour to England, although he did not play a test match. Wayne has taken the most wickets in first grade for the club on five occasions, with his best figure of 61 wickets in the 1995-96 season. Wayne holds the first grade club record for a ninth wicket stand of 118 against Parramatta in 1993-94 with Ken Hall. David Freedman, at 37, is still regarded as one of the best spin bowlers in New South Wales. In 1987-88, and again in 1990-91, David was Bankstown District Cricket Club's player of the year. He has taken 700 wickets in all grades and 381 wickets in first grade. Considering the club has produced bowlers like Len Pascoe and Jeff Thomson, David has matched it with the best. David is also renowned for the nature of his motivational team talks and continues as a club mentor. David debuted for New South Wales in 1991-92. He snared 161 first class wickets with a career best of 8-49 against the West Indies in Newcastle in 1995-96. Throughout their international careers, Steve and Mark Waugh have remained ambassadors for the Bankstown district and the club they play for. In 1984-85, Steve Waugh topped the first class batting average for the club at 68.87. Mark topped the first class batting average in 1986-87 at 48.50 and, again, in 1987-88 at 57.67. Mark scored the most runs for the club in the first grade in the 1986-87 season at 582. Only representative duties have stopped them playing more games with the club's first grade. In February 1998, Steve Waugh became Australia's 40th test captain. Mick Stephenson, who wrote a book for the club's 50th anniversary, believes that Steve epitomises the bulldog spirit and mentally is the toughest Aussie test player in the history of the game. I agree. Mark Waugh is a majestic and magnificent run-getter who has provided countless hours of enjoyment for cricket lovers all over the world. I wish to congratulate Brian Freedman, the president, and Marty Klumpp, the honorary secretary and to also thank the club for electing Kevin MCCormick and me as copatrons. It is an honour and a privilege. Bank476 stown District Cricket Club has produced 21 New South Wales players and six Australian test players. This is a matter of immense satisfaction and pride to a club with a strong sense of identity and history. There are many players who have not represented Australia but they have represented the community and also deserve congratulations. The players and the officials have made an outstanding contribution to the Bankstown community. They are the pride of the Bankstown community. We follow them closely. What pleases me is that both Mark and Steve, whenever they are available, play first grade for the club. They look forward to coming along and lending support even if they are unable to play on both weekends. There is a wonderful community spirit engendered by this cricket club. They are the pride and toast of Bankstown. I salute all of the players at all levels of the club. They are great ambassadors to the community and the officials themselves. I think the club will have many more successful years because they have the right combination and it is all done without charge to the community and with immense pride. It is what we live and breath for-community spirit. I salute them all. Herbert Electorate: Law and Order",130
198,Mr LINDSAY,ADJOURNMENT,"I suppose there are a great many issues facing this country today. It is very hard to know what sort of order you should put them in, but I think I have a pretty good idea. I survey my electorate every four weeks and I have a very accurate record of what the people in Australia's largest tropical city feel are the important issues. Some people might think they are issues related to education, health, veterans affairs, defence, immigration or even citizenship-the member for Moreton's portfolio. I was appalled to find out on the weekend that one in four people in Australia are not Australian citizens. That is just incredible. Mr Laurie Ferguson-Where did you get that figure from?",131
199,Mr LINDSAY,ADJOURNMENT,"I have it in writing from the minister's office. However, what concerns me is that I do not think the media in this country understand what the No. 1 issue today is. It is a suburban issue. street issue. It is the issue of crime and law and order. It is the No. 1 issue in my electorernments ate. In thinking about that and in thinking about possible solutions to that I have been able to develop a Peacebuilders program in the electorate. This program gets into the schools when children are at an impressionable age and it tries to educate them that violence is not the answer, that you can get on with your fellow human and that it is not smart to break the law. I am hoping that the program will go a long way in my electorate to addressing the particular problems of law and order. Currently in Townsville there are 100 break-ins a week. It is just appalling to think that, in a city the size of Townsville, there are 100 break-ins a week. We have to do something about it. You have to ask yourself, ‘Who's doing this and why?' A lot of them are juveniles-juveniles who are out roaming the streets at night-time, juveniles whose parents do not know where they are and juveniles who face really no penalty even if they are caught-a bit more about that in a moment. People, particularly older Australians, tell me that they do not feel safe in their homes. They tell me that they have to put bars on their windows and all that sort of thing-we all know that, as members of parliament. So what is the solution? If a juvenile is caught, what happens to them? The judge does not want to send them to jail. If they do get sent to a detention centre, they are in there for five minutes and they are out again! But what happens to the damage that they cause-the damage to businesses, to homes and to public infrastructure? Who pays for that? The answer is: somebody's insurance company or the victim pays for it out of their own pocket. I reckon that we should be looking at a HECS style scheme where, if a young person is convicted of causing damage, that is recorded and then, when they can afford to pay, they pay for the damage they did. It is pretty radical, but when you think about it, it is certainly possible to do. At the moment, a judge can order restitution but, in general, the offenders do not have any dolIt is a backlars, so it is ineffective. I am proposing tonight that the state govliaise with the federal government to see if there is a mechanism whereby we can record the cost of the damage done so that juveniles are required, when they are working and when they have the means, to repay the cost of that damage. I think that that might be a mighty disincentive for these youngsters who are roaming the streets to commit the damage that they do, and it will help stop them committing these crimes which are causing huge costs to the community at the moment. Shortland Electorate: Health Services",131
200,Ms HALL,ADJOURNMENT,"Today I have spoken on two very important issues-education and health. In this speech I will concentrate a little more on health and the ageing population, particularly in my electorate. In my private members' motion earlier today, I identified how doctors in the area I represent-the Shortland electorateare no longer bulk-billing their patients, and that includes pensioners. What I failed to mention in that motion was a new phenomena, and that is the practice of general practitioners no longer bulk-billing veteranssomething that has been unheard of in Australia's history. I am receiving reports from throughout the electorate-from the Central Coast and from the Lake Macquarie part of the electorateof doctors asking our veterans to pay for their medical consultation. In the Lake Macquarie area of the electorate, five out of the 24 GPs I surveyed on Thursday last weekor 21 per cent of the doctors-are asking veterans to pay for their medical consultation up-front. I know that that will disturb all members of this House. This is unheard of. It is an unwritten rule that the government would always ensure that veterans with gold cards-those men and women who have protected Australia throughout the years, who have fought for our country-would get the medical treatment they needed without question. When you combine that with the fact that there has been a recent increase in the fees being charged by doctors, you will see that this is creating quite a problem for veterans, pensioners and families, for that matter, throughout the electorate. One practice within the electorate has recently increased its consultation fee from $38 to $47. If a veteran or a pensioner has to pay that amount and then travel to the nearest Medicare office, it does create a severe problem for them. Another surgery has recently increased its fee from $37 to $40. As I mentioned earlier today, there is one medical centre that charges $27 if the pensioner pays on the day-they get a $24.45 refund from Medicare, which is a $2.55 difference-whereas, if the patient asks the surgery to submit it, they will be charged an excess of $6. So those people that can afford to pay the fee up-front are a lot better off than those that are struggling. The word going around the electorate is that these increases in fees are to do with medical indemnity crisis-the insurance crisis-that we are seeing at the moment. The government should be very mindful of this and actually do something about solving the problem. For people within the electorate of Shortland it is a long way from their doctor in many instances to the nearest Medicare office, and many of the little communities that make up the electorate of Shortland do not have a Medicare Ezy Claim. I have been fighting very hard to have this situation changed, but my words invariably fall on deaf ears. It is also important to point out that the Shortland electorate has a very elderly population. I currently have a social worker, Jenny Boddy, from Newcastle University on placement in my office. She is researching the needs and lifestyle issues of older people in Shortland. To date, in the surveys that have been completed and returned to our office, practically every one of them has nominated health as the No. 1 issue. The issue that concerns older people in the electorate of Shortland is health-having access to good health care, knowing that the doctors in the area will be there to give them the treatment they need and that they have the financial ability to meet those services. It is not good enough that medical treatment, access to doctors, becomes a privilege. It is a right and it should be available to everyone. The type of medical treatment you receive should depend on your need, not the cost. (Time expired)",131
201,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"It being 11.00 p.m. the debate is interrupted. Mr Hardgrave- Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to require that the debate be extended understanding order 48A. Leave granted. Ministerial Reply",132
202,Mr HARDGRAVE,ADJOURNMENT,"I value highly the record of this place and, as it is in the public domain, it is important that there be accuracy. The member for Herbert, in his contribution a few moments ago, made a suggestion regarding the number of people currently rethe siding in Australia who are not citizens. I want to place on the record that some 27 per cent of people residing in Australia were born overseas. Perhaps that is what the member was referring to. Some 47 per cent of people living in Australia were either born overseas or have at least one parent who was born overseas. It is important to note that over 900,000 residents in Australia are not citizens-roughly one in 20-and the government is very serious about its commitment to encourage those people to take out Australian citizenship, because citizenship is the glue which holds our culturally diverse society together. It is interesting to note that the largest single group in the eligible non-citizen category is those who are British citizens-some 381,000 across Australia, however, two out of every three British-born residents in Australia are citizens. It is the New Zealand-born residents in Australia, though, who are proportionally the least likely to take out Australian citizenship. Two out of three New Zealand-born residents in Australia, which represents some 207,000 people, are not Australian citizens. I thought it was important to detain the House, at great expense from an overtime point of view, to put those matters on the record. House adjourned at 11.02 p.m. NA The following notice was given: Mr Mossfield to move: That this House: (1) acknowledges that: (a) quality access to the Internet and to information technology in general is becoming a necessity, rather than a luxury, in modern Australian society; and (b) infrastructure is not keeping pace with technological advancements, particularly in new and developing suburbs on the outer metropolitan fringe of Australia's capital cities; (2) notes that: (a) Telstra and Optus discontinued its cable roll-out before many of the new, outer metropolitan, suburbs existed; (b) the existing location of Telstra exchanges means that ADSL is unavailable in many developing suburbs; (c) there has been an increase in the use of “split pair gains” as a method of providing basic telephone services to developing suburbs which is also incompatible with ADSL; and (d) satellite is the only broadband delivery system available to many Australians and that this is the most expensive broadband service available; and (3) calls on the Government to: (a) investigate the true extent of this problem facing many Australians in developing communities; (b) examine whether Telstra's Community Service Obligation is adequate when dealing with broadband delivery services; and (c) develop a comprehensive solution to the problem of lack of access to broadband services.

The area is the most significant parcel of private land managed for nature conservation on the Swan Coastal Plain. The proposal has a high community benefit beyond nature conservation extending to research, education and involvement. There is a the high degree of organisation of visitors and associated visitor management, and consequently assistance with salaries for a manager to develop, coordinate and establish the required links with the various stakeholders and appropriate committees and friends groups is recommended.

This project will enhance earlier outputs by developing a more comprehensive approach to community consultation, so that any claims made on community opinion in the Regional Environmental Strategy (RES) report, are broad ranging within the community (including the Aboriginal community) and are representative of the community within the Region. This project also builds on the original project by undertaking further promotional work for the RES by media releases, advertisements, newsletters and fliers, to educate and encourage greater community involvement in this important and innovative project. The project aims to protect, maintain and enhance the natural conservation value of Kensington Bushland, 19 $9,400 a Bushplan site of regionally signficant vegetation. The project will implement one of the high priority 99/2000 recommendations of the Kensington Bushland Management Plan - installation of fencing to prevent access to the bushland, especially of off-road vehicles and domestic animals, thus allowing re-vegetation of tracks, and the bushland itself. 19 $12,082 ments since 1997 within 35ha of coastal dune shrubland and woodland/forest terrain. The regeneration 99/2000 strategy essentially involves weed removal and planting using only species native to this site, and cultivated from material located closest to the site. Matting and mulching are used in fragile zones. Brushing of trample tracks is proposed. Minor dune repair is scheduled by the city of Nedlands and Department of Defence. Systematic investigations of bird and reptile species is intended. Weed control and plant survival rate will be monitored by quadrants. This project aims to build on the significant achievements of the Wooroloo Brook LCDC over the past 19 $34,150 decade. It continues the work of revegetating saline and waterlogged areas; and also introduces new strate- 99/2000 gies to achieve a greater level revegetation of recharge areas. These strategies include agroforestry, direct seeding and protection of existing remnant vegetation. The project concept arises from the key issues and objectives developed through a catchment planning process that the group has undertaken as part of the Swan Mundaring Community Catchment Project.

This propety sits on the boundary between the Swan Coastal 00/2001 Plain (high priority), and Jarrah Forest (low priority) IBRA Regions. The 230 hectares of remnant egetation supports seven vegetation communities, and significant populations of two species of endangered flora and three species of Priority flora. The clay based wetlands, as well as being rare in their own right, are considered suitable sites for the translocation of the critically endangered Western Swamp Tortoise. Acquisition of the remnant and protectgion in the conservation reserve system is consistent with the State's Salinity Action Plan which identifies the protection of remnant vegetation as an important strategy for controlling salinisation. 20 $13,500 for wetland bird species.

The sanctuary is the last wetland on the Bayswater Main Drain (BMD) and offers the last hope for nutrients that enter the sanctuary from the BMD to be removed before they enter the Swan River. As part of the BMD catchment, we are working in partnership with the BICM program to recreate the catchment as a regional strategy. The Perth Biodiversity Project aims to develop regional partnerships, conserve biodiversity and facilitate 20 $459,100 $415,200 on-ground activities that improve the linkages between, and the quality of, locally significant bushland 00/2001 areas in the Perth Metro Region. This will require coordination, information exchange and support between 2001/2002 Local Government, State Government and regional bodies. The Project Officers will assist Local Governments to address the lack of appropriate data for defining and managing biodiversity at the Local Government level, ensure a consistent approach to the development and implementation of local biodiversity plans and facilitate the implementation of strategic on-ground works in locally significant bushland sites throughout the metro region.
