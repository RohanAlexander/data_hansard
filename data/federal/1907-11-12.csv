7,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"In view of the reports have appeared in Melbourne newspapers, and in the Sydney press, to the effect that the Government is entering into an arrangement with the Government of Yictoria to lease certain offices for a period of ten years or more, will the Minister responsible be good enough to give to the House a full explanation of the transactions in question, so as to allay the susof picion in New South Wales that another is being, made to delay the settleof the Federal Capital Site question ?",14
8,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"In consequence of a statement in the Argus the other day, morning, went through the papers, and find that an arrangement was made by my late colleague, the right honourable member for Swan, to occupy the buildings which are being erected near the Victorian Treasury Buildings; but there is no bindwhat ing agreement to occupy them a moment take longer than they may be required.",14
9,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Will a forfei t have to be paid if they are given up?,14
10,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"No . The State Government is erecting the buildings partly for its own use, and arranged with the right honourable meiuber for Swan that the Commonwealth Government should occupy two floors until we desire to move. We have not agreed that notice shall be given of the termination of the tenancy, or that, any penalty shall be paid.",14
11,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,It is merely a tenancy the proposed from month to month.,14
12,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I should think In reference to the which additions which are to be made to the building now occupied by Commonwealth I . find that it is intended to it two stories in one part, and one to story in another. The new accommodation will be occupied by the Commonwealth, and we shall pay rent for it , I believe, in proportion to that now paid, while it is proposed that if the building be vacated within ten years, the sum of £|i,ooo be paid. That recommendation of the Department of Home Affairs was before me for approval. If we moved to the Federal Capital tomorrow we should have to retain certain offices in Melbourne, and these offices would be used. NEW PROTECTION. - Mr CROUCH - In . the published .list of trades to be brought under the proposed Excise Act, which has been referred to as the new protection, the salt workers are not included. Is that omission made designedly ?",14
13,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,r-No authentic list has been published.,15
14,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Will all protected trades be included?,15
15,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"It is difficult for me to say, but the proposed legislation will be made to apply to all trades to which the Government may think it should apply, and the list will be submitted to Parliament, so that if honourable members wish to extend its application, other trades may be inserted. TELEPHONE CHARGES. SYDNEY-MELBOURNE AND SYDNEY-WEST MAITLAND LINES.",15
16,Mr LIDDELL,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I wish to draw the attention of the Postmaster-General to the following paragraph, which appeared in last Saturday's Argus:With the advent of Cup week, the boom in the use of the Melbourne to Sydney telephone probably reached its height. Ever since the spring racing campaign opened, the receipts on the line have steadily grown week after week. week was a record- a long way ahead of the previous week, which was up to that time also a record. Last week there were 426 calls over the line, as against 391 the week before. This is the first time since the 'inauguration of the line that the number of calls has gone over 400. The receipts last week were £q6 , as against £§1 for the previous week. With the average receipts as large as this, the line would pay handsomely. Indeed, if there were any prospect of last week's business being maintained, there is little doubt that the Postmaster-General (Mr Mauger) would again cut down the charges made for using the line. I desire to ask the honourable gentleman if the Department has taken it upon itself to reduce the fee which was fixed for holding a conversation over the trunk line between Sydney and Melbourne, and, if so, whether the Minister cannot now take it upon himself, contrary to the regulations, to reduce the charge which was fixed in respect of the telephone line from West Maitland to Sydney ?",15
17,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"The honourable gentle-' man supposes a case and then proceeds to knock it down. There has been no change, either in the policy of the Department or in the charge for using the trunk line between Melbourne and Sydney, or the trunk line between West Maitland and Sydney. NA IMPORTATIONS: NEW ZEALAND.",15
18,Mr THOMAS,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"In July last I asked the Acting Prime Minister whether he would obtain from New Zealand some information as to the amount of freights paid by its Government for State importations in its subsidized boats. I desire to know whether the Prime Minister has received a"" reply from the Government of New Zealand, and, if so, whether he will give the information to the House ?",15
19,Mr DEAKIN,FREIGHTS ON STATE,A reply has been received to the query. I shall either lay it upon the table or hand it to the honourable member.,15
20,Mr THOMAS,FREIGHTS ON STATE,La y it upon the table.,15
21,Mr DEAKIN,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Mr Speaker, I hand in the following correspondenceMelbourne, 31st July, 1907. Sir, I have the honour to inform you that references have already been made in the Parliament of the Commonwealth to the arrangement that exists between your Government and the line or lines of steamers that receive subsidies for carrying mails to New Zealand. 2. It is understood that in all cases of goods imported by any of .your Government Departments such steamers receive a preference over other lines of vessels. Will you .kindly inform Last me if this is so, and if you will add the amount of freight which is annually paid in connection with such importations I shall be further obliged. I have the honour to be, Sir, . Your most obedient servant; WILLIAM JOHN' LYNE, For the Prime Minister. The Right Honourable The Prime Minister of New Zealand, Wellington. Prime Minister's Office; Wellington, 21st August, 1907. The Hon. the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia. Sir, I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter (P.M. 07/3305) of the 31st ult., regarding references having been made in the Commonwealth Parliament to a preferential arrangement said to exist between the New Zealand Government and.a line of subsidized mail steamers. In reply, I have to lniorm you that the only arrangement of this kind which has been entered into is in connection with the contract between the New Zealand Government and the New Zealand and African Steam-ship Companyj for a cargo steam-ship service between New Zealand and the West Coast ports of the Unit-d Kingdom. The provision in the contract affecting the matter as referred to by you is as follows :"" In consideration of the premises the Government undertake to ship one-half of all cargo under their control from the West Coast ports of the United Kingdom, and one-half of such cargo coming forward from London by the Contractors' line of steamers, Contractors give sufficient public notic: of the sailing dates of such, steamers, and that should any cargo at any time be shut out, the Government shall b° at liberty to make other arrangement for the shipment of such cargo."" This line of steamers received no subsidy from the Government. . The only consideration given was in respect of goods shipped under the above clause of the contract. I am at present unable to say what amount in freightage was paid to the contractors, and it would entail considerable labour to get the figures - If , however, these are of importance to you, please, let me know, and they will be prepared andsent to you as early as possible. I have the honour to be, ADDITIONAL EMPLOYES: SYDNEY POST OFFICE.",15
22,Mr LIDDELL,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Prio r to asking the Postmaster-General a question, without notice, I desire to quote a paragraph which appeared in Saturday's Argus, and which reads ns followsThe Postmaster-General recognises that the only way to effectually deal wilh sweating is Oy the employment of more hands. In this, however, he has been blocked by the Treasurer (Sir William Lyne), and the Public Service Commissioner (Mr D. C. MCLachlan). The employment of a number of temporary hands was sanctioned by them. Mr Mauger instructed the count Deputv Postmaster-General in once engage as many as have been allotted to him. I desire to know whether it is a fact that the Deputy Postmaster-General has applied for 600 additional hands, of which number only one-half has been allotted ?",16
23,Mr MAUGER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"The honourable gentlefollowing paperman is again wrong in his facts. The Deputy Postmaster-General did not ""apply for 600 hands; and everything pertaining 114. to the permanent employment of those officials was stated by the Treasurer ar.d also by myself on two or three occasion'.; in the House. ""COUNSELS OF THE EMPIRE.""",16
24,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"I draw the attention of the Prime Minister to the following passage in the report of a speech which he recently delivered- Only then would they be able to obtain a population, proportionate to their resources, and be able to speak in the counsels of the Empire - a right to which Australia was entitled-and only then would they be able to break through the official ties and bandages once helpful, but provided that the now hindering. As the passage is delightfully vague, I should like to know whether the honourable gentleman is prepared to take the House into his confidence as to what form of Imperialism is there proposed, and as to what are the "" ties and bandages once helpful, but now hindering '' ?",16
25,Mr DEAKIN,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"The report is as complete as one can expect. It naturally is not quite as comprehensive as my statement; but it applies clearly enough to what I was referring. Speaking of the relations of the Colonial Office with Australia in particular, and the Dominions iri Sir, Your obedient servant, general--the relations which were disJ. WARD, cussed at the Conference, which have been, Prime Minister. particularly in this State while it was a Colony, a frequent subject for discussionI took exception to their present character. The proposal that this Government submitted for the establishment of a connection between Conference and Conference bymeans of an office in which all the Dominions should be represented at one joint cost is our remedy. The "" bandages "" are the old relations which are now official obstacles in the way of that ideal. LEAVE OF ABSENCE.

29,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Trea surer) [3.20] - I have taken action alA message from the Governoro f the General has been brought down today, and shall proceed tomorrow to move for leave to introduce the Bill. At the last sitting of the Committee I stated that, in consequence of the reduction of the duty on woollens, it would be necessary to reo f teleduce the duty on piece goods by the same amount and in the same proportion, that is, 10 per cent, lower than the duty on woollens, which we decided a few nights since. TARIFFMr TUDOR - What the honourable (Congentleman means is that he proposes to leave a margin of 10 per cent.",17

33,Mr WILSON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,Why has'not this amendment been circulated?,18
34,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"The honourable member for Melbourne has circulated an amendment, but intends to slightly alter it. That is why I have indicated at the present stage the nature of his proposition. The stipulation that these piece goods shall not weigh more than 4 ounces to the square yard is designed to rid us of a very troublesome position which has arisen in the past in connection with the administration of the Customs Department. Such a condition will prevent the use of a superabundance of wool, since the weight must be kept down.",18
35,Mr REID,FREIGHTS ON STATE,What class of goods are these light dress materials? How would they be described ?,18
36,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"They are used for making up.light dresses for women and children, ancl sometimes clothing for men living in warm climate's. T think that honourable members will approve of what I propose to do. Much time has been devoted to this matter, and considerable information has been obtained. The proposal is in the direction of reducing in most cases the duty upon these imported piece goods, which stand in a somewhat different position from other items. The reason for the proposal to add the words "" rubbered waterproof cloth of any material "" is to afford better protection to the local industry for the manufacture of rubbered waterproof cloth. There has been a great deal of difficulty in deciding what is and what is not rubbered waterproof cloth.",18
37,Mr FULLER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Thos e engaged in the waterproof cloth trade are in opposition to this proposal, are they not? ' Sir WILLIAM. LYNE - I do not know ; ancl I do not think that we should be influenced by such a consideration, provided that we are satisfied that the course proposed is a proper one to take. In such circumstances why should we be etuded solely by the desire of the trade ? They sometimes want something which it might not be right to concede.",18
38,Mr TUDOR,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Do the Government propose to do anything in"" relation to jute?",18
39,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Jut e will be on the free list. At present woollen rubbered waterproof cloth is dutiable . under item 124 paragraph A, but cotton rubbered waterproof cloth can be dealt with only under the present sub-item 124E, at io per cent, or 5 per cent., according to the country of origin. As that is an anomalous position, the amalgamation as set out in the words of the amendment is necessary. I therefore move That after the letters ""n.e.i.,"" paragraph A, the following words be inserted :- "" and rubbered waterproof cloth of any material.""",18
40,Mr REID,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"East Sydney) [3.28] - The use of the words "" of any material'"" is really a departure from this line. We understand the term "" woollen or containing wool,"" but we do not understand the proposed addition of the words ""of any material."" I do not think those words ought to lie added to a paragraph dealing with woollen goods, unless in relation to goods that are partly woollen.",18
41,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,Troubl e has hitherto arisen from the fact that these goods are rubbered.,18
42,Mr REID,FREIGHTS ON STATE,Do they consist wholly of wool except for the rubber?,18
43,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,Yes. This will apply only to rubbered goods.,18
44,Mr REID,FREIGHTS ON STATE,Why not provide for it in a separate item?,18
45,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"The matter has been considered by the Department, and it is. thought desirable to insert the amendment as proposed. I am guided to a considerable extent by the Department.",18
46,Mr REID,FREIGHTS ON STATE,Is there in Australia more than one factory where this cloth is manufactured ?,18
47,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"I am informed there are manufactories, but cannot speak as to the number.",18
48,Mr REID,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"I am under the impression that there is only one factory in Australia where rubbered cloth is made, and I would remind the Committee that this material is used by a large number of factories.",18
49,Mr FULLER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Illawarra) [3.29] - I have here a copy of a letter dealing with this matter, which was addressed to the Ministei of Trade ancl Customs by S. Weingott & Sons Ltd., Wallace & Co., Perdriau Rubber Coy. Ltd., M. Golomb, and J. Sampson and Son. Perhaps I had better read the whole letter to the CommitteeWe, the undersigned waterproof clothing manufacturers, Sydney, respectfully draw your attention to the impossibility of carrying on our business under the existing Tariff of 30 per cent. ad val. on waterproof cloth, and in supno-t of our application for a reduction to the old rate, 15 per cent, ad val., invite your earnest consideration to the undermentioned facts :1. The manufacture of waterproof clothing in Australia finds employment for close on 500 hands. 2. Local proofing would be impossible for the following reasons :",18
50,Mr WATSON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"It is not impossible, because it is done here.",19
51,Mr FULLER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Thes e are the reasons given. It will be for honourable members to determine whether or not they are sufficient. (a) The local proofing firms are our competitors in the trade of waterproof garments, and if they did our proofing would derive an unfair advantage over us, in knowing all our patterns, and what we were doing, generally speaking, besides which they would naturally give a preference to their own materials; furthermore, there would be nothing to prevent them making a prohibitive charge for the proofingwhenever it suited them to do so, knowing that we would be entirely in their hands (b) It would not be feasible for any one of us to start a .process of proofing cloth on account of the excessive cost of the necessary plant. An estimate from a ' reputable English firm , puts down the cost of a small plant (capable of proofing twenty-five pieces per day), at £3,000 ; this expenditure is exclusive of the import duties on the machinery and the erection of the buildings, &c. . {c) So rapid is the process of - waterproofing cloth, that it would not pay any manufacturer to start a factory for this purpose alone, for a small plant working constantly for two months could proof all the cloth used in Australia for twelve months.",19
52,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"The writers of letter aire importers of waterproof cloth, think.",19
53,Mr REID,FREIGHTS ON STATE,They are also.,19
54,Mr FULLER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"They are and manufacturers, I take it .",19
55,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,I they have much to do with manufacturing.,19
56,Mr FULLER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,Thes e firms give employment to 500 hands. They are manufacturers who use waterproof cloth.,19
57,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"They use ported cloth. MT. FULLER - Yes . 3. The waterproof trade is at any time a very capricious one, owing to the uncertain cl'matic conditions and the droughty nature of Australia generally speaking, so that nb encouragement is afforded for expenditure of large sums for proofing plant. 4. We would respectfully submit that if cloth made waterproof with Indiarubber were made a special line with a duty of 15 per cent, ad val., it would afford an ample protection for firms proofing cloth locally, whose interests are guarded by item 124 (page 49 of the schedule), and we might mention that in New Zealand, a strong protectionist colony, waterproof cloth is actually admitted free of all duty. In conclusion, we earnestly press the claims of the large number of hands engaged in the waterproof garment making, as against the dozen or two who may be employed in the proofing process; and as indicated above, as the retention of the present duty pf 30 per cent, ad val. would make it quite impossible for us to carry on against the existing monopoly, we sincerely trust that you will see the vital importance of this matter to us and those we employ in the trade. The letter is signed by the firms whose names I have indicated. Considering the purposes for which this material is used, that the business gives employment to such a large number of hands, and that the establishment of a proofing business would mean the employment of so few in addition, I think the Committee ought seriously to consider the position. Waterproof cloth is really the raw material of an industry which gives a large amount of employment. I trust that under the circumstances the Committee will not agree to addition proposed by the Treasurer.",19
58,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,North Sydney) [3.35] - The waterproof cloth in question is the raw material for making waterproof clothing.,19
59,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,The clothing is made largely from imported raw material; but the material is also manufactured in Australia,19
60,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"If . we impose a duty of 35 per cent, it will evithe dently reduce the opportunity for mainI taining the manufacture of waterproof clothing in this country. manufacturers Sir WILLIAM LYNE - The duty will conduce to more waterproof cloth being made importers here.",19
61,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Accord do not think ing to the information before us, that would mean a very small additional employment of labour.",19
62,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,That is what - the importers say. the im- Mr DUGALD THOMSON - They are manufacturers as well as importers.,19
63,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,I know that there is a large proofing manufactory here.,19
64,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Wehv gott's are manufacturers. They may import cloth for their own purposes, but their principal business is manufacturing the clothing. . The Minister, by his proposal, is running a risk of injuring, one business without greatly benefiting another, because the amount of labour involved in proofing would be very small indeed. A plant that would be sufficient' to provide waterproof cloth for all Australia would not employ much labour. By this duty we shall be likely simply to conduce to the importation of finished garments.",19
65,Mr REID,FREIGHTS ON STATE,That is so ,20
66,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Of course it is. The benefit of the duty would be secured by the importers of the finished article. Of course, if the Minister is prepared to take that course I have nothing more to say.  are 188 hands employed ira the manufacture of waterproof clothing in Victoria. Only a very few are employed in the manufactuie of the cloth. It is evident that it would require the employment of only a very few more of the latter to supply the whole of the Australian requirements. This is a question as between the industry of making up garments and of manufacturing waterproof cloth. Another consideration is that whilst the makers of these garments carry on their business under Wages Board conditions the manufacturers of waterproof cloth would lae subject to no such regulations. If we carry the Minister's proposal it means wiping out the making-tip industry. I am astonished that some of the Victorian members have not taken note of this fact, because I do not think that there is any doubt that the effect of the proposal will be that the chief material employed in making up will not be obtained.",20
67,Mr WATSON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,Why cannot cloth be proofed in this country ?,20
68,Mr MAUGER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Tihey are here  hands are employed in that industry, whereas there are 188 employed in the manufacture of waterproof clothing under Wages Board conditions. The contention is that double the number of hands at present employed in proofing would be sufficient to supply the whole Australian market.",20
69,Mr WATSON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,I do not think that that is so.,20
70,Sir TOHN FORREST,FREIGHTS ON STATE,How many are ploved in the - industry ?  emoloyed in making up.,20
71,Sir JOHN FORREST,FREIGHTS ON STATE,How many in Commonwealth ?,20
72,Mr WILKS,FREIGHTS ON STATE,There are about 500 employed in the Commonwealth.  siderable number are employed in the Commonwealth. What is proposed now is to establish this industry at the cost of another in which a large number of people are employed.,20
73,Mr BRUCE SMITH,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Parkes) [3.41.]. It seems to me that the Committee are entitled to hear something from the Minister in answer to this letter. I find, on inquiry, that this question of waterproof clothing did not come before the Tariff Commission, and, therefore, we are bound now, as a Committee, to look into the matter for ourselves. The only piece of testimony of a special character that we have before us is the letter referred to. Unless the Minister, or the honourable member for South Sydney-wh o is now engaged in writing a letter, but who says that the statement placed before us cannot be true - is prepared to place some contrary evidence before the Committee, we have no alternative but to act, so far as we can, on this letter from the manufacturers.",20
74,Mr WATSON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"The statement. I objected to was not in the manufacturers' letter, but was made by the honourable member for Grey, to the effect that there were only twelve men employed in proofing.",20
75,Mr BRUCE SMITH,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"That strengthens my case, inasmuch as we have no contradiction before us of the facts stated in the letter.",20
76,Mr WATSON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"The facts stated are, I think, a sufficient answer.",20
77,Mr BRUCE SMITH,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"I do not think they are; and I should like the honourable member to explain how he arrives at that proofing it conclusion. This letter, of which we have all had a copy, makes a very circumstantial statement with regard to the condition of this industry; and I take it that the Com- mittee will not flippantly throw it aside unless the Minister can give us information of a contrary character. We are not here merely to pass duties in an off-hand way without troubling to ascertain the facts. If the.Minister does not bring forward some other evidence, I do not see what the Committee can do beyond acting in accordance with the information before it. What does em- the letter state ? It affirms that in the Commonwealth there are 500 people engaged in making waterproof clothing from this cloth. the Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I think we may take it that that is not correct.",20
78,Mr BRUCE SMITH,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"That is not the sort of statement to which the Committee entitled, in answer to an authoritative and specific assertion if I may so call it. The. Minister had a copy of the letter as far back as the ist November; and, with large number of officers he has at his mand, it would be an easy matter for to find out whether or not the statements therein are true, and, if they are not to give us a report from an officer which would at once carry equal weight with to which the letter is entitled. We seem to be running in an absolutely contrary direction from that which we have followed in regard to other items. We are including waterproof clbth under this item, and making it liable to a duty of 25 and 20 per cent., the latter duty being in favour of Great Britain, where large quantities waterproof articles are made up. Whilst we are imposing a duty of only 20 per cent, on made-up waterproof cloaks and coats, we are thus proposing to' impose a duty of 25 per cent, on the raw material from which the garments are made. surely, is contrary to the principle we have followed in relation to other items. I am not - addressing myself to the Minister so much as to the Committee when I say that, in face of the statement that 500 peopleor even if we take half that number-ar engaged in making up this waterproof clothing, and of the further statement by of the proofed material. the manufacturers that one or two dozen people can make enough cloth for the whole of Australia, it seems to me that we are being asked to so legislate as to discourage instead of ""encourage this particular dustry. I have no personal interest matter; and I shall be very glad to follow the Minister's suggestion if he is prepared to put some data before us. But if he is going to ask the Committee to treat this circumstantial letter with scant coming from an interested source, and give* us no argument on the other side; then I exaggeration. say it is of no use trying to legislate. the Minister is going to use whatever majority he has for the mere purpose of pushing this proposal through, irrespecreason tive of its merit, it is hardly worth our while discussing it. But, I submit, ought to be reasonable and consistent, and to give encouragement to this industry least placing a higher duty on the"" madenamely, up articles than we do on the raw material.",20
79,Mr WATSON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"South Sydney) [3.47]' The honourable member for Parkes seems matter should be attended to. to imagine that this manufacturer's letter, which he has frequently referred, has been sprung on members of the Committee. The honourable member also stated that impossible for me fo write a letter, and, at the same time, pay attention to the matter the under discussion. As a matter of fact, comthe letter read by the honourable member for him Parkes has been before every member for a considerable time. It does not matter true,\ whether or not a member is writing a letter during the progress of this discussion; that he has by this time made up his mind as to the plausibility of the statements put forward in the letter of the manufacturers, i have not before me the exact terms of the letter, but I recollect them sufficiently so to be able to say that it conveys a contradiction on its face. In the first place, it is said in the letter that local proofing is imof possible. Why ? Because the makers of the local material will be competitors in regard to made-up goods. First, it is said that local proofing is impossible, and then, that the material is made locally by those who wil.l be competitors in made-up goods. So fair as my knowledge goes, I believe that That, proofing is done locallv.",21
80,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,B y three firms.,21
81,Mr WATSON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"This letter is signed by fiveor six strong firms in Sydney alone, and they say that if the duty on the e material is carried, they will be under the thumb of the existing local manufacturers In the same breath, however, they said that it would only cost them a little over ,£3,000 to proyide a plant for themselves. I ask whether it is likely that a company like that of inPerdriau would consent to. be under the in the heel of the Dunlop Company, for instance, merely for the sake of an expenditure of £ 3 , 0 0 0 or £ 4 , 0 0 0 .",21
82,Mr WILKS,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"It is said that the plant would be kept working for only two or three courtesy, as months in the year.",21
83,Mr WATSON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"That , I think, is an There is an enormous If quantity of this material used in the Commonwealth; and if it be a fact that only a few men are employed, it is an additional for encouraging the industry. This letter, so far as it appeals to me, does we not convey any argument worth considering-the real argument was that mentioned by at by the honourable member for Parkes, that it is undesirable to impose a higher duty on the raw material than is imposed on the made-up article. That If it is to true, as stated, that the made-up waterproof clothing is dutiable at a lower rate than is proposed to be levied upon the raw ""material it was a mistake' has been made.",21
84,Mr STORRER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Bass) [3.51]--If the word ""waterproof"" is added in this paragraph it should also be added in item 106. By that means there would be a difference of. 10 per cent, between the duties on the made-up article and the piece goods respectively. This would meet the difficulty mentioned by the honourable member for Parkes. - Mr Bruce SMITH (Parkes) [3.52] I am quite with the honourable member for South Sydney in taking up a rather sceptical attitude towards the letters and circulars so frequently addressed to honourable members. It is very embarrassing and confusing to honourable members to have conflicting sfatements put before them by ' manufacturers and importers. That is why I have so forcibly advocated following the Tariff Commission where they have had an opportunity of hearing evidence, on oath, from both sides, and of judging judicially between them. But the honourable member for South Sydney should notice that in this case no evidence af all was given to the Commission. We have nothing but this letter to guide us, and tire Minister either has no knowledge of the subject, or does not choose to put it before the Committee.",21
85,Sir JOHN FORREST,FREIGHTS ON STATE,What is the value of the imports?,22
86,Mr BRUCE SMITH,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"They are fairly substantial. There is a big industry concerned. I do not think the honourable member for South Sydney does justice to the authors of the letter when he says that it is absurd on the face of it. They do not say that it is impossible to manufacture the material here, because they admit that it is done. They state that there is already at least one substantial firm manufacturing it, and that enough can be manufactured by from twelve to twenty men in two months to supply the whole of the Commonwealth. There is another raw material in the shape of the woollen or cotton fabric, in addition to the water-proof. Upon, that fabric the india rubber surface has to be placed. It is very probable that this can be done by machinery at a very rapid rate.",22
87,Mr WATSON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"I saw the material being Archer, E. W. made. The process is not very rapid. The number of men mentioned is ridiculously small.",22
88,Mr BRUCE SMITH,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"I should say that the application of the india rubber to the fabric is done almost wholly by machinery under the guidance of one man. The honourable member for Illawarra has placed in my hands a schedule showing that the value of cloth-made water-proof imported has been as follows:-1902 , , £ 2 2 , 0 0 0; [206] 1 9°3> £ 3 > ° ° ° i 9 ° 4 . £ 5 3 > ° ' > and 1906, 2 I 00 ,£39,ooo -- Whilst I regard with great scepticism these ex parte statements made by manufacturers on the one side and by importers on the other-alway s in their own interests and not too carefully drawn for the guidance of honourable members-the statement which has been put before the Committee is one to which there is practically no contradiction, and although it may appear'improbable, it is due to those who have made the statement for the' information of the Committee and addressed it to the Minister that it should be met by some authoritative counter-statement. If , as they say, the wafer-proof material can be made for the whole of the Commonwealth by such a small number of people, and the industry of manufacturing the cloth into garments is so substantial, we ought to be very careful before we dismiss off-handedly and without information their statement as to the hardship which will accrue to the four or five substantial firms engaged in the industry.

Question so resolved in the affirmative. Amendment agreed to. ; Mr JOHNSON (Lang) [4.4] move That after the words ""35 per cent.,"" graph A, the words "" and on and after November, 1907 (General Tariff), ad val., per cent.,"" be inserted. The question of the duties which should be levied upon woollens was fully debated when the item of apparel and attire was saysunder consideration, and I do not propose to' add much to what was then said. I after merely wisli to point out that the arguments which were then advanced apply with eaual force to this item in so far as the conditions of labour under high and low Tariffs are concerned. From a return which has been prepared I find that in 1878, when a duty of i r per cent, was operative upon woolare made in France and Germany. lens, there were 736 hands employed in the Victorian woollen mills. But when the rate was increased to 44 per cent, in 1892-3, the number of hands declined from 736 to °59",22
89,Mr WATSON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"The Bank smash iii 1893. "" Mr JOHNSON"" - Then I will select some other years for the purpose of stituting a comparison. In 1888, when duty was increased to 22 per cent.",23
90,Mr REID,FREIGHTS ON STATE,-That was a boom year.,23
91,Mr JOHNSON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"That is so. In when the duty was increased from cent, to 22 per cent., the number of ployes in the industry fell from 736 I i i 1892, with the duty of 22 per cent, in upon them. 1888 increased to 44 per cent., the number of hands employed fell off to 552. I 1899 the duty was considerably less than tective duty. half of this, the highest then being 27^ per cent, and the lowest 16J per cent., and duty. under the operation of the lower duty the number of hands employed increased from 552 to 917. Last year the hands increased to 1,315 under a J 6 | per cent, duty. It will be seen, therefore, that as the rate was increased employment in the industry decreased, arid vice versa. would also point out that Mr Grainger, the Ballarat woollen mills, stated in evidence before the Tariff Commission, in answer to questions 10719-10721, that three Victorian mills had closed within a or two of 1896, when the duty under the and blouses. highest Victorian Tariff was 44 per cent. Again, in answer to question 10722A-10726, he mentions two other mills 'which commenced operations under the first Commonwealth Tariff, which imposed a very much lower rate than that levied uniler the old Victorian Tariff. I These facts show that under a high Tariff the industry suffered,' whilst under a low paraTariff it progressed. I have been asked 13th by the honourable member for Moreton to 20 bring before the Committee a letter which has been forwarded to him by a clothing, manufacturer, and which enclosed several samples of woollen material. The writer I have just returned from the Old Country a very short stay. But, before returning, I sent a wire to have certain goods bonded, owing to the increased Tariff from 15 to 30 and 35 per cent. I enclose samples bf similar goods. Note - They are now classed with woollens, and tweeds and there is not a yard being made in any State in the Commonwealth, and cannot be made for the next fifty years. Indeed, some of the samples cannot be made in England, but -. .. I ' spoke to one of the directors of the company, who told me that the Board had no idea that light dress materials were included in the new Tariff. The bonded warehouses, are full of the class of-goods that I have sent samples of, and many of us would prefer sending them back occurred sooner than pay the higher duty. Any honourable member who inspects the enclosed samples will see at once that fh*ey inare of materials which are' not manufacthe tured in the Commonwealth at present, and are not likely to be manufactured here during our time.' It would therefore seem 1888, ridiculous, as well as a great hard11 per ship upon the people who have to emwear these materials for clothing, that to 704. these high duties should be imposed After all, this duty is imposed merely for revenue purposes, and n cannot in any sense be r/jgarded as a pro",23
92,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,This is a protective,23
93,Mr JOHNSON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,Not when it covers employed materials such as I have here.,23
94,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,What are those just materials'; what are they used for?,23
95,Mr JOHNSO N,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"They are dress I materials, classed as woollens, and they of are being charged the highest rates of duty as such when, as a matter of fact, they are chiefly cotton, and are the materials in year general use for women's summer dresses",23
96,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"I am reducing the duties on those goods to 20 per cent, and 15 per cent.",23
97,Mr JOHNSON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Eve n those duties are exceptionally high for goods of this description, which cannot be manufactured in Australia.",23
98,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"As the Tariff stands at present, the duties proposed are 30 per cent, and 35 per cent.",24
99,Mr JOHNSON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"That is so. And that is the rate now being charged upon them. These goods are classed under woollen piece goods, and the importers state that it will pay them better to send the goods back whence they came than to take them out of bond at the rates proposed.",24
100,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,I intend to reduce the rates proposed by 5 per cent.,24
101,Mr JOHNSON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,The honourable gentleman must himself admit that that is not - a very material reduction.,24
102,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"They were dutiable at 15 per cent, under the old Tariff.",24
103,Mr JOHNSON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"That is so; and I submit that 15 per cent, is a sufficiently high duty to impose on such materials. But even under the Treasurer's amended proposal the duties will be increased by 5 per cent.",24
104,Mr MALONEY,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"My amendment, if carried, would make the duty on them 20 per'cent, under the general Tariff, and 15 per cent, from the United Kingdom.",24
105,Mr JOHNSON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,It should be remembered that many of these goods are not manufactured in England.,24
106,Mr MALONEY,FREIGHTS ON STATE,Most of them are not.,24
107,Mr JOHNSON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Most of them are manufactured on the Continent; and the general Tariff rate would consequently apply to ""them.",24
108,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,They do not come uncler the paragraph we are discussing now.,24
109,Mr JOHNSON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"I am dealing with the item generally, and I am not certain that they do not come under paragraph A. I repeat that the duty on these goods cannot be regarded as protective in its incidence, and with a lower Tariff we would remove a hardship which otherwise would be inflicted upon people who must have this material, whilst the effect, I believe, would be beneficial to the Treasury in bringing about an increased revenue.  here a' letter, which I received from the Adelaide Warehousemen's Association, dealing with this item. The writer saysI have the honour, by direction of the Adelaide Warehousemen's Association, to bring under notice the administrative effect of the proposed Tariff on some lines of textile goods in Tariff 'division 5, and the certainty of further complications with the items 108 and 118 passed by the House of Representatives on the 6th and Slh inst. respectively. [206]- 2 The administration of item 124F is such that unless it is taken out altogether or the list of articles extended in E, almost everything in the way of cotton piece goods will eventually f all under F- a higher duty than silk piece goods. I have only to mention that the Customs have decided in respect to some pocketings, ordinary cotton shirtings, cotton tweeds,' and the like, that because a microscopical examination or axi imaginative official mind traces a treated surface they are liable to 25 per cent, and 20 per cent., an increase of 15 per cent. The Tariff Commission, as the result of an exhaustive inquiry, recommended items 124B and 124F should pay the same rate of duty as 124E, viz., 10 per cent, and 15 per cent. My association therefore ask you to have items 124B and 124F deleted, and item 118 recommitted, so as to include the articles under item 108 that are furnishing drapery and napery, as unless these articles are distinctly specified'under 118 the importers are at the mercy of the administrative authorities whether the classification is lo be item 108 or 118. Reference to item 108 of proposed Tariff on such' articles as kettle-holders, polishing, tea, glass, kitchens, sponge, counters and crumb-cloths, '&c, will convince you that such articles are as much furnishing drapery and napery as doyleys, tray-cloths, & c , under item 118, and should f all under the same item.",24
110,Mr MALONEY,FREIGHTS ON STATE,The Minister has promised to take a note of that.,24
111,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,That is so.,24
112,Mr GLYNN,FREIGHTS ON STATE,I saw the Minister about that this morning.  being charged at 'the higher duty.,24

114,Mr GLYNN,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Angas) [4.18] - I may say that I received a letter similar to that which has been quoted by the honourable member for Grey, and I .saw the secretary on the subject yesterday. I find that sometimes one can get a thing done more quickly by informing the Department beforehand of what one intends to move in Committee. The departmental officers are thus given an opportunity to ldbk into the somewhat complex questions, and make up their minds in advance of the action taken in the Committee, thus facilitating the speedy settlement of the Tariff. This matter is as stated in the letter which the honourable member for Grey has read, but I understand that the Minister promises to reconsider it in the light of the suggestions made.",24
115,Mr WATSON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,He promised to. do .so last week.,24
116,Mr GLYNN,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"This morning I received a letter from Dr Wollaston, whohas looked into the matter carefully. I quote a short extract from his letter in referbefore ence to items 108 and 118. He writesRelating to the effect of the items 108 an'.t u 8 of the Tariff as passed by the House Representatives, I beg to state that 118 specifically includes articles of furnishing drapery and napery, whereas 108 refers to articles not where included. As articles of furnishing drapery and napery are elsewhere included, are not affected by 108. I am not sure that that is an answer the letter quoted by the honourable memwe ber for Grey, but it is as well to have statement on record, as the letter itself has been read. With respect to the geneing. ral item, 1 may say that in my district there is a woollen factory, which has battled against a good deal of difficulty, and in which the colonial material has been brought to a pretty high state of perfection, judging by. the evidence given before the Tariff Commission. The comorable pany strictly fulfils the scriptural injuncflannelettes, tion against mixing, because I find that Mr the item under, consideration. Moore, the manager, has said that they never mix cotton with wool. They prerates fer to trust to qualitv. I mention this fact because last week, when the manufacture of blankets was being discussed, good deal was said about the admixture of cotton with wool. .",24
117,Mr THOMAS BROWN,FREIGHTS ON STATE,The . Tariff mission reported that the mixing is almost entirely confined to Victoria.,25
118,Mr GLYNN,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"I think that, in justice the South Australian firm, which is turning out a good article, the fact that it does mix should be made known. I should like the Minister to tell us what is the ratio local .production to consumption. Accordsay ing, to evidence given in Sydney by a Riplev, two years ago, the local produche tion of woollens- I take it in Wales-wa s then valued at about .£70,000, and the importations at about If the same ratio exists between the production and consumption of the Commonmainly wealth, there is a considerable ""disparity.",25
119,Mr TUDOR,FREIGHTS ON STATE,That is a reason for posing stiff duties.,25
120,Mr GLYNN,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Not a bit. If certain materials are not manufactured here; either because, for the present, they cannot be made here or because it is more profitable to give attention to other manufactures, the imposition of high rates of duty upon them means the imposition of heavy, taxation upon the people, who must pay higher prices in quence. Apparently it will be many j'ears venue. the local production equals the local consumption in certain classes of imports.",25
121,Mr WATSON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,Then the sooner we start of to manufacture these goods the better.,25
122,Mr GLYNN,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"I shall not elaborate my elseargument, because, since the consideration they of the Tariff commenced, I have endeavoured in my remarks on specific duties not tb exceed five minutes, knowing that if to every honourable member - speaks at length shall be here until the Day of Judgment the - though , if the Government had their deserts, that day would not be long in arrivHeavy duties will, in many cases, prove very burdensome for many years to come, because the local production cannot meet the local requirements.",25

The rates in regard to all the items will be reduced, with one exception, in which case there will be an increase of 5 per cent. I hope that the Committee will not seek to maike further reductions, which will not only lessen the protective value of the duties, consebut will also immensely decrease the re",25
126,Mr EDWARDS,FREIGHTS ON STATE,Oxley) [4-28] - The Minister says that he proposes to reduce the rates of duty in this case.,26
127,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Yes ; to 30 per cent, and 25 per cent.; while on some goods the rates will be only 20 per cent, and 15 per cent.",26
128,Mr EDWARDS,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"The rates would still be a little too high, though I should have said nothing against rates of 25 per cent, and 20 per cent. Perhaps 15 per cent the former rate-wa s rather below what the manufacturers should get. But it must be remembered that they have been doing very well. The merchant tailors of Sydney are utterly opposed to any increase, and have passed a resolution to the effect that a duty of 30 per cent, on woollens is opposed to the best interests of the Commonwealth, and that 15 per cent, will give sufficient protection to the Australian woollen manufacturers.",26
129,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,The principal business of those who passed the resolution is importing.,26
130,Mr EDWARDS,FREIGHTS ON STATE,They also say that the proposed rates will crush out many tailoring establishments. I do not think that the Minister wishes to do that.,26
131,Mr JOHNSON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Yes , if they dare to import.",26
132,Mr EDWARDS,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"I will not go quite so far as the honourable member in that belief. Another resolution of the tailors reads as followsThat since Australian woollen manufacturers are unable to fill requirements, we are of opinion that if this Tariff is passed inferior woollens will be imported into the Commonwealth. That is their opinion, which, of course, they are entitled to hold. I have in my hand one or two paragraphs in a communication from the 'Queensland Warehousemen's Association. After referring to the duty on woollen piece goods they state that the classification is not correct. They point out that a distinction ought to be made between piece goods used for men's clothing and piece goods used for women's dresses. They sayIn classing woollen piece goods a distinction should be drawn in goods that are made or can be made in Australia, and those which cannot t e produced under existing conditions. All agree, I think, that goods wihich we cannot produce) if not placed on the free list, should be allowed to come in at a very low rate of duty. The writers go on to sav- The piece goods which can be made include Ivsavy tweeds and serges, chiefly for men's wear. We suggest a duty of 20 per cent, on this class. . . The goods which cannot be made may be describe'd generally as fine texture/ light weight all wool, woollen and silk, Or woollen and cotton mixtures used in making up of ladies' apparel or for lining men's apparel. They include fabrics in endless varieties of designs and colourings, which ever-changing fashion demands, and they are known as cashmeres, voiles, delaines, nun's veiling, fine twills, amazons and face cloths, Italians, Venetians, Sicilians, lustres, Bieges, Eoliennes, silk and woollen mixtures, Panama cloths, hopsacs, and similar goods under various names. Eor reasons well understood in the trade, many of these goods are not made in Great Britain, and the same reasons in a much greater degree will prevent their being made in Australia. The public taste demands these goods, and the Tariff cannot alter this. The high rate will hinder or prevent the making up in Australia of garments made up from these materials, the duty on ready-made articles being a very little more. I hope that the Minister will not ask the Committee to pass higher duties than 25 and 20 per cent, respectively. I am quite prepared to support those rates.. The honourable member for Angas has referred to the mixing of wool and cotton in the manufacture of piece goods. .1I have here a sample which the Ipswich Woollen Company sent to the honourable member for Moreton, who has been obliged to pay a visit to Queensland, and who otherwise would have, exhibited it to honourable members. I have had considerable experience in connection with this kind of ' industry, and I assure the Committee that, I have not seen a better sample, than this one. The goods are guaranteed by the company to be all wool. They are quite prepared to allow their goods to be analyzed with a view to discover if any cotton has been mixed with the wool. They are really mosi beautiful goods. I think that duties of 20 and 25 per cent, respectively will be fair to both the manufacturers and the workers.",26
133,Mr HEDGES,FREIGHTS ON STATE,Fremantle) [4-35] - I . take it that this item includes the woollen piece goods from which our clothes are made. Until a day or two ago I was under the impression that cloth was being made in Australia.,26
134,Mr MAUGER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,It all depends on what the honourable member calls cloth.,26

Certain information from a very reliable source was placed in more surprising. mv hands, and, thinking that it could not be quite true, I got it confirmed this ing by the Comptroller-General. I believe that honourable members will be astonished when I give the figures showing the extent to which these materials are imported. Here are samples of the weft and the warp which are imported. The weft goes one way through the cloth, and the warp the other way. These two threads are imconsisting ported.",27

147,Mr HEDGES,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Althoug h we have been told that pure Australian wool is being manufactured into cloth for our people' to wear, yet I find that the weft and the warp which may be made up of old rags from London or other big cities is largely used. That may be why it is so short. Let honourable members . try the staple of the English material against that of Colonial material. Our wool in Australia is specially good; perhaps imported yarn accounts for the quality of our cloth not being as good .as it should be. . ",27
148,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,If is the best the - Comqualitv which can be obtained.,27
149,Mr HEDGES,FREIGHTS ON STATE,I do not know that the honourable gentleman is a judge of that.,27
150,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,Ye s I am; I havewearing it longer than has the honor,27
151,Mr HEDGES,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"That does not make honourable member a judge of cloth. I a know a man who wears worse clothes than. can do he does; and is perfectly satisfied with as them; but that does not make him a judge of cloth. The clothing for the people of should be made as cheap as possible. There are many persons living in parts where they would not benefit from the operations of a woollen factory at a distance of 3,000 or 4,000 miles, especially if it were run with imported material. I have in my hand figures which I believe will stagger many persons. Last year ,£91,000 worth of this yarn was imported for the purpose of making cloth like that on which it is proposed to put an increased",27
152,Mr BRUCE SMITH,FREIGHTS ON STATE,If we add the figures for cotton yarn the result will be,27
153,Mr HEDGES,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Thos e figures refer mornsolely to yarn made partly or wholly of wool. An honourable member has assured the Committee that the manager of a factory has stated that he did not add cotton. If he did not add cotton, he may have bought stuff into which somebody else had added cotton. It was not necessary for him to buy the cotton-h e could buy yarn, partly of cotton, for use in his factory. Australian COLONEL FOXTON - Int o what States was this yarn imported?",27
154,Mr HEDGES,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"I cannot say. We are dealing now, not with individual States, but with Australia as a whole, and I repeat that .£90,930 worth of partly dr wholly woollen yarn was imported for cloth making.",27
155,Mr MAUGER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"The Government are proposing a duty of 10 per cent."" on yarn's. 1",27
156,Mr HEDGES,FREIGHTS ON STATE,The Government areproposing a duty that will increase the cost of this material to the public.,27
157,Mr FOSTER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,Is the honourable member's information to the effect that the yarn of which he speaks was imported for making cloth?,27
158,Mr HEDGES,FREIGHTS ON STATE,For what other purpose would it be used?,27
159,Mr FOSTER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"For making socks, stock. ings, and other goods of that class. ' Mr HEDGES - I thought that ordinary worsted would be used for knitting stockings. I have obtained my information from persons interested in the trade, who tell me that they import in the name of "" yarn."" what is known in the indus^ try as the weft and the warp. If we are to impose a duty for the encouragement of cloth making in Australia, I should like - to see every operation connected with the industry carried on in the Commonwealth. .Why should we not spin our own yarn?",27
160,Mr TUDOR,FREIGHTS ON STATE,The spinning is done in some places.,28
161,Mr MAUGER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,It is spun in Ballarat.,28
162,Mr HEDGES,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Le t us spin all that we require. The cloth-making industry seems to be in very much the same position as that of wire netting. We use imported .machines to twist imported wire into netting, and make believe that we are manufacturing netting in Australia. In the same way it would appear that wool grown in Australia is sent to other countries to be converted into yarn, in which state it is returned to Australia to be made into cloth. We gammon that the cloth so made is an Australian production. Such a state of affairs is disgraceful to Australia, and it would be foolish for us to impose a high duty for the sake of encouraging such a tricky business. We should be prepared to impose certain duties to help any purely Australian industry, but I am riot going to vote to assist an industry that sends to another country for a partly-manufactured material. t t was with regret that I received this information. The man who supplied it to me is thoroughly conversant with the cloth-making trade, and I spent over a week in endeavouring to authenticate it .",28
163,Mr HUME COOK,FREIGHTS ON STATE,Has the honourable cloth making. member visited a woollen mill?,28
164,Mr HEDGES,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"When I desire to obtain correct information, I do not seek it from a man who is interested on the other side.",28
165,Mr HUME COOK,FREIGHTS ON STATE,Coul d not the honourable member visit a woollen mill and ascertain for himself whether the yarn was being spun there?,28
166,Mr HEDGES,FREIGHTS ON STATE,I am not a Government inspector. - Mr HUME COOK - But the honourable member said that he was in search of the truth.,28
167,Mr HEDGES,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"I am not going on a .tour of inspection. The information I have obtained is confirmed by the Comptroller-General of Customs. Mr HUME . COOK - I will guarantee ""that it is not.",28
168,Mr HEDGES,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"I repeat that he confirms the information I have obtained, that the weft and the warp are imported into Australia under the name of yarn. I have also learned that some years ago the Victorian Parliament granted a bonus of ,£5,000 on the local production of a given quantity of cloth, and that, according to a. fairly good authority, there is reason to believe .that the"" cloth in respect of which the bounty was paid was made from imported yarn.",28
169,Mr HUME COOK,FREIGHTS ON STATE,I admit that there was some suspicion of that.,28
170,Mr HEDGES,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"And there is grave suspicion that imported yarn is now being used for the manufacture of what is known as Australian cloth. The Committee ought to recognise that we are asked to agree to a vote that will increase the price of an article which is bought chiefly by the poorer classes. Doubtless the British manufacturers laugh at us, and say, "" These people think that cloth is being made in Australia, when, as a matter of fact, we are spinning the yarn with which that cloth is manufactured."" I hope that the Minister will consider this matter, and propose an amendment with the object of insuring that the whole of - the work involved in the making of Australian cloth shall be carried out in Australia. If we placed a duty of 5 per cent, or 10 per cent, on the manufactured cloth, and a duty of 40 per cent, on the yarn, I do not think that we should hear any more of the importation of yarns for Australian",28
171,Mr JOHNSON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"The local woollen mills say that, irrespective of the quantity which they spin for themselves, they must im""-* port yarn.",28
172,Mr HEDGES,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Then they are not making what is in the true sense of the term Australian cloth. I hope that the Committee wilt reduce this duty as much as possible, and that later on the duty on yarn will be increased. Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane) [4.48] I do not question the figures which the honourable member for Fremantle has submitted, but I would suggest to him that a solution of the problem is probably to be found in the fact that these yarns are - used very largely for the manufacture of stockings, sweaters, and other goods of that class. Mr JoHNSON -^-We want population, not protection. ' Colonel FOXTON - We need both. 'Unless I am very much mistaken, the whole 'of the yarns used by. the Ipswich Woollen 'Company-whic h is the only woollen fac'tory in Queensland-ar e spun by themselves. It is of np use to say that it is not Australian wool that is manufactured. I have been through the factory frequently. One can see there the wool as it has come off the backs of the sheep; and everything that it is necessary to do is done on the premises until the wool comes out in the 'shape of cloth, samples of which are now before us, and which are of a quality not to be be,aten anywhere in the world.",28
173,Mr MAUGER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Withi n a mile from this .building, some of the finest yarns in the world are being spun.",29
174,Colonel FOXTON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"As to the amend-ment immediately before the Committeefor the reduction of the duty to 20 per cent., with a view of making the duty on .goods from the United Kingdom 15 per cent - I say at once that' I am not prepared to go so far. The honourable member who has moved this amendment must surely realise by this time that it is futile to attempt such a reduction. If , instead of doing that, he and those who think with .him would join with those who are more moderate than the ultra-protectionists and endeavour to come to an arrangement to support less drastic duties, we should get on with the Tariff much quicker , Mr FULLER - If there are only three .or four members who think that duties should be reduced considerably, they are entitled to express their opinion.",29
175,Colonel FOXTON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"I quite agree with 'the honourable member, but to fight in order 'to be hopelessly beaten every time is futile. Personally, I am in favour of duties, of 25 per cent., and of 20 per cent, on goods imported from the United Kingdom. ' Mr Mauger - That is less than the protectionist members of the Tariff Com-mission propose.",29
176,Colonel FOXTON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"The A division of the Tariff Commission recommended a duty of 30 per cent., and, as most of these goods come from the United Kingdom, it may be said that the Government have practically adopted that proposal. But I am not prepared to'go so high. I think .that a duty of 20 per cent, against the Old Country is ample. It is 5 per cent, more than we had under the old Queensland Tariff, under which the Ipswich Company was established. It is also 5 per cent, more than the duty under the old Federal Tariff. Under the circumstances, I think that an increase of 5 per cent, in the duty would be sufficient protection, and' I intend to vote for that.",29
177,Mr STORRER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Bass) [4.54] - I do not dispute the accuracy of the statement of the honourable member for Fremantle, but I deny that our woollen, factories, as a whole, use imported yarns. I have been in several woollen mills and tweed factories, and know that they use none but Australian wool for the manufacture of their tweeds. I hold in my hand a declaration-signe d before^ a Justice of the Peace-by Mr. Robert Hogarth, proprietor of the Waverley Woollen M ill , Tasmania, in which he states that all his goods are made from pure Australian wool. He does not import any yarn. His factory has been established for thirty-three years. I have been through it several times, and have also been through several other mills which are conducted on the same principle. A number of honourable members went through some Victorian factories a little while ago, and are well aware that the process of manufacture includes dealing with the wool as it comes .off the sheep's back until it comes out in the form of the manufactured article.",29
178,Mr LIDDELL,FREIGHTS ON STATE,I suppose they had the whole thing readied up for the parliamentary visitors?,29
179,Mr STORRER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Does the honourable member for Hunter think that a factory is established at a cost of several thousand pounds simply to be seen by. halfa-aozen members of Parliament? I do not think that a firm would go to such expense, even with the object of pleasing parliamentary visitors. Because some persons find it advantageous to import yarns, that is no reason why all the woollen mills of Australia should be slandered.",29
180,Mr HEDGES,FREIGHTS ON STATE,Who did that?,29
181,Mr STORRER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"The honourable member said that the manufacturers imported their yarn, and simply made it up.",29
182,Mr HEDGES,FREIGHTS ON STATE,I said that yarns of a certain value were being imported.,29
183,Mr STORRER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"The honourable member stated that cloth was not made in Australia, but that the yarn was imported and made up. He afterwards qualified that statement to some extent. But I have seen the yarn"" made here. I have seen it made in the days when a spinning wheel had to be used, such as can at present be seen at the Exhibition. Not only do our manufacturers make yarn for the manufacture of tweed, but they also sell it to those who require it for different purposes in their own homes. Therefore, it is a pity that such an unwarranted reflection should be cast on the woollen mills of Australia. I am in favour of duties of 25 and 30 per cent., .as proposed by the Treasurer. that the Committee, will agree to those rates in order that more Australian wool may be manufactured in this country. I received only the other day a letter stating that only 1 per cent, of the wool grown in Australia was manufactured here. time we manufactured more than that. By imposing a fair duty we shall enable that to be done. The proprietor of the Waverley mill sends out a certificate with every five yards of material manufactured, stating that it is made from pure Australian wool. It would be a good thing if more honourable members would visit some of our woollen factories, and see for themselves what is being done in Australia.",29
184,Mr FOSTER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"New England) [4-59J-I was rather pleased to hear the statement of the honourable member for Fremantle, because I think that we require evidence of the' kind which he brought forward in connection with the Tariff. He is to be congratulated on giving the Committee such information, which undoubtedly came from a good source. He tells us that .£90,000 worth of yarn is imported. do not dispute the fact, but I object to the deductions which the honourable member sought to draw from it . The main deduction was, that because this yarn is imported, we ought not to protect our woollen industry. I hope that the honourable member was not serious in advancing that argument. If he examined the facts with more thoroughness, I think that he would urge the Treasurer to insist upon - a good, substantial duty. We can make cloth; and I think we should make all the materials of which cloth is composed. A story runs through my mind in connection with the woollen industry in America. There, a writer was such an ardent free trader that he got quite indignant over what he deemed the ridiculous action of < the American Government in allowing dirty wool to be imported at a lower duty than was clean wool. That man quite forgot thatemployment was required in America - that Americans desired to have the clean- : ing of the wool. But this man went f u r ther, and said fhat America was being ruined by the "" hoofed locusts,"" as he termed the sheep, who were said to be ruining the land. I am not an advocate of' importing d i r t ; and, therefore, I ask that yarn shall be manufactured here. In1905, Great Britain imported £ 7 0 0 , 0 0 0 worth of woollen rags-jrag s gathered in the slums of the Continent, and heaven I hope knows where. These rags were woven into the cloth which we buy as British tweed. .",30
185,Mr MAUGER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,We never hear of imported shoddy from honourable members opposite.',30
186,Mr FOSTER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"-We do not. HonorI t is able members opposite attack Australian industries; and it is just as well that they should be given these particulars - If honourable members expended as much ardour in exposing, imported shoddy as they do in talking about Australian-made articles, the result would be much better for our industries. I was delighted tohear the honourable member' for Brisbane say that woollen goods were manufactured within his State from Australian wool, and I have it on authority that all, or nearly all, the manufacturers in Australia make their own yarn. In England, the cloth makers do not need tp. make their 'own yarn, because it is turned' out by special mills. I must express my admiration for the - waly in - which the re-presentatives of Queensland fight for the industries' of their State; and I desire to I put in a little plea for a woollen mill in New South Wales. I have a letter, written, neither to me nor to a member of this House, but in the ordinary way of business, by Messrs. James Bergan and Sons,. woollen manufacturers, of Granville, New South .Wales, from which the following is an extractUnless the present Tariff on woollens, flannels, and blankets becomes law, we must close our mill. For the last ten years the woollen industry has been dead, so far as profit is con-; cerned, in New South Wales. "" Moderate protection "" is no "" protection."" A tariff, unless sufficiently high to check British and foreign imports, is, in the protective sense, inoperative, and, therefore, no aid to local industry. If we are to protect any industry, we certainly ought to protect the woollen industry, native as it is to the soil. Although I am an ardent believer in Australian tweeds, the number of patterns that can be turned out locally has come as an absolute surprise to me. My own . opinion is that if manufacturers would take more trouble to advertise and place their goods before the public by means of the tailors, the sale of Australian tweeds would be vastly increased. In important towns in New South Wales,' tailors are found to be without Australian tweeds, and customers are told that people will not buy them. What nonsense* it is to talk of people not buying goods which they have never seen ! Seeing that we produce all the raw material, the sooner we encourage the production of Australian tweeds, the sooner will people get good ancl cheap clothing in the place of imported shoddy.",30
187,Mr KING OMALLEY,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Darwin) [5.7]. - I agree with every word uttered by the honourable member for New England. Many years ago, in the United States, it was impossible to buy American cloth in any tailor's shop; customers were told that only imported goods were kept. The same thing is going on in Australia, and it would be worth our while to impose a duty of 15 to 20 per cent, to teach Australians to respect and love their own country. For my part,. I should make the duty prohibitive.",31
188,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Are the honourable member's hats made in Australia? Mr KING 0 | MALLEY - Yes ; the hats I now wear are made at the Denton H at Mills. Some of the finest woollen goods of this kind are made in Australia, but the importing habit has prevailed so long that people are ashamed to tell their friends that they wear locally-manufactured articles-it is deemed a sort of disgrace to be dressed in Australian material. I would make the Tariff so high that people would be only too glad to try Australian goods, when, I am sure, they would never dispense with them.",31
189,Mr JOHNSON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"But how could we make people who can afford to buy imported goods buy Australian goods ? Mr KING O'MALLEY - We all descendants of English, Scotch, Irish, German, and other people, who would climb a thirty-feet greasy pole to save a pound. Heretofore, the local manufacturers have had no chance; and now that we are putting on a Tariff, we ought to determine to make the people of Australia respect their own country. If we cannot make them respect it , we can make them obey its laws. M. JOSEPH COOK - What about MCKay case?",31
190,Mr KING OMALLEY,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"The world was not made in a day. MCKay will come in time to recognise that, to be a Christian man he must do his Christian duty in a Christian country. We ought to impose a duty on every article that can be manufactured in Australia, and thus enable Australian manufacturers to pay Australian wages, based on civilized conditions. The differentiation ought to be high enough to enable local manufacturers to compete against the cheap-jack wages paid in foreign countries. That is the kind of Tariff that I shall vote for. I am following the Government throughout these proposals. I only hope that the Opposi-. tion, staunch free-traders as many of them, are, will, like Saul of Tarsus, f all clown in front of the great light of protection,; and thank God for their conversion.",31
191,Sir PHILIP FYSH,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Denison) [5.11]. - Le t us attempt to get back to something serious; because we are dealing under this, division, which begins with woollen piece goods, with an enormous portion of the imports into this country. Taking our. total imports at about £42,000,000, and writing off .£2,000,000 for spirits and narcotics, and another £5,000,00 0 for free items, we get a total of £35,000,000 of dutiable imports. Under this division we, deal with one-fifth of those goods, for ;£7,000,000 worth of goods were imported last year in association with it. It is because we are dealing now with so large a proportion of our imports, and because the purpose of the Government is to add so seriously to the duty which is to be chargeable thereon, that I desire the attention of the Committee while I investi-. gate the figures given by the Treasurer. I was astonished when he told us that the reduction of 5 per cent, which he proposes to make in the rate proposed in the schedule will mean a reduction of £ 7 5 , 0 0 0 per annum in the revenue, and that the loss of revenue would be ,£125,000 per are annum if the proposal of the lionorable member for Lang - were accepted. I i m -. mediately went for my papers to see how far those statements are borne out by the actual circumstances of the case. The duty received last year, not on woollens only, but on the whole of the ,£7,000,000 worth of goods imported under this division, was £ 6 5 0 , 0 0 0 . I call attention to the great discrepancy between the actual facts and the statement which the Treathe surer, I think, fel l into an error in making. I understood him to state that a loss of j 'revenue to the extent of ,£125,000 would result if the proposal of the honourable .'member for Lang were accepted.",31

193,Sir PHILIP FYSH,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Then am I right .in saying that if the rate proposed the schedule is reduced by 5 per cent., doss to the revenue, according to the honfor - orable - gentleman, will be ,£75,000 ?",32
194,Sir WILLIAM,FREIGHTS ON STATE,LYNE - That is what - officers tell me.,32
195,Sir PHILIP FYSH,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"I am always sorry to find myself at issue with the surer, or with what his officers say, I am quite sure that in some of the culations made by the officers the figures failed. are dealt with in a manner which covers, .as I am' sure that the Comptroller-General now. would at once admit, a far larger area than the question before the Committee. again. We are dealing in this item with woollen piece goods only; but the whole division covers all classes of piece goods. The paid on the total value of the imports, for a great number of years. under a maximum duty of 15 per cent, the old Tariff, was, as I have stated, ^£650,000 last year, but in this one item the duty is increased to 30 per cent., or kinds of goods. doubled. The average rate of duty the old Tariff taken at 20 per cent, gives for Fremantle as to yarns. £^650,000, and 5 per cent, of the portion represented by the amendment of the orable member for Lang would be nearly ^£32,500 - Five per cent, of £ 6 5 would be only .£32,500. There is a great discrepancy between that and the Treadeed, surer's estimate of .£75,000. If the duction of the proposed duty by 5 per cent, will mean a loss of ,£75,000 to the revenue, then the revenue estimated to received from the whole of this for the current year must be nearly ,£1,500,000, as against £ 6 5 0 , 0 0 0 year. It must also be apparent Treasurer's estimate applies to the 'whole division, arid not only to woollen piece goods, which form but a small portion it. I have - previously asked the attenoperations tion of the Committee to the question of who is fo pav for the enormous increase in the duty from 15 per cent, to 3<T cent, on these goods.",32
196,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,The A section of the Tariff Commission recommended a duty of 30 per cent.,32
197,Sir PHILIP FYSH,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Only'one-hal f of' the Tariff Commission made that proposal. The whole of the manufactures of woollens in the Commonwealth are infinitesimal, and are likely to remain sd for years to come, as compared with the total, value of the goods imported under the whole of We are all proud that woollens are manufactured in Australia, but five-sevenths of the goods dealt with in in this division are cotton manufactures, the which cannot possibly be made here, and which there are no raw products here. Certainly not more than ,£2,000,000 worth my of the ,£7,000,000 worth of goods represented by this division come under the head of woollens. The other £5,000,00 0 Treaworth comprise cotton piece goods.

202,Mr SAMPSON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,The honourable member is referring to the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission.,32
203,Sir PHILIP FYSH,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"I quite agree with the conclusions of that section of the Commission. The protectionist section of that body recommended the imposition of a duty avhich cannot be supported by the evidence - tendered to it.' The manufacturers selves declared that they had done exceedVictorian ingly well under the operation of a 20 cent, duty, and that they merely desired .to be left alone. .

SMITH (Parkes) [5.25]. - The Committee must feel very debted to the honourable member for Denison for his level-headed exposition of the position of the woollen industry. So the debate has been of a very partial if not punished. ex parte character. One representative of Queensland, who is evidently displeased with the reflection that has been cast the purity of Australian woollens, has formed us that, in his own State, these goods are the pure merino. The honourable member for Bass, too, has assured us in Tasmania all woollens manufactured already locally are of pure quality. Now, we not wish to live in a fool's paradise, we certainly ought to face the facts of th"" case, which seem to be rather distasteful. I was very. pleased to hear the honourable this connection member for Fremantle try to prick - the bubble which has amused Victorian resiought to do so. dents for so many years- I refer to the idea that everything made in Australia in the way of woollens or flannels is of absolutely pure quality. A little study of. the tenderedto the Tariff Commission would disillusion them,. because we are assured by that body that, in some cases, Vicduct ? torian flannels have been found to contain as much as 81 per cent, of cotton. _ is the judicial finding of the Commission. Before today we have heard honourable members condemn the use offlannelettebehave cause it is a cotton manufacture. have affirmed that people ought to be compelled to use pure Australian flannel ference, to flannelette. Side by side with that statement, the claim has been advanced the Mr. that Australian flannel is absolutely pure and above suspicion. But in this conwhen nexion we have to recollect the finding a judicial body- a body which was applace pointed under Royal Commission, whose .members were under oath, and which took evidence under oath and weighed it judicithe ally in order to determine the facts. These themCommissioners have reported to us that woollens actually contain from per 15 per cent, to 81 per cent, of cotton.",33
205,Mr STORRER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,Some of the woollen goods produced in Victoria are pure.,33
206,Mr BRUCE SMITH,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"That may be so. a I am quite willing to believe that some manufacturers are so indifferent to competition and financial results that they use all wool in their manufactures. Looking at the matter from a commercial standwhich point, I should have expected those manuthe facturers who are condemned to use the pure article, and to compete with others who put from 15 per cent, to 81 per cent, of colton into their manufactures, to much inspeedily go to the wall.",33

But he is the sort of honourable member who needsto be warned against drawing false conclusions upon practical questions. We are living in a fool's paradise if we imagine that our woollen goods contain nothing but wool, especially in view of the report of the Tariff Commission that Victorian flannels in some cases contain as much as 81 per cent, of cotton. We have these very high duties claimed for Victorian products on the ground that the raw material from which they are made is on the spot. No greater fallacy was ever uttered, because if these' flannels or woollens contain so very large a percentage of cotton, that raw material comes from the United States of America. Some of us-and I include myself among the number, although I think I am not guiltv of the credulity which I am pointing out-ar e willing to put high duties on these goods on the strength of the old gag that the raw material is ""on the spot."" It is not on the spot. The honourable member for Fremantle has satisfied meas I think he must have satisfied every impartial mind in the Chamber-that no less than £ 9 0 , 0 0 0 worth of woollen yarn is imported into this country. Is it not a strange thing that in a country in which we are imposing these extraordinarily high duties, in order to encourage the production bf materials of which we imagine we have the raw material on the spot we are im- porting woollen yarn for the purpose? .",33

218,Mr STORRER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,It is not necessary for flannel.,34

I am aware that, as a free-trader, nothing I can say is likely to influence any protectionist votes on this matterI am not speaking with that object, but, at all events, I shall have the satisfaction of knowing that these misconceptions have been pointed out. The honourable member for Fremantle has already informed the Committee of the importation of a large quantity of yarn. When he first stated what was in the paper he was about to read, he was met with all sorts of ridiculous epithets; but when he went on to say that the statement he was about to make was confirmed and authenticated by the Comptroller of Customs honourable members seemed surprised to learn what he said. Whilst woollens and flannels locally manufactured contain this very large percentage of cotton, and a percentage, Avhether large or small, of imported yarn, we have woollen manufacturers inviting us to admit yarns free, in order that imported yarns may be used to a larger extent than at the present time. They are, at the same time, asking us to impose heavy duties on woollen goods, on the false assumption that fchey are being manufactured from our own raw material.",34
220,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,Yarn s are not free.,34
221,Mr BRUCE SMITH,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"No ; but the manufacturers are asking that they should be admitted free. They admit that imported, and not Australian yarns, constitute part of the raw material of their all manufactures, and they are now asking that they should be admitted free. One cannot help going back occasions of this sort to first principles, and inquiring how long this sort of thine is of to go on. We never hear any one refer that to the parents of families who have to buy tiousers, coats, and waistcoats for their boys, or. to the workmen who must buy their clothing. The consumer is never It referred to in this Committee, because honI orable members are concerned all the time of about the interests of the manufacturers.",34
222,Mr MATHEWS,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Oh , yes; we do talk of the workmen. We want to give them good wages. We are talking about that now.",34
223,Mr BRUCE SMITH,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"The honourable member for Melbourne Ports reminds me of the Irishman who thought to lengthen his blanket by cutting a piece off the botthat tom and sewing it on to the top. Does not the honourable member recollect that as after Mr Ramsay MCDonald, the-""British cotton. Labour member, returned from New Zeahe said he had found that in thai Dominion they had raised wages by 8 pei cent., but that at the same time thiey had raised the cost of living by 18 per cent. ? I point out to the honourable member that while seeking to secure high wages for the workman he and those who think with him are piling up these duties, and increasing the prices of the necessaries of life of the working classes. They are robbing Peter to pay Paul, and are merely taking the money out of one pocket to put it into another. I wish to know how long this is going to last. were imposed on woollens as far back as 1866, and a few years later I remember being told by protectionists that they did not want that kind of thing to cjontinue. They said they wished the Tariff to be used as a mother uses her hands under the armpits of her child to help it to walk, and that when they found they could toddle alone the duties might be withdrawn.",34
224,Mr SALMON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,When did the honourable member hear fhat?,35
225,Mr BRUCE SMITH,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"I heard that in 1866, and I have heard it ever since. It is a hollow argument; and I use that adjective as the one which best describes it. These industries have been established now for forty-one years, and they are still calling out for higher duties. child helped up to manhood by the support of his mother's or father's arms said, "" . I require stronger crutches now,"" he would be pronounced a cripple, and if the people engaged in these protected industries cannot, after forty-one years, by educating labour, importing improved machinery, and overcoming local prejudice, hold their own against importations from other countries, we should begin to consider whether they have not had a fair chance, and whether the unfortunate consumer should not be given some consideration.",35
226,Mr MATHEWS,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"We have had civilization for a good many years, but we still have the policeman.",35
227,Mr SALMON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,Does the honourable member think it is fair to use general arguments of that kind on this item?,35
228,Mr BRUCE SMITH,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"If the honourable member for Laanecoorie had been present to hear some of the other arguments addressed to the Committee on the item, he would know that I am merely answering them. It is not likelv that the amendment \vill be agreed to, but I think the Minister will find that a duty between that which he proposes and that suggested by the honourable member for Lang will be passed. I shall vote for the amendment of the honourable member for Lang, and, if it be not carried, for an amendment proposing the next lowest rate.",35
229,Mr CARR,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Macquarie) [5.40] - The honourable member for Parkes has given us a great deal of cry and very little wool. I desire that more wool shall be manufactured in Australia. The honourable member has put up a fight for the pauper indusDuties tries of Great Britain ancl their millionaire proprietors- I call them pauper industries because those who work in the factories are paupers. I wish to put up a fight for Australian industries. It is a shame that we who produce wool in such large quantities are compelled to purchase our woollen goods from abroad. The honourable member has stated 'that cotton is used by Australian manufacturers. If we need cotton we should be .able to import it free of duty; we should be able to import free everything that we cannot make here. But I cannot understand those who profess to view these matters from an altruistic standpoint arguing in favour of such conditions as obtain - in the older countries of the world. Do honourable members not 'know that those who work in factories at Home have to live in dog kennels, a family in If a each room? In such places as Huddersfield, and even in Edinburgh, families live in what are known as closes, which - sometimes occupy as much' as a square mile. Tenement houses, in rows of sixty, with spaces of 10 feet between them, sometimes accommodate a family to each room. Will it do Australia any good to assist the industries which give those people employment? What we should do is to build up industries in this country, and we can do so by imposing protective duties. Honourable members talk about the dearth of, and the need for increasing, population here. We now have an opportunity to increase it. Surely, if we can make anything, we can make woollen goods. It behoves us to try to do this, seeing that we need population-to get which we must provide employment-and that we are cut off from other parts of the'world. We, more than any other people, should busy ourselves in developing our resources so as to obtain some measure of independence. Are we to be ever the sucking child of Great Britain? Are we not now grown to sufficient stature to be able to control our own factories? I am ready to vote for higher duties on commodities which we can manufacture in Australia. We can remedy abuses here, and, no doubt, they will creep in ; but we cannot remedy abuses in other parts of the world. I am averse from supporting, more than we can help, industries which allow such abuses. The fine stuffs which we import now are the product of the flesh and blood of the women and children of Great Britain, and their manufacture has done much to undermine the stamina of the population of that country.",35
230,Mr REID,FREIGHTS ON STATE,It would be better if we could get more British blood into Australia.,36
231,Mr CARR,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"I am prepared to work for that. I put first the development of primary .production. I wish to see our primary resources still more full y developed. But how can anything be done in that direction so long as a body of landlords, sitting on the Opposition benches, defy reform ? In any case, we must tect ourselves from the cheap and bloodstained products of foreign countries..",36
232,Mr FULLER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,Are there no landlords and mining speculators on the other side of the chamber?,36
233,Mr CARR,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"-They are prepared to vote as I would vote, while the members of the Opposition are not. The honourable mem: ber for Parkes endeavoured, as usual, to depreciate. Australian productions; but, in speaking of the amount of cotton in Australian woollen goods, he failed to mention that the Tariff Commission recorded the opinion that the second set of samples obtained by the Customs Department was no more representative than the first set for the purposes of comparison, and that an exhaustive examination ""of imported flannels would, probably, disclose the fact that, on the whole, as much cotton is used in their manufacture as is used in the manufacture of the Australian article, while there is more shoddy in them. We are getting more shoddy and rubbish from abroad than we make here, because the devices for converting rags and tatters into cloth are better known elsewhere than they are here. We shall be able to control whatever industries we may establish here, the representation in Parliament being a registration of the sentiments of the community, and the public is against imposition and fraud being practised on either consumers or workers.",36
234,Mr SALMON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,Laanecoorie) [5.46] I am anxious that the Committee should come to a vote on this question.,36
235,Mr FULLER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,Why ?,36
236,Mr SALMON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Because I am anxious that Parliament shall, if possible, rise before Christmas.",36
237,Mr FULLER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,We should hear something from the Minister first.,36
238,Mr BRUCE SMITH,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"It wil l not matter to the honourable member for Laanecoorie' whether we do or do not rise at Christmas, because, as a Victorian representative, he will be on the spot in any case, whereas others will have to travel long distances to attend the meetings of the House.",36
239,Mr SALMON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"I have known instances in which honourable members responsible for the re-assembling of the House after Christmas have not attended its meetings, having remained on the mountains, or in a more pleasant climate than. Melbourne enjoys during the summer months.",36
240,Mr REID,FREIGHTS ON STATE,Are we not to reply to pro- aggravating speeches such as we have just heard ?,36
241,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,It was brought about by the aggravating speech of the honourable member for Parkes.,36
242,Mr SALMON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"I have no desire to cause irritation, and have largely refrained from taking part in the debates, not from want of interest in the principles to which I am pledged, but because I wish to shorten the discussion of the Tariff as much as possibleI am pledged to, and have done my best to support, protectionist principles, but I have felt that there are occasions when one can best do that by maintaining a discreet silence. With regard to the manufacture of woollens, there is one aspect of the question which I desire to put before the Committee. A pound of wool, when shipped from Australia to the Old Country, is worth about is., but on its return in the shape of cloth is worth anything up to 12s., the whole of the - added value having been given to it abroad. The primary producer is not materially benefited by the exportation of his wool instead of its manufacture here. He would receive more assistance if Australian manufacturers bought more of it , and if , instead of being compelled to submit to the temporary derangement of markets at Home, he could obtain a certain market here, and have the additional value to which I have referred given to his product in Australia. Nearly the whole of the added value is re' presented by labour. It is because I want to see the people of Australia, and those whom we hope to see coming here within the next few years, fully and lucratively employed, that I desire this added value to be placed on the article within the confines of the continent. Much has been said about the position which is occupied by the various woollen factories operating in Australia. It has been stated frequently that they are unable to immediately supply the orders submitted to them. The mills find themselves m that position mainly owing to the restricted output which they have. Honourable members have said, and said wisely, that the real problem is the question of patterns. Last week, I was surprised to hear an honourable member on the other side say that patterns are not originated here. That is not a fact, because I have seen very many patterns which have been originated in Australia at the suggestion, of those who supply the public with particular brands of tweeds. I am glad"" to see that the mills are taking up this question with very much greater vigour than they have displayed previously. They were conservative then, but they are prepared now to meet the popular demand, and the result undoubtedly will be a very much larger output.",36
243,Mr FULLER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,They have had designers here for years.,37
244,Mr SALMON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Las t week a statement was made by an honourable member sitting on the front Opposition bench that no patterns have been made in Australia. I contradicted the statement at the time, and can assure honourable members, from: personal knowledge, that a number of men are engaged solely in the work of designing, ancl that it is being carried out under most satisfactory conditions. With respect to the duty wihich is asked for, I have made very eareful inquiries, and satisfied myself that there is no hope of the mills getting the proper machinery which is necessary not only to cope with the demand which will arise but with outside competition, which will undoubtedly exist, unless we can secure to our own people the greater part of their home market. In these stances, I intend to vote for the duty as proposed by the Government.",37
245,Mr REID,FREIGHTS ON STATE,East Sydney) [5.53] - I must refer very briefly to the last two speeches. It is rather too much to expect the Opposition to sit silent while such wild statements are made as those uttered by the honourable member for Macquarie. What a grossly unfair thing it is to talk of the labour of Great Britain as pauper labour!,37
246,Mr CARR,FREIGHTS ON STATE,So it is.,37
247,Mr REID,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Suppose that a man gets a few shillings a week less than does ancrfher man-if he pays his way, is he a pauper? That is an odious term to apply to a man who has the misfortune to earn not so much wages as does another.",37
248,Mr CARR,FREIGHTS ON STATE,It is a reflection on Great Britain.,37
249,Mr REID,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"What has the honourable member to say about some workers who earn twice as much as do British workers, and spend all their wages in drink, and clo not pay their debts? Arethev not worse than paupers?",37
250,Mr CARR,FREIGHTS ON STATE,They cannot be counted by millions.,37
251,Mr REID,FREIGHTS ON STATE,Who would ascribe that character to the workers generally because one or two are guilty of such conduct?,37
252,Mr CARR,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"In Australia, they have not to live like dogs, anyhow? - Mr Reid - Why should the people of the Mother Country be branded by such an opprobrious epithet as that?",37
253,Mr CARR,FREIGHTS ON STATE,Because Great Britain deserves it .,37
254,Mr REID,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Is a man a pauper who earns his living as well as he can in his own country, and pays his way ?",37
255,Mr CARR,FREIGHTS ON STATE,They cannot pay their way.,37
256,Mr REID,FREIGHTS ON STATE,The honourable member is contemptible when he makes use of such epithets with reference to the .stock from which he comes.,37
257,Mr CARR,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"So is the honourable member, who is a much older man and ought to have more sense.",37
258,Mr REID,FREIGHTS ON STATE,It is simply a contemptible insult to the workers of the Mother Country.,37
259,Mr CARR,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"It is an insult to Great Britain, I admit.",37
260,Mr REID,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"No man is a pauper who pays his way and keeps out of a Benevocircum- lent Asylum. How can the honourable member fairly apply such an epithet to any man who pays his way honestly and gets, the best wages that the circumstances of his country will admit of ? The representatives of labour should be the last to so brand workers, whose only reproach is that, amongst the millions who live in that little spot-, they cannot get the splendid wages which prevail in newer countries. Is it their fault that their wages are lower than those, which obtain in newer countries ?",37
261,Mr CARR,FREIGHTS ON STATE,Certainl y not.t,37
262,Mr REID,FREIGHTS ON STATE,The term is not a proper one to be applied to any man who pays his way.,38
263,Mr TUDOR,FREIGHTS ON STATE,Surely it is the fault of the legislation which allows them to live like that!,38
264,Mr REID,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"That is another matter. No working man who pays his debts ought to be' branded as a pauper. It is a gross slander to utter,.and I cast it back in the teeth of the honourable member for Macquarie, who ought to be^ashamed of using such an expression with reference to millions of the class which he is supposed to represent. It is quite true that the piece rates in the woollen factories of Australia are 50 per cent, higher than the rates in the' Mother Country.",38
265,Mr MATHEWS,FREIGHTS ON STATE,Then they must be bad there.,38
266,Mr REID,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"That may be. The machinery used in the Mother Country is infinitely superior to ours; and with that machinery much more than the 50 per cent, difference in the piece rate is earned.",38
267,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,Vicars ' machinery is as good as any machinery that can be found.,38
268,Mr REID,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"I am not talking of Mr. Vicars, to whom I gave a start with his blanket contract.",38
269,Mr FULLER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,An' d he is at Home getting the last developments in machinery.,38
270,Mr HUME COOK,FREIGHTS ON STATE,He is back.,38
271,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"W it h the machinery, too.",38
272,Mr REID,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"-He is a credit to the manufacturers of Australia. When I was at the head of a Government in New South Wales, he came to me and said, "" If you give me a five years' contract I will ask you for no protection. I will put down a plant to make colonial blankets out of colonial wool."" I decided in favour of competition, and he won against the whole world.",38
273,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,H is evidence bepublic institution? fore the Tariff Commission does not show that.,38
274,Mr REID,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Onl y yesterday I received a letter confirming what I have said here able member had better consult on a previous occasion. I suppose it will be admitted that in the Mother Country they have rather better appliances in these beside me. great industries than a young country like ours can have. Although the rates lower there, still the earnings of the people in the woollen factories are not so bad. Let us compare the wages of adult males ancl females in the Mother Country the wages of adult males and females in, say, the Victorian factories. The figures show that there is nothing of the pauper about the hands in the Old Country. An adult male in Huddersfield will earn 30s. a week, as against 37s. a week earned by an adult male in Victoria. And an adult female operator in Huddersfield makes from 20s. to 23s. or 24s. a week, as against about the same - rate here. We have had gross exaggerations about the condition of the workers in the Old Country. I-ask any reasonable man how he can expect the workers-crowde d in a territory comprising 120,000 square miles, and containing a population of 42,000,000 men, women and children-to be as well off as the comparatively small number of workers",38
275,Mr MATHEWS,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"We do not expect them to be. MT. REID - Something will happen to the honourable member if he does not wait until the person he wants to interrupt has finished his sentence. Compared with our enormous territory of 3,000,000 square miles, we have amere handful of workers,' and any attempt to compare the wages of the workers of the two countries is, I think, most unfortunate. Whether a man is getting high or low wages, if he pays his way, and does not go on the State, he ought not to be branded as a pauper.",38
276,Mr SINCLAIR,FREIGHTS ON STATE,Why should it be an unfair comparison if they are both producing the same class of material?,38
277,Mr REID,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"I mean that it is an insulting sort of comparison which treats the workers of England as if they were paupers, because they cannot get better wages than they do. It is an odious expression to apply to any man who works for his living honestlv and pays his way. That is what 'aroused my indignation.",38

279,Mr REID,FREIGHTS ON STATE,Nothin g of the kind. Mr - MALONEY - Then the right honorMulhall.,38
280,Mr REID,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"I must not speak too positively, because I have not the figures It is absurd to make any statement without reference to the authori-are ties, but I know that no man can describe the millions of persons who are employed in the factories of England as if they were in the position of paupers. The honourable* with member for Laanecoorie spoke of the added value which would be given to Australian wool by a development of our woollen industries. I am sure that he spoke at randomj because if we can use only a small quantity of the wool which we produce, the price of the article is governed by the world's market, and not by our market.",38
281,Mr SALMON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Las t year we imported £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 worth.",39
282,Mr REID,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Suppos e that we used in our factories 100 times more wool than Ave do, and that our AVOOI clip was twice as much as that which Ave used in our - factories. The fact that Ave used half of our clip Would not affect the price of the wool by one farthing. the same Will Avheat, as the honourable member, who represents a farming constituency, must knoAv. If Ave do not produce enough Avheat for the Australian market our farmers have the benefit of a protective duty, but if Ave produce tAvice as much as treatment-^ Ave require for local consumption every buyer' of Avheat in the country markets quotes not the local price governed by the Tariff, but the Avorld's price, governed quotations outside Australia.",39
283,Mr SALMON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,The more wheat Ave use in Australia the steadier will be the price in Australia.,39
284,Mr REID,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"I do not object to that proposition. I see Avhat the honourable member means. When he referred to "" the added value "" he had in mind the added value given to the article by manufacture.",39
285,Mr SALMON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Hear , hear. - Mr Reid - The remark is proper one. We all desire that our manufactures should flourish. The only question is as to Avhat is a fair thing tAveen the factories and the public Avho have to use the fabrics made up by those factories. As long as we keep those two points steadily in view and do not think of the one and forget the other, Ave shall be likely! to arriA'e at a satisfactory determinarays tion Will regard to this matter. I admit that the lines on which the Opposition go are lines which my honourable opposite could never folloAv. chasm which divides us, although Ave have both the same aims. But the Opposition not accept the vieAv adopted by the honorhas able member for Macquarie. His idea building up the primary industries of tralia is to build up the city industries high protective duties, the brunt of has to be borne, not by the protected industries but by the unprotected consumer. seems to me to transpose the argument. It is a case of talking about the roof instead, of the foundations. As a nation rises in. greatness it grows in the higher forms of human industry. But the foundations of a nation are - always to be found in its forms of primary industry-the forms of industry closely, associated Will its natural resources. My idea is that these high protective duties wil 1 handicap the primary industries of Australia. They will make them less attracti\'e and make the town in-, dustries more attractive, and that is the very process which I belieA'e to be Avrong. When Ave come to the duties on mining maonechinery AAt'e shall have to choose between the manufacturers in the big. cities and those. It is just Avho use Avhat they produce.",39
286,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,I have already made that choice.,39

296,Mr REID,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"That is an axiom from South Melbourne. We shall inscribe it on that pinnacle of materialistic vapour. If we cannot carry the amendment moved by the honourable member for Lang, I hope that, at all events, the duty will be reduced, because the history of these duties is not encouraging. When we look at the records we find that these industries flourished less when the duties were higher. When we agreed, in 1901, to a duty of 15 per cent, on woollens, we were told that it would spread ruin among the woollen factories of Australia. Since then the number of hands engaged in the woollen industry has been very largely increased. The mills, I am told, cannot supply for months ahead orders that have been given to them.",40

298,Mr REID,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"I know that the honourable member has a lot of information which we - do not possess in regard to these industries. I sympathize with them very much; but we have also to sympathize with the public. I hope that no cotton is used by mills of which the honourable member knows anything. Instead of the duty of 15 per cent, having ruined the woollen mills, we find that they have now more orders than they can supply.",40
299,Mr WYNNE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,That is not so. - Mr MATHEWS - They have had offers at a price.,40
300,Mr REID,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"I am talking not of offers, but of orders, which are something very different. A man might be offered a ridiculously low price, which he would not accept, 'but I am speaking ,of orders that have been accepted.",40

I think, perhaps, that an individual case illustrating that might be interesting to the Committee. It is typical of a large number of these outwork cases, but it may be interesting.",40
313,The CHAIRMAN,FREIGHTS ON STATE,Does the honourable member intend to connect his remarks with the item now under consideration?,40
314,Mr COON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"I wish to show the condition of the workers, under free-trade, in Great Britain. I wish, also, to show that it is necessary to have a protective duty for the benefit of our workers.",40
315,The CHAIRMAN,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"I would point out to the honourable member that he would be in order in referring to the wages paid to operators in the woollen industry, but that we have already dealt with apparel and attire, to the making of which the figures quoted by him relate.",40
316,Mr COON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Shoul d I not be in order in showing the condition of the workers under free-trade in Great Britain? We are now seeking to increase protective duties, and I am showing reasons why they should be' increased. I find that there are at least 14,000 workers in Great Britain who are working seven days a week.",40

319,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,Perhaps to Australia.,41
320,Mr COON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"The ' right honourable member for East Sydney has referred to the textile workers. We do not want to have in Australia the condition of things exist ing in England with regard to that trade. The report of the Chief Inspector of Factories and Workshops in Great Britain for 1906, page 244, shows the wages paid in the industry. Spinners receive 8s. 9d. per week. In Australia, theyreceive from 30s. up to £ 2 . Layers receive 6s. 6d. per week, and other workers as little as 3s. n d . per week.",41
321,Mr FULLER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,What are they making?,41
322,Mr COON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"All kinds of articles, I suppose. Where our workers receive 32s. a week, similar employees in Great Britain are being paid 9s., ios., and us.",41

326,Mr FULLER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,They are fined here in just the same way.,41
327,Mr COON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"A girl gets ns. a week, with a bonus of 2 s. per week if she is not a minute late on any day; and if she should be a minute late, she has, as I have explained, to pay a fine of 2d., before she starts work. The honourable member for Macquarie is quite correct in bringing this matter before the Committee. I am prepared to meet the honourable member fairly and squarely in assisting in any effort to . improve the condition of the workers. We should try every method to prevent our workers being employed under similar conditions. The sweating that prevails in Great Britain today is deplorable; and, much as we may desire to give a preference to goods imported from the Old Countrv, we must insure that our workmen and workwomen do not have to compete against the goods of those who pay_ their employees only 9s. a week, whilst our manufacturers pay them 32 s.",41
328,Mr CARR,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Macquarie) [6.14] - I desire to clear the air a little in regard to the construction placed by the"" leader of the Opposition upon what I said a little while ago. With that aptitude for which he is so famed, he twisted my remarks into a misrepresentation of my meaning.. He knows as well as I do that to speak of "" pauper labour "" is to use a well understood economic term, and conveys no reflection upon the labour fer se, although it mav be a reflection upon the conditions : which make it imperative for people to work for wages which force them to live in a state of pauperism. The fanfare of the right honourable member-o r the. pyrotechnical display with which he favoured the Committee-were simply indulged in with a view of diverting the attention of honourable members from the solemn and sorryfacts which I brought under their notice. The right honourable member, I think, traduced, the dignity of the Committee when he proceeded to ridicule statements which showed how the life-blood, of human beings and the welfare of the nation are concerned in such facts as have been disclosed to honourable members. Then, again, the right honourable member twitted, me with placing secondary industries before primary industries-wit h putting the roof on before the foundation of the building is laid. But he knows better, than any one present how difficult it is to stimulate the primary industries of this country, thwarted as we are by landlordism and by the abominable land laws of the States. It is for that reason that we cannot deal with our primary industries as we can with our secondary industries. As we cannot legislate with regard to the land as I should like to see it dealt with, we are compelled to do what we can to develop our secondary industries. The attitude of the right honourable member is that of one who has apparently grown weary in well-doing and upon whom the lassitude of age has fallen, so that if we adopted 'his point of view we might assume to be written up over the portals of Parliament, '' Abandon hope all ye who enter here."" Are we to refrain from doing anything to improve the condition of the people of this country because the leader of the Opposition is tired? Are we to make no political move forward and to say that there shall be no experimental legislation because the leader of the Opposition is weary of well doing? If the right honourable member had seized the opportunities which presented themselves to him in years gone by, Australia would have been in a better position than she is in today. He might have placed himself at the head of the democratic forces of this country, instead of attempting to block their path. Instead of endeavouring to keep back the march of democracy, he might have been the manWho makes by force-his merit known, And lives to clutch the golden keys, To mould a mighty State's decrees, And shape the whisper of the throne. But instead of that, we have him supporting a policy' which would degrade the worker, and put a stumbling block in the path of the young Australia party which is trying to improve the condition of the people. The right honourable member might surely find some more useful scope for the exercise of his abilities than in endeavouring to prevent us from doing what we desire to do for the development of Australia. We, I take it , are here toRing out a slowly dying cause, And ancient forms of party strife; Ring in the nobler modes of life With sweeter manners, purer laws. That is what I meant by the remarks to which the right honourable member has taken exception.",41
329,Mr SAMPSON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Wimmera) [6.20] I think that in laying down a policy for this country, it may be profitable to look to the condition of affairs that obtains in other countries. What Tariff has been found necessary there in order to establish their industries? In Canada, according to Kelly's Tariffs of the World, the duty on woollen clothing is from 25 to 35 per cent., and in the United States from 40 . to 50 per cent., while the duties in both France and Germany are very high. We are only a young country, and, in' laying the foundations of the Tariff, we ought to draw some valuable lessons from the experience of older countries.",42
330,Mr TILLEY BROWN,FREIGHTS ON STATE,Has able member any figures showing the comparative production ?,42
331,Mr SAMPSON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Any such comparison would be in favour of the country which produces least. After all, fortunes are not made on high prices, but on the general turnover. Importing houses in Australia have succeeded, in many instances, in making large fortunes, not because of excessive prices, but because of an immense turnover. I find from the report of the Tariff Commission that we import ,£2,000,000 worth of piece goods per an 7 num.. The protectionist section of the Tariff Commission say that if the whole of these goods were made in Australia""we should be employing full y 10,000 men, as compared with only one-fifth of that number employed at the present time.",42
332,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Hear , hear.",42
333,Mr SAMPSON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"We may also learn valuable lessons from a! comparison between the wages paid in Great Britain and the wages paid in Australia. I thoroughly agree that we should avoid casting any reflection on the older countries, especially on Great Britain; but still we ought to profit by experience in our endeavour to secure better conditions in Australia. The protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommended a duty of 40 per cent, on clothing, but the Committee agreed to a duty of 40 per cent, for the general Tariff, and 35 per cent, as against Great Britain. In the case of blankets, the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommended a duty of 25 per cent., whereas the Committee agreed to a duty of 25 per cent, general Tariff, and 20 per cent, as against Great Britain.",42
334,Mr WATSON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,There is a great difference between blankets and tweed.,42
335,Mr SAMPSON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"I quite agree with the honourable member; a duty of 20 per cent, on blankets is as good protection as 40 per cent., or probably 50 per cent., in the case of clothing. In the present instance the Government proposal is a reduction of 5 per' cent, in the duty as against Great Britain; and that is consistent with the recommendation of the protectionist section pf the Tariff Commission.",42
336,Mr WATSON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"The Government proposal is fo place dress fabrics on the 15 per cent, scale, and that makes a lot of difference.",42
337,Mr SAMPSON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"That I quite understand; this may be a technical, matter, the honor- but the proposal seems worthy of favourable consideration, though how far I may be able to agree with the proposal I am not prepared to say at this point. These are my reasons for voting for duties of 30 and 25 per cent.; and my action is consistent with my votes on the items of clothing and blankets. Whilst I have not been able to follow the Commission in every instance, I think that in this case their recommendations are worthy of consideration ; and I shall vote for a reduction of 5 per cent, in favour of Great Britain in this and other instances in this item of - woollens.",42
338,Mr FULLER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Illawarra) [6.25J - I fail to see any justification on the part of either the Treasurer or his supporters for doubling the duty on the item under consideration. No arguments have been submitted to justify the action of the Treasurer; but it would appear that arguments are of no use in this Committee. Seeing that the Treasurer has failed to justify his action, I invite the Postmaster-General, who has been continually interrupting, to show some grounds for the increase of duty.",43
339,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"I have justified my position absolutely. - Mr FULLER - The Treasurer has justified his position just as much as he has in regard to other items. The Postmaster-General is a well-known protectionist, and has been secretary of the Protectionist Association of Victoria for years. According to his interjections he knows all about the woollen tirade of Victoria; and I think' he ought, under the circumstances, to show some reason for the duty which the Government propose. The honourable member for Bourke, who is the Government whip, has been in close association with the Postmaster-General in fiscal matters'; and from that gentleman,- too, we are entitled"" to some off again. statement. - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - The protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recomor mended a duty of 30 per cent.",43
340,Mr FULLER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"I regret exceedingly that the Chairman of the Tariff Commiscent. sion is not here to justify his position, cause his absence prevents those who took an opposite view from speaking as strongly *s they otherwise might do. The free-trade section of the Tariff Commission were quite prepared to sign a report which gave a fair presentation of the case to Parliament the country, but they could not possibly a report which did not honestly do so. Under the circumstances the free-trade secbe tion were forced into drawing up a report their own.",43
341,Unknown,FREIGHTS ON STATE,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.45,43
342,Mr FULLER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"The two - sections of the Tariff Commission brought up separate reports on the question of woollen piece goods. In consequence of the evidence and the whole position not having been, in opinion of the free-trade section of the Commission, placed full y and fairly in the Chairman's report, we felt bound to bring up a report showing what we considered to be the true position of the woollen industry in Australia. I desire to draw - attention to the position of the. industry before Federation. The Victorian witnesses before the Commission made very strong representations that the industry would go down unless the duties were restored to the rates at which they stood years ago under the Victorian Tariff. The .industry in Victoria had the advantage of very high protection for a great number of years. The men who shrieked out loudest for protective duties for the benefit of the Australian woollen industry were those Victorians who had had the advantage of high duties in the past, and it was only because the Victorian manufacturers approached those of Tasmania, South Australia, and New South Wales, that the latter fell into line with the request of the former for higher duties. As I stated before on the question of apparels and textiles, the Committee is entitled to know from the Treasurer why, in the first instance, he proposed a higher protective duty than the highest asked for by the manufacturers who came before the Commission.",43
343,Mr TILLEY BROWN,FREIGHTS ON STATE,Simpl y to take it,43
344,Mr FULLER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"It . m a y be so, but, if so, it is not a fair thing to the Committee to the country. '- The very highest duty on this item a'sked for by any witness before the Tariff Commission was 30 per The Treasurer did not even attempt beto justify his proposition for higher duties, nor have any of his supporters done so. Mr Grainger, who was the principal witness for the Victorian Woollen Mills before the Commission, admitted that the history of the industry during the whole of and the period before the advent of the Comsign monwealth Tariff had not been very encouraging, most of the mills having had to reconstructed at one time or other, while of some had gone out of existence. That was under the high protective duties of the Victorian Tariff. The figures quoted p.m. to-night by the honourable member, who moved to reduce the proposed duty now under discussion, showed clearly that during the time those high protective duties were in existence fewer operatives were employed in the Victorian woollen mills, but the that under the operation of the Federal Tariff, which is the lowest that the Victorian woollen mills have had, the number of operatives reached its maximum. The names of at least four mills which had gone out of existence under the Victorian Tariff were mentioned to the Commission. Does the evidence of Mr Grainger and other representatives of the Victorian woollen mills furnish any reason why the Committee should agree to the high duties now proposed by the Treasurer? On the contrary, even since the comparatively low duties in the first Commonwealth Tariff were imposed, the Victorian mills have been working full time, their employees are receiving today - higher wages than ever they received during the whole previous existence of the mills, and everything, according to the evidence submitted to the Commission, shows that instead of agreeing to. a proposition for higher duties, we should, at any rate, grant none higher than those imposed by the Tariff of 1901. I wish to quote .figures to show the number of hands employed in the Victorian millsin given years. I quoted the same figures in connection with employment so far as apparel and textiles were concerned, but honourable members, and the public generally, ought to know these figures, because they show that as the duty decreased more hands were emploved in the woollen mills, not only of Victoria, but of Australia. They are as followKate of Year. duly. 1878 11 per cent. ... 736 1881 165 per cent. ... 1886 22 per cent. ... 1887 22 percent. ... 1889 33 per cent. ... 1890 33 per cent. ... 33 per cent. ... 1892 ... 44 per cent. ... 552 There was an immediate reduction from 791 to 552 the moment the duty was increased by 11 per cent.",43
345,Mr MATHEWS,FREIGHTS ON STATE,Does the honourable member infer that the increase of the duty was the cause of the decrease in the number of hands employed ?,44
346,Mr FULLER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"The honourable member need not look so self-satisfied. I know as well as he does that there was in Victoria a boom which burst, and I am prepared to ascribe as much to that cause as the honourable member is, but these facts appear right through the figures long before we come to the boom time- . 1893 ... 44 per cent. ... 1895 ... 44 per cent 1899 ... i6£ per cent, to ... 27I per cent. There was a great decrease in the duty in that case, but the number of operatives increased considerably.",44
347,Mr WISE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,Because times had improved very much in Victoria.,44
348,Mr FULLER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"They have continued to improve very much, so far as the woollen mills are concerned, underthe lower duties of the Federal Tariff1903 ... i6£ per cent. ... 1,013 That is the largest number of operatives employed in the Victorian woollen mills' during the whole of their existence. It is' marvellous that under the lowest duty which has been applied to the industry for many years, as compared with duties nearly four' times as high, there has been such an increasing number of operatives employed in those mills. I put that contention forward, and claim that the Treasurer, or someother member of the Ministry, is entitled to answer it. The Treasurer may put it . down to boom times or anything else, but there are the facts. Before the Committee votes for the high duty asked for, the position which I have put forward should be answered. Something has been said of the' woollen industry of New South Wales.",44
349,Mr WH IRVINE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,Of course there are later figures available.,44
350,Mr FULLER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"But I am not in possession of them. Reference was made by Hands the honourable member for New England to employed. a woollen mill at Granville. Had he known 776 anything about the gentleman who is con-, 780 ducting that mill he would scarcely have 704 quoted the latter when he did. Mr Bergan 841 did not appear as a 'witness before the' 810 Tariff Commission, and it is well known 791 that at various periods his establishment has been closed: When I say that I have said as much as I ought to say upon the floor of this House.",44
351,Mr FOSTER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,The honourable memberimplies that Mr Bergan did not speak the truth.,44
352,Mr FULLER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,I do not say that. It is a matter that I trust the honourable member will make inquiries into.,44
353,Mr STORRER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,I think that any manufacturer was foolish to appear before the Tariff Commission.,44
354,Mr FULLER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"A manufacturer was absolutely foolish to appear before the Commission if he expected the whole of its members to accept as gospel every word that he chose to utter. The reason underlying all 639 the noise which was created in Victoria in 690 reference to the Commission was that its 917 . members insisted upon learning something about the industry in which the manuMills, facturers who gave evidence were interested AVe desired to see their balance-sheets and to ' learn whether the industry was propresented gressing.",44
355,Mr MATHEWS,FREIGHTS ON STATE,It s members were like the nasty Labour Party-the y wanted to know something.,45
356,Mr FULLER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"That was the reason the manufacturers did not like to appear before the Commission, and that is the rea15 son, why the honourable member for Bass deat clares that they were foolish to appear bein fore it.",45
357,Mr STORRER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"They were foolish to do so, because they were not believed when they spoke the truth. . Mr FULLER - We absolutely believed them when they spoke the truth, but when upon cross-examination they were not able to substantiate their statements we refused to accept them as gospel. It has <;aid that the woollen industry in New South Wales was practically killed under freegaged trade conditions. In answer to that statemuch ment I would point out that Mr Vicars' establishment-and he is the biggest woolto do so? len proprietor in New South Wales-ha been in existence for a great number years. Those honourable members who saw the exhibits of his tweed at the Royal Agricultural Show in New South Wales will admit that he displayed the finest samples of tweed manufactured in the Comasked monwealth. It is all very well for the Treasurer to say that the industry was killed in New South Wales under free-trade conditions. But his statement the fact that in addition to Mr Vicars' mills, the Parramatta Woollen Mills and on One the Coverwul Mills at Bowenfels running. Mr Vicars himself stated in evidence that prior to Federation his firm In hacl ma:de profits, though they were not of altogether satisfactory. I would further point out that he was able to send his wrotegoods into Victoria when a duty of 25 per industryI cent, was operative here.",45
358,Mr BRUCE SMITH,FREIGHTS ON STATE,The honourable memhaving ber will never persuade Victorians of that.,45
359,Mr FULLER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Some of the Victorian manufacturers today are feeling the pinch spinning, of the competition from. New South Wales. I wish now to refer to the condition of the woollen industry . since Federation. One would imagine from the statements which are made in various quarters that in quence of the operation of a duty of 15 per cent, the industry was languishing. But Mr Grainger, of the Ballarat Woollen himself admitted that the inaugura- tion of Inter-State free-trade had benefited his firm. Indeed the whole of the evidence by the Victorian manufacturers was to the effect that they had derived a very great benefit from the establishment of Inter-State free-trade by reason of the extended market which was made available to them. Mr Grainger statedThe effect of the reduction of the duty to per cent, had been to cause them to look very much sharper after their affairs, to work increased pressure and to turn out more goods order to decrease the cost of production. The fact is that under the high duties which had been previously levied in Victoria, the woollen manufacturers of this State had become very careless in the management of their businesses. They had allowed their machinery to become obsolete. The result of the opening of the Australian markets, in spite of the reduction of the duty to 15 been per cent, from the high duty previously in force in Victoria, was that those enin the industry had to look very sharper after their affairs and to work at increased pressure. Why had they It was in order to enable s them to supply the larger demand for of their goods. To-day a number of the woollen mills in Victoria, as well as in other parts of Australia, are unable to supply the demand for their goods by merchants and retailers. Mr Grainger was if he had any explanation to offer as to why certain Victorian mills, which had enjoyed. so large a measure. of protection under the State Tariff, had ceased to is refuted by work, and he saidreason was that the industry was carried more irregularly and without that dash which are still now characterises it. his report for 1903, Mr Ord, the Inspector of Factories in Victoria, speaking the position ,of the woollen industry, have again to report that the woollen trade has been exceptionally busy during the whole of this year, an average of 300 workers been constantly employed in one of the mills. In my last report I mentioned that additional machinery had been brought from England. A complete set of carding, combing, and winding plant has .been added during the year, together with new machinery throughout various departments of the mill, and the business is extending to the other States, clearly showing that theTe is an increasing demand for woollens of Colonial manufacture. conseWhen Mr Grainger was asked whether that portion of Mr Ord's report was correct, he said it correctly represented the position. The factis that - ever since the establishment of Federation Mr Grainger's company have been paying good dividends.",45
360,Mr WYNNE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Thei r capital was written down by one-half, and the original shareholders lost their money.",46
361,Mr FULLER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"I do not wish to take up the time of the Committee in going into the lengthy examination of the witness on that point by the Tariff Commission. The honourable for Balaclava is specially interested in one woollen mill in Victoria, and if he looks up the evidence taken in connection with the matter to which he* refers, he will find that it was very full y and carefully inquired into. The question arose whether the capital of the company was .£30,000 or .£60,000. Mr Grainger hedged on that question from start to finish, but finally was brought to admit that on the subscribed capital of ,£60,000 the dividend paid worked out at' i \ per cent.., and that on the paid-up capital of ,£30,000 it worked out at 15 per cent.",46
362,Mr SAMPSON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"They wrote down ,£30,000.",46
363,Mr FULLER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"They paid l \ per cent, of the Commission. on ,£60,000, whereas the real dividend paid by the company was 15 per cent, a paid-up capital of .£30,000.",46
364,Mr STORRER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,Did they pay dividend every year?,46
365,Mr SAMPSON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"They paid no dividend, for ten years.",46
366,Mr FULLER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,I ask the honourable member for Bass whether he has read the evidence given by Mr Grainger in conin nexion with that matter?,46
367,Mr STORRER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,Yes .,46
368,Mr FULLER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Then I ask the honorBergan, able member whether I am not right in the contention that a dividend of 15 per cent, was paid on the paid-up capital of £30,000 ?",46
369,Mr SAMPSON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Does the member suggest that the dividend was 15 for per cent, over the whole term of the operaoccasion tions of the company ?",46
370,Mr FULLER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"No , since the imposition of the duty of 15 per cent, under Federal Tariff.",46
371,Mr SAMPSON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"That is to say that the company have paid a dividend of 15 per cent, on the paid-up capital for the last six years ?",46
372,Mr FULLER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"I will nojt say six years, because at the time the Tariff Commission took the evidence to which I have referred, six years had not elapsed from the estabat lishment of Federation.",46
373,Mr SAMPSON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,Then five years?,46
374,Mr FULLER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"The Tariff Commission is not sitting at the present time, and the Treasurer should be able to give the Committee the information. He should be able to tell us what Mr Grainger's mill is paying in the way of dividends. _ Does the honourable gentleman know whether the Ballarat mill is languishing for a lack of member the higher duties he proposes?",46
375,Mr BRUCE SMITH,FREIGHTS ON STATE,The Minister knows no moie about the matter than does the man in the moon.,46
376,Mr FULLER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,And the honourable gentleman does not want to know any more about it .,46
377,Mr CROUCH,FREIGHTS ON STATE,It seems to me that the evidence was not sufficient to justify a conclusion in either direction.,46
378,Mr FULLER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,The honourable member for Corio is a laiwyer. and if he had read the evidence he would have come to the same conclusion as I did. Mr CROUCH.;-Perhap' s from the demeanour of the witnesses; but not from the sworn evidence as it appears in the report,46
379,Mr FULLER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"From , the evidence given on by Mr Grainger himself. So far as the New South Wales mills are concerned we that had evidence that the 15 per cent, had little or no effect on the industry in that State. They had been getting on practically as well without any duty as with the duty of 15 per cent, under the Federal Tariff. I have mentioned that it was onl y consequence of the Victorian manufacturers approaching Mr Vicars, of the Marrickville Mills, Mr Blackman, and Mr. to whom I have already referred, that they came into line with the Victorian manufacturers in requesting the imposition of high duties. What Mr Vicars said was thathonorable Although the duties have been in existence nearly four years, this is practically the first when we have had a taste of protection so that we do not quite know what will be its ultimate effect. the He had been carrying on the industry in free-trade New South Wales, had done a big business, and his business was improving. The honourable member for Mernda gave us the information this afternoon that Mr Vicars had recently come back from a visit to England. Every one knows what his business there was. It was to secure improved machinery to put into his factory Marrickville, and we all wish success to his venture.",46
380,Mr CARR,FREIGHTS ON STATE,In view of the increased Tariff ?,47
381,Mr FULLER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"No . In view of the way in which he had been able to carry on his business under the old Tariff and of the way in which he found he could carry .it on in New South Wales without - protection. We had evidence from Mr C. E . Moore, a South Australian witness, that the progress of the industry in that State was ;not due to the Tariff at all. They found 'that they had been carrying on the business under an old and obsolete system, and they changed their system, with the result that 'today in South Australia Mr Moore, the principal woollen manufacturer in the 'State, is carrying on the industry successf u l l y , and, according to his own evidence, fus success is not to be attributed to the 'duty.",47
382,Mr BRUCE SMITH,FREIGHTS ON STATE,The 'member will never persuade a protectionist that any industry can be carried on without coddling of some kind.,47
383,Mr FULLER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"I am giving honourable members the evidence of Mr Moore himself. He puts it down, not to duties, but to changes of methods of manufacture. So far as Tasmania is concerned, the manu""facturers there have stated that a duty of 20 per cent, is high enough for them, and that they do not desire the high rate asked for by the Victorian manufacturers.",47
384,Mr BRUCE SMITH,FREIGHTS ON STATE,It is those who use obsolete machinery who want protection.,47
385,Mr FULLER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Honourable members generally must admit that the Tasmanian factories are flourishing and prosperous. It has been said in this chamber, and oublished in the press, that, in consequence of the substitution of the old Commonwealth duty of 15 per cent, for the Victorian duty, the Victorian mills largely changed their output from tweeds to flannels ; but statistics do not bear out that assertion, because there was a large falling off in the production of tweeds in Victoria more than a year before the Commonwealth Tariff was introduced, the Victorian out^put of tweeds in 1899 being 1,051,832 yards, and in 1900, only 971,267 yards.",47
386,Mr CROUCH,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Victori a agreed to Federation in 1899, and anticipated then the destruction of her industries.",47
387,Mr WYNNE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Some qf the mills went - in for the production of worsteds, because of the large bonus offered by the Victorian Government for the manufacture of that article.",47
388,Mr FULLER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"I do not pretend to be thoroughlv conversant with the relations between the Victorian Government and the local woollen mills, but the figures which I have quoted disprove the assertion-that it was in consequence of the introduction of the first Commonwealth Tariff that the Victorian mills began to produce flannels rather than tweeds. As a matter of fact, the mills now manufacturing flannels have more work to do than .they can perform, and will not take orders, commissions given to them six to twelve months ago being yet unexecuted. What justification is there then for the proposed increase of duty ? The honourable members for Batman and Macquarie spoke of the difference between Ihe rates of wages here and those prevailing in the Old Country. I shall not deal with what was said about pauper labour, because those statements have been finally honourable answered. According to the Statistical Register of New South Wales, the rates of wages in that State are similar to those in Victoria, the average wage being 20s. 5d. in New South Wales as against 20s: 9d. in Victoria. Since Federation, the tendency has been for wages to f all in New South Wales, while in Victoria, under the operation of the Wages Boards, they have risen slightly. Still, we may take it that in the two States the prevailing rates are practically the same. Examined on the subject' of"" rates of wages in the woollen industry in the Old Country, Mr C. J. Ripley, a Sydney warehouse manager, gave evidence which the protectionist members of the Tariff Commission were unable to upset. He saidYou have been informed that Australian, rates of wages are 50 per cent, higher than those ruling in Great Britain, but it is not so. Two years ago I was speaking to some of the largest manufacturers in Great Britain, who showed me their wages sheets, and I am convinced that there are plenty of mills turning out the same kind of material as is made in Australia, whose rates of wages are not 10 per cent, below the Australian rates. The hours of labour in this industry are in Australia forty-eight, and in Great Britain fifty-six per week, the-difference being equivalent to eight weeks in the year. The free-trade members of the Tariff Commission, after careful consideration of all the circumstances, reported thatIn every £100 worth of goods produced in 'Australia the value of the labour is £30 as against ^20 paid by the British manufacturer. Therefore,' on an extreme estimate, the total Australian labour disability is not more than io per cent, of the value of the goods produced. t u t t in g it in another way, from a protectionist stand-point, and ignoring the natural protection of freights, a duty of 10 per cent, on the goods in question would equalize all the alleged disadvantages of the Australian manufacturer in respect of higher wages and shorter hours. The protectionists who came before the Commission admitted that the manufacturers here enjoy a high degree of natural protection, especially in connection with blankets, by reason of the freight, cartage, insurance, and other charges which, have to be borne by importations, so that with the 15 per cent, given by the former Tariff, their total protection amounted to at least 40 per cent. Yet the Minister, without the slightest explanation, has asked the Committee to increase the duty by 15 per cent. The whole of the evidence which was given to the Tariff .Commission does not justify for a moment any proposal to increase the duty of 40 per cent. On the contrary, it shows that our woollen mills are in a flourishing and prosperous condition..",47
389,Mr TILLEY BROWN,FREIGHTS ON STATE,And they do not want establishing.,48
390,Mr FULLER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"I ask the Minister to stand up and give a reason for granting any more protection. As I am reminded by my honourable friend, the woollen mills do not want establishing, but are in existence and doing well. What necessity, then, is there for the higher duty proposed? I do not wish to go into the various matters which I discussed in connection with the manufacture of blankets. alleged disabilities in connection with the manufacture of woollen, goods applied in connection with the manufacture of blankets, which is part of our woollen industry. There were enumerated five disabilities, which I shall state shortly. In the first place, it was claimed that, with regard to the buying of the raw material, the conditions here are unfavorable. Now, is there any unfavorable condition in that respect, so far as the Australian woollen manufacturer is concerned ? Has a single honourable member to-night referred to that in any way ? Is there a representative on the Ministerial side of the chamber who can stand up and prove that an Australian manufacturer is placed ""in an unfavorable position as compared with his English competitor ?",48
391,Mr CROUCH,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"It seemed to be so from the evidence, except in the case of one South Australian manufacturer. Does not the honourable member think that?",48
392,Mr FULLER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"No . The whole of the evidence shows that, so fa r as the purchasing of the raw material is concerned, our manufacturers occupy a more favourable position. Certainly, when we remember that the English manufacturers get their wool from Australia to a very large extent, have to pay ocean freights, insurance rates and all the other charges incidental to its transportation, have to manufacture the. wopl, and pay all the various charges on"" the transport of the manufactured article to Australia, it will be recognised, I think, that that natural protection against the. British competitor ought to be sufficient for any manufacturer in Australia. It has also been claimed, on behalf of the Australian' manufacturer, that he has to pay higher wages to men who, in their turn, work shorter hours. I have shown fro m the figures I have quoted that the total disability in connection with those two items is j i o per cent.",48
393,Mr REID,FREIGHTS ON STATE,On the value of the goods?,48
394,Mr FULLER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Yes ; and if we add 2 per cent, for equipment, 12 per cent, is the total disability under which the Australian manufacturer labours. It was also claimed that he is handicapped by local prejudice. That is said to be a great factor against the use of Australian goods. But it is well known that that prejudice is - fast disappearing. Before the Tariff Commission"" we had evidence from the manufacturers that it is' fast disappearing. We know that all patriotic Australians are only The too glad to use the Australian manufacture if it is anvthing like up to the mark. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Unfortunately , we have only a few patriotic Australians among the gilded roosters.",48
395,Mr FULLER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"We have a few, and I do not know whether my honourable friend who talks so much about "" gilded roosters "" is wearing a suit of Australian tweed tonight.",48
396,Mr KING OMALLEY,FREIGHTS ON STATE,I am.,48
397,Mr FULLER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Is the honourable "" member ?. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I hope so; at any rate, I asked for Australian tweed.",48
398,Mr FULLER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Thos e are the five disabilities under which Australian manufacturers are supposed to labour. I regret having taken up so much time, but this is a very important item, and, as has been pointed out, the division involves a matter of £ 7 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 . That, as compared with the total revenue, is a very big: proportion indeed. Outside the manufacturing classes which exist in our large towns, and live under good conditions, and whose emplo)'es enjoy all the advantages of social life, do not honourable members think that we ought to have some regard for the numerous consumers in Australia? Do they not think that we ought to consider all the men who are engaged in the great primary industries of wool-growing, agriculture and mining? Are those men to receive no consideration from the Committee? It has been stated here time after time that the men who are developing the industries which have made Australia what she is, have received very scant sympathy indeed, and that the whole consideration has been given to putting on high duties in order to make our rich manufacturers richer than they are, to put money into the pockets of men who, when they went before the Tariff Commission, and were subjected to cross-examination , were not able to substantiate their claim, and were afraid to produce their balance sheets for inspection. If they stood in the position which they would have us believe they occupy, they would have been only too willing to allow us to see their balance-sheets, and prove that they were in a languishing or strangled condition. But as they were'afraid t q take that course, it convinced me, and it must satisfy every thinking man in this community, that they are doing so well that they do not want to let us know their exact position. those circumstances, I think that the Committee, instead of raising the duties to the higher percentages which the Treasurer has proposed, will vote for the duties which have been recommended by the honourable member for Lang. In voting for the higher duties they will be raising a wall, not against the foreigner, but against the old Mother Country.",48

He would like to rush through the Tariff in one night, and then to go to the people and boast of how he had "" bulldosed "" honourable members. I have a duty to perform, not only to my constituents, but to all the people of Australia. I recognise that, apart from the manufacturing element in Melbourne and Sydney, there is a vast population engaged from one end of Australia to the other in developing our labour of great natural resources. Whilst. I am a member of this House, I shall be prepared to do what is right so far as the manufacturing - section of the community is concerned, but, at the same time, I shall see that the people who are developing the great resources of Australia get a just deal. As a member of the Tariff Commission, I gave this matter the most careful scrutiny, and since the manufacturers absolutely failed to prove that there was any justification for higher duties, I feel that I am justified, in the interests of the great masses of the people, in voting for the lowest possible duty that I can secure.

417,Mr MALONEY,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Melbourne) [8.53] I move That the following new paragraph be inserted : - "" AI . Piece goods, woollen or containing wool, viz., women's and children's dress goods not weighing over 4 ozs. per square yard, :ui val. (General Tariff),- 20 per cent.; (United Kingdom), 15 .per cent."" The amendment which I now move differs from that of which I have given notice in one or two particulars, which I will explain. It proposes an increase of 5 per cent, against the foreigner, whilst the duty in regard to the United Kingdom would be the same as under the old Tariff. Perhaps honourable members would like me to indicate to what goods the amendment will applv. I will not attempt to explain them; I will simply give the names of the goods. They are-Bengalines , cashmeres, cashmerettes, cheviots, clan tartans, crepalines, cordehines, chenilles, crepe de Chine, dress, serges, dress tweeds, delaines, French flannels, hopsacks, lustres, nun's veiling, Silicians, taffetas, voiles, and winseys. These goods all contain more or less wool. It is very difficult to see how to differentiate between the heavier textiles worn by women and the lighter textiles, such as men. use in our northern latitudes-in . QueensNOES. land and Northern New South Wales. I think it would be better to take an example, from the United States Tariff, which, I . dare say, honourable members will agree is,perhaps, more systematic than our own, and, it may be, a little more scientific. I propose to quote a fewfiguresto show that what I propose is a light duty in comparison with that charged in the United States. Tellers : I quote from the Shipping World Year Book, page 1443. Notwithstanding the high duty in America 45,000,000 square PAIRS yards of these light materials were imported from Great Britain. If the cloth is of the value of is. 8d. per yard, the duty is is. 4jd. per lb., with 50 per cent, added; and I think the honourable member for East Sydney will agree with me that our duties are very, mild in comipari-. son. In the United States, if the value is from is. 8d. to 2s. n d . per yard, the duty is is. iod. per lb., with 50 per cent, added, and if over 2s. n d . per yard the duty is is. iod. and 55 per cent. To show, how careful the Customs authorities are in LYNE) the United States, I may say that in regard to women's materials, if they are of the value of 7&d. per yard, the duty is reduced from is. 4^d. to 3^d. per lb., with 50 per cent, added, and if the value is over 7 Jd.' per yard, the duty is reduced to 4d. per* lb. with 50 per cent, added. But recognising the difficulty, which honourable members will admit, if the square yard of material does not weigh more than 4 oz. it is admitted in the United States at the reduced rate, and that is in accordance with the amendment I have moved.",51
418,Mr CROUCH,FREIGHTS ON STATE,How does the duty proposed by the honourable member compare with the duty in the United States?,51
419,Mr MALONEY,FREIGHTS ON STATE,The duty I propose is very mild in comparison.,51
420,Mr CROUCH,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Could , the materials not be manufactured in Australia?",51
421,Mr MALONEY,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"It would be absolutely impossible to manufacture the materials here, not because there is not the ability, but simply because it would not pay to do so. in Canada they have modelled their Tariff in this connection on that of the United States. But in the former case the weight of the stuff is reckoned at 6 oz. for the square yard, which admits of a larger range of material than in the United States. In Canada the duty is 17^ per cent, as preference to the United Kingdom, the intermediate duty is 22J per cent., and the duty against the outside world is 25 per cent. It will be seen, therefore,, that the duty proposed is that levied by Canada against the outside world. journalistic lady, who has gone into this matter, has supplied me with some data, and as she puts the matter more trenchantly than I could, I cannot do better than read her wordsWomen's dress goods- I asked Lincoln Stuart to give me an estimate for a coat and skut, saying that I absolutely refused to take any material which was not of Australian manufacture. They could not take my order, had nothing in stock, and thought that I would find 1 the material, of which a small quantity has been turned out locally, quite unsuitable for summer wear. I then asked to see some Australian tweeds or serges for men's suitings, and was offered a choice of more than a hundred very attractive patterns of beautifully finished tweed. Buckley and Nunn were also unable to give me anything for my own wear, but would make me up anything from their stock of men's tweeds. But I want something cool and light, and also less expensive than the men's stuff, although it seemed to me to be excellent value for the price asked. So, not being able to afford the really good Australian product, there is nothing left me, but to buy a woollen material, .which never has been, and most likely never will be, made here, and pay the extra cost. I did not confine my inquiries to the city shops, I tried Geo. Stirling and Sons, and Love andLewis, in Richmond, so as to get a fairly representative idea of how. all sorts and conditions of women fare under the Tariff. .At the last-named place, I was shown dress lengths, of which an enormous quantity are sold, and the price has ad'vanced from 7s. 6d. lo ios. With reference to the dress stuffs question, it appears that because our mills have been able lo turn out an excellent suiting for men which pays them well, every woman in the Commonwealth is to be penalized, though she is not even given the chance of refusing the local product. The reasons given for the infinitesimal output are as follows :-The fashions change so rapidly, that it is only the great European manufacturers, - with their enormous production, and practically world wide markets, who can afford the expense . involved in the multiplicity of patterns, designs, and colours, which have become a recognised necessity of even the lowest priced goods. America, in 1905, imported from Great Britain and Europe 45,000,000 square yards of dress material, and as her fiscal policy cannot possibly be construed into a leaning towards foreign products at the expense of her home industries, this fact may reasonably be considered to have some bearing on our Tariff. Buckley and Nunn's manager assures me that the Albion Mills' representatives f u l ly recognise the fact that in the interests of the wage-earners there ought to be a difference in the duty upqn men's tweeds and women's dress stuffs, in favour of the latter, and more, they are prepared to support such a proposition. I am sending; in concrete form, the Tesponse to my'request at Buckley's for patterns. The Australian material is not procurable, except in the shape of a suiting tweed, whilst the choice offered by the imported goods speaks for itself. My observations, necessarily limited as they have ""been to a couple of hours' time, point strongly to one conclusion. The retailers are practically unaffected by the duty. Clothes will continue to be bought, and the woman who goes A shopping with 20s. of her husband's wages in her purse will hand it over just the same. The difference will be that she will get very much less for it than she used, which inevitably means, in the case of diminutive incomes remaining stationary, much real hardship and privation.",51
422,Mr CROUCH,FREIGHTS ON STATE,Does the honourable member mean to say that the Geelong mills cannot turn out women's dress goods ?,52
423,Mr MALONEY,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"I do not say that the Geelong mills cannot turn out ladies' dress goods, but they cannot turn out the variety that fashion dictates. Fashion is queen; and I suppose there as many patterns as there are inhabitants of the United Kingdom. None of the materials to which I refer could possibly be manufactured in Australia. WOMEN'S DRESS STUFFS. The question of the duty on these goods is so involved with the woollen industry as to necessitate its discussion in connection with the conditions now prevailing in that trade. On Saturday last, I went over the Albion and Union Mills, Geelong. The former turns out travelling rugs and tweeds, the latter confines itself to the manufacture of blankets and flannels. Both establishments are making additions to their buildings, for the installation pf new plant. The manager of the Union M ill informed me that he did not in the least fear the competition of the imported article; that a steadily increasing demand for his goods had set in, and his mill is working at high pressure to fill orders. The duty just agreed upon, from his po'nt of view, is eminently satisfactory. At the Albion M ill , an immense variety of men's tweeds were in process of making, and the manager told me that every six months between two and three thouspnd new patterns and designs were originated and made up. I asked what he could show me that would do for dress material, and he produced a pattern of a coarse, loosely woven white serge, suitable for seaside wear, as the so.le product of his recognition of women's sartorial needs. When, however, he showed me the - process of manufacture, and explained to me the time, expense, and labour involved in the setting of a pattern, I did not wonder at his preference for making men's suitings. He lold me that the manufacturers in the European centres, holding, as they do, the trade of the world in dress fabrics, are able to turn out, comparatively speaking, a mile of stuff, where an inch would suffice in Australia. And that is all the difference between profit and loss. At the best, he could not expect to sell more than fifty yards of each pattern he made, and the expense of altering his cear every time he put on a fresh design would be prohibitive. This confirmed what I had been told by Buckley and Nunn's manager, and I then inquired what chance there was of fine cloths such as are used for opera coats and mantles being made here. He said, "" None, for many a year to come."" As to Astrakhans, sealettes, and materials which are extensively used for trimmings, he was"" emphatically of the same opinion. There an aspect of the proposed duty, so far as it - affects wage-earners, which I think is deserving of some consideration. I have not been able in the time at my disposal to simplify the information given, but will submit the available particulars. turers of the Continent. .An immense number of women and girls' are employed in making up women's clothing, underwear, dresses, blouses, mantles, Amongst the firms who have launched out extensively in this way are Messrs. Foy and Gibson, Ball and Welch, Robertson and Moffat, Robson and Bussell, and Buckley and Nunn. honourable member for The number of hands employed, and the amount of wages paid by the latter firm for the year, ing the Government. according to the return furnished under the tories Act, is available, and will serve as index to the proportions which the industry has reached. I am informed by experts that the Australian workers are second to none in world. But if the raw material which forms the basis of their employment is heavily the manufacturing firms will be compelled close up this branch of their business, and port the ready-made garments from Great Britain and Europe, which the lower standard wages prevailing there will enable them to do at a profit. Anything less than a margin 15 per cent, on apparel and attire as with woollen piece ""goods will conduce to this course. Regarding the difference in the wages paid here and in England, the manager of the Albion M ill told me that operatives here, ing the statutory number of hours, receive per week, as against 16s. and iSs. for the same gether. work and longer hours in the British mills. There are 300 women and girls employed by Messrs. Buckley and making women's apparel. wages for the year 1906 were £""9,066. I am informed that there are thousands of pounds' worth of goods in bond both here and in Sydney, and that those to whom they are indented will not feel inclined to pay if what they consider a .prohibitive duty is charged on the woollen stuffs.

I am glad that that is so, because, if they did not, the honourable member would probably not have carried it, good as it is. It was very instructive to. listen to the honourable member's statement about the lady who brought this trouble under his notice. Some protectionists have the idea that they have only to impose a. duty of 30 per cent., and the problem of Australian industry is solved. The honourable member quoted the case of a lady who is an enthusiastic protectionist, and has the strongest possible aversion to wearing anything that is not made in Australia. She made a tour of all the shops, from Buckley and Nunn's to those in Richmond, in her frantic endeavour to get a piece of Colonial tweed that she could have made into a summer dress. In spite of her enormous efforts, she had to admit",53
432,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,Le t us take a division.,53
433,Mr REID,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Nothin g of the sort.' The honourable gentleman is becoming wonderfullv impatient. If we had gone to a division ten minutes - before we did we should have won on the last occasion. We had several members away whom we could not pair, but we will have a recommittal c f that line, which will play the part played by salt in the old Tariff. This case .affords an instructive example to us of an Australian lady anxious to wear an Australian dress, but unable to obtain a suitable material owing to a number of trade difficulties, which even the most enterprising and intelligent manufacturers cannot overcome. Indeed, it is well known that manufacturers, even in the Mother Country, with their marvellous powers, cannot compete with Continental countries in certain lines. It was proposed by the Government to impose a duty of 30 per cent, on dress materials of a. kind which could not possibly be made here-thereb v placing a heavy handicap upon the women of Australia. This is a class of light dress stuff which is absolutely necessary in this warm climate. How could we expect the women of Australia to wear Colonial tweeds on a summer day like this? Even the Treasurer has been ill all day in consequence of the suit that he is wearing. The honourable member for Parkes, who has a new suit of Colonial tweed, has been suffering in like manner. It is a grand material, but a little heavy for summer. I am glad that this proposition has been made, and that the Government .have accepted it.",53
434,Mr THOMAS,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Barrier) [9.14] - I desire to propose an amendment to make these goods free of duty. I have listened with the greatest possible pleasure to the honourable member for Melbourne, who has. made out a very strong case for the articles to be free. No one would accuse him of being a free-trader. He is a protectionist of the protectionists, and he has told the Committee that these articles cannot be produced here. A duty, therefore, cannot be in any way protective, but must be merely for revenue purposes.",54
435,Mr WH IRVINE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,Does the honourable member for Melbourne say that the goods cannot be made here?,54
436,Mr MALONEY,FREIGHTS ON STATE,Not under present circumstances.,54
437,Mr THOMAS,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"The honourable member went so far as to state that the British manufacturers were unable to make some of the materials which were produced on the Continent. If it is impossible to make them in England, it is reasonable to suppose that, for a time at least, it will be impossible to make them in Australia. The honourable member for Melbourne has stated that he would be prepared to advocate the admission of these articles free if it were [207] not for the Braddon "" blot."" What the Braddon "" blot "" has to do with the question of free-trade or protection, I cannot understand, especially in view of the fact that the honourable member is in favour of direct taxation. I - therefore move That the amendment be amended by leaving out the words '* ad valorem (GeneTal Tariff), 20 per cent.; (United Kingdom), 15 per cent.""",54
438,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,Hume-Trea surer) [9.19] - I hope that honourable members will not agree to place these articles upon the free list. The duty proposed by the honourable member for Melbourne is merelv a revenue duty,54
439,Mr TUDOR,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"What was the rate, which was previously operative?",54
440,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"It was 15 per cent. The honourable member for Melbourne merely proposes that the duty shall be 20 per cent, against the foreigner, and that the old rate shall operate in regard to the manufactures of Great Britain.",54
441,Mr FRAZER,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"But the Treasurer admits that it is merely a revenue duty, and not a protective duty. Sir WILLIAM LYNE , - It is a revenue duty, no doubt. I am willing to meet the honourable member for Melbourne by substituting 5 ozs. for 4 ozs.",54
442,Mr MALONEY,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Would it not be better to make it 6 ozs., as is done in Canada!? '""Sir WILLIAM LYNE ; - No: -''The moment that I give way in the slightest degree, the honourable member asks me to go further. ' '",54

444,Mr CARR,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Macquarie) [9.21] - As a protectionist, and not a revenue tariffist, I shall vote for these items being placed upon the free list. The proposal of the honourable member for Barrier offers a splendid opportunity to those honourable members who are always so solicitous for the welfare of the working classes to give effect to their protestations. I was selected as a protectionist, with the reservation that there should be no revenue Tariff so far as I could prevent it. I regard this proposal as one of the most effective means for bringing about direct taxation, which will accomplish that which the honourable member for East Sydney has so much at heart, namely, the development of our primary industries, and which will avert the possibility of our being called upon to establish industries with pauper labour to compete with the pauper labour of other countries - as he himself said we should have to do.",54
445,Mr REID,FREIGHTS ON STATE,East Sydney) [9.23] - The statement which the honourable member has just made is a repetition of a despicable calumny which I long ago refuted. I regret that he should begin his career as a member of this House,55
446,Mr CARR,FREIGHTS ON STATE,The statement is upon record in Hansard.,55
447,Mr REID,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"That does not sanctify the calumny by any means. So far from my attitude having been that which the honourable member has suggested, it was that, in view of the fact that labour in Australia is paid rates so much higher than those which obtain elsewhere- a fact in which I delighted- I did not wish to see it placed in competition with the poorer classes of labour in the older countries of the world. I looked upon Australian labour, devoted to the development of Australian natural resources, as being sure of maintaining its happy pre-eminence. I looked with apprehension upon the prospect of Australian labour competing with the labour of Belgium, and with labour even in the Mother Country, which-accordin g to the statements made by honourable members this evening-is paid an altogether inadequate wage. It is my abhorrence of low wages which has kept me free from these industrial experiments. I hope that the honourable member will abstain from adding fresh circulation to despicable calumnies which put men in the light of being destitute of proper feeling for their fellows. I do not think my public career has put me in that light before the people of Australia. Mr W' H . IRVINE - The calumny has been refuted over and over again.",55
448,Mr REID,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"It has been refuted over and over again, and I regret that the honourable member for Macquarie should have stated it again.",55
449,Mr CARR,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Macquarie) [9.25] - I must, of course, accept the right honourable gentleman's withdrawal. I read the statement in Hansard. I read that the right honourable gentleman used the words that in the plenitude of time, when our millions shall have become tens of millions, we shall have a crop of misery which will enable us to compete with the pauper labour of the Old World.",55
450,Mr CROUCH,FREIGHTS ON STATE,That is what was said absolutely.,55
451,Mr REID,FREIGHTS ON STATE,I L is an absolute twist of my words in a published statement. Words were taken out in order to give the statement that complexion. It was an absolute forgery on my published statement.,55
452,Mr CARR,FREIGHTS ON STATE,I quite understand that the right honourable gentleman is able at once to appreciate anything in the nature of twisting.,55
453,Mr REID,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"I thank the honourable member. He will gain a very unenviable reputation very soon. - Mr HUGHES (West Sydney) [9.26] I rise to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Barrier. I cannot for the life of me understand what possible excuse a protectionist Government can find for proposing the imposition of such duties as these, nor can I discover what excuse a free-trader can offer for voting for them; nor, further, what possible excuse the members of the party to which I belong can put forward for doing so. I see absolutely no justification for the proposal. It was stated before the Tariff Commission and in this House, and it is very obvious, that it is quite impossible to produce these - goods in Australia in any extent or variety, whilst they must be regarded as. the raw materials of a dozen or more industries. They are. necessaries to, I suppose, ninety-nine one-hundredths of the population of the Commonwealth. To impose such a burden as was contemplated by the Government in submitting duties of 35 and 30 per cent, on these goods is, on the face of it, outrageous. Now the Treasurer says that he is prepared to reduce the proposed duties to 20 per cent, and 15 per cent. The duty can be proposed for no other purpose in the world than that of raising revenue, and I venture to say the honourable gentleman will raise abundant revenue from his so-cailled protective duties. It is one of the most astounding things in the history of economics, and especially in the so-called non-experimental legislation, that it is impossible to put duties up sufficiently high to prevent the importation of certain articles. Let honourable members consider the revenue that is derived through the Customs of the United States of America, where the duties imposed are, as the Treasurer told us the other night, like grown men compared to children when contrasted with the duties imposed under our Tariff. Yet, as a matter of fact, in the Unifed States they find it almost impossible to deal with the surplus revenue that comes into the Treasury. They have a pension fund revenue away. there which has Leen growing each year, and, notwithstanding the fact that sioners in the ordinary course supposed to die, these become more vigorous and more numerous each year. would be well, in the interests of the dustries of the country and in the interests of the consumers, who form the bulk the population, to place these articles the free fist. Some of them were forhe merly dutiable at 5 per cent. I see denims were, though I do not know whether they are, included in piece goods.",55
454,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"No , they are not.",56
455,Mr HUGHES,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"I remind honourable members that the higher the duties imposed upon these articles the higher will be duty required on the finished articles the manufacture of which they are used. The manufacturers will say, "" If you not let us have our raw material free, must ask you to impose heavier duties the finished articles."" In connection this item we have an opportunity to every one in Australia fair consideration, in the circumstances I shall certainly to have these goods placed on the free list.",56
456,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Trea surer) [9.30] - Before the question is I should like to say that I realise that "" large extent but not wholly these are revenue duties. If honourable members will look the wording of the item they will notice the phrase, "" Piece goods, woollen or ' taining wool."" The goods are then dethe scribed and the reference to "" 5 ounces"" is to provide that they shall not contain much wool. I recognise that in the ordibers, nary sense these are revenue duties rather than protectionist duties, but I point .that to admit them free of duty would volve a loss of revenue to the extent £200,000 a year.",56
457,Mr WH IRVINE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,What was the total amount of revenue collected under this item last year?,56
458,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"The item as presented in this Tariff is subdivided - what differently from the way in which was included in the old Tariff. I may say that about £7,000,000 was the value of these imported piece goods, and I am informed that the goods included in this item were responsible for £200,000 duty. That being so, it is rather a serious thing to propose that these goods should be admitted free. I do not in this instance [207]- 2 speak from the stand-point of a protectionist, but we cannot afford to give all our",56

460,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"That estimate It is made up of parts of a number of other inestimates. The estimated loss of revenue to which I have referred is not my own. of The Comptroller-General of Customs, from on whom I have frrade inquiries, tells me that estimates that to admit these articles that free would involve a loss of £200,000.",56
461,Mr THOMAS,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Barrier) [9.33] - Hon orable members can all the more readily vote for the free admission of these goods in view of the statement just made by the Treasurer. During the last New South the Wales elections the State - was placarded in with references to the high taxation imposed by the Federal Government as comcanpared with the small amount of taxation we imposed by the State Government. The on State Government complained of the vast with sums of money that were in consequence give being placed in the hands of the State and Treasurer. As a result, I understand that vote at the present time in New South Wales it is proposed to abolish the State income tax, or at least to raise the amount ex- empted from taxation to £[1,000. That put proves that we are raising too much money to a. through the Customs, and are consequently handing over too much to the States Goat vernments. The Treasurer has admitted that these are not protective but purely conrevenue-producing duties, and he is asking Committee to agree to them merely for the purpose of raising £200,000 through too the Customs. I trust that honourable memand especially those who are (protectionists, will not support the Treasurer's out proposal. There are members of the Cominmittee who describe themselves as "" demoof cratic protectionists."" They say that they are prepared to impose even prohibitive duties on goods which can be manufactured in Australia, but that they are prepare""!! to allow articles which cannot be manufactured in Australia to come in free pf duty. In somedealing with this item, an opportunity is it afforded those honourable members to show that they are true to their platform pledges.",56
462,Mr MALONEY,FREIGHTS ON STATE,As a free-trader the honourable member should vote for the free of admission of everything.,56
463,Mr THOMAS,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"I have voted for the free admission of articles on which purely - revenue duties were proposed. Three or four years ago I voted for the free admission of practically every article. When ever now I have been told that a duty is merely revenue producing, I have voted for the lowest possible rate. The Treasurer has admitted that the articles to which this duty applies, cannot be manufactured here, and so, too, ihas the honourable member for Melbourne, a protectionist of protectionists, who has been referred to by the Postmaster-General, himself a leading protectionist, as one of the moat scientific and able protectionists in Australia. being so, I appeal to those protectionists who on the platform have again and again stated that they are prepared to allow to come here free goods which cannot be. manufactured in Australia, to vote to allow these, goods to be admitted free. The honourable member for East Sydney has pointed out on many occasions that the burden of high duties falls mainly on the shoulders of the poor, and in days gone by, it was his great triumph that he was able to largely re- increase? move them, and, by imposing direct taxation, to make the rich bear their share. I am glad that today he is prepared to take similar action, and to lift a burden from the even, I take it , at the risk of allowing the imposition of direct taxation.",56
464,Mr REID,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"East Sydney) [9.37] - I am not concerned with the motives of honourable members who vote for low duties, or for the remission of duties to deplete the revenue. If they can get a majority of the electors to agree to some policy which they favour, they will be able to give effect to it , whatever the state of the revenue, while if they cannot secure a majority, eifect cannot be given to it. But in any case, no one need have any anxiety for the revenue. If I were a member of the Labour Party, and regarded the depletion 'of the revenue as the shortest road to direct taxation, I should not vote steadily fov rates which will increase our Customs returns by - £2,000,000 a year, which seems to be the probable result of' this Tariff. Members of that party may sincerely believe that by increasing duties they will diminish revenue; but the experience of the United States of America, which is very instructive on this point, is that, notwithstanding rates almost twice as high as the highest here proposed, the Customs returns became so enormous that the authorities - did not know what to do with the money, with the result that their infamous pensions system was established, under which from 150,000,000 dollars to 200,000,000 dollars a year are being paid to the grandchildren of those who fought in the war forty vears ago, - and there are now more pensioners than there were ten years after the war»",57
465,Mr MALONEY,FREIGHTS ON STATE,The American pensions system is not so bad as the Victorian Public Service pensions system.,57
466,Mr REID,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"-Then the Victorian system must be a very bad one. In my opinion, judging by the immediate results, the effect of this Tariff wihich the Labour Partv is That supporting will be to give an overflowing Treasury.",57
467,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,No .,57
468,Mr REID,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"The returns, so far, point to a probable increase of £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 6 a year. The Treasurer, in introducing the Tariff, estimated an increase of .£986,000 to commence with. Mr W. H. IRVINE - Is it possible at this stage to correctly estimate the probable",57
469,Mr REID,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"It is not easy, but, in my judgment, these high duties will prove veryfruitful. The immediate effect of the poor, Tariff was to cause the bonds to become congested. At the present time, merchants are taking out of bond as little as possible, hoping that the rates proposed by the Government will be reduced, so that the - normal revenue will be larger than that which we are now getting. The bonds are now crammed almost to bursting point, be- ' cause merchants are clearing only what they absolutely require for immediate use. In view of this probable large increase of revenue, a loss of £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 need not be ' seriously considered. The women and children of Australia are being cruelly taxed, and in this instance free-traders and protectionists can honestly join in an attempt to lighten their burden. I do not care how poor a man is, he likes to see his wife and children dressed, not only decently, but with a certain amount of taste. Surely that is a laudable and natural feeling. Surely we want to see the masses dressed tastefully and well. Why should this be the luxury and prerogative of persons who have an abundance of money, .and can buy the more expensive forms of dress material? It appears that this is a cheap, seasonable material, which is capable of producing ai becoming raiment. In these circumstances there ought not to be any doubt about accepting the amendment of the honourable member for Barrier.",57
470,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,I am sorry to hear the honourable member say so.,58

488,Mr HUGHES,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"West Sydney) [9.49] is one phase of this question wihich seems to be in danger, not of being overI n looked, but of causing some honourable members to vote in a direction in which, perhaps, they should not vote. It is quite certain that a very large proportion of in honourable members have been returned in of a protective Tariff for one purpose, and one purpose only, namely, to They are not in in favour of Customs duties for the purpose of raising revenue at all, ancl if they had their way that would be the last means, to . which they would resort for that purpose. It has been admitted by the Treasurer that that is the only reason why he asked the of imporCommittee to agree to this item.",58
489,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,I did not say that it was the only reason.,58
490,Mr HUGHES,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"I utterly fail to see how any man who was returned on a ticket in favour of protection for the sole purpose of stimulating native industries, or was returned in favour of, if he had a the choice, raising revenue by direct means, can, no matter who else may do so, vote for this particular item. The honourable member for Bass has said that the Commonwealth has been built up under a protective or revenue-producing Tariff. the Treasurer came into the House to destroy that Tariff. It is every-day boast that he is not a "" shandy-gaff ' protectionist, and that he 1 came here to establish protection on a scientific and glorified basis. From time to time he advocates a duty of 40, or 30, or 25 per cent., and if he had his way he would propose still higher duties. Therefore, the Treasurer wants to destroy the Tariff of which the honourable member for Bass is so proud. He comes, here now for the purpose of promoting protection and destroying a revenue Tariff. I must remind him that at the last election he was not averse, if necessary,, to imposing a tax on the unimproved value of land for certain purposes, and I was very glad to hear it. I do not know that he is averse to direct taxation in other forms; I am not, and never have been. A great many other honourable members are in exactly the same position. When the honourable gentleman gets up, and says that this duty is proposed, not for protective purposes, but simply for revenue purposes, I claim the vote of every honourable member who was not returned on a revenue Tariff basis. In view of that statement, every, honourable member of that class must vote directly with the honourable member for Barrier. It is clear that no honourable member who believes in direct taxation can for a moment cast his vote in favour of an item when the honourable member for Bass has declared that the very purpose for which he wants it is not to build up protection, but to get revenue. That destroys the very purpose for which we, as a party, came into Parliament. It destroys the very purpose for which the Treasurer and his party came in, and that was to establish industries He says that this duty will not establish an industry, but will raise revenue. is the last method of raising money for which I shall vote.

The point of was order should, in my opinion, have been taken at that time. I put the question deliberately, and I think that the Committee thoroughly understood what I was doing. It was stated that an honourable member did not .understand the question, and I then put it again in order that it might be what honourable But now it that an honourable member, had a the lowest further amendment to move ",60
502,Mr WATSON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,Surely we can add to the which motion that has been carried ?,60
503,The CHAIRMAN,FREIGHTS ON STATE,There is this objecand I tion to that course: The Committee has of the already decided a certain question.,60
504,Mr WATSON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,It only decided that cerevery tain words shall stand; not that other words should not be added.,60
505,The CHAIRMAN,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"The Committee of having decided that certain words shall stand, it is not possible to alter them.",60
506,Mr WATSON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,To add other words is,60
507,The CHAIRMAN,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"If I were to allow that to be done in this case, I could not think prevent another honourable member from moving that on and after a subsequent day I have been ruling against that procedure, because if such a course were permitted there would be no finality.. It would possible for one honourable member after another to move different rates of duty come into operation on successive days. - Mr WATSON - The effect of the decision is to tie the Committee up.",60
508,The CHAIRMAN,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"That was not intention. But as the question ' is already decided, I cannot allow another amendment in the manner suggested.",61
509,Mr REID,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Thes e difficulties have always been met in a very simple way. They have occurred several times. When there has been an obstacle in the way the Committee voting ona lower rate duty than that before the Chair, invariably, when the Chairman has ascertained that ' an honourable member has wished to test the feeling of the Committee on the lower rate, the amendment before the Chair been temporarily withdrawn to enable that question to be decided. That has done over and over again - A ll that have done so far is to decide that certain words shall remain part of the question. We have done nothing more. So that the amendment which has. been withdrawn can now resume its former position; easily be seen that if honourable members are tied up by these formal difficulties there is a very simple way of dealing them. It does not conduce to the transacnot tion of public business to deprive honourable members of an opportunity of expressing their views.",61
510,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,I am - that.,61
511,Mr REID,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"The honourable gentleman can make a suggestion to remove this diffiwords? cultv. There has been a. very narrow diviChairman that sion, and if a large number of honourable pose to move are, members are blocked from having an altercontradictory native proposition submitted, it will not conduce to the speedv transaction of busito, ness.",61
512,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,Do not start animosities. I do not wish to do anything unfair.,61
513,Mr REID,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"I am sure that the honourable gentleman does not, and, therefore, I want him to act up to that attitude.",61
514,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FREIGHTS ON STATE,I am afraid cannot do anything -^whether,61
515,Mr WATSON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"The honourable gentleman rr.ised a point of order. There was no necessitv to do that. The ""CHAIRMAN - Of course I have no personal interest in preventing orable member - from-moving an amendment. I suggest that if honourable members do not be approve of the duty of 20 per cent, they should negative that proposition, and then-' to another, amendment can be moved that the-, duty be 10 per cent. Mr Reid,-That course would reversewhat has been our procedure. the The CHAIRMAN - We are trying to get over a difficulty which has cropped up.",61
516,Mr REID,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"The Committee having affirmed that a certain rate-of duty shall beimposed on and after a certain date, surely the question of how long that duty is to remain at that rate is within the power of of the Committee. The real question has not of been put yet. The hands of the Committee are not tied as to whether a lower rate of duty shall prevail after a certain date. The power of the Committee to datethe rates of duty is absolute. If it be suphas posed that such a procedure as I say ispermissible might be used for blocking the been course of business, would it not be time we enough to deal with that case when it arises, without making it an element in deciding as to our present action ? Such possibilities ought not to be considered as elements in a situation which has no such It can extreme features about it.",61
517,Mr WATSON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Do I understand, sir, that you have ruled that the Committee with having decided that certain words shall? be omitted, we are now precluded from moving that certain words shall be added to the motion as it stands.",61
518,The CHAIRMAN,FREIGHTS ON STATE,It all depends not doing what the other words are.,61
519,Mr WATSON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Can I move to add other With all respect to you, my contention is what it is of no moment to the the words that I proso long as they, are not of the words already agreed and so long, of course, as they are relevant. I want to know from you whether the Committee is now at liberty to add any words that they may think f it , and which are relevant ? If so, there will be no difficulty. The CHAIRMAN,-If such words are in order they can be moved, but until I that I know what the words are - I cannot say they will be in order or not. ' Mr WATSON - I understood you to rule that it is not in order to add words. But , if you say it will be in order, provided the words are relevant, I might move that on an honand after 14th November the duty be. General' Tariff, 10 per cent., UnitedKingdom, 5 per cent.",61

I do not wish to take the matter out of the hands of the honourable memought ber for Grey.",62

527,Mr REID,FREIGHTS ON STATE,That has always been done.,62
528,Mr SALMON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,"Our desire is that Committee should be got out of the difficulty, which I can assure honourable bers is owing to no fault of the Chairman.",62
529,Mr WATSON,FREIGHTS ON STATE,I do not say that it is.,62

549,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PAIRS,"Trea surer) [10.35] - I move That paragraph B be left out. - I wish to point out that there are two classes of denims - One is a striped and fancy denim, with which it is very difficult to deal owing to the fact that it so closely resembles woollens. This, the Department would like to place in a separate item. The other class consists of plain denims, which I propose shall be admitted at .10 per cent, under the General Tariff, and at 5 per 1 cent, under the Tariff ot the United Kingdom. The only difficulty experienced by the Department is in deciding between fancy denims and cloth. The loss of revenue involved in my proposal will not be large. I am of opinion that it would be very much better to include all denims in a separate item, and to make them dutiableat the rates I have indicated. Amendment agreed to.",63
550,Mr REID,PAIRS,"East Sydney) [TO.38] - It seems to me that it is proposed to admit silk at a very low rate, seeing that woollens, which - are a necessary of life, have been taxed at 30 per cent, under the General Tariff, and at 25 per cent, under the Tariff for the United Kingdom.",64
551,Mr CARR,PAIRS,We do not grow silk in Australia.,64
552,Mr REID,PAIRS,"But surely it is a luxury, upon which we can impose a good stiff revenue duty. Certainly it does not stand in the same category as does woollen goods. Amendment (by Mr JH CATTS) proposed - That after the figures "" 15 per cent.,"" paragraph C, the words "" and on and after 13th November, 1907, free,"" be inserted. - Mr TUDOR (Yarra) [10.40] - The Treasurer' should certainly take into consideration the duty that has been imposed upon silk used by umbrella workers. If we retain the rate which was agreed to the other night, when a majority of honourable members were under the impression that the item had been postponed, the manufacturers of umbrellas will be very seriously handicapped. It may be suggested that the difficulty can be remedied by allowing silk which is cut in bond to be admitted free. ""piece"" But that would mean - that each umbrella manufacturer would have to pay the cost of the attendance of a Customs officer there, which would probably amount to here. ^ 2 5 0 a year.

We do not wish to charge them a higher duty upon their raw material than we levy upon the finished product. '",64

555,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PAIRS,"Hume-Trea surer) [10.43] - I do not wish to promise to recommit items where it may not be wise to adopt that course. I do not think it would be wise to admit silk free.

557,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PAIRS,"It would be a great pity if we did not impose a fair duty upon silk, ""for the purpose, of stimulating the growth of the silkworm and the production of silk. But I can quite understand that the raw material for the making of umbrellas should be dealt with in some way which will not handicap the manufacturers. That is why I wish to provide in respect of the silk used by umbrella manufacturers, and also in regard to the handles",64

563,Sir PHILIP FYSH,PAIRS,"Denison) [10.47]. - I should like to ask whether the honourable member for Melbourne understands exactly what he is proposing to do? It seems to me that he is proposing to insert in paragraph D some goods which are included in paragraph E, and dutiable under that paragraph at 10 per cent, and 5 per cent. By placing them in paragraph D, the honourable member would render them liable to duties of 20 and 15 per cent., and I am sure that is not what he desires. Italian cloths referred to would be introduced as cotton piece goods n.e.i.",65
564,Mr MATHEWS,PAIRS,Nothin g of the kind. Some of them contain wool.,65
565,Sir PHILIP FYSH,PAIRS,"There are not many varieties of Italian cloth that contain wool. Really the honourable member for Melbourne is proposing to increase the duties on these goods. This does not apply to Astrakans and imitations of f u r , but it certainly does to Italian cloth.",65
566,Mr FISHER,PAIRS,"Wide Bay) [10.49] - We should not accept the amendment until the Minister has ascertained exactly what its effect would be. I think there is something in what has been said by the honourable member for Denison. If ' the amendment were'accepted, all the cloths which it covers, and which are made of cotton, would be subject to a higher duty than under the item as it stands.

We have already passed the first item in this division, which will include all woollen piece goods or piece goods containing wool. Therefore, however much we may desire to relieve these goods of the full duty payable on The woollen piece goods, we shall be unable to do so.",65
571,Mr MATHEWS,PAIRS,Melbourne Ports) [10.53] - I understand that the Committee is now dealing with Italian cloths.,65
572,Mr MALONEY,PAIRS,No ; that has been struck out of the amendment.,65
573,Mr MATHEWS,PAIRS,"I wish to see Italian cloths left in.. They would not come into competition with any goods manufactured here, and the better classes of Italian cloth are made almost wholly, of wool. The:e goods, even in the old world, have increased in price, and I think honourable members would do well to place them in paragraph p of . this item, and make the concession in duty that would involve on articles which.are really tailors' trimmings. I have been assured that it will effect the purpose aimed at, while the Treasurer need not be afraid that he will suffer any serious loss of revenue.",65
574,Sir PHILIP FYSH,PAIRS,"Denison) .[10.57]. - It is some years since I was associated with importing, but I know that lustres, lustrines, and similar materials used for linings, are sometimes called Italians. These materials were, under the old Tariff, dutiable at a lpw rate, in order to assist the local makers of ' clothing. They are now dutiable at 5 per cent., but, if put under some other heading, they may have to pay a higher rate.",65
575,Mr MATHEWS,PAIRS,"Melbourne Ports) [10.59] - Nearly : all Italians contain a slight percentage of wool, and are, therefore, dutiable under paragraph A at 30 and -25 per cent. Dealing with certain materials used by women, we fixed certain rates for weights not exceeding 5 ounces to the square yard. I should have liked to place Italians in the same category, but could not do so since they weigh from 5^ to 6 ounces to the square yard. If Italians areinserted in the paragraph with which we piece are now dealing, these goods will be dutiable at 20 and 15 per cent., whereas other- wise they will be dutiable as. woollens Amendment agreed to.

600,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PAIRS,"We are .not raising the duty. Mr. JOSEPH 'COOK - Havin g regard to the dimensions of this item, I say that it ought to be considered in a full Comorable mittee. I ask the Minister, ests of good feeling, to report progress.",67
601,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PAIRS,I am going either to get the Tariff pushed on or to give up the task.,67
602,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PAIRS,I think that the honourable gentleman is getting pushed on.,67
603,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PAIRS,I think not. talk from the other side is keeping Tariff back.,67
604,Mr JOHNSON,PAIRS,"That is a foundationless charge. Most of the talk has come from fore the other side. I have spoken for only three minutes today, and I have been the Chamber all the time.",67
605,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PAIRS,"Thes e are amongst the most important items in the Tariff, and the fact that we have dealt four paragraphs should satisfy the most exacting Minister - Immediately following will be put up. these items are a large number which should, occupy our attention for only a little",67
606,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PAIRS,Unles s we can every day with two or three pages of the Tariff we shall never dispose of it.,67
607,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PAIRS,There is no readesire son why we should' not be able to get quickly after we have disposed of these important duties. A vote ought not to be taken on this question in a thin Committee. We have had a reasonable debate.,67
608,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PAIRS,What ?,67
609,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PAIRS,"This bluff on the part of the Treasurer would not deceive the veriest tyro. As soon as an honourable on this side makes a suggestion he is met with' bluff on the part of the Minister. It is now 11.15 p.m., and I think that the Treasurer might well consent to progress being reported.",67
610,Mr FISHER,PAIRS,"Wide Bay) [11.17] - I agree with the honourable member for Parramatta that the item is an important one, but at the same time. I think that honourable members who are absent are fairly well paired.",67
611,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PAIRS,They are not paired.,67
612,Mr HUME COOK,PAIRS,Every honourable,67
613,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PAIRS,We should have a vote on an' item relating to woollens but for the fact that all were not paired.,67
614,Mr HUME COOK,PAIRS,Every honourable member was paired.,67
615,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PAIRS,Some were paired afterwards with dummies.,67
616,Mr HUME COOK,PAIRS,Nothin g of the kind.,67
617,The CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,I must ask the honmember for Bourke to cease his conin the intertinuous interjections.,67
618,Mr FISHER,PAIRS,"This is an important item, but in fairness to the Government it should be stated that their proposal is that a duty lower than that suggested by the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission the Tariff shall be imposed.",67
619,Mr JOHNSON,PAIRS,That is not a fair stateThe ment. The suggestion in question was the made only in connection with a general scheme that was outlined.,67
620,Mr FISHER,PAIRS,"The statement put beus is that the free-trade section of the Commission suggested a duty of 20 per in cent. Over £""3,000,000 worth of goods coming under this item, or at least nine-tenths of the total importations, are annually imported from Great Britain, and with will be dutiable at only 5 per cent.",67
621,Mr THOMAS,PAIRS,Which-mean s that prices,67
622,Mr FISHER,PAIRS,"Unde r the old Tariff time. a duty of 5 per cent, was imposed, deal although many of us endeavoured to make the item free. I do not think any great principle is at stake, and whilst I do not. late'sittings I agree that we might on very well try to make some progress. Sir WILLI AM LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [11.20] - It is rather unreasonableto ask that a vote on this question shall bedeferred since there is really nothing todebate in connection with it. Under theold Tariff, the duty on these goods, with the exception of jute-whic h was free-was- . 5 per cent. I now propose a duty of 5; per cent, on all goods of this class that are imported from Great Britain, and a duty of 10 per cent, on imports from other countries. Jute will still rema'n free. The value of goods coming under this heading, and imported from Great Britain, in 1906, w as £ 3 ! ° 7 ' 5 i '> J l t n e being valued at ,£3,309,618. That being so, it must be recognised that only a very small proportion of these goods will be dutiable at 10 per cent. bag making will not be dutiable. I believe that every honourable member will be represented in the division on this question. I do not wish to be unpleasant tq the honourable member for Parramatta",67
623,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PAIRS,What does the honourable member wish to clo to-night?,68
624,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PAIRS,"I wish the Committee to deal with this proposal, and with two others, one of which relates to piece goods other than woollens or silks, and deals really with flannelette. As soon as we have disposed of the item relating to piece goods, I shall be prepared to consent to progress being reported.",68
625,Mr THOMAS,PAIRS,"Barrier) [11.22] - I should have been glad had the Treasurer seen fit to agree to the request that progress be reported. It is all very well for those who live in Melbourne to urge fhat we should go on, but, having regard to the fact that many of us were travelling last night, I think it is only fair that the Government should be prepared to agree at this hour to an adjournment. At the same time, I am willing to remain here a little longer.",68
626,Mr WEBSTER,PAIRS,Le t the item go through.,68
627,Mr THOMAS,PAIRS,"It is very easy to make such a proposition. I would remind honourable members that this is a proposal to tax the poor people of this country to the extent of ,£166,000 per annum. If it were proposed to impose a land tax, which would yield that amount of revenue, we should have a good deal of opposition from some honourable members who are inclined to let this item go. I hope that cotton and linen, as well as jute, will be placed on the free list. This is a purely revenue producing duty. Not an ounce of cotton or linen material is produced in 'Australia.",68
628,Mr CARR,PAIRS,There is a cotton' mill at Ipswich which is producing some cotton goods.,68
629,Mr THOMAS,PAIRS,What quantity ?,68
630,Mr CARR,PAIRS,I cannot say.,68
631,Mr THOMAS,PAIRS,"- If linens can be made in Australia, 10 per cent, is not high enough.' We should have a much higher duty if it is to be protective in its incidence. But this is only a revenue producing duty. I venture to say fhat the effect of a duty of 10 per cent, will be to raise the cost of these articles to the consumer.. The English manufacturers will total importations naturally put up the price. So far as printing paper is concerned, within . twenty-four hours of a preference of 5 per cent, being given to the English manufacJute used for turer, it was cabled out that the price was to be raised 5 per cent. In regard to linens, there is practically no competition outside England, and consequently the English manufacturer will have so much the better opportunity of raising prices. If linens are placed upon the free list, the tendency will be for more shirts to be made here. Already the Lieutenant-Governor of Victoria has publicly announced that a shirt was made in Australia that fitted him and was suitable for his purposes. That gives hope of the establishment, of a very large shirt-making industry. The cheaper the linen the easier it will be to make shirts in Australia.",68
632,Mr LIDDELL,PAIRS,"Hunter) [11.32] - If there is an item in the Tariff about which the members of the Labour Party should raise an outcry it is this duty on cottons and linens, which includes dungaree and corduroy. In the northern districts of Australia, tihe people derive the greatest benefit from wearing linen suits in the hot weather. The goods are brought out very cheaply, and can be obtained at a very low price. The effect of this duty will be to raise the cost to the consumer considerably. Other goods affected are denims, which arc largely used by working men, like painters, to protect their clothes. If any item should be on the free list, it is this.",68
633,Mr CROUCH,PAIRS,"Corio) [11.33] - I think that there is a great responsibility resting on protectionists in this matter. The new Tariff has occasioned a certain amount of outcry in the country, and for my own part I am not inclined to vote for duties which are not of a protective character. . I do not believe in voting for revenue duties which are advocated by free-traders. ' I think, moreover, that in the absence of internal competition, the raising of the duty from 5 to 10 per cent, against the. foreigner will mean that the cotton and linen manufacturers of England who, at present, work upon a margin of only 2J per cent, will be able to exclude the foreigner from the market altogether, and we shall, consequentlv, be at the mercy of British manufacturers who are not above forming rings. Indeed, I would have voted against the duty on silks if I could have got some one to vote with me. Cottons are not luxuries in any sense. We are responsible for this Tariff, and the higher the duties for protection, and the lower the duties for revenue, the better we shall serve the purposes of protection. However,- I shall vote always, so far as I can, for freedom in the case of any articles that cannot be made in Australia.",68
634,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PAIRS,"Parramatta) £11.35] - In m v judgment, as I have already said, this item should be voted on when there is a much fuller attendance. This is one of the most important items in the Tariff, involving, as it does,,£3,500,000 worth of importations. I doubt if there is another item in the Tariff which has the range of this, or which brings in so large a revenue. I think I only make a reasonable request when I ask that the vote shall be taken in a fuller Committee, when members have an opportunity of freely expressing themselves in regard to it . There have been votes taken to-night when pairing with regard to absent members has taken place after the' division; and we have not had. the fair play from the Government which we have a right to .expect.",69
635,The CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,Order !,69
636,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PAIRS,"The least we can ask is that a vote shall be taken when honourable members are present, and not when they have to be paired as they have been to-night on some other items.",69
637,Mr JH CATTS,PAIRS,Why are honourable members not here?,69
638,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PAIRS,"Honourable members ought to be here, of course, but all of them are not here. Some honourable members have gone home, under the impression that the House was to adjourn, about 11 o'clock.",69
639,Mr SALMON,PAIRS,The duty proposed is the old duty.,69
640,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PAIRS,"It is not the' old duty j and if there is an item in the whole schedule in which the Committee should stretch a point in favour of Great Britain, this is the item. These goods are not made here, and are not likely to be made here for many years; and they are of vital consequence to the inhabitants of the Mother Country. We can very well afford the revenue, having regard to the way in which money is coming in and is likely to come in under this Tariff. Let us recollect that every. modification made in the rate of duties means so much: more revenue. Already the scope and range of the Tariff has been so wide and expansive as to make it just as much a revenue Tariff as it is a protectionist Tariff. The framers of the Tariff seem to have had revenue in their minds as much, if not more, than the protection of an Australian industry. Therefore we could very well afford to abandon this duty, affecting, as' it does, so large a number of the poorer classes of the community. The proposalbefore us is just another instance of sham preference to Great Britain. We are told by the honourable member for Barrier that there is still a margin of ,£170,000 or .£180,000 of imports from foreign countries, but I venture to say that a preference of 5 per cent, will not Have any appreciable effect on these importations. The duty will only have the effect of making it more difficult for the people to obtain the goods, while it will not give Great Britain and her cotton industry one pound's worth more. In my judgment, even if we make this Tariff protective, there is no need, in addition, to make it bear more heavily on the people of this country who use these articles.",69
641,Mr FISHER,PAIRS,"Therefore , the honourable member does not favour a revenue duty?",69
642,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PAIRS,"Not on this item, in regard to which I should be prepared to abolish the duty so far as Bri tish imports are concerned. I do not think that the matter need be delayed tomorrow.",69
643,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PAIRS,Will the honourable ' member agree to a vote being taken within' an hour of the House meeting tomorrow ?,69
644,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PAIRS,"So far as I am concerned, I will allow it to be taken within half-an-hour. All I wanted was to have the vote taken in a fuller Committee. I made a reasonable request to the honourable member, and he ought to have met it at once.",69
645,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PAIRS,"Hume-Trea surer) [11.46] - I am very anxious to make more rapid progress with the Tariff. It is heart-breaking to have two or three items debated all day and then make no advance of any moment. If we do not go faster than - we have been going, Heaven knows how long it will take. I understand from the deputy leader of the Opposition that he will exert his influence to. allow a vote to be taken on this item within an hour of the House meeting tomorrow. Progress reported. House adjourned at 11.47 P- - m",69
