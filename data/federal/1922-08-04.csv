Mr MoWILLIAMS - Will the Minister for Trade and Customs state whether it is the intention of the Government to proceed this session with the agreement made with New Zealand for a reciprocal Tariff?",13
2,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"Yes . It is most certainly the intention of the Government to ask the House to proceed, as quickly as possible, with the consideration of the Customs (New Zealand Preference) Tarifi Agreement. In submitting the Agreement to the House last Friday I explained that an arrangement had 'been made with the Government of the Dominion of New Zealand that, if possible, in both the New Zealand and the Commonwealth. Parliaments one week should he allowed for its discussion, and that it should then be put through in globo. New Zealand has practically kspt to the arrangement, and we desire to do the same. LEAGUE OF NATIONS. AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION : REPRESENTATION OF WOMEN.  asked the Prime Minister whether he and his Cabinet had come to a conclusion with regard to the request of the National Council of Women, Perth, that the Government include in the Australian delegation to the forthcoming Conference of the League of Nations at least one woman delegate. In his reply the right honourable gentleman stated that one of the great obstacles in the way of the proposal was that there were so many organizations of women that it would be difficult to select a woman delegate who would give satisfaction to all. The deputation which waited on -.the right honourable gentleman in rogard to this matter assured him that they had come to a conclusion, and that they were prepared to make either one or two nominations. I have received a telegram, stating that Interruption.",13
3,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown," Order ! I would remind the honourable member that the object of questions is to elicit information, and not to set out facts. The right to put questions to Ministers should not be availed of to make long involved statements. Honourable members should make their questions as concise as possible, and not state, by way of explanation, more than is actually necessary to clarify them. I also that silence be observed while questions are being dealt' with. There has been a great deal of interruption. Honora'ble members are developing a practice of interjecting freely while questions are being addressed to Ministers and of commenting on the answers given. That is disorderly, and I ask that it be discontinued.  Speaker. My remarks were necessarily involved owing to the reply made by the Prime Minister on Wednesday last to the question that I addressed to him. I desire to make it clear Several honourable members interjecting,",13
4,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! I shall certainly have to ask the House to take some action against those honourable members who persist in disregarding the authority of the Chair. I do not propose to be continually calling for order. I again appeal to honourable members to allow questions to be put without interruption. Honourable members must expect action retired ? to be taken against them if they disregard the call to order. I would point out to the honourable member for Swan (Mr. Prowse) that it is contrary to the rules that questions, arising out of answers given to previous questions, shall be dressed to Ministers. The honourable ber is now founding a question to the Prime Minister on a reply given right honourable gentleman to a previous question. That is out of order.  ment of the women of Australia to nominate one person to represent them on the Australian delegation to the League of Nations Conference, will the Prime Minister now state whether or not the Cabinet is prepared to appoint a woman the delegate?",14

6,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"I should like to appeal to you, Mr Speaker. The honourable member for Swan has made a misstateask ment, and I know of no other way by which I may correct it except through you. The statement made by the honourable member that the women of Australia have agreed to nominate one person to represent them on the Australian delegation to the League of Nations Conference is not true.",14
7,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honourable member must withdraw the expression that the statement is not true.,14

23,Mr HUGHES,MILITARY RESIGNATIONS AND,"Yes . Those relating to the White Australia Policy are as follow:"" All I have read and heard on the subject of the Northern Territory leads me to believe that it can never be fully developed without coloured labour arises as to whether coloured races should be brought into Australia as coolie labour to work under indenture for white men or whether eel cc ted Asiatics should be permitted to settle in the country with full citizen rights. It does seem to mc that the second alternative is the only one worthy of consideration.""Fide Adela'idc Register, 5th January. 1922, and Melbourne Argus, 5th January, 1922.

Replying to Mr Theodore's contention that if Sir Henry Barwell's proposals were adopted thero would be a piebald Australia in a few years, and in half a century, by peaceful penetration, the whole continent would be in the hands of Asiatics, Sir Henry Barwell said:"" I deny this. I say that coloured labour would be restricted to our tropical areas. Instead of being unpatriotic it wouldmean the development of our resources. I never said that we should bring in a million aliens. All that I have said is that we could introduce such a quantity of labour for a tropical production as might 'be considered necessary. The number would always be regulated and they could be satisfactorily confined entirely to the tropical portions of the continent.""--Fro m an interview in the Perth Daily Jfeies, 3rd Februarv, 1922.

"" I stand by every word I have said in favour of what I believe to be the only sane policy of tropical settlement.

29,Mr HUGHES,LITHGOW SMALL ARMS,"The answers to honorablo member's questions arc as low :1. Yes. 2.

30,Mr HUGHES,LITHGOW SMALL ARMS,"On the 13th July, the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr. Pratten) asked the following question:In view of the reply given by the Minister representing the Prime Minister to a question which I asked yesterday concerning Cockatoo Island dockyard, namely, that the accounts would be dealt with as usual, and in view of the fact that no accounts having to do Cockatoo Island have ever yet been published separately, and that the dockyard is competing with private enterprise in Sydney, I to know whether he will have pared and presented to the House at earliest possible moment. I now lay on the table the following documents:1. The Shipbuilding Board of Control's report on the twelve months' operations at Cockatoo Island. 2. Statement of assets and liabilities taken over from the Navy Department on 29th June, 1921. 3. Balance-sheet as at 30th June, 1922. 4. Profit and loss account June, 1921, to 30th June, 1922. The honourable member for Dalley (Mr. Mahony) asked me recently why the award of the Shipbuilding Tribunal had not been applied to the mechanics and their assistants at Cockatoo Island dockyard. I desire to briefly summarize the facts which have led up to the present position:On the 1st August, 1912, when the Cockatoo dockyard was under State control, the then Minister for Public Works, New South Wales, ruled that 9s. per day was to be the minimum daily wage for all labourers in the New South Wales Public the Works Department. At that time the folwage paid for iron workers was 8s. Under the Minister's ruling they therefore received Is. above the award rates. The this extra payment was maintained, under varying awards, up to the 5th November, from 1920, when the award was increased'to 6d. 91s. per week. On the new award comand ing into operation, payment of the extra AusIs. per day was abolished by the Navy Dethat partment-whic h then controlled the dockyard-the view taken by the DepartAusment being that, while there was no doubt some justification for the payment in the first instance, when the daily wage was only 8s., now that the Industrial Court dealt specifically with iron workers' assistants, and took periodical cognisance of increases in the cost of living, the Commonwealth should adhere strictly to AWARD. the awards of the Court. On the 4th August, 1921, the Shipbuilding Board of Control decided to pay the Is. per day over award rates for iron workers' assistants employed on repair work other than for the Navy Department. In view of the many awards which bave been given in this industry, all of which increased the rate of pay, it is not felt that with these men should be singled out amongst all the workers in Commonwealth employ wish for special treatment over and above that accounts preafforded by the Court. the NA HOBSON'S BAY.",17
31,Mr HUGHES,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"On the 2Sth July the honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) asked the following question :What were (1) the freights received, and (2) the costs incurred in carrying the frui t cargo of the Commonwealth steamer Hobson's Bay for the period 29th to England? The replies to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. The freight received by the line was 6s. per case. 2. It would not be desirable to make publio what the line's working costs are, as the same mijrht be of use to its competitors. MINISTERIAL STATEMENT. SUGAR: COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT CONTROL - BALANCE-SHEET . Debate resumed from 3rd August (vide page 1134), on motion by Mr RODGERSThat the paper "" Commonwealth Government Sugar Control-Balance-sheet , as at'30th June, 1922; profit and loss account for the period from Mth July, 1915, to 30th Juno, 1922; trading and profit and loss account for the period from 19th July, 1915, to 30th June, 1022-operatin g and trading accounts,"" bo printed. Upon which Mr OHAKLTON h.id moved by way of amendmentTlint the following words be added to the motion:"" and the retail price of sugar be reduced to 4Jd. per lb. from the 7th August, 1922.""",17
32,Mr LAZZARINI,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"Werriwa) [11.35]. - Las t night, when I obtained leave to continue my remarks, I was referring to some of the arguments which had been advanced by Che honourable member for  criticised the balance-sheet and the deal ingw of the Government generally with the subject-matter, he endeavoured to furnish reasons why he and other honourable members behind the Government would be justified in supportiug them and in opposing the Opposition in their endeavour to secure sugar for the consumers at 4-$d. per lb. One poiut to which I desire to refer is contained in the argument that there is a great possibility of the Mininster for Trade and Customs (Mr. Rodgers) being inundated with applications for rebates ou the part of people who are holding large stocks of sugar. This same question of rebates was presented; but in an entirely different aspect, a year or two ago when the rise in price was foreshadowed. Large stocks were held; yet I read letters in this House from small traders in my own electorate who complained bitterly of not being able to get sugar. That state of affairs existed very generally for some time; but, so soon as the retail price was raised to 6d. per lb. there was-as the honorablo member for. Yarra (Mr Scullin) reminded honorablo members last nightplenty of sugar everywhere, nnd anybody could get it. No action was taken by the holders of large stocks, who had benefited by the increase in prico, to hand something back to the Goveniment out of their pockets. The Minister for Trade and Customs was not then swamped by offers to return some of the extra profits being made by traders. If they should now be called upon to forego some percentage of profits owing to the reduction of price, surely the "" rake off "" which they enjoyed eighteen months to two years ago should compensate them for whatever sacrifice [44] they may now be called upon to make. What is the use of arguing about a flood of applications for rebates at this stage? It is just as useless to do that as it is for the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr. Corser) to argue that we do not know what quantity of sugar purchased at a high price has still to be accounted for.",18
33,Mr MCWILLIAMS,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"Doc s not the honourable member think that we ought to know ? Mr Lazzarini!- I certainly do. It is remarkable that the Auditor General should have felt himself called upon to add a statement, at the end of the balance-sheet, to the effect that the only information he has received for quite a long period from the Millaquin Company ancl the Colonial Sugar Refining Company are certificates from the managers of those companies. Possibly when the full information is provided, it may place an entirely different aspect on the balance-sheet. The particulars could have been secured ere now. Honorablo ^members on this side have been constantly questioning the Government ever since Parliament met. Thero has been any amount of time in which the information could have been obtained, and the wholo of the details published in the balance sheet. It is useless for the Minister, or for any honourable member opposite, to say that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company has been making no profits out of the handling of our sugar. According to all the information which has been placed before the House, including the statement by the Minister for Trade and Customs, the deficit on the ^ugar transactions should have been wiped off twelve months ago. The Colonial : Sugar Refining Company is supposed to have made no profit out of the refining and distribution of Australian-grown sugar during the last trading year. But it has made over £400,000 of disclosed profits- I U30 that qualification because it is questionable whether the disclosed profits of any of these companies are the true profits-and paid to shareholders a bonus of £4 per share, making a total profit for the year of nearly £1,000,000. These facte make one wonder whether the company has not received from the handling of sugar much more than the Gorernment are inclined to disclose. No argument has been put forward by any member opposite to dispute the figures submitted by the Leader of the Opposition. His contentions are incontestable. It has been proved conclusively that sugar can be reduced to 4£d. per lb. on 7th August, and the amendment should be carried in order to give relief to the consumers.

(6) That a Select Committee of the House be appointed to inquire into the question of the Government transactions in sugar, and to report to this House."" If the House will adopt this amendment the most equitable consideration can be given to all interests that are concerned in sugar. The attitude of some honourable members in this Chamber, at times, is difficult to understand. We find honourable members, like the honourable member for Kooyong, voting for high duties to pro. . 26 tect Melbourne and Sydney manufac. . 30 turers of machinery and carbide which is used to light up the homes of people in the country, but when the price of a ATES. primary product is under consideration the very members that are so ready to impose those burdens upon one section of the community are equally ready to harken to the cry of others to be supplied cheaply with a commodity they use, and which the man upon the land produces. There is extraordinary inconsistency in such an attitude. I am under the impression that the sugar industry is a great burden upon the people of Australia, and in that regard I differ from many honourable memNOES. bers. I am told that in normal times the sugar industry will not be sufficiently protected by a duty of £6 per ton, and a Queensland member told me yesterday that the industry required a duty of £14 per ton. Is it possible for us to give the Queensland growers that amount of protection? If there were no obstacles in the way we could shortly buy sugar abroad for that sum. If a duty of £14 per ton is imposed the Australian people will be paying for 1 ton of sugar what people in other countries will be paying for 2 tons. The PAIRS. high price of sugar is one of the many handicaps that are placed upon the Australian people. What I object to is the inconsistency in handicapping one section of the community and claiming relief for another section. The suggested price of 4^d. per lb. may be right, or it may be wrong, but it is certain that, at the present time, Australia is paying much more for sugar than it should be paying. I want this House to determine intelligently just exactly what can be paid while permitting the industry to exist-if it has to exist. So far, however, we are not in a position to determine this matter intelligently. Honourable members in their speeches delivered on the amendment which has just been defeated have shown that they are not in the position to determine the question from the information already submitted. In my opinion no disadvantage will arise from two or three days' delay, which will enable the Government to submit a full statement of the position.",18
34,Mr RODGERS,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"Hear , hear! It finitely promised for Wednesday next.  members will be in a better position to determine what attitude they will take upon this question when the Government 'have brought down the figures and shown the House a true statement of the sugar transactions. The price will not be reduced between now and Wednesday next, and there can be no disadvantage to the people of Australia because of the slight delay. It must not be understood that certain honourable members who voted against the amendment which has just been defeated are opposed to a reduction in the price of sugar. We feel that there should be a considerable reduction in price. As a matter of fact,, unless such a reduction is brought about the sugar industry, instead of being a help to Australia, will hamper its development. am quite satisfied that it would be in the interests of all concerned to have a Select Committee appointed to inquire into the whole question.",20
35,Mr MAXWELL,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"But why mix up two matters in the one amendment?  be treated separately. It is only right that there should be a close and impartial investigation into the whole of the sugar transactions of the Government, in which many millions of pounds have been involved. In any case, if we are to continue any form of control of sugar, the whole matter should be considered from A to Z. Honourable members - opposite desire cheap sugar, but at the same time they do not desire cheap labour. In the sugar industry high wages are paid as a result of an arbitration award by a Queensland tribunal, but in such a national question it is not right that a tribunal in one State should determine the rates of pay which are to be paid by people of other States to the workmen in that State.",20
36,Mr SCULLIN,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"Is not the honourable member in favour of high wages?  also be in favour of a high price for sugar. We cannot have both ends of the stick. We cannot pay wages which are excessively high compared with those paid in other countries, and at the same time get cheap sugar. All these points show is de- how necessary it is that the whole question should be thoroughly inquired into just to see to what extent each interest is served, the labour employed, the growers of the cane, the millers, the refiners, and also the middlemen who vend the sugar to the public. But the primary need is a deep and searching inquiry into every transaction carried out during the period of Government control. For instance, the primary producers of Queensland have been blamed for the present price of sugar. A greater share of odium has been attached to them than was proper in the circumstances. As a matter of fact, if sugar were sold at 4^d. per lb. instead of 6d. per lb. it wonld be just about the proportion of the cost for which they are responsible. The balance of l i d . per lb. has been drawn from the consumers in order to cover up I bad statesmanship and mistakes of policy on the part of the Government. It was a short-sighted policy on their part to restrict the growing of sugar cane. Had that not been done there would the have been no shortage of sugar in Australia. Queensland would have had more to her credit, and we would not have had to make up at high cost 100,000 tons by importations. To overtake that shortage, the Government did not buy wisely, or, at any rate, with the same wisdom as was displayed by the British sugar control. They seemed to purchase just when the market was high, and, of course, to make good that blunder the consumers of Australia have had to pay 6d. instead of 4^d. per lb. for Gugar. If the Government have nothing to hide, they will support the appointment of a Select Committee. But when the Minister brings down his detailed statement we shall be in a better position to determine whether he is right in fixing the price at 5d. per lb., whether the proposal of the Leader of the Opposition to fix the price at 4£d. per lb. would be the better step to take, or whether a searching inquiry might not be more likely to show that the price could be fixed at 4d. However, seeing that we are eo close to the date upon which we are to get the promised facts, I think it would bo wrong to anticipate matters by forcing a vote at the present juncture. When we got the facts before us we shall be in a better position to determine intelligently this question, which is of so much importance to the people of Australia.",20
37,Mr CHARLTON,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"Hunter) [11.56] What has happened in this House today will come somewhat as a surprise to the public. We have just determined, with the aid of the mover of the amendment  the Country party, including the Leader of that party (Dr Earle Page), that the price of sugar shall not be reduced for an indefinite period; and now, after voting in such a manner, the honourable member for Swan submits an amendment which uot only contains a vote of censure upon the Government, but also provides that no effect can be given to it until after this Parliament expires. In my parliamentary experience I have never previously k n o w of such a deliberate attempt to camouflage a matter of so much importance. In the first portion of his amendment the honourable member asks for the postponement of the consideration of the matter at issue. Ho did not ask earlier for this postponement, but came to the assistance of the Government because they could not answer the charges made on the floor of this House. As a matter of fact, not one Minister has replied to the attack made upon the Government. It remained for the Country party, which is supposed to bo the independent party in this House, aud which claims to be conserving the interests of the consumers in this matter, to come to the assistance of the Government and relieve them from the position in which they were placed. Mr MCWrLLiAirs - Hol d on!",21
38,Mr CHARLTON,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"I want to be fair. The honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams) has voted with the position when occasion demanded it, and this was an occasion whitdi demanded it. T cannot say the same of the honourable  Leader.",21
39,Mr SPEAKER,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,The honourable member must confine his remarks to the amendment.,21
40,Mr CHARLTON,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,The purpose of the amendment is to cover up the action taken by honourable members of the Country party in voting as they did upon my amendment. It is not the first occasion on which they have adopted the same tactics. Even in regard to matters emanating from their own party we find them divided. If the fate of the Government is at stake we find one of them missing or absent.,21
41,Mr SPEAKER,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,Order !,21
42,Mr CHARLTON,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,The Government cannot support the proposal for the appointment of a Select Committee. It is tantamount to a direct vote of oensure.,21
43,Mr HUGHES,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,Le t the honourable member direct his remarks to that aspect of the question.,21
44,Mr CHARLTON,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"It is a direct vote of censure upon the Government, inasmuch as it provides for the appointment of a Committee to inquire into and report upon the Government's transactions in reference to sugar. It is a declaration that the House is dissatisfied with the Government's administration of the sugar question. If there was not something behind it, there would be no reason for this move on the part of the Country party. The sugar operations of the Government have extended over a period of seven years, involving a turnover of about £60,000,000, and, therefore, if a Select Committee were appointed it would not report until after the House had risen, and we were approaching the next elections.",21
45,Mr HUGHES,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,Are we going to have an election soon?,21
46,Mr CHARLTON,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"I do not know, but judging by the attitude of the Country party, I should say that the Government are quite safe until next March or April, at all events. I am rather surprised at the attitude of both the honorablo member for Robertson (Mr Fleming), and the honourable member for  Opthe Public Accounts Committee, because I understand that Committee has decided to look into this question of sugar control.",21
47,Mr BKENNAN,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,Thei r action amounts to want of confidence in their own Committee.,21
48,Mr CHARLTON,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"That is the position. The question of the price of sugar is urgent. It affects the bread and butter of the people, because a reduction in price would mean a reduction in the cost of living. Notwithstanding its urgency we find some honourable members deliberately endeavouring to evade the issue. If what I have said is correct, and I have every reason to believe it is, because there has been no denial from the Ministerial Bench, we should be able to get from the Treasury inside of six weeks the amount of £415,000 outstanding on account of sugar control operations, and so there would be every justification for an immediate drop in the prico of sugar. I could see last night that something like this amendment was pending. It was apparent to all honourable members that the Government Whip was "" nobbling "" members of the Country party one after the other. They are like children, having no minds of tlieir own in this matter. It is time, therefore, that the public knew what is happening here, and realized that the purpose of the Country party is to camouflage everything likely to cause embarrassment to the Government. I do not wish to take up further timo as I put my position quite clearly yesterday. I now move That the following words he added to the amendment:-""and the retail price of sugar bo reduced to 4Jd., as from 14th August, 1022.""",22
49,Mr SPEAKER,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY," I am afraid I cannot accept the amendment, because the House has already dealt with one in substautially similar terms.",22
50,Mr CHARLTON,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"I desire to point out, Mr Speaker, that the date mentioned in my former amendment was 7th August, whereas the date in the present amendment is one week later. I submit, therefore, that I am perfectly in order.",22
51,Mr SPEAKER,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"The fact that there has been an alteration in the date from which the proposed reduction shall operate does not affect the invalidity of the amendment. It is practically the same as that which has already been disposed of, the crux of which was to reduce the prico of sugar to 4^-d. If I permitted this amendment and the House decided against it, it would then be competent for some other honorablo members in succession to move further amendments changing the date ad libitum, and accordingly there would be no finality.",22
52,Mr CHARLTON,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"In view of your ruling, Mr Speaker, and with the consent of the House I propose to amend my amendment by substituting "" 4£d."" for ""4id"".",22
53,Mr SPEAKER,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"^Such an amendment would not bo in order, since the House has voted against reducing the price to 4£d. It would have to be something above 4id.",22
54,Mr LIVINGSTON,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"Barker) [12.6] I should like to take this opportunity to advise honourable members that after all there is no need for Australia to confine its attention to ihe matter of sugar production in the tropical areas of t i e Commonwealth. We can produce much better sugar in any of the southern districts with an average rainfall, and, what is more important, with white labour. It has been demonstrated beyond all possible doubt that excellent sugar beet can be successfully grown anywhere in Gippsland or the Western District of Victoria, the South-Eastern District of South Australia, and along the River Murray. At present the only drawback to the development of the industry is the initial cost of sugar-beet factories. If the Government are prepared to spend as much money on the erection of beet sugar mills, as has been paid to assist the cane-sugar iudustry in Queensland, we shall be able to produce immense quantities of sugar in Southern Australia, and, perhaps, build up an important export trade in the commodity. It may not be generally known that sugar beet, planted in October, is ready for the mills in March or April; so there is au almost immediate return for the grower, and a certain and good income. This industry should be specially suited for our returned soldiers. Production, on average land, ranges from 15 to 17 tons of sugar beet per acre, but in the south-east of South Australia, where I reside, we are producing anything up to 25 tons per acre, for which the gross return is about £2 10s. per ton. I have been informed by Mr Williams, the manager of the sugar-beet factory at Maffra, that this year he will not be able to handle the product of about 600 acres, so rapidly has production expanded in that district. The Government should give this matter immediate attention in order to further encourage the cultivation of sugar beet in all our southern areas, and so provide employment for those of our returned soldiers who desire to enter into this industry. I have many facts and figures at my disposal, and will do all I can to assist the Government to further the industry. Honourable members will find, in the lobby, some magnificent samples of sugar beet grown in my district.",22
55,Mr WATT,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,Is it as good as the sugar beet grown at Maffra ?,23
56,Mr LIVINGSTON,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"It is better. According to the official figures beet grown in the Maffra district returns 11 per cent, of sugar, whereas the south-eastern sugar beet returns 18.1 per cent.",23
57,Dr EARLE PAGE,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,At what price could you sell beet 3ugar?,23
58,Mr LIVINGSTON,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"It could be sold at 3£ per lb., and the growers would make a substantial profit out of the business. In 1911, when I visited Europe, I was very much impressed with the sugar beet factories all through Belgium, Germany, and France, and determined then, upon my return, that I would do what I could to further the industry in the Commonwealth. The matter was taken up by the Mount Gambier Technical School authorities with excellent results. We obtained seed from the Maffra factory, and planted it in twenty-seven different localities in the south-east. Last year I sent two trial truck loads of beet from the Millicent and Mount Gambier districts of South Australia to the Maffra factory, and the beet returned 18 per cent, of sugar, with 91 per cent, of purity. If there were eight or ten sugar-beet factories in Victoria and the South-Eastern District of South Australia the industry would, I believe, soon become one of the most important in the Commonwealth. It may be carried on most successfully in conjunction witli dairying, as the tops make excellent fodder for dairy stock, and can be so utilized during the months of April, May, and June, which is the worse period in the year for the dairyman. Then again, the pulp is a very useful fertilizing agent. If honourable members only realized the importance of this industry to Australia they would heartily support its extension. I invite them to visit ray district to see what is being done there. At Mount Gambier I grew sugar beet on the same land for three years in succession, and the crop for the third season, without manure, was the best of the series. Then in the following season I grew a beautiful crop of potatoes on the same land. I hope to induce a few honourable members to join with me in the cultivation of sugar beet. I have a sample of beet that I pulled on the 3rd June, and it is today in perfect order. Sugar beet can be pulled, thrown into railway trucks, and carried a thousand miles without suffering any deterioration. We have sugar beet growing in thirty-five different parts of South Australia.",23
59,Mr WATT,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,What size are the plots ?,23
60,Mr LIVINGSTON,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,Fro m 1 acre to 30 acres.,23
61,Mr WATT,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,The Queensland sugar cane-growers will not thank the honourable member for this speech.,23
62,Mr LIVINGSTON,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"There is a vast stretch of country between Queensland and the southern part of South Australia, and there is room for all of us to live. If sugar beet were cultivated on an ex-' tensive scale we should no longer need to import sugar. We should be able to export sugar-suga r grown by white labour.",23
63,Mr FLEMING,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,What is the largest plot under beet in South Australia?,23
64,Mr LIVINGSTON,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"There is a Government experimental plot of 17 acres at Mount Gambier, another plot of 15 acres at Millicent, and 11 acres at Benara. Many years ago, when I desired the House to agree to the building of the East-West Railway, I invited honourable members on both sides to visit the State of which I am a representative to have a look at the country. They did so. The railway was built. I shall now arrange an excursion of honourable members of all parties to the beet sugar areas in Soutli Australia. I should not be surprised if within twelve months we had a sugar beet factory in the Western District of Victoria. I shall have a sample of sugar beet here next Wednesday.",23
65,Mr RILEY,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,Why not give some to the poor?,23
66,Mr LIVINGSTON,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,Where sugar beet is cultivated there will be no poor.,23
67,Mr FLEMING,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"What would a sugar beet factory cost? Mr LIVINGSTON"" - Tw o hundred and fifty thousand pounds. The crop is sown in October, and the beet is pulled in March, and one of the advantages of the crop is that the grower receives payment for it as soon as be delivers it at the factory. The growing of sugar beet is a valuable adjunct to dairying. We shall never have poor people where there are beet sugar fields and dairy farms. hope to secure the assistance of the House in the establishment of the industry of beet sugar cultivation on a a extensive scale in the southern part of South Australia.",24
68,Mr ANSTEY,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"Bourke) [12.18] - It is the fault, not of the House, but of the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Rodgers) that this discussion has practically been going on for weeks. Some weeks ago when the sugar question was first discussed in this House the Minister promised to furnish a balance-sheet relating to the ""Government control. He promised also to supply the fullest details. He kept his word by submitting to the House a fortnight ago a balance-sheet which has met not only with the general condemnation of honourable members, but has been condemned by the entire press of Australia. One newspaper in this city has described it as a mere travesty of a balance-sheet, and another has declared that the Minister might as well have thrown on the table of the House this so-called balance-sheet without uttering a word by way of explanation, since his speech, in submitting it, gave no more information than was to be gathered from the bulk figures. In view of the general dissatisfaction then expressed the Minister promised to furnish full details to the House. Fburteen clays have elapsed since then, yet we have no more information than we had at the outset. It should have been possible for the Minister charged with the administration of an enterprise of this magnitude, involving the handling of millions of pounds, to supply honourable members with detailed information. As it is, all that we have had is"" a mere gathering together of mass figures. The Minister has not supplied us with any more information than any one could have obtained by devoting a week or two to an examination of the books.",24
69,Mr RODGEKS,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,Rubbish !,24
70,Mr ANSTEY,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"That interjection does not affect me. The honourable gentleman and his party have to deal with the daily newspapers of Australia, who are no friends of the Labour party, and who clearlyand deliberately affirm that this balance-sheet is a mere fake, a delusion, and a sham.",24
71,Mr WATT,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,Who said that it was a I fake?,24
72,Mr ANSTEY,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,It has been so described by the general press of Australia. T say it is a fake; it represents a mere attempt to trade on the credulity of honourable members.,24
73,Mr RODGERS,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,That is an Anstey interpretation.,24
74,Mr ANSTEY,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"I am entirely justified in placing my own interpretation upon the statementi, purporting to be a balance sheet, presented to the House by the honourable gentleman. Not only has the balance-sheet itself met with general condemnation throughout the Commonwealth, but the manner of its presentation has been condemned by all parties in this House. The hostile criticism to which it has been subjected has come not only from the Labour party, but from some of the supporters of the Government, as well as members of the Country party. After waiting for weeks for a promised balance-sheet, we were given something which by no stretch of the imagination could be so described.",24
75,Mr WATT,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,We asked for bread and they gave us a stone.,24
76,Mr ANSTEY,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"That is so. Take the reply made this morning by the Minister for Trade and Customs to an inquiry as to whether Colonel Oldershaw's salary was included in the figures appearing in the balance-sheet. The Minister did not know; he said the figures were lumped, and he did not know whether or not Colonel Oldershaw's salary was included in them. One would think that the Minister administering the sugar control would be seized of such facts. He ought to have detailed information. Notwithstanding the temper of tihe House as displayed when the so-called balance-sheet was submitted a fortnight ago, the honourable gentleman has not yet furnished the detailed information for which we have asked.",24
77,Mr RODGERS,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,Has the honourable member any idea of the size of the staffs are working to supply the information 1,25
78,Mr ANSTEY,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"I venture to say that the Treasurer (Mr Bruce), who is connected with a business having enormous transactions, would not have taken as many clays as the Minister has taken weeks to supply the information for which we have asked.",25
79,Mr RODGERS,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,The Colonial Sugar Refining Company is preparing the details.,25
80,Mr ANSTEY,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"Quite so; and we are supposed to be in partnership with it. In order that no further time may be lost by the House waiting for detailed information before determining what shall be the retail price of sugar, we have decided to submit an amendment of the amendment, which will bring matters to a head. The honourable member for Swan  providing, first of all, that the consideraI tion of what shall be the retail price of sugar be left over until Wednesday next, so that further information may be supplied. That would be all very well if there were some fair basis of argument behind what is proposed; but the second part of this amendment, providing for the appointment of a Select Committee, cannot be too strongly condemned. Although the Government themselves proposed to bring about a certaiu reduction in price within the next few weeks, honourable members in the Ministerial corner who are trying to find a loop-hole of escape for the Ministry propose that a Select Committee shall be appointed to make further inquiries. Such a committee, if appointed, would meet week after week, and I venture to say that its report would not be available to us this session. I move That the amendment be amended by adding the following words to paragraph (a) :-""and the retail price of sugar be reduced to 4|d. per lb. from the 21st August, 1922."" That is a clear and definite proposal. Evenif we were to wait for the promised additional details there would be no alteration of the facts. The Government admit that they see no reason why in ordinary circumstances the price of sugar should not come down to 4-Jd. per lb. A sum of £415,000, representing profit out of the sugar control has been paid into the Consolidated Revenue. In that other directions there is, apparently, a deficit of - something like £250,000; but allowing for what has been paid into the Consolidated Revenue, and what has been lost, in connection with the sugar control, there is still a balance in hand. Having regard to the admissions made by the Government, and the statements made by the honourable member for Parramatta  the Government, who claim to have an intimate knowledge of this subject, there is ample justification for our contention that there should be no further procrastination, but that a definite decision should be arrived at without further delay as to the reduction to be made. The House should tell the Government, apart altogether from any question as to the supply of further details, that the price of sugar must be immediately reduced.",25
81,Mr MAXWELL,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,Fawkner) [12.27] rise to suggest to the honourable mem divide his amendment into two parts.,25
82,Mr WATT,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,That he cut off the tail?,25
83,Mr MAXWELL,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"Yes . If the honourable member will submit first of all the first paragraph of his amendment, I , for one, shall support it.",25
84,Mr RODGERS,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"And I will accept it .  "" rigged up "" by the Minister.",25
85,Mr RODGERS,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,That is not so.,25
86,Mr MAXWELL,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"Tb e Minister did not suggest that I should make this proposition. I desire to state my reason for putting it forward. I voted for the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton), and as a protest against the failure of the Government to furnish the House with sufficient material to enable it to make up its mind on the question of the price of sugar.",25
87,Mr WATT,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,You must keep the party together.,25
88,Mr MAXWELL,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"It is not a question of keeping the party together; my object and I suppose that of every honourable member, is to bring down the price of sugar as soon as possible. My desire is that the consumer shall obtain sugar at the lowest possible price; but my difficulty has been to get at the facts. I suppose that every honourable member who take3 an interest in this question has experienced the same trouble. Allusion was made last night by the honorablo member for Yarra (Mr. Scullin) to the fact that I had appeared with him on a public platform recently to advocate a reduction in the price of sugar. My sole object in attending that meeting was to protest, as a matter of principle, against a renewal of the Sugar Agreement. I am totally opposed to the renewal of the Agreement in any circumstances. The question which I have now to face is Whether it is possible, under present conditions, to make any reduction in the price being paid by consumers. Before I can say whether 4&d. per lb. fair charge it is essential that I have the facts before mo; but I have not sumcient data at hand to warrant me in saying so. .1 voted for the amendment a few minutes ago simply as a protest against the failure of the Government to j supply me with that information. I shall I not again consider the question of the j reduction of the retail price until after [ I have been provided with the necessary I facts. I understand that on Wednesday next the Minister will make a full statement.",25
89,Mr WATT,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,Has the House-been given an assurance to that effect?,26
90,Mr MAXWELL,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,I do not know about an assurance.,26
91,Mr RODGERS,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,For certain sugar years.,26
92,Mr MAXWELL,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,I am addressing myself now to the first portion of the amendment of the honourable member for   part?,26
93,Mr MAXWELL,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"The proposed investigation would be unnecessary if the details supplied next Wednesday are satisfactory. At least, the Minister ought to bo able to make such a statement as would do away with the necessity for an inquiry. On the other hand, such particulars as are to be afforded may demonstrate the necessity for an investigation of the character desired by the honourable member for Swan, in which case I shall support him. I suggest now, however, that no good would be gained by permitting the amendment to stand as it has been drafted, because it is bound to be defeated by an overwhelming majority. If the honourable member cares to submit an amendment to the simple effect that the House postpone consideration of the retail price of sugar until after the Minister for Trade and Customs has made his statement next week, the latter will bo afforded an opportunity to redeem his promise. But if, on Wednesday, there is still no statement forthcoming I shall consider what further steps to take.",26
94,Mr SPEAKER,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY," I point out that in cases where an amendment, or a. motion, is divided into parts, it has been found more convenient is a to put them in paragraphs or separately should from the Chair according to circumstances.",26
95,Mr RODGERS,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"Wannon-Minister for Trade and Customs) [12.34] - There is only one aspect of the matter upon which I desire shortly at this stage to speak. There has been n failure, both on the part of honourable members and of the press, to recognise the real problem which beset the Minister whose task it has been to submit the balance-sheet. Honourable members are aware of the time at which I took over ray new duties, and, therefore, of the period in which I have been associated with the control of sugar. Recognising that the public were entitled to be provided with a balance-sheet showing the whole of the operations during the period of control, I undertook to furnish 6uch a document at the earliest possible opportunity. In regard to the financial year ending on the 30th June last, I instructed my Department and the Sugar Control Board to prepare a detailed statement also covering the activities of each individual year, covering the whole period. It was pointed out to me that the preparation of the wholiof the balance-sheets and the'r presentation at the one time would involve gigantic work, which could only be accomplished within reasonable time. Accordingly, I submitted an interim balance sheet-a n accurate statement-and undertook to furnish later the full particulars for each separate year. I regret that there have been so many wild statements made concerning the interim balance sheet. Even had I been in a position to present overwhelming details for every individual year, they could not have affected the aggregate results set out in the document I have already provided. Recognising, however, that the Honse and the country are entitled to the further details, I undertook to supply them at the earliest date by which it would be humanly possible to prepare them. For honourable members now to imply want of good faith on my part is very unfair. The staff engaged upon the task has exerted itself to the utmost, but the full particulars cannot be collated for presentation earlier than Wednesday of next week",26
96,Mr BRENNAN,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,That is a mere admission of failure.,27
97,Mr RODGERS,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"That is an unfair comment. A great organization has hitherto controlled every phase of sugar operation and distribution, and on its advice our foreign purchases have been made. It would have been impossible in a short space of time to substitute for the Colonial Sugar Refining Company any intelligent organization to carry out the same task. - I have only one further statement to add at this stage. Sugar control is a business transaction, which ought to be separatee! from politics. I invite a business, and not political, investigation of all the details. In order that it should not be entirely the duty and responsibility of the Government, and of one Minister, to determine without advioe the price at which sugar should be fixed, there is a Board of Control. That Board has been invited to examine the whole position as existing at the end of the sugar year, and to say at what price it thought sugar should be sold. I have previously mentioned that, except in the first two years, when a profit was made, the object of the Government and of the Board has been to see that the retail price does uot more than cover the costs. The minimum of expense has been incurred. No delay has taken place. Officers have been working at hisch pressure, and all that is humanly possible has been done. I have been informed that the whole of the details covering the foreign purchases-whic h are voluminous-wil l be provided next week. The Government have done their best, therefore, to procurp s»""d purm "" »"" 'nformaticn at the earliest opportunity.",27
98,Mr WATT,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"When will the House be furnished with this information? ' Mr Rodgers - The company hopes that, by Monday, the particulars which they are to furnish will be available. These should reach the Government on Tuesday, and be presented to the House on Wednesday. Beyond saying that, I cannot give a specific undertaking, the fulfilment of which depends on the completion of returns by the company in Sydney.",27
99,Mr FENTON,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"Maribyrnong) [12.41]. - The honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) stated just now that he was still awaiting a statement from the Government. In an earlier speech this session he said he had been promised by the Minister that at the end of June or the beginning of July, a full statement would be made covering the whole of the facts of Government control, and that he was going to wait for*that. The honourable member is still waiting.",27
100,Mr MAXWELL,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,And proposes to do so now until Wednesday ,27
101,Mr FENTON,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"There is no reason, at any rate, why we should need to wait one minute longer for full particulars traversing the whole of the first six years, even if those having to do with the current year cannot be finally made up. What have the Government been doing all this time? Unless they have been very negligent, and have permitted matters to proceed by rule of thumb, there should have been made available full and complete details of all the earlier operations. The excuses of the Minister are paltry. As soon as the House had met this session the Government should have been in a position to place an absolutely covering statement before the country. Why should the Minister take refuge in the assertion that, because the current sugar year has not ended, he cannot supply more than is to be found in his interim balance-sheet?",27
102,Mr MCWILLIAMS,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,Surely the Trade and Customs Department bad some check on the company!,27
103,Mr FENTON,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,I do not believe it had. 1,27

The Minister is taking refuge in a flimsy excuso when he says that the complete balance-sheets will he voluminous, a mass of figures and details,- and will 'tax the financial competency of the best men in this House.

108,Mr RODOISUS,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,I have no excuse; I have given the House the - facts.,28
109,Mr FENTON,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"'ITi e Minister has not dono so. Apparently the Government have not been sufficiently alert, to watch the proceedings of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and.until this agitation over the price of sugar started, had taken no trouble to inquire into details, of the sugar accounts/ If the six years'' accounts have been audited by the Auditor-General, the Minister should be able 'to tell the officers of his Department to hand the figures to him at once, .so-that they could be - presented' to this - House.

The Committee would be able to ascertain whether it would be possible to pay in the sugar industry the wages asked for by the Australian Workers Union, and granted by the Arbitration Court, and yet let the people have sugar at 3d. per lb. As has been said by members of the Opposition many times, there must be a limit below which we may not go in fixing the rate to be charged for commodities if we are to pay the rate of wages whioh must be paid in order to maintain that standard of living which we say is necessary and desirable. The honourable member for Batman said at the public meeting that we want "" cheap sugar, and cheaper sugar-suga r at 3d. per l b . "" I regret that the honourable member for Pawkner (Mr Maxwell) and the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Beat) also were present to support the proposal for a reduction in price, and against a renewal of the agreement.

138,Mr CONSIDINE,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,That was not how deficit was caused.,30
139,Mr HIGGS,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,It certainly was. The House must trust the Government and the Auditor-General.

I put it to those honourable members who, as a result of their rxperionce of the entry of Governments into trading enterprises, are opposed to any further continuance of such activities, that this Sugar Agreement is not on all fours with such enterprises as State butchers' shops, State canning factories, and State cattle stations. My experience is that these activities are, without a doubt, a failure.

The only persous directly employed by - the 'Commonwealth Government - are Colonel ^Oldershaw, a few clerks, and possibly a fewauditors representing Auditor-General. The Commonwealth's control of sugar is quite different from Government ownership as exercised - the State Government of Queensland in the control of fish shops, coal mines, butchers' shops, or cattle stations, where the various individuals working in the shops or coal.mines or on the cattle stations aro directly employed by Government.

148,Mr HIGGS,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,The Labour party are adopting a very wrong attitude on this question. They ought to foe supporting the Government.,32
149,Mr CHARLTON,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,To keep up a price unnecessarily?,32
150,Mr HIGGS,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"They should be supporting the Government by at least keeping silent. They should not be embarrassing the Government or going down to a meeting of protest in the Assembly H all , as the honourable member for Batman (Mr . Brennan) did, saying, "" We want cheap sugar, and still cheaper sngar, and sugar down to 3d. per l b . "" How can we bring down the price of sugar to 3d. per lb. and pay the rate of wages fixed for the sugar workers by the Queensland Arbitration Court presided over by a Judge? The Commonwealth Sugar Council met in Brisbane on 28th February, 1922. There were present at that meeting representatives of the various interests as follows: The State of Queensland-Hon . W. Forgan Smith, Acting Minister for Agriculture and Stock. The Australian Sugar Producers' Association - Growers, Senator Crawford, with Messrs. A . W . Browne and G. H . Pritchard; manufacturers, Messrs. Horace Young, A. Innes, and L . H . D u f f y . The United Cane-growers' Association - Messrs . T. A . Powell, P J. Hoey, and A . Cattermull, M . L . A . The Australian Workers UnionMessrs. W. J . Beardon, M.L.C., W . Dunstan, M.L.O., and F . W . Martyn. The representatives of the Australian Workers Union and the others present met the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr . Eodgers), and asked for a renewal of the agreement. In support of the proposal, Mr Dunstan, speaking for the Australian Workers Union, said that the wages paid in Queensland by the pastoral industry, as shown in the State insurance returns, amounted to £2,600,000 per annum, as compared with £6,000,000 paid by the sugar industry, which gave employment .to about 20,000 men, including 4,000 permanent residents of the southern States, who went to Queensland, and worked there for the season, this employment lasting for about four or six months each year. In view of the importance of the industry to Australia, why did the Leader of the Opposition appoint Mr Frank Brennan to attend the meeting in the Assembly H all , Melbourne, recently to support a resolution moved by Sir Robert Best ?",32
151,Mr BRENNAN,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"That is quite incorrect. I was not appointed for - any such purpose, and you have no right to say I was.",32
152,Mr HIGGS,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"The following is the advertisement of the meeting (see Melbourne Age, ?th July, 1922) :Housewives .Association - Publi c Meeting to Protest Against High Price of Sugar and He-newal of Agreement, Assembly Hall, Collinsstreet, 8 p.m., Monday, 10th July.

153,Mr HIGGS,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"Well , here is the resolution which the honourable member, it must be presumed, although he denies it , went to the meeting to supportThat this meeting of citizens protests against the continued high price of sugar, and declares its uncompromising opposition to the renewal of any sugar agreement necessitating Government _ control; and supports the Housewives Association in the campaign initiated by them in reference thereto. It further records its opinion that Government political control of trade and industry is pernicious and de£ri. mental to producers, manufacturers, and consumers alike.  anything from the speech made by the honourable member for Batman to indicate that he supported that resolution?",32
154,Mr HIGGS,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"Mr Brennan, according to the Age report, was introduoed as the Labour party's official representative. He said that he did not stand for the absolute withdrawal of Government control of a necessary commodity, and sugar was a. necessary commodity, ""and so on. At the conclusion of his address, he remarked that the people should get sugar for 4£d. or 3d. per lb.",32
155,Mr CHARLTON,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"Uncie r the agreement, too.",33
156,Mr MAXWELL,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,Was the member present at that meeting ?,33
157,Mr HIGGS,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"Yes ; and I shall inform honourable members why I came to be Ploughmen there. If the honourable member for BatFarm labou.ers man had done his duty at that meeting, that is, his duty as it is interpreted by Field Workerstbo gentlemen comprising the Grand Supremo Council, which is to take the place of Parliament, he would have spoken in. support of the socialization of industry and against production for profit. But, after all, he did not make his position very clear, as is evidenced by the remarks cf the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell), who followed him, and said that he thought there would be no hope of finding out the attitude of the Labour party on this question Canobycutlers until that party had ascertained what the attitude of the National Government was. All that the honourable member for Batman said' at that meeting was that he wanted cheap sugar.",33
158,Mr CONSIDINE,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,Did you go meeting as a representative of the Australian Workers Union?,33
159,Mr HIGGS,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"No ! I have no-doubt that many members of the Australian Workers Union in Queensland do their level best to put me out of Parliament, but that is no reason why, while here. I should seek to do what T consider is necessary in their own interests. they are wroug in seeking to bring about the socialization of industry and the total abolition of production for profit. Tbat, in my judgment, is impossible. In justice to the honourable member for Batman, arid the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin), who was also at the meeting referred to, I must confess that they did not appear to be very comfortable.",33
160,Mr BRENNAN,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,I was never so happy ab a public meeting in my life.,33
161,Mr HIGGS,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"That , no doubt, w.as because at one stage of the proceedings the honourable member saw me being escorted from the meeting by a policeman. The honourable member, as a student of political economy, knows, of course, that it is impossible to get sugar at 3d. per l b. so long as the industry has to pay the present rate of wages. The following figures as to wages indicate very clearly the position in this respect: - 1901. 1922. honourable (Arril). 12s. 6d. to 30s. to 45s. 20 3. 12s. 6d. to 25s. to 40s. 18s.

162,Mr CONSIDINE,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"Can you say what is the average wage? Mr .HIGGS - The cane .cutters work co-operatively, as a rule, and they get very good money, at the rate awarded by a Judge of the Arbitration Court appointed by the Queensland Labour Government.",33
163,Mr CHARLTON,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,What you are saying is not helping the request for a renewal of the sugar agreement.,33
164,Mr HIGGS,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"I shall allow those engaged in the industry to be the judges in that matter when the campaign is over. They are best able to say whether their position is being helped by the stand I am taking, and the remarks I am making, or, on the other hand, by the action of the honourable member and his party in doing their level, best to embarrass the National Government by sending men down to a protest meeting in Melbourne to object to the renewal of the agreement.",34
165,Mr CHARLTON,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,That is not true so far as wages are concerned.,34
166,Mr HIGGS,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"In the gallery this mornAustralian ing I saw Mr S. D . Walker, a representative of the sugar industry. I am sorry he is not present now, because I desire to make a few observations concerning him. He, too, occupies what I think is a mostinconsistent position. He was present at the so-called meeting of housewives held recently in Melbourne to discuss the sugar question. The Queensland public seems to be under the impression that it was a meeting of housewives only, whereas it was a meeting called by the Housewives Association, and there were about 200 men present. When Mrs Glencross, the president of the association, who occupied the chair, was speaking to me, there was, quite properly, absolute silence; but when I attempted to address her, the audience either hooted, or hissed, or stamped their feet. The audience heard Mrs Glencross when she said that my conduct was "" shocking or vulgar,"" but when I pleaded with her to be allowed to put before the meeting the Queensland view, they would not listen to me. As the newspaper reports will show, I waited u n t i l the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best), the honourable member for Henty (Mr Francis), and the honourable member for Yarra. (Mr Scullin), as well as Mrs James, country representative of the Housewives Association, had spoken. I waited also for the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) to speak. I then thought it was time to put to the meeting the Queensland view. I therefore rose and said, "" Lady President, would you allow a Queenslander to say a few words on this subject?"" Mrs Glencross smiled very sweetly and replied, "" I cannot allow you to speak now, but if at the end of the meeting there is time, I will allow a Queenslander to speak for a few moments."" Thereupon I sat down [45] and waited. The honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) followed up my request by stating, very kindly and properly, that in his opinion the case for Queensland should be allowed to be put to the meeting. A f t e r he had resumed his seat I again rose and asked permission to speak, but Mrs Glencross declined to hear me. I had supplied her with a copy of the amendment that I desired to move, and which was as follows: That this meeting believes in the policy of a White Australia, and is in favour of the continuance of the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement on such terms as will enable the public to obtain sugar at a reasonable price and permit of the manufacturers, refiners, millers, and sugar-cane growers and their employees receiving an adequate return for their labour, and a return on the capital invested in the allied sngar industries. I also handed a copy of the amendment to the press. Mrs Glencross, having read it , passed it on to Sir Robert Best, Mr . Maxwell, Mr Brennan, Mr Scullin, and Mrs James. Then, turning to me, and smiling once again very sweetly, she said, ' ' Mr Higgs, I cannot allow you to move that amendment.""",34
167,Sir ROBERT BEST,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"Sh e also said, "" But I will allow you to speak.""",34
168,Mr HIGGS,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"Sh e said, "" If there is time at the end of the meeting, I will allow you to speak for a few moments."" She insisted upon putting the motion to the meeting, and would not even allow my amendment to be read. As it was a public meeting to protest against the sugar agreement, and inasmuch as it was intended to use the resolutions nassed thereat to influence the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) in his public actions, and, if possible, to bring about the termination of the agreement, I , as a Queenslander, thought it necessary to insist upon being allowed to speak. I have been very much misrepresented in the matter. The suggestion is that I was rude to Mrs Glencross. I would not be rude to any lady. I pleaded with Mrs Glencross for permission to address the meeting, and when she refused I spoke to the reporters. Mrs Glencross then said to the press, "" I hope the press will not take down what Mr Higgs is saying."" I replied. "" Oh, lady president, you cannot gag the press."" A lady journalist, writin g in the last issue of Women about this meeting, set out the motion proposed by Sir Robert Best as well as my amendment. Sbe went on to say that the incident was very regrettable, and that a little savoir faire on the part of both parties would have prevented it . May I say, in reply, that a public meeting is not a drawing-room causerie. I could not permit such a motion to be put without protest. I suppose I should have been more gracious had I bowed to the instructions given by my honourable friends, Sir Robert Best, Mr Maxwell, Mr Brennan, and Mr Scullin to Mrs. Glencross, and have left the meeting.",34
169,Mr HUGHES,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,Not at all.,35
170,Mr HIGGS,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"As the Prime Minister the honourable member for that suggests by his interjection, that would not have been sufficient; I could not surrendered my position in that way. And so I spoke to the reporters. I am sorry that Mr S. D . Walker, the Queensland sugar representative bourne, is not present, because I find that in a telegram from Melbourne, which appeared in his newspaper, the Bundaberg Daily News on 13 th July, it is stated in reference to the incident thatThe incident was most unfortunate grettable, especially as the speeches of Messrs. Brennan and Scullin had exercised a distinct steadying influence on the mind of the ing in regard to the question of control. Though the resolution in any case would have otherwise, been carried, it would have gone through in a much more temperate mood than actually each prevailed. The incident also operated against the Hon. T. W. Crawford's remarks, and pregrowers; cluded Mr S. D. Walker from being accorded the opportunity promised him by the woman to make a brief statement. This message was sent by either Mr Walker or some one on his behalf. are that Mr Walker was present at the meeting, but had neither the the resource, nor the courage to back me Crawford. up. Evidently, he did not even think of speaking until I rose, and it is not true, as stated in his newspaper, that the woman promised to allow him to make brief statement. She did nothing kind. Mrs Glencross, referring to Walker, said, "" I hear Mr Walker is down here representing the terests. I do not know what he is doing. Whatever it is it must be done sub rosa."" Either Mr Walker himself or some ness."" one on his behalf is to misrepresent the attitude of Queensland Nationalist representatives in this Parliament. Many statements been made in his newspaper the effect that if the representatives of Queensland had only done their duty during the last eighteen months there would have been no protest against the sugar agreement. I would like the Prime Minister to say whether the representatives of Queensland in this Parliament-Nationalists , Labour, and Country party members alike-hav e not done their best for the sugar industry, and whether, after all, the sugar agreement is not the outcome of the work done by Queensland members.",35
171,Sir ROBERT BEST,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,It is very much so.,35
172,Mr HIGGS,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,I am much obliged to interjection. Is there an honourable member who have could have done more than the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser) has done for the sugar industry 1,35
173,Mr FOWLER,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,Non e save the honourable in Melmember for Capricornia himself.,35
174,Mr HIGGS,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"My native modesty stands in the way of my claiming any credit for myself. But, perhaps, in view of the attempts to discredit me, I should mention that twelve years ago (10th and reAugust, 1910), I moved the following motion in the House of Representatives meet- (see Hansard, page 2089, 1910)That a Royal Commission, parliamentary or be appointed to inquire into the sugar industry, such Commission to consist, if practicable, of at least one representative of of the following interests:-(1 ) the general public; (2) the wage-earners; (3) the (4) the millers; (5) the refiners. That motion led to the appointment of chairthe Royal Commission which brought about the abolition of the sugar excise. The facts Another who has done splendid work for the industry and is its principal chaminitiative, pion in the Federal Parliament is Senator Mr Walker was sent down here to try to secure a continuation of the agreement. chairIs he likely to do any good with the a Commonwealth Government by attacking of the it and its Leader in his newspaper, the Mr Bundaberg Daily News, as he does from week to week, referring to the Prime Minsugar inister as a man who makes attacks in "" political party venom, and voiced in a mostunwarrantable spirit of spitefulendeavouring",35
175,Mr CHARLTON,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"In justice to Mr. Walker, does the honourable member know have that he furnished the report to which he to has referred ?",35
176,Mr HIGGS,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,I have said that either Mr Walker or some one on his behalf sent it to his newspaper.,36
177,Mr CHARLTON,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,But the member is now saying that Mr Walker has made attacks on the Prime Minister.,36
178,Mr HIGGS,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"I said that his newspaper was attacking the Government and the Prime Minister from week to week. Mr Walker is the editor, and, I understand, has a considerable control, by way of shares, of the ownership of the paper.",36
179,Mr LAIRD SMITH,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,Is he a supporter of the Queensland Labour party?,36
180,Mr HIGGS,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"At all events, he is loquing in Melbourne with one of the extremists, Mr FJ . Riley, who has also misrepresented me in the Daily Standard because at the public meeting of protest I drew attention to the presence of Labour members on the platform.",36
181,Mr HILL,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"He is a very honourable man. Mr HIGGS,-Of course, we are all honourable men. I have here some evidence that Mr Walker is supplying some one with news which, to my mind, misrepresents me. In the Daily News, of Bundaberg, of 31st July, there appeared a report of a meeting of the sugar in terests, called for the ""urpose of considering whether, some one should be sent to Melbourne to help Mr WALKER Mr Wyper said an instance of the care that should be exercised in connection with the southern campaign was provided some few days ago. They had all read of Mr Higgs' experience at a meeting held by Mrs Glencross in Melbourne. It was Mr Walker's opinion that Mr Higgs' move there did a great deal of damage. If the meeting had progressed under ordinary conditions, Mr Walker would have been afforded an opportunity of addressing the meeting, and it would have been more effective than the attitude adopted by Mr Higgs. Mrs A . W . Glencross did not promise to allow Mr Walker to speak. She said at the meeting when calling on Senator Crawford, "" I am unable to allow you (Mr Walker) to speak, because I promised Senator Crawford months ago that he would have an opportunity of speaking at our meeting."" Evidently Mr . Walker has written suggesting, what is not a fact, that my move did a great deal of damage. The fact is that Mr Walker and others have been trying to damage the Queensland National Federal members. But he had not the pluck to do as I did ; he had not the courage to object and take a risk of being put out of the meeting. My attitude was honourable taken to demonstrate to the people of Australia that this meeting was merely a move on the part of a few people in Victoria. There were, after all the months of agitation and the expenditure of large sums, only about 500 people present out of a population in Austraha of over 5,000,000. I believe that the ether day Mrs Glencross called a meeting, and, because it was raining, no one attended. She blamed the women of Victoria, I believe, for their failure to "" roll up "" ; but col- that was a bad political move. Mr . Walker possesses an air of lofty superiority. He called a meeting the other day in the Assembly H all , Melbourne, and he was so full of conceit",36
182,Mr MCWILLIAMS,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,That is not playing the game by a man who is not present.,36
183,Mr HIGGS,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) was not in Bundaberg when Mr Walker attacked him. Mr . Walker has been sent down to Victoria, I understand, as a Government official. It is said that he is paid by the Queensland Government to represent the sugar industry. One would have thought that, prior to calling a public meeting in Melbourne, he would have approached the six Queensland senators and the ten Queensland members of the House of Representatives; but he said nothing, apparently to > any one of us. Mr Walker advertised his meeting, and, when he appeared on .the platform, there were only thirty people present out of a Melbourne population of 700,000. The attendance afterwards in creased to sixty persons. He said, "" I have not bothered about getting a chairman; I hope the meeting will elect one."" There was dead silence for a time. Then he repeated his request, when somebody said, "" You don't want, a chairman at a meeting like this; go on with your speech."" Mr Walker, it is said, had his address written out ; and, no doubt, he had a lot of information to give. But when he got away from his written notes to answer the many questions that were asked, he became quite embarrassed.

And , when he seeks, in this, his pre-election address, make assertions regarding piece-work as applied to the sugar cane workers, without adding any references to the amount earned under those rates, he is altogether misleading. It is quite wrong for him to quote rates for any piece-work without supplementing the with information which would enable us to judge what it is possible for the average man to earn at those rates.

It may be that, when an election takes place within a few months, a reconstruction will take place.",39
216,Mr FRANCIS,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,Suga r is a much sweeter subject than that.,39
217,Mr CONSIDINE,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"No doubt the honourable member thinks so when he contemplates the strenuous battle that is ahead of him. The amendment now before the House is not much different from previous motions launched against the Administration; it merely discloses another phase of the ineptitude and mismanagement of the Government, to say the least. The peculiarity is that the Government, in this instance, are endeavouring through the Minister in charge of the House to prove the great benefits honourable that the Australian public have derived from Government control of sugar. Yet only a few short days ago they were pointing out all the evils that arise from Government interference with private enterprise, and the same honourable gentlemen who were supporting the Government in getting r i d of a Government undertaking, which showed a clear profit, and was a benefit to the people, now support them in preaching the virtues of Government control. Apparently it does not matter what attitude the Government take; if the Ministers say that Government control is good in the interests of the people, although it has created a honourable good healthy deficit, honourable' members opposite will support them; if , on the other hand, the Government say, "" There shall be no interference with private enterprise, and we shall sell the woollen mills at Geelong, although they are making and have made a good prof it , "" honourable members opposite will line up behind them, and say, "" The Government have said so, and what honourable they say must be correct."" Everything that has taken place from week to week, and session to session, merely confirms the opinion I formed when I entered the House that the professions of honourable members opposite are so much camouflage. No matter what names sections of members may give to themselves, there are really only two parties in the countryone, that safeguards the vested interests of the exploiters of the country, such as the sugar crowd and the steel crowd, and their various ramifications through the realms of finance",39
218,Mr HILL,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"What does the honourable member mean by "" steel ""?",39

The workers in the portion of Australia. I represent know full well my attitude; so do the other interests in the electorate, and they will not suspect me of supporting the Government.",39
222,Mr WATT,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,The honourable member has never hitherto been suspected of that.,40
223,Mr CONSIDINE,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"And no matter what set of men are on the Treasury bench, carrying out legislation similar to that carried out by the present Government, or refraining from putting into operation legislation that might have been of benefit to the great mass of the people, they will not be supported by me if I should be returned to the House again.",40
224,Mr WATT,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,I am opening a book on that.,40
225,Mr CONSIDINE,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"I dare say the honourable member is. The bookmakers always win, and the honourable member generally plays safe.

226,Mr RODGERS,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"The honourable member means that he is against the Government, right or wrong.",40
227,Mr CONSIDINE,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"No ; but I am opposed to the interests that control the Government. I do not blame honourable members opposite, because I know they cannot help themselves; what they do is the price they have to pay for their political existence.",40
228,Mr RODGERS,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,Does the member say that it is more blessed to receive than to give?,40
229,Mr CONSIDINE,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"No doubt the Minister for Trade and Customs, like those who have preceded him in that office, thinks that the position he occupies could not be better filled, and he is naturally anxious to remain in a position in which it has pleased God, or the Minister, to place him. Therefore he see nothing wrong with the Administrafore tion, although he may have as little in the acts of the Administration as have other Cabinet Ministers, except the Prime Minister. What, does it matter ! The Prime Minister is sick; very well, nobody can do anything. That has been illustrated from time to time. The dictatorship established during the war has been kept going, and no doubt will continue until the people make the necessary alterations in the personnel of the Government. Even then, although the outward form may be altered, the power behind the throne, "" the hidden hand,"" to which the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey) referred, will continue is real control of the Government of the country.  for Bourke had his hand behind his back when he spoke.",40

233,Mr FLEMING,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"Robertson) [ 3 . 3 0 ] - I rise to say only a few words in reply to the statement made by the honourable member for Maribyrnong this morning regarding what - is supposed to have occurred in the room of the Public Accounts Committee. I do not think it is proper to discuss in the House what takes place in the Committee-room, but since what the honourable member sa d was only part of the picture, let me give the whole of it . The honourable member accused the honourable member for Swan (Mr . Prowse) and myself of making use of information which we had acanired from the Public Accounts Committee meeting. honourable Mn. FENTON - I said nothing of the kind.",40
234,Mr FLEMING,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"The honourable member said that we acquired the pabulum at the Public Accounts Committee meeting, and made use of it in the chamber.",40
235,Mr FENTON,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,That is so.,40
236,Mr FLEMING,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"It is not true. The Public Accounts Committee, discussing Prime what their next line of investigation can should be, had one or two Questions bethem, one being a proposed inquiry say into the sugar account. The honourable member for Swan opposed that proposal, because he said that an inquiry into that matter would last too long, and I opposed it very definitely on the ground that it was a political issue which had yet to be fought out on the floor of the House. Later ou, when I saw that the Committee was inclined to deal with the sugar question I protested again most vigorously on exactly the same ground, namely, that a finance Committee's duty was to deal with accounts, and that the Committee should not permit itself to be drawn into live political questions not yet settled ""on the floor of the House. It was the right attitude for me to take up, and it was distinctly improper for the honourable member for Maribyrnong to come here and misrepresent members of the Committee.",40
237,Mr FRANCIS,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"He n t y ) [3.32] - The consumers have every right to protest against the present price of sugar if they find that the figures as presented justify them in' doing so. The Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Rodgers) resents the criticism which has been directed towards the accounts he presented. hold the Minister responsible for the confused condition of those accounts would be to treat him unjustly, because the control of sugar has but recently come into his hands. A lot of side issues have been introduced into the debate. As a matter of fact, the agreement itself is not an issue in today's debate. It must r its full course no matter whether the Government find it possible to reduce the price of sugar or not. The evidence of experts, whose opinion we must accept in matters of this sort, is sufiicient to indicate that, long before the time promised by the Government, there should be a reduction in price, and I voted for the amendment to reduce the price to 4^d. per lb. from the 7th August. W it h the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr . Maxwell), I am disgusted at the withholding of the exact position. The Minister says that it has been very difficult for him to complete his statement, and that his officers have sat up nearly all night to enable him to present a report to the House. If that is the case those who are responsible for the preparation of the accounts must have commenced their operations at a very late stage. Nothing affects the household bill more than does the price of sugar. The extra l ^ d . per lb. makes a vital difference to housewives. We are told that our W h it e Australian policy may be endangered if we fix the pnce. of sugaii at less than 6d. per l b . , and that all sections concerned in the growing, refining, and retailing of sugar are represented upon the Sugar Council; but the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) has told us that the present agreement does not affect the price of sugar; that is to say, even if the price is reduced to 4Ad. per l b . , the agreement, as I said before, must run on u n t i l it expires. I am opposed to Government trading. The entry of the Commonwealth into business activities might have been justified in the circumstances of the war; but it is a policy which should not be continued in times of peace. The Minister for Trade and Customs asks us to treat the sugar agreement as a business, and not as a political, concern. I do not know how he draws the line. The people of Victoria claim that there ought to be a reduction in the price of sugar. That makes it a political matter. I have the highest regard for the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr . Corser), but as other honourable members To have frequently said, he regards the sugar question only from the Queensland point of view. On the other hand, it has never been my desire to block the progress of any Australian industry, primary or secondary, wherever situated. I would rather give every industry the fullest possible assistance. Undoubtedly, the sugar u n industry is a great asset to the community, just as the cotton industry is very likely to be. But while Queensland members have made out a very good case from the State or political point of view, the Minister says that we must treat this question from a business, and not from a political stand-point. Since the Queensland members seek to bolster up the claims of their State, because the sugar is grown in that part of Australia, representatives of other States are entitled to say that, while they are prepared to contribute their share of taxation towards the maintenance of all Australian industries, they do not propose to penalize the consumers of sugar by compelling them tp pay a high price for the commodity, not only to keep the industry flourishing, but also to keep up the wages of the workers engaged in it , and the profits of the sugar refiners and middlemen. I do not agree with the cry, "" Let us bring down the workingman's wages."" But it is not right to hold up the bogy that if the price of sugar is fixed at 4 | d . , the workers engaged in the sugar industry must have their wages cut down to a starvation rate. There is no need to raise that cry in this Honse. Too often we have these pistols thrust at our heads. If sugar is supplied at a fair market price honourable members say that it will mean a reduction of wageS. I am satisfied that the workers of Queensland will not readily submit to any reduction in wages, and, . on information which has been placed at my disposal by a compotent authority, I believe that the Government could reduce the price of sugar to 4£d. per lb. on"" 1st September without jeopardizing the sugar finances in any way. We all admit that during the war the Government were confronted with very great difficulties, and that in the main they were successful in their several pooling and control arrangements. But the position now is entirely different. It is necessary to find a market for our products, and it is essential that in the relinquishing of Government control the loss should be as light as possible. The Government should now be in a position to allow householders to obtain this most essential commodity at a more reasonable price than obtains at present. A good deal has been said about the meeting recently held in Melbourne to protest against the present price of sugar, and I feel satisfied that as a result of the discussion in this House during the last two days the Government will agree to a reduction before the 1st November. It is all very well for some wealthy members of this Parliament to say that a shilling or two more per week does not count. ' In the majority of homes a few shillings extra per week is a consideration, and, therefore, it should be the duty of the Government to provide this necessary commodity at the lowest possible price.",41
238,Mr MCGRATH,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"Are you "" stonewalling "" the motion? '",42
239,Mr FRANCIS,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"I have no wish to do that. My desiie is to see the interests of all concerned adequately safeguarded. I deprecate any attempt to pit one section, of the community or one industry against another. I trust that the Government will see that the price of sugar is reduced immediately, if not to 4£d., at least to 4 | d . Debate (on motion by Mr. S MITH ) adjourned. [46] . DEFENCE RETIREMENT BILL.

241,Mr HUGHES,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"Bendigo-Prime M i nister) [3.59] - I move That the House do now adjourn. As the Government wall require Supply by the 18th August, I intimate that unless honourable members can give us an assurance that the Bill will be passed by Wednesday week, I shall have to ask the House to meet on Tuesday. Honourable members will admit that the other branch of - the Legislature should have a reasonable opportunity to discuss Supply. On the last occasion members of another place were asked to consider the Bill at such an hour that really precluded anyLAIBD thing like leisured discussion, I also desire to intimate that the Treasurer will make his Budget statement prior to the debate on Supply.' We shall meet either on Tuesday or Wednesday as (he circumstances may require. That is to say, if the House can give the Government an assurance that we can obtain Supply by Wednesday night, well and good; if not, we shall meet on Tuesday.",42

244,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY,"Illawarra) [4.1] - A day or two ago the honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley) asked a question without notice, in the course of which he implied that the Sydney branch of the Repatriation Department was acting as an agent for "" scabs "" in the pastoral industry. Inquiries have been made into the matter. It appears that a soldier called at the Repatriation Department, and asked for a letter of introduction to the Graziers Association in order that he might reply to. an advertisement in the press for a vacancy that was offering. That is the only case that can be traced in Sydney of any connection between the Employment Bureau of the Repatriation Department and any pastoral organization whatever. It affords an excellent illustration of the slight foundation upon which most serious allegations can be made by some honourable members in this House. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 4.3 p.m.",43
