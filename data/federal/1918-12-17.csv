3,Mr WATT,Unknown,"The business paper conveys a very clear idea of the desire of the Government with regard to the measures to be passed this year. After the introductionof the Conciliation and .Arbitration Bill we shall ,prooeed with the debate on the first item of the Estimates and then with the consideration of the Estimates.",21
4,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,To be passed before Christmas ?,21
5,Mr WATT,Unknown,Most decidedly. There need be no doubt in the honourable member's mind as to that.,21
6,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Does - that statement apply also to the fourth item on the business-paper in regard to the debate on the Ministerial statement respecting the report of the Royal Commission on Navy and Defence administration ?,21
7,Mr WATT,Unknown,That depends oh circumstances. Other matters depend more or less on.the progress made.,21
8,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,The Government propose to pass this session the Chief Justice's Pension Bill?,21
9,Mr WATT,Unknown,"Yes . The honourable member, having sat for many years on the Treasury bench"" knows that the number of items which we can discharge""' depends to some extent on the progress made. I am hopeful that we shall be able to rise by Thursday or Friday next, at the latest. .",21
10,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"Can the Acting Prime Minister state today when the first payment for the coming season's wheat will be made, and what the amount will be?",21
11,Mr WATT,Unknown,"I dealt with that question yesterday in reply to an inquiry by the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Sampson). I then intimated that negotiations were proceeding with the financial institutions concerned with regard to the ,payment of the guarantee money. I hope to be able some time this week to make a statement on the subject. SALE OF COPPER.",21
12,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,Can the Acting Prime Minister give the House any further information as to the position in regard to the sale of Australian copper ?,22
13,Mr WATT,Unknown,I have no more recent cable messages than those to which I referred on the occasion of the last inquiry by the honourable member. ARTIFICIAL CANE-MAKING MACHINERY.,22
14,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"I was informed last week that on behalf of the Repatriation Department some artificial canemaking machinery, intended for the employment of returned soldiers, had been purchased. The sum mentioned to me as having been paid for the patent rights and for two machines, which I understand have never been tested in any country, was so large",22
15,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Fift y thousand pounds, was it not?",22
16,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"I am told that that was the price paid for the patent rights, in addition to nearly £20,000 paid for the machinery. In view of the rather murky atmosphere in which we are living just now, will the Acting Prime Minister have the papers laid on the table for the information of honourable members?",22
17,Mr WATT,Unknown,"I do not know to what the honourable member is referring when he speaks of a "" murky atmosphere "" ; can only assume that it is a descriptive statement.",22
18,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,We have had some trouble lately.,22
19,Mr WATT,Unknown,But I beg leave to say that the honourable member has no right to allude to that matter in connection with this question.,22
20,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,Certainl y not. merely want the matter to be cleared up.,22
21,Mr WATT,Unknown,"The Minister for Repamuneration triation (Senator Millen) made a full ployment. statement to the press last week on the matter to which the honourable member refers. If my honourable friend desires to deners ? see the papers relating to it, I will confer with the Minister concerned. [350]- 2 Later. Mr Bruce .SMITH - As a matter of personal explanation, I should like to assure the Acting Prime Minister that I had no desire to associate the term ""murky atmosphere"" with the subject matter of my question. If the honourable gentleman will study the phraseology of my question he will see that I used the expression as a justification for clearing up these rumours the moment they are circulated.",22
22,Mr WATT,Unknown,Perhaps the honourable gentleman did not see the full statement on the subject made by the Minister last week.,22
23,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"No , I did not. I want to dissociate my use of the phrase to which the honourable gentleman took exception from the subject-matter of my question. It is as well to clear up such matters aa soon as reference is made to them in order to prevent the circulation of such rumours. NA SERVANTS. _ Mr FINLAYSON - In view of the fact that the State Government have announced that to all employees of the State Parliament House who are receiving less than £200 per annum a bonus of £10 will be given at Christmas, I wish to ask you, Mr Speaker, whether the position of the lower paid assistants and messengers on the House staff has received any conI sideration, and whether the House Committee will consider the desirableness of granting them a bonus at Christmas?",22
24,Mr SPEAKER,BONUS FOR PARLIAMENTARY,"I have had under consideration something of the nature suggested by the honourable member in view of the increased cost of commodities due to war conditions during the past year, but am not prepared to state off-hand what will be done.

Mr MoWILLIAMS.^Some rather serious statements appear in today's newspapers in regard to the treatment of returned soldiers now in quarantine in Western Australia. It would appear that messages have been sent to a member of the Government with regard to the position of these men, which is said to be most deplorable, and I ask the Minister in charge of quarantine whether any official inquiries have been made?",22
26,Mr MASSYGREENE,BONUS FOR PARLIAMENTARY,"If the honourable member refers to statements that have been-made in regard to the men on the B>oonah, now in quarantine, I can tell the House exactly what the position is.",23
27,Mr MOWIIXIAMS,BONUS FOR PARLIAMENTARY,"Hear , hear.",23
28,Mr MASSYGREENE,BONUS FOR PARLIAMENTARY,"The Boonah arrived at Fremantle with something like 400 cases of influenza on board. Every step was taken to immediately transfer the sufferers to the shore. The rest of the men, in their own interests, were left on the Boonah until such time as we could clear up the case. It has been suggested that it would have been very much better to take them off the vessel and to place them on an island, on the ground that the ship itself is infected. Our medical advisers tell us that this disease differs materially from the plague, in that while the plague may be conveyed by inanimate objects on a vessel, Spanish influenza cannot. has to be conveyed by e-intact with a person who is actually suffering from the disease. The medical officers say that by means of an inspection made twice daily-whic h they ean adequately carry out on board, with the men under control - the y can clear up the disease faT more :rapidly than would be possible if the men were given liberty on an island, where they could not be rapidly collected. The experience we have had so far in dealing with various ships that have been quarantined upon arrival in Australia has borne out that statement. In every case within three or four days at the outside we have been able to clean up Price a ship, and there have been no further cases. The course followed is, ON further, in the interests of the men, in that as soon as we arrive at a iiage-whic h in the case of the Boonah we expect will be reached tomorrow or the next day, if our experience of that vessel is the same as that of others-whe n there are no further cases reported, the ship will be immediately sent away from Fremantle in quarantine to the other States, and it will be possible for the men to be released in time to get to their homes by Christmas. If we were to adopt the' course suggested, of taking the men off the vessel, it would take longer to clear up the case, and there would not be the slightest chance that the men would be able to reach their homes by Christmas.",23
29,Mr TUDOR,BONUS FOR PARLIAMENTARY,"I ask the Minister whether it is correct, as has been stated, that a number of these men broke quarantine by seizing boats, and that they were subsequently captured by tugs on their way to the shore with the boats in a very, leaky condition? If the statement be true, the Minister will recognise that it is serious on two accounts-the breaking of quarantine, and the fact that the men were jeopardizing their lives.",23
30,Mr MASSYGREENE,BONUS FOR PARLIAMENTARY,"We have some information in regard to the incident referred to, but it 'was connected, not with the Boonah, but with another vessel, which arrived at Fremantle and had to undergo a short period of quarantine, as I exIt plained to the House yesterday to clear the case up. There was no case of influenza on board that vessel, but it was thought well to make certain that none of the meu on board were carriers of the disease. Every ship that comes to Australia under present circumstances, is put through a short period, of quarantine to enable that to be done. The men referred to were arrested on their way to the shore;- they had been duly .quarantined, and there is now no further trouble in connection with that incident. BUTTER POOL.",23
31,Mr CO,BONUS FOR PARLIAMENTARY,RSER - I ask the Minister for Fixing if he is in a position to make any report to the House in the matter of the payment of balances for butter by the I m p e r i al Government at the arranged rate of 19s. per cwt. ?,23
32,Mr MASSYGREENE,BONUS FOR PARLIAMENTARY,"I have received a - cable to the effect that the Ministry Food in England notified the High missioner that the amount of 19s. per cwt. as the surplus profit on last season's would be paid over almost immediately. The whole of the shipments of last season's butter have been approved. A p p l i cation has been made by the Treasury for immediate payment. We have not yet received payment, but I anticipate that we will do so shortly, and that we shall be In a position to pay over, through the Butter Pool Committee, the balances due to the various factories early in the year at the latest.

36,Mr GREGORY,WAR TIME PROFITS TAX,There ought to be other than a departmental inquiry.  been arrived at as to any further inquiry. All the reports we have had point to the of fact that everything was done that it Comwas necessary to do before the boat left Australia.

37,Mr FINLAYSON,EMBARGO ON POSTAGE OF NEWSPAPERS,"I ask the Postmaster-General whether the embargo upon the postage of newspapers to members of new the Australian Imperial Force abroad still operates, and if so, when it may be expected to be removed ?",24
38,Mr WEBSTER,EMBARGO ON POSTAGE OF NEWSPAPERS,"That is a matter which rests with the Imperial authorities. As soon as they indicate' that the embargo is removed, I shall have much pleasure in resuming the conditions which up obtained previous to - the imposition of NA ORGANIZATION S. BALANCE-SHEETS : COMMONWEALTH LIN E PAPER. OF STEAMERS.",24
39,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALT H COMMERCIAL,"I ask the Acting Prime Minister if he can inform the House whether further progress has been made in obtaining the balance-sheets of the Commonwealth Commercial enterprises, and especially of the CommonWe have not i th had a real balance-sheet, such as an acto tuary or accountant would provide, since time the Prime Minister bought the Commonwhether wealth steamers some years ago.",24
40,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALT H COMMERCIAL,"Speakin g from memory, to I do not know what state of preparation has been reached in connection with the boat balance-sheet of the Commonwealth line of steamers. I shall refer to the office ascertain the position. Most of the balance-sheets of the other organizations t . referred to have already been laid down on lines recommended by outside accountants, who are specially qualified. The Government will see that the promise made in this connection will be observed. ADJOURNMENT (Formal). COPPER MARKET .",24
41,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALT H COMMERCIAL," I have received from the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr . Higgs) an intimation that he desires to move the adjournment of the House to call attention to a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, "" the failure on the part of the Prime Minister to keep the Government informed as to the position in regard to copper."" Five honourable members having in their places, Question proposed.""",25
42,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALT H COMMERCIAL,"Capricornia) [11.20] - I assure honourable members that only the extreme urgency of this matter prompts me to occupy the time of the House in this way at such a late hour of the session. Honourable members will recollect that for many months past. I have endeavoured to get, through the Acting Prime Minister, relief for the copper producers. I asked the honourable gentleman if he would ascertain from the Prime Minister if Australian copper producers would be allowed to sell their product to Allied markets if the British Government declined to buy after the 31st December next. The Acting Prime Minister endeavoured to get the in formation, and he either told the House on his own account or conveyed an intimation from the Prime Minister that it would be time enough for the producers to ask to be allowed to sell their copper to Allied countries when the British Government definitely refused to buy after the 31st December, 1918. About a week ago, the Acting Prime Minister told us that the Prime Minister was endeavouring to sell copper to the British Government up to the 30th June next year, or for three months after the war, whichever period was the longer. This_ morning I asked the Acting Prime Minister whether he had anv information in regard to copper, and he replied that he had received no word from the Prime Minister since that intimation came to hand. I read in this morning's press information which will have proved very profitable to some people, and very unprofitable to others. In the Age appears this statementThe latest London metal quotations show A fall of about £12 per ton, to £112 per ton,, in the rate for "" standard"" copper on. both> positions, while electrolytic has dropped £11, to £134 per ton. It is stated that this is due to "" official control of the metal having been released."" Upwards of 800 Hampden-Cloncurry shares changed hands at the lower price of 13s. 6d., while Mount Cuthbert, after free quittance between 2s. 9d. and 2s. Od., finished upon offers at 2s. in a wide market. The Mount Cuthbert shares have fallen during the last two weeks from 12s. to 2s. r due largely, I admit, to labour troublesrisen and the presence of Industrial Workers of the World wasters on the mines of No r t h ern Queensland, but due partly to the u n certain position in regard to copper. The Prime Minister in London is supposed, in conjunction with Sir Joseph Cook, to beattending to the interests of Australian metal producers, but the Government know absolutely nothing about the fact that theImperial Government have released control of copper, and that there is apparently a free market all over the world. Doesnot that disclose a serious state of affairs ?",25
43,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALT H COMMERCIAL,How ?,25
44,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALT H COMMERCIAL,"It is serious that people on the Stock Exchange can get in for m a tion which ought to have come as soon as possible from the British Government to the Commonwealth Government so that everybody interested Would be in an equally good position. As it is, some men have had the opportunity of selling their shares to unsuspecting people.",25
45,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALT H COMMERCIAL,That would have happened? no matter how the information came through.. The cable shows that when the British Government made the announcement the market at once fell.,25
46,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALT H COMMERCIAL,"The Argus says-rThe announcement that the Imperial Government had released its control over the market for copper, and that the electrolyticmetal had fallen £11 in price, to £124 per ton, was contained in a cable message received during the afternoon by the Australian Metal Exchange. It is apparent that somebody in Australia can receive cables regarding the position of copper before the Australian Government could get the information. Car* the Acting Prime Minister defend that position ?",25
47,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALT H COMMERCIAL,"Howeve r the announcement was made, the f all in price would be instantaneous.",26
48,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALT H COMMERCIAL,"-Information regarding the copper position ought to be known by the Commonwealth Government as soon as possible, and the Acting Prime Minister ought to have been able to in form all holders of shares in copper companies at once, so that they could please themselves as to whether they sold out their shares or held them. But certain people have been able to get this information in advance, and being in doubtas to the future of copper, and as to whether the mines would continue to pay at the lower prices, they have been able to sell their shares to unsuspecting people, who were not possessed of that informat i o n.",26
49,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALT H COMMERCIAL,I understand that the information was posted as soon as it was known.,26
50,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALT H COMMERCIAL,How has the Acting Prime Minister discovered that?,26
51,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALT H COMMERCIAL,I believe that is the practice of the Stock Exchange.,26
52,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALT H COMMERCIAL,"The fact remains that when I asked the Acting Prime Minister a. question this morning he did not know anything about the copper position. I say that is wrong. I may be complaining too much of the actions of the Prime Minister, but I feel that he is responsible in this matter, and that it is my public - duty to call the attention of the House and the country to his neglect.",26
53,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALT H COMMERCIAL,"Balaclava-Actin g Prime Minister and Treasurer) [11.28] - I find very littl e to object to in the earlier remarks of"" the honourable member; they were a brief r is u m i of what has taken place in this House from time to time. W it h him, I lament the fact that we have not been able to persuade the British Government to extend our copper contracts to 30th June next. But I am. satisfied that the Prime Minister has done his best, in difficult circumstances, to get an extension, beyond the 31st December. To ask him to do impossibilities when the war is over, and the control is not in Britain's hands-for America controls the copper market-is absurd. have sent to the Department for the latest information. I have not vet received the papers, but as far as I am aware, no information has reached the Government within the last few hours. During recent months, we have been constantly compelled to take our information from the newspaper cables, which have, in certain cases, been subsequently confirmed by cables sent from the Secretary of State for the Colonies through the ordinary channels, or by direct cable from the Prime M in ister. The cable lines are in a very congested and unsatisfactory state. Frequently three days have elapsed between the despatch and the receipt in the case of cables sent by the Prime Minister.",26
54,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALT H COMMERCIAL,Many private cable messages are three weeks in transit.,26
55,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALT H COMMERCIAL,"I am aware of the position in regard to private cables, but M in isterial advices are supposed to be "" clearthe-line cables""; that is,' Government messages of importance are supposed to be given a certain amount of priority. Nevertheless, whether coming by the Eastern or Pacific route, it is not uncommon for them to take three or four days from the time of lodging to the time of receipt at their destination. It is all too frequent for it to take .a week or more to get a. reply now to a cable. We have had numberless cases of that k in d in the past, but we are not responsible for it , nor can we control it . The British Government, through its press bureau and its method of publicity, is responsible for the way it sends its information abroad. Frequently we get it through the press first, and lately that method of public announcement of news has been increasing in frequency. No one can blame the Prime Minister for that. It may be that there is a cablegram en route, but the last wire which I had made it perfectly clear that he was doing all he could, and expected to succeed, in connection with copper. If the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) so desires, I shall be glad to show hi m the copper file, showing exactly what cables have been exchanged, because there is nothing to hide about the matter. All the Government were interI ested in doing was to stabilize the industry during the war, and, if possible, to get a contract which would project itself into post-war times, until the market attained normal conditions, and the copper producer knew exactly where he stood.",26
56,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALT H COMMERCIAL,"Would it not have been, a graceful act on the part of the British vernment to inform the Prime Minister that it could not make the contract, and so give the copper producers ample notice of the intention to make a free market in copper ?",27
57,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALT H COMMERCIAL,"I do not know whether the British Government have done so or not, but I do not propose to reflect on the grace with which they have done their work. They appear to be surrounded by pressing problems of immense and far-reaching importance, with all kinds of new prospects opening up on the termination of these controls. No man can predict what will happen when they do terminate. In the case of lead, the reverse sult followed, because, as soon as lead was freed, it jumped in the market by from £11 to £14 per ton, Wheu copper was freed, having apparently been kept at too high a level, it fell in equal and opposite ratio. I do not think that for this the head of this Government, or the British authority, can be blamed. I should certainly prefer, if it was possible, to get information here that could be published by the Government simultaneously with the publication in Great Britain, but that we cannot control. If the honourable - member for Capricornia suggests that the interests of the copper producer, or of the holder of copper shares, have been neglected or hurt by the action of this vernment, or by any carelessness on the part of the Prime Minister, he is doing both the Prime Minister and the Government an injustice. All we have been anxious to do is to help the industry, and we have gone so far during the three months since the Prime Minister left, before the June to December contract extension was made, as to arrange an advance for the whole of the copper producers of Australia, and I am doing that now for the first three months of 1919. We are going to take a Tisk in that regard. We are doing the same thing also in regard to tin, our desire being to sustain these industries, as it were, until the producers _ of these metals can see what post-war conditions mean to them, .and are able to make their own arrangements accordingly. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - Has there been ' Go- any development in regard to tin ?",27
58,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALT H COMMERCIAL,"1I have no recollection of fresh cablegrams in the last few days. Surely the honourable member for Capricornia will see that, were the Government ever so wise, and ever so well-informed, they could not avert the dislocation or change upward or downward which will be the inevitable result of the release^ of these metal and other controls ?",27
59,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALT H COMMERCIAL,That goes without saying. It is the lack of information that I am complaining of.,27
60,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALT H COMMERCIAL,"I have my own ideas of the cause of the difficulty in the copper situation, and do not mind expressing re- them. I think the British Government were powerless to combat the American influence. I have said that to my colleagues all the time. If the British Government had been in possession of the bulk of the supplies, they could have exercised a more potent influence on the market and on the purchasing arrangements for the war, but America supplies the bulk of the copper production of the world, and the nation that supplies only a minor proportion cannot exercise the influence which it otherwise would.",27
61,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALT H COMMERCIAL,Americ a rules the copper market.,27
62,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALT H COMMERCIAL,"Pu t plainly, that is the fact. I sorrow with the honourable member for Capricornia regarding the inforGo- mation coming as it has done, but that is a matter beyond my control, and beyond'the control of the Prime Minister. ' Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN (Eden Monaro) [11.35] - As I have been making some representations to the Acting Prime Minister regarding the copper producers, I must say that he has done a good deal towards helping the industry along, so far as we have gone, especially in the guarantee that he has given on behalf of the Government, although I do not think that entails any risk. But the very fact of the press getting this information first from overseas seems to me to prove one thing. We are now in a transition period, and a number of these things which are of great importance to the commercial and ""lining world are bound to occur. I would, therefore, ask the Acting Prime Minister to consider the desirableness of instituting better business arrangements on the other side of the world. I know his hands are pretty full with the making of business arrangements ou this side, but if he made a suggestion on these lines to the Prime Minister he would probably find that, as we have a High Commissioner and a big staff, they could do something in a business way to supply us with information. The Prime Minister has done well in big things in England, but he has never been looked upon as a champion in matters of detail, and it is desirable, in the interests of a great many industries, particularly the big mining enterprises of t in and copper, which are the life-blood of this country, that we should have first-hand information. The only way that we can get it is by some system on the other side such as I suggest. Surely we have enough people in the High Commissioner's office to see that our interests are properly safeguarded. I have no objection to the press getting information first, because it gives the information out again right away, and everybody sees it ; but it seems an anomaly that the British Government should take an important step like this, and that we should get the news of it in a second-hand way. I ask the Acting Prime Minister to have something done on the lines I have suggested. While I believe that the Acting Prime Minister has done everything possible to help and safeguard this great industry, yet, unless we have proper arrangements on the other side of the world, I fear that some terrible difficulties will arise here owing to the want of business arrangements in detail, for which the Prime Minister is not famous. Perhaps a word of warning such as has been given on this - motion will have the effect I am aiming at. Question resolved in the negative. HMS FOR SOLDIERS' WIDOWS .",27
63,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALT H COMMERCIAL,"for Dr MALONEY) asked the Assistant Minister for Defence, upon noticeWill he give the following information to the House:1. The numbers of homes that have been provided for the widows of soldiers by the Commonwealth and State Governments, showing the numbers severally in the various States? 2. The numbers of widows of soldiers in the various States who have had their rent paid in lieu of such homes?",28
64,Mr WISE,COMMONWEALT H COMMERCIAL,"The information is being obtained by the Repatriation Department, and will be available tomorrow. TAXATION OFFICE. "" SLOWING DOWN "" BY EMPLOYEES.  Minister, upon notice I. Is it a fact that a number of employees in the Federal Taxation Office have been brought before the Commissioner of Taxation because of their conduct of slowing down in their work, and for advocating that policy in a type-written journal, named by them The Aubrey, prepared by them, and to which their signatures are attached? 2. Will the Minister produce the copy of the journal referred to for the information of honourable members, and which is now in the hands of the Secretary to the Treasury? 3. Will the Minister inform the House if one of the ringleaders of the party responsible for the production of this journal was. dismissed from the Public Service some twelve months ago, and was reinstated quite recently? 4. Is it a fact that the employees referred to have been reported to the departmental heads for slowing down? 5. Have they been still further reported for hostility to other departmental employees, particularly returned soldiers, who were endeavouring to do a fair day's work? 6. How many signatures are attached to The Aubrey, and will the Minister disclose the names?",28
65,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALT H COMMERCIAL,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l low :1. The position is not as stated. The officers in question were called before the Commissioner to explain their attitude in connection with the issue of the journal The Aubrey. Pending determination of the action to be taken by the Department, the officers were given the opportunity of stating in writing any grievances which they may consider they may have against the administrntion.' 2. I do not see what good purpose would be served by so doing. 3. No. The officer referred to was suspended, but subsequently reinstated. 4. No report of slowing down has been made against any of the officers referred to. 5. No. Representatives of the returned soldiers have spoken of an attitude of veiled hostility on the part of certain unnamed permanent employees. 6. There are no signatures. The articles are signed by noms de plume. SPELTER ZINC : TREATMENT.",28

Is it a fact that on the hospital ship MUtiades, which arrived in Australia in August, 1917, with approximately 800 men on board, mostly invalids, military police were used to keep the men off one side of the promenade deck, the same being used for seventy officers and sergeants? 2. Is it a fact that, on the same ship, onelegged and otherwise disabled men had to go up and down several flights of companion ways to bunks and meals, while the officers had almost the whole of the cabin accommodation to themselves? 3.

88,Mr GROOM,DARLINGHURST DETENTIO N,"Wit h reference to a question asked me in the House recently, by the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Nicholls), I am in receipt of the following reply from the Comptroller, partment of Repatriation: Presumably the form of assistance referred tion :to is that provided for under regulation 60 of the regulations under the Australian short Soldiers' Repatriation Act 1917-18, which reads:A State Board may make advances by way of loan for the purchase of approved form? businesses, plant, stock, and live not exceeding £150 in each case to(a) Widows with one or more children; (6) Married soldiers, incapacitated to tion :the extent of being unable to engage in their usual employment; and (c) Soldiers who, prior to enlistment, were dependent for their living upon businesses which they owned and conducted. Provided that, where an application involves an advance exceeding £150, but not exceeding £250, the Board shall refer the application with a recommendation to the Minister for determination. Provided further that advances for live stock will only be made when ""an applicant is not eligible to secure such assistance under the land settlement schemes State in which he resides. Whether or not applicants, previous listment, possessed the same amount of property they apply for is quite immaterial the determination of any application under regulation, and, therefore, no"" applications would be refused on this ground. With regard to the statement that a man who applied for a horse and dray was informed that as he did not possess a horse and dray previous to enlisting, the Department assist him, the answer is that the man was probably informed that under regulation 60 (c) ne was not eligible for that particular form of assistance.

93,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"D a r l in g Downs-Actin g Attorney-General) [11.47] - I moveTint this Bill be now read a second-tTrne. This is a Bill to make certain amendments in the Commonwealth conciliation and arbitration legislation. It may ""be regarded as more or less in the'nature of a temporary measure; it is not intended as a review of previous legislation or to meet the need for amendment generally. The Bill practically deals with three poiutsthe position of the Deputy President of the Court, the enforcement of awards, and the position of returned soldiers in rela' tion to awards or agreements made under the A ct which accord preference to members of organizations. Under section 14 of the existing Act the President of the Court has power to appoint a Deputy with capacity to exercise, during the pleasure of the President, such powers and functions of the President as the latter may .think fit to assign to him. The appointment of the Deputy does not in any way affect the exercise of the functions of the President himself. By section I 4 A power is taken to appoint aDeputy President whenever the President is out of the Commonwealth, or is for any reason unable to appoint a Deputy. It is proposed by the Bill to repeal both section 14 and section 14A. Litigation is in progress with respect to section 14 as regards the validity of appointments made under it . Mr Justice Powers has been acting as Deputy President.",32
94,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Has the litigation reference to the Journalists case in Western Australia 1,32
95,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"It was raised in the Journalists' case. Mr Justice Powers considered that his position was so seriously in question that he did not feel justified in continuing to act as Deputy without an amendment of the law as is now proposed. Clause 2 provides(1) The Governor General may, by instrument under his hand, appoint any Justice of the High Court or Judge of the Supreme Court of a State to be the deputy of the President in any Part of the Commonwealth, and in that capacity to exercise'such powers and functions of the President as the Governor General thinks lit to assign to the deputy. (2) The deputy so appointed shall be entitled to hold office during good behaviour for the unexpired period of the term of office of President for the time being, and shall be eligible for re-appointment, and shall not be removed during the said period except by the Governor General on an address from both Houses of the Parliament in the same session, praying. for such .removal on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity. (3) The appointment of a deputy of the President shall not affect the exercise by the President of any power or function. This only deals with future cases. It was not considered advisable to do more than is now proposed.",33
96,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"It is quite possible, then, that the decisions given by Justices Powers, Rich, and Isaacs will be upset.",33
97,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I do not want to make any comment upon that aspect of the position. The question of the enforcement of awards having arisen in connection with the Waterside Workers Union versus J . W. Alexander Limited, a series of questions were placed before the High Court. The questions asked were: (1) Is the constitution of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration beyond the powers of the Parliament of the Commonwealth, and in particular as to (a) the arbitral provisions, and (b) the enforcing provisions? (2) Is the award invalid by reason of the appointment of the President for seven years only? (3) Is the award enforcible by the said Court? The case was fully argued, and the judgments were carefully considered. I do not propose to quote from the long and elaborate judgments delivered in that case, but, perhaps, I may conveniently summarize them by saying that the majority of Judges held that the arbitral provisions of the Arbitration Act were valid, but that the provisions relating to the powers of the Court as to the enforcement of the awards were invalid. Mr Justice Higgins gave a short summary as to the effect of the judgments which, perhaps, I might be permitted to mention'. A f t e r the decision of the High Court was given, he said I am told that a great deal of misapprehension has arisen as to the effect of the decision given by the High Court last Friday in the case of the Waterside Workers Federation versus Alexander, that the decision referred to has the effect, as I understand, and I have no doubt about it, of preventing the Arbitration the Court from applying penalties for breaches of awards. .But"" the decision of the High Court in no way interferes with the power of this Court to make compulsory awards as before. The only point of difference is that after an award has been made, this Court has no power to enforce it. Enforcement of awards must be done by the Court of Summary Jurisdiction, or otherwise, as the case may be. It may help parties who are interested in cases actually pending, or to be brought forward, to know that the Arbitration Court goes on as before That means that the Arbitration Court can go on making awards and giving decisions which are binding on the parties concerned, but that difficulty has arisen with 'regard to the enforcement of such awards, and for the purpose of clearing up the position it has been thought advisable to introduce the amended provisions now under consideration. Section 44 of the original Ac t states1. Where any organization or person bound by an order or award has committed any breach or non-observance of any term of the order or award any penalties which the Court has power to impose may be imposed by any Court of summary jurisdiction constituted by a Police Stipendiary or Special Magistrate. Different opinions were expressed by the Judges of the High Court with respect to this section, and difficulty has arisen with regard to the words "" any penalties which the Court has power to impose."" It has been held that the Arbitration Court itself has no power to impose penalties, and therefore, a Court of summary jurisdiction cannot, because it has only the same power to impose penalties as the A r b i tration Court. In order to inform honourable members of the difficulty that has arisen from the conflicting judgments, I shall read three extracts fro m opinions dealing with these particular sections. The Chief Justice saidThe exercise of the power to impose penalties is admittedly an exercise of the judicial power. If the Court has no such power, the provision is, of course, of no effect. ties which the Court may itself impose, but no others, may be imposed by State Magistrates' Courts (section 44). Mr Justice Isaacs and Mr Justice Rich gave a joint opinion, from which I jurisdiction, take the following:But here striking out the enforcing powers of the Court, there is still left so much of section 44 as relates to Courts of summary jurisdiction with regard to penalties. I suggested that in section 44, the words "" any penalties which the Court has power to imI pose,"" mean that if it be found the Court invalidly invested with the power to impose vision :the penalties referred to, the Courts of summary jurisdiction are not to be so invested. We do not so read the words. It cannot be denied it is not impossible to read them so, we consider that such a reading is less reasonbe able, and less consonant with the scheme of the Act, than another reading which we shall in the order. state. Mr Justice Powers saidA doubt was raised during the argument to whether State Courts' can enforce awards if the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation Arbitration is held to be unable to do so, because of the words which appear in line three of section 44 of the Act, namely, ""which Court has power to impose."" It is said only power given to the State Courts is pose penalties which the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration can impose, and if it is held that that Court cannot impose penalties, a State Court cannot do so. It not necessary to decide that question, but it might very well be held that the words in tion 44 are only used as a concise description of the class of penalties or orders that can enforced by State Courts. The omission words in question by an amendment of the would clear away the doubt. It is for the purpose of clearing away that doubt that the amendment to section 44 is proposed. We are adding a jurisdiction to section 44. The original Act provides for the imposition of penalThis ties by any Court of summary jurisdicto tion, constituted by a Police, Stipendiary, or Special Magistrate. B y the amendno ment we propose to give jurisdiction i this regard to any District, County, Local Court, or Court of summary jurisLocal Court of full jurisdiction diction, which is constituted'by a Judge, or by a Police, Stipendiary, or Special Magistrate. The County Court or District Court is an exceedingly useful tribunal. Its Judges travel all through the States of Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria, where such Courts Any penalare established, and the Judges are generally men of considerable standing in their profession. - Section 45 providesWhere the Court, or any Court of summary imposes any penalty for any breach or non-observance of any term of an order or award, it .may order that the penalty, or any part thereof, be paid into the Consolidated Bevenue Fund, or to such organization t is or person as is specified in the order. t is proposed to Tepeal that section, and is insert in lieu thereof the following proWhere any Court imposes a penalty in pursuance of the last preceding, section, it may but order that the penalty, or any part thereof, paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund, or to such organization or person as is specified The words ""any Court "" refer to the tribunals mentioned in the previous secas tion of which I have just spoken. It is proposed to amend section 46 by and omitting the words "" the Court""-re ferrin g to the Court which has been held the to have no enforcing jurisdiction-and the inserting in lieu thereof the words "" a to imCourt"", one of the Courts mentioned in the proposed amendment to section 44. iSection 48 is to be amended by omitis ting the words "" the Court,"" and inserting seci n lieu thereof the words "" a County, or District.

This is the section which of the deals with the power of the Court to Act make an order on the application of any party to an award in the nature of a man'damus or injunction to compel compliance with the award, or to restrain its new breach under pain of a fine or imprisonment; but the section seems to be invalid. power has been reserved in the past the Arbitration Court, but as it has been held that the Arbitration Court has power to enforce any of its awards, it n is now proposed to invest the power in OT a County Court, a District Court, or a As County Court Judges travel all over the various States in which County Courts are established, a wider area of juristhat diction is given for the enforcement of rare cases only. awards. „ Clause 7 proposes to add a new section to the Act. At present the power to direct that preference shall be I given, and although it has very rarely ments do so. exercised that power, preference is ceded by some agreements which have been filed under the Act . The effect of the posed new section is that nothing conpreference tained in any award or agreement which agreement. gives preference to members of organizations shall prevent the employment of returned soldiers. The section reads as follows: After section 1 of the principal Act the following section is inserted in Part VII . :"" 8 1 A - (1) Nothing in any award or made under this Act, or in any agreement lating to industrial matters, shall operate to Courts, prevent the employment of returned soldiers or sailors.

In Committee of Supply (Consideration resumed from 25th September, vule. page 6355, of motion by Mr Watt ) Tliat the .first item in the Estimates under Division I , The Parliament, namely, "" The President, £1,100,"" be agreed to.",35
103,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Y a r r a ) [18.12] - In view of the long period that has elapsed since the delivery of the Budget statement, it is rather difficult to deal with the matters that are embodied in the Estimates in the way that they ought to be dealt with. The Treasurer delivered his Budget speech on the 25th September last-almos t three months ago. At that time a-number of the questions which> were dealt with by him, were fresh in the minds of honourable members. But since then many of those matters have been disposed of. Now the real object of a Budget statement is to afford the Treasurer an opportunity of outlining proposed taxation measures, of forecasting expenditure during the financial year, and of allowing honourable members a chance to discuss these questions, in order that the Government may derive whatever advantage is to be gained from such an interchange of ideas. I am not one of those who imagine that all the ability of this Farliament is centred in the occupants of the Treasury benches. Only the other day I remarked that in all probability the Estimates, which provide for an expenditure of nearly £100,000,000, would probably be dealt with in the early hours of the morning, when there were perhaps only a half-adozen members present. To-day we are witnessing the fulfilment of my prediction. The lack of interest which is taken in the discussion of the Budget is reflected in the poor attendance in the Chamber at the present moment. By postponing the consideration of the E s t i mates until practically the eleventh hour of the session, the Government are not doing what is best in their own interests, or in the interests'of the'community, and they are certainly not affording honourable members the opportunity to which they are entitled, of discussing the very many questions which arise out of the Budget statement. In short, Parliament is being denied the exercise of that control over our finances which is one of its functions.",36
104,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Why does every Government do the same thing?,36
105,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I can say without fear of contradiction that no Government has ever delayed the consideration of the Estimates u n t il within two or three days of the close of the session.,36
106,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"There was one year in which they were not brought forward t ill the close of the session, but on that occasion, they were merely discussed, not passed.",36
107,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I have already said that if the Government were wise they would bring down a Supply Bill to cover the period over which they desire, to adjourn - sa y some two or three months-and allow us an opportunity to exhaustively debate the Estimates when we re-assemble. One of the most important matters demanding our consideration is the control of the Northern Territory. Will the honourable member for Denison (Mr Laird Smith), who has visited that Territory, tell me that two hours is sufficient time in which to discuss the estimates relating to the Northern Territory, or the Repatriation Department, or the Defence Department ? Yet that represents the period over which their consideration will extend if the whole of the Estimates are to be dealt with during the course of the next couple of days. I ask the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman) whether he thinks that two hours are sufficient time to allocate to the debate of the Estimates for the Federal Capital site, which is only one of the many matters connected with the Works and Railways Department? I am satisfied that in the end the procedure which has been adopted throughout the war will be again followed in connection with the present session of Parliament. I mean that within the next two or three days , we shall be asked to adjourn until such time as the President and Mr Speaker may see fit to call us together again. Indeed, the adoption of that procedure is absolutely necessary if we are to avoid rendering illegal the collection of the whole of the revenue which has been derived from the Customs and Excise Bills that were introduced in 1917 and in September, 1918. The increased Excise of 6d. per gallon upon beer has probably yielded a revenue of more than £100,000 during the past three months. Similarly, the advance ' of the import duty upon whisky from 18s. to 25s. per gallon, has also resulted in the collection of a considerable sum. The Excise duty upon tobacco has also been advanced from Is. to Is. 8d.; upon cigars, from Is. to 2s.; and on cigarettes, from 4s. 6d. to 6s. 6d. There has not been so much importation of beer, because that has been a prohibited item as from 8th August last year. . The importation of spirits is being permitted to the extent of 70 per cent, of the importations in the previous year. Import duty on tobacco has gone up from 4s. to 4s. 8d. With regard to unmanufactured tobacco, I am under the impression that about 12,000,000 to 13,000,000 lbs. weight was imported for the purposes of manufacture in Australia. At the time when the Budget statement was delivered honourable members had the whole subject fresh in their minds. was presented in this House six weeks before the armistice had been signed. - Since then the position has become entirely altered. It would have been wiser for the Government to withdraw their Estimates of Expenditure, based upon a full war year, and to have brought down a modified set of Estimates, dealing with the position as it now stands. Por example, in respect to Defence matters, expenditure is bound to be curtailed, Every ship-load of Australian soldiers returning home means a decrease in Defence expenditure, for the reason that those troops will be paid of f . We aTe given to understand that many transports will he arriving fairly early next yeaT. A cable message in last night's press-related that General Monash is busily engaged upon demobilization, and that it is expected that some 15,000 of our men will return to Australia each month. One of the objections raised by our boys in Great Britain has been that sailings are to be so limited that greater numbers than those I have just indicated will not be able to return during any one month. The Government realise, of course, that it would be unwise to throw larger numbers upon Mr Tudor. the labour market at any one stage. The fact remains, however, that as the men steadily return, and are paid off, there will be hugely less expenditure in the Defence Department.",36
108,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The difference would be shown under the heading of "" Unexpended balances.""",37
109,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"No doubt. And the Treasurer would do as all Treasurers have been careful to do; that is, he would take care that the various Departments curtailed expenditure to the utmost limit, in any circumstances. But the trouble is that if a certain amount of money is available for departmental expenditure, there is always difficulty in preventing the Departments from spending up to their limit. Take price fixing, for example. And, in regard to that phase of our war measures, honourable members recently were interested to read in the press an official notification that, so far as some half-adozen articles were concerned, there was It no longer necessity to deal with them with the price fixing machinery of the Government. I am not sure whether those six items included galvanized iron; but there were such articles as paper, soda, tartaric acid, and cream of tartar. What joy there must have been in the households of Australia when our women folk learned that such an enormous domestic item as cream of tartar,was to be freed from the clutches of the price fixers! At the same time, housewives, who have to purchase boots and shoes, and socks and stockings, know only too well that there has been no price-fixing machinery set in motion with respect to those highly important items. They are still aware, to their sorrow, that prices are about double what they were before the war.",37
110,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The honourable member must accept a certain amount of responsibility for not dealing with matters such as those himself.,37
111,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I agree that that remark is pertinent; but the Treasurer will recall that I resigned from the Government only about a month after it was learned that the Government had power to fix prices of various commodities. I refer fco the decision given in the Bread case. Prio r to that, the Government were not seized of the fact that they had the power to impose price fixing. I might he permitted to add that today a person, if he were prosecuted for not selling goods at the prices fixed, would probably be able to show-havin g read a recent decision of Chief Justice Sir Samuel Griffith-that the Government held the power to fix prices only during the state of war. I am of opinion that, the state of war having virtually passed away, the whole matter of price fixing will have to go by the board. Last September the Acting Prime Minister informed us, in setting out a statement of Government business, that it was intended to put price fixing upon a firm basis, and to deal with it by means of an Act rather than under War Precautions regulations. I was hopeful that we should have an opportunity of dealing with it , but the official answer is that, since the armistice has been signed, it is not intended to .proceed with it . The Treasurer, in his Budget statement, saidIt is a matter for regret that the Commonwealth has relied upon the - British. Government to help in financing Australia's share in the war. The prosperity of Australia is remark- by an additional income tax. able, and at least we should arrange for the future that the current expenses of the Australian armies shall be met by Australian money. That is the basis upon which the Estimates for this year have been framed, and there is reason to believe that flie British vernment will agree to fund the arrears of £38,345,000. I share the honourable gentleman's regrets. When the late Lord Forrest was Treasurer I urged that, since we were enjoying phenomenally good seasons and our producers were obtaining better prices than they had ever secured before the war, the income tax should at once be increased as a means of assisting us in financing the war. When, in 1914, Mr Fisher, who was then Treasurer, imposed an income tax running up to 5s. in the £ 1 , such a rate was undoubtedly high. Great Britain I do not think the income tax then reached that level. posed this gradually increasing tax by means of the remarkable system of curves which the present Prime Minister loves so much and which we have never been able to get away from.",37
112,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,And which no one understands.,38
113,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Practicall y no one understands this system, and very few agree with the results obtained by means of it . The honourable member for Grey  Fisher as Treasurer, proposed and carried an increase of 25 per' cent, in the income tax, but from that time until the present Treasurer took office, no further increase was made. The income tax, to my mind, is the fairest system of taxation that could be imposed. During the last few days we have been dealing with a Bill to amend the War Time Profits Act. I do not know what the position is in regard to that Bill today, and I do not think that even a Ministerial supporter would hazard a guess with respect to it ; but I do know that the Treasurer's attitude ""is causing some consternation amongst his supporters. By means of the amending Bill an attempt is being made to patch up the principal Act ; but, as I said the other day, if some other means of reaching those who have been making extraordinary profits during the war could be devised, I should be prepared to accept it. In my view they can best be reached Previous Treasurers have made the mistake since the war - of failing to obtain additional revenue by means of the income tax, and I agree with the Treasurer that it is unGofortunate that we should have fallen into arrears to the extent stated by him in financing Australia's share in the war. We should have obtained more revenue than we have done from those who have been enjoying magnificent seasons, and who have secured, during the war, better prices for their produce, both here and abroad, than were ever previously obtainable. As to the cost of living, there are many products the cost of which could not have been affected by the war. The produce Even in of market-gardens, for instance, has not been affected by the war, save, perWe im- haps, that on account of the number of enlistments skilled labour is not so freely forthcoming as it was before. Cabbages which, in the pre-war days were obtainable for I d . each, have since been costing from 6d. upwards.",38
114,Mr ATKINSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The market-gardeners have had a bad season or two, and have' also suffered damage by reason of floods.",39
115,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I know that they have suffered from ' the ravages of the fly pest, but that is no new experience, while the damage done by floods was mainly on the upper Yarra. There has been a steady in crease in the price of vegetables.",39
116,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Does not the honourable member think that the market gardeners deserve all that tEey get? We see them coining into the market at all hours of the morning.,39
117,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I do not say that they do not deserve all that they .can get. I am merely pointing out, in dealing with the cost of living, that the price of tsome commodities cannot be said to have been affected by the war. The Treasurer no doubt is on the lookout for new methods of taxation, and I direct his attention to the following telegram from Washington, published in the San ""Francisco Bulletin of 10th July last: LUXURIES HARD HIT IN TAX BILL. WASHINGTON, July 10 - Preparation s for framing the new war revenue Bill went forward in the House Ways and Means - Committee today, with attention centering upon the list of suggestions for new or higher taxes on luxuries and necessities submitted yesterday by the Treasury Department. Members of the Committee indicated that the list would form the basis for consumption taxes in their draft of the Bill. Besides doubling present taxes on liquors and tobaccos, quadrupling soft drink levies and making general increases in other existing rates, the Treasury suggestions include :Taxes of 50 per cent, on retail prices of jewellery, watches and clocks (except those sold to army or navy men). Twenty per cent, on automobiles, bicycles, musical instruments, &c. Ten cents a gallon on gasoline, to be paid by the wholesaler. Ten per cent, on hotel bills for rooms over 2 dollars 50 cents a day or American plan over 5 dollars. Ten per cent, on all cafe or restaurant bills and taxes of unstated amounts on men's suits selling for more than 30 dollars, women's suits over 40 dollars and coats over 30 dollars; men's hats over 4 dollars; shirts over 2 dollars; pyjamas over 2 dollars; hosiery over 35 cents; shoes over 5 dollars; gloves over 2 dollars; underwear over 3 dollars; all neckwear and canes; women's dresses over 25 dollars; skirts over 15 dollars; hats over 10 dollars; shoes over 6 dollars; lingerie over 5 dollars; corsets over 5 dollars; and all furs, fans, &c., children's clothing, including suits, over .15 dollars; toilet articles over 2 dollars. In addition to all these taxes, which would be levied directly upon the consumer, the listproposes doubling the present motion-picture admission tax and imposing a tax of 5 per cent, on moving-picture theatre rentals, with the present film tax eliminated. . A 10 per cent, tax on "" wire leases,"" intended to apply to telegraphs and telephones and other wires whose use is leased, is another of the Treasury proposals. The retail tax principle is new in the United States tax law, although it has been levied in England, France, and Germany. The Treasury suggested that 10 per cent, basis for this plan would be too low, and that any one wanting the retail goods would-pay as high as 20 per cent. The Treasury proposed a license tax of 10 dollars a year on soda fountains. The suggested tax on domestic servants would allow an exemption of one female servant. Others would be taxed as follows :First servant, 25' per cent, of wages paid; second servant, 50 per cent.; third, 75 per cent.; and on more than three servants (not counting the one female servant) 100 per cent, of wage paid in each case. I understand that under that system, if a man purchased a watch at a cost of £ 5 , the retailer would levy another £ 2 10s. T as a contribution to the national revenue. Again, the purchaser of a motor car costing £ 6 0 0 , would, if the tax were at the rate of 20 per cent., have to pay an additional £ 1 2 0 as a contribution to the cost of government. It may be said that it would be impossible for the Commonwealth Government to collect such taxation, but if it has been possible to collect it in Great B r it a in and the United States of America, there ought not to be any insuperable difficulty in the way of its collection here.",39
118,Mr BRUCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The Luxury Tax has not been operative in Great Britain .,39
119,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Whether that is so or not, I know that Treasurers are anxious to obtain as much information as possible as to new methods, of raising revenue, and I think this statement will interest the Acting Prime Minister. I have been very anxious for a long time that certain commodities should no longer escape taxation. I do not mind sharing with the Government, if necessary, the responsibility for the tax that has been i m posed upon colonial wines. I urged, both publicly and privately, the present Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr W at t ) , and the ex-Minister (Mr Jensen), to levy such a tax. I can see no more reason for imposing an Excise duty of 6d. or 7d. per gallon on colonial beer, than there is for imposing au Excise duty on colonial wines. Because of information that came to my knowledge when I was administering the Customs Department, I suggested that an Excise duty should be placed on spirits used' for fortifying colonial wines. The effect of that would be that the greater the quantity of spirit used in wine, the higher would be the tax on the manufacturer. That duty, besides yielding increased revenue, would encourage the production of a lighter wine, which, I think, would be a very good thing for the community. I do not think that the Excise duty has been fixed high enough, being equal to only about 8d. per gallon. The price of beer at the brewery would be about Is. per gallon, or, with the tax added, 2s. per gallon. The. price of wine at the vineyard would be very much greater-pro bably 4s. to 6s. per gallon-and there is no reason why the tax on wine should not - be at least equal to that on beer, namely, Is. per gallon. Reverting to the importation of luxuries, I have complained ever since August, 1917, that the list of articles, the importasecondly, tion of which was prohibited by the Government, was not large enough. honourable member for Flinders (Mr. Bruce) has stated that the luxury tax in England has never been enforced. Perhaps the Imperial authorities thought it better to deal with that problem through the income tax, or by some other means. The prohibition of the importation of luxuries into Australia was referred by the Government to a Committee, which included Mr Mcintosh, the manager of Ball and Welch. As far as I know, no honourable member of this Parliament has ever seen the report of that Committee. But the. Government, acting on the Committee's recommendation, prohibited the importation of-(1 ) ale and other beer, porter, cider and perry, spirituous, in bulk or in bottle; (2) potable spirits; (3) perfumed spirits and bay rum; (4) biscuits; (5) confectionery; (6) eggs, in shell or otherwise; (7) fur apparel; (8) perfumery; . (9) jewellery, imitation jewellery and imitation precious stones; and (10) bodies for motor vehicles, whether imported separately or forming part of a complete vehicle. The prohibition, so far as ale, porter, ""cider, and perry were concerned, meant practically nothing. In regard to potable spirits, which, of course, included brandy, whisky, gin, and schnapps, the Minister decided that the merchants should be allowed to import a quantity equal to 70 per cent, of the importations in the previous year. The importations in the previous year had been extraordinarily large, and honourable members will find that, as a result of that permission by the Minister, the importation of .spirits today is practically as large as it was in pre-war years.",39
120,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The honourable member refers to the value?,40
121,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"No , to. the quantity. I think that statement will be proved by reference to Knibbs' Customs Statistics, which show both the quantity and value of the imports. The reasons for the great increase in the value of spirits were, firstly, the commandeering by the British Government of an enormous quantity of 1 spirits for munition purposes, and, the increase of the Excise duty. MT. WATT - And decreased production. The Mr TUDOR - To some extent. The prohibition of the importation of perfumed spirits and bay rum was to have been absolute. Bui as a result of complaints made by the importers, the Minister decided to allow those articles to be brought into the extent of 50 per cent, of the previous year's importations. So far as I know, that permission is still in force. The importation of biscuits has always been very small. I believe that 90 per cent, of the biscuits consumed in Australia are made locally. The only importations are a few fancy biscuits by some of the well known manufacturers of the United Kingdom'. So far as the prohibition related to confectionery, it .was of great importance to local industries. Even today one can see imported confectionery in the window of every first class confectionery shop. But I am pleased to say that as a result of the prohibition, and the resultant diminution of competition from abroad, local manufacturers are producing confectionery of as high a quality as was ever imported. I do not desire to give an advertisement to any particular firm, but I do say that the "" O l d G o l d "" and "" V i o l e t R a lates, made by opposition firms, aTe of the very highest quality. that prohibition of the importation of confectionery did an immense amount of good in stimulating local production, and I hope that it will be the means of encouraging Australian manufacturers to make a high grade article. I often think that in prohibiting the importation of eggs the Government must have had in mind the unfortunate experience of the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) at Warwick. The prohibition of the importation of f u r apparel was not very important. I suppose that every Minister for Trade and Customs who has brought forward an amending Tariff has realized very soon afterwards that mistakes have been made. It is impossible to avoid errors when dealing with a Tariff of 400 items, many of which are subdivided under sixty heads. I admit that a mistake was made in fixing such a low duty on f u r apparel, and I hope that when an amending Tariff comes before the House a higher duty will be imposed. The prohibition in regard to motor bodies has been held in abeyance from time to time, and I do not know whether or not it is absolute today. There is no reason why motor bodies should not be manufactured in Australia as in other parts of the world. I hope that if the Government find it necessaiy to repeal the prohibition proclamation they will in the amending Tariff deal effectively with such imports as interfere with Australian industries. If persons desire fancy biscuits from abroad they should be prepared to pay a high price for them. And if the fixed duties, and the alternative ad valorem rate, are not high enough to discourage the importation of confectionery, the rates should be increased. The same remark applies to the duty on imported motor bodies. We can make them in Australia, and if the present duty does not give sufficient protection to local industry we must increase it .",40
122,Unknown,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Sitting suspended from 12.58 to 2.S0 p.m. Mr Tudor.,41
123,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The Treasurer, in his Budget speech, referred to the Wheat Pools, the Metal Board, and the general financing of the primary products of the y "" choco- country; but so much time has elapsed since we discussed those matters that I I believe that do not intend to deal with them today. He referred also to the proposal to establish a Bureau of Science and Industry, to do which a Bill has been passed through the Senate and is now before this Chamber. If there is anything which requires discussion it is that proposal, but sufficient time is not being given to us to deal with it . Shipbuilding is another matter on which the House is to be asked to legislate before the end of the year. According to the Budget-papers, the Government has under construction twenty^ four steel vessels-si x at Williamstown, six at Walsh Island, two at Cockatoo Island, four at Maryborough (Queensland), four at Adelaide, and two in Tasmania. Of wooden vessels, it has six under construction in Sydney. They are being made by Messrs. Hughes, Martin , and Watson L t d . , and are auxiliary schooners. Six more are being made at Fremantle by the Western Australian Shipbuilding Company.  six has been cancelled.",41
124,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,-Do all the other contracts stand ? ,41
125,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The other wooden vessels that are being constructed) are twelve barquentines, of which. six are being built at Sydney by the Wallace Power Boat Company, and another six by Messrs. Kidman and Mayor. The twenty-four wooden vessels are to be constructed for about £1,536,000. ",41
126,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"If we get the wooden vessels for £ 2 6 per ton we shall have a good bargain, and if we get the steel vessels for £ 2 9 per ton we shall do very well.",41
127,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,What was the pre-war price?,41
128,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Before the war you could get vessels like those of the White Star, Orient, or Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, first-class ocean-going steamers, with all fittings and engines, ready for sea, for about £ 8 per ton. During the war the price went up to over £ 6 0 per ton.",41
129,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That was a rascally shame. Mr TUDOR, - It is difficult to know how it could have been prevented unless by the Government taking over complete control. Everyone can be wise after the event; the difficulty is to be wise before a thing happens.",42
130,Mr SAMPSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Eve n Great Britain had to go into foreign ports and purchase shipping at prices going up to £50 per ton.  formation we have, regarding prices is contained in an offer from England to build ships for about £ 2 7 a ton.",42
131,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That is a modest price. Freights jumped up enormously during the war. When I was Minister for Trade and Customs, I did my best to keep track of these matters, because I wished to know the effect of freights on the price of commodities. At that time the freight was £ 2 0 per ton from the Pacific slope to England, and about £ 7 10s. per ton from the Argentine to England. Subsequently rates went still higher. In three months, with freights at £ 1 0 per ton, a vessel doing a trip and a half would make £ 1 5 per ton.",42
132,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,What freight to Australia during the war?,42
133,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That was kept a secret, but I understand that it was something over £7 per - ton. Soon after the war started we were offered freight at £5 per ton, but the price jumped considerably. Before the war you could bring kerosene as deck cargo on a sailing ship from New York to Australia for 6d. per case, and before I left the Customs Department that rate had risen to 6s. per case, while the steamer rate had increased from 2s. to 3s. per case to 12s, per case. Australia kerosene is in general use, and this is the only country in the world, I believe, in which it is purchased regularly by the case or the tin. Before the war it used to cost 6s. or 7s. per case. Honourable members can see how the rise in freight must have affected its price. I hope that with the building of ships all over the world that is now taking place freights may drop. Recently when the subject was under discussion here, a member stated that freights would keep at their present prices for some time to come.",42
134,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,They have fallen 25 per cent since then.,42
135,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"In Great B rita in they have fallen 25 per cent, since the armistice was signed; but if they do not f all more than 50 per cent, it will be a bad lookout for some of our exporters. We can afford to pay a freight of I d . per lb., or £9 6s. Sd. per ton, upon meat, which is worth od. per lb., and upon butter, which is worth from Is. to Is. ""6d. per lb., and upon wool, but not upon commodities worth only I d . per lb., such as wheat and f r u it . It is most important that the shipbuilding programme of the Government should be carried out, and that the vessels should be built at as moderate a rate as possible. I do not think that we shall ever get back to the working conditions that prevailed in other parts of the world before the war. The Prime Minister of Great Britain (Mr Lloyd George), in his first electioneering address, recently stated that the physical condition of Britishers was worse than that of any others engaged in the recent struggle, and that that was on account of the industrial conditions was the which had prevailed. In 1901, when I sat on the Ministerial cross-benches, I described the conditions which prevailed in England when I worked there. Havi ng come to England from Australia they appalled me. I saw children in Lancashire and Yorkshire going at 6 o'clock in the morning to work in the mills, their afternoons being devoted to their schooling, while other children had schooling in the mornings, and worked in the afternoons. It made my heart bleed to see children of twelve and thirteen In years of age treated in this way, when they should have been free to play like other children. I believe that the industrial conditions in the jute mills of Scotland are as bad as those in the cotton mills of Lancashire, or the woollen millsof Yorkshire. I hope, however, that the war has aroused England to a knowledge of her industrial conditions, and that these will be improved. I have known. mothers to be at work in factories two days after bearing a child - Twelve or fourteen years ago Sir Henry Campbell Bannerman, soon after Booth had published his L if e and Labour in London, and Rountree had made his investigation of the industrial conditions of York, said that the industrial conditions of England were awful. I am glad that Mr Lloyd George has stated that they must be i m proved. I certainly do not think they will remain as they are. Some 5,000,000 men went from England to fight, in addition to those who left other occupations to engage in the manufacture of munitions. A great number of the munir tion workers will return to their former industrial life, and the munition factories can be devoted to other work. most important to the Australian producer to be able to have the primary products of the country taken overseas at the cheapest possible rates. No one desires to see these vessels con-, structed at such a rate that those employed on them wil l be sweated in order that goods may be carried across the seas at cheap rates. There are many other points of interest touched on by the Treasurer in his Budget speech, but I do not desire to refer to all of them now. There is, however, one matter on which I should like to say a word. Two or three weeks ago I asked the Treasurer (Mr Watt) a question in regard to the premature publication in some newspapers of the report of the Repatriation Board. This is a matter that has"" been referred to in another where it was stated that, although the report had been issued to the newspapers in confidence, to be held by them permission was given to publish it, two newspapers had broken that confidence. I well remember in 1914, when a new Tariff was introduced, that copies were sent to all the newspapers in Australia, right around from Cairns to Geraldton, under similar conditions. This procedure, of course, is desirable and necessary, particularly in the case of the Tariff, when the protection of the revenue has to be considered; and it is a great convenience to the newspapers, inasmuch as they are able to have the information set up for printing when the time comes, and all Mr Tudor. journals are placed on the same level. Unless some arrangement of the kind is made, the Melbourne newspapers, or the newspapers of whatever place is at the time the Seat of Government, obtain a great advantage; and that, of course, is not. desirable. In the case to which I am immediately referring, I understand that the Sydney Daily Telegraph, and the Adelaide Advertiser broke the trust that was reposed in them. Sir Langdon Bonython, the proprietor of the Adelaide Advertiser, is a member of the Repatriation Committee, and I acquit him of all blame in connection with this unauthorized publication of the report That gentleman is so much away from Adelaide, on repatriation business, that I It is feel sure that he had nothing to do with the breach of trust. The other two daily papers in Adelaide, the Register and the Daily Herald, honourably observed the conditions under which the information was supplied to them; but those who did not do so ought to be punished in some way; for if a newspaper will publish a report of that kind, they will publish any other information obtained in confidence. Yesterday, I asked the Treasurer (Mr. ' Watt) if he would obtain for me the report of the Repatriation Board before the Estimates were disposed of , so that I might ascertain whether any action had beietn taken in regard to the Sydney Daily Telegraph and the Adelaide Advertiser. There is another matter in connection with repatriation to which I desire to place, refer. In connection with the-employment of returned men in various trades and callings, it has been decided to appoint committees representative of employers until and employed to watch over the interests of those concerned. When the value of the work done by disabled or invalid returned men is less than the r u l ing rate of wage in any calling, the Government make up the difference, and the representative of the employees is on the Board to see that fair play is observed, so that not only the ordinary workmen, but the taxpayers, may suffer no injustice, and the money not be made use of for the purpose of helping certain businesses. ' The following letter was addressed by the Deputy Comptroller of Repatriation, Major C. S. Cunningham, to Mr De Gruchy, the Secretary of the Tinsmiths and Sheet Metal Workers Union, Melbourne, on the 26th JulyThe regulations of the Department of Repatriation provide, inter alia, for the setting up of a Soldiers' District Industrial Committee which shall govern the training and employment of returned disabled soldiers in various trades or callings to which they may be trained. Regulation 30 lays down that a Soldiers' District Industrial Committee shall be formed as directed by the Minister, and shall consist of a chairman to be appointed by the Minister, two representatives of the employers in the trade of the trainee, and two representatives of the union covering the trade or calling of the trainee. It is desired that such a Committee shall be formed forthwith for the regulation of training, &c, in the tinsmithing and sheet-metal working trade, and I would be glad to receive at your earliest convenience, the nominations from your union, of its two representatives for this Committee. I attach hereto a copy of regulation 31 which outlines the functions of the Soldiers' District Industrial Committee. Regulation 31 is as followsA Soldiers' District Industrial Committee shall(a) Consider opportunities for employment of soldiers or their dependants; (b) Decide after trial as to the suitability of applicants for particular callings; (c) Assess the efficiency of the trainee after the commencement of his training; (d) Re-assess the trainee's efficiency every three months; (e) Periodically review the facilities for training in workshops and technical schools; (/) Deal with disputes between persons entered for training in private workshops under regulation 42, and the employer, in particular disputes arising as to what is the ruling rate of wages in any industry; and (<?) Have power to call for and take evidence when necessary. The union held a meeting and appointed representatives, and on the 16th August wrote to the Repatriation Department stating that Mr R. C. West and Mr de Gruchy had been chosen. This letter was acknowledged by M a j o r Cunningham on the 19 th August, in the following terms:I beg to acknowledge yours of the 16th instant, informing us that Mr R. C. West and yourself have been nominated as representatives on the Soldiers' District Industrial Committee. You will be notified in due course the date of the first meeting. Thanking you for your assistance and courtesy. That is the last that the union has heard of the matter, and the Board has not been called together, although there are returned soldiers working in the industry. Mr de Gruchy, in a letter he sent to the Repatriation Department, dated 16th September, saysAt the present time returned soldiers are being employed in a certain factory, and have been for several months, where the employer is only paying the men 40 per cent., and the Department of Repatriation is paying the balance, 60 per cent.; and I can assure you from information we have received, the employer should be paying the men at least 80 per cent, for the - class of work they are on, which Bhows the necessity for this Committee to meet in the best interests of the Repatriation Department. Mr LAI RD SMITH - Does an officer of the Repatriation Department visit this factory ?",42
136,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I do not know, but it is only right that, in the interests of the returned soldiers, the union, and the taxpayers, the Department should not pay too large a proportion of the wages in volved. I am quite prepared to take the word of Mr die Gruchy that the employers should pay at least 80 per cent, of the wages. Only recently, along with several honourable members, including the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) and the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney), I had the pleasure of visiting the Working Men's College, where a number of returned soldiers are being vocationally trained. We there saw one man who had lost his right arm, but who, with an artificial limb, was able to hold metal, and turn out first-class work. If that is possible in six weeks under tuition at the College, I think it will be found necessary to re-assess the value of such work, not only every three months, but at much shorter intervals. I understand that it is a rule in Government Departments for someone to go through the Hansard reports and collect such portions of the debates as are of in terest and importance to the Minister of any particular Department; and I hope that this matter will be brought under the notice of the repatriation authorities. I am extremely anxious that the returned men should be properly trained, and, secondly, that the workers and the taxpayer should receive a fair deal.  to send on the letter you have read to the Minister for Repatriation?",44
137,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I shall be very pleased to do so. Last week I brought under the attention of the House the treatment which the wif e of a wounded soldier is alleged to have received from one of the officers of the Repatriation Department. I not only wrote to the Minister for Repatriation (Senator M ill e n ) , but saw that gentleman in regard to the matter, and he promised that if the lady would go down to his Department and identify the man, and if the facts were as she had stated, he would do all in his power to. see that such a thing did not occur again. I would like to bring under notice the case of Major Carroll, in connection with which the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) asked a question on the 3rd October last. I should not refer to the case on the present occasion if it were riot that Major Carroll is to retire within a few weeks. Honourable members who have been in the House for a few years will remember that in 1914 a Select Committee was appointed by the Senate to deal with this case. In reply to the question asked by the honourable member for Capricornia, the Crown Solicitor has given an opinion upon the case, evidently as submitted to him by the Defence Department in 1916. Turning to the report of the Select Committee on ithe 14th. Sep- tember, 1914, page 6, question 89, it would appear that the facts upon which the Crown Solicitor gave his opinion were inaccurate. The following is a portion of the evidence to which I refer:Are you "" Captain"" Carroll or "" Major"" Carroll?- I am Major Carroll, according to the Gazette, according to General Orders of the Commonwealth Military Forces, and according to Army Orders issued in South Africa. On my return from South Africa to Queensland, Colonel Ricardo would not recognise my rank as major, on the ground that to do so would be to put me over the heads of other officers. When I was retrenched in Queensland, and sent temporarily to New South Wales, I continued my correspondence on the subject of the recognition of my majority, and I was so certain of my rank that I asked that the matter should be referred to the highest military authority in Australia. I take it that that is the Governor General. I wrote to the Chief Staff Officer in New South Wales, calling attention to the fact that I was addressed as "" Captain,"" though I had been promoted to the full rank of Major, and although that rank was recognised in the Commonwealth Military Forces in a General Order published in the Gazette No. 29, 1902. M a j or Carroll is to be retired, as major at the age of fifty-five. He has obtained his promotion, and he contends that he should have had it in 1901. His case is important, in view of the fact that we shall have many men returning from the Front holding various ranks; and it may prove an object lesson, and prevent officers who have stayed at home taking precedence over those who have served abroad. Captain Carroll was not serving with the Queensland contingent, but waa serving with the 20th Battery Royal Field Artillery , as can be seen from the following extract from A r m y Orders, South Africa , dated the 14th October, 1901: Appointments - Subjec t to the approval of the Queensland Government, Capt. J. W. M. Carroll, Queensland Permanent Staff, to ba Major, supernumerary to establishment. Dated 7th July, 1901. It is also proved by the following memorandum, which is Exhibi t 23, to the Report of the Select Committee: Captain J. W. Carroll, C.M.F., was attached to the Royal Field Artillery (20th Battery R.F.A.) on the departure of his contingent (the 1st Q.I.B.) to Australia in. 1901. He was appointed Major in Army Orders, South Africa, dated 7/7/01 (certified extract attached). He commanded the 20th Battery R.F.A. daring that period of 1901 when Major King was in command of a column - H . A. Coddington, Major, CO. Natal District. Lord Kitchener cabled to Queensland asking if the Government would consent to this promotion to the rank of major. This was granted, as can be seen in Queensland Government Gazette dated 29th November, 1901. The - K i ng then promoted Captain Carroll to the full rank of major. He continued to serve with the 20th Battery Royal Field A r t i l lery as a major of .the Queensland permanent staff u n t i l his recall in 1902. The following is an extract from Cape Colony Orders, dated 27th March, 1903: Major J. W. M. Carroll, Queensland Permanent Staff (attached R.F.A.), is granted leave of absence in Cape Colony for six weeks from 1st January to 11th February, 1902, instead of as therein stated C.R., No. A-2830/1844 . The Commonwealth acknowledged the promotion in. South Africa , because, on Major Carroll's return, as shown in General Orders dated 10th A p r i l , 1902, the name of Major Carroll appears among the commissioned officers mentioned as being due to arrive at Albury on the 20th A p r i l , 1903. As Major Carroll is to retire/ before this House may meet again, he is putting forward his claim, which I am voicing. He has been deprived of his position, and men who have not had the service he had in South Africa , or service in the present war, have been promoted over his head. As he will be fifty-five years of age next year, he will have to retire, this being age of retirement for majors. He claims that he is entitled to the full rank of major from the 7th July, 1901; and that as promotion comes every five years, he should have attained the rank of Lieut colonel in 11906, and colonel in! 1911. He would not then have had to retire at the age of fifty-five. This morning, Mr Speaker, in answer to a question as to whether the officers and servants of this Parliament had received consideration in the matter of promotions and increases of pay, said that their claims had been given consideration. The increased cost of living has affected every one. House rents have gone up, and the price of clothing, food, and every necessity has increased. every arbitration award provision has been made for increased wages. The Estimates show that the foreman gardener attached to this building was paid £ 1 6 8 last year, and receives the same amount of wages this year. I admit that it is promotion, because, unfortunately, his predecessor passed away last year. Three other gardeners were employed last year, and were paid £445. There are only two of 'them employed this year, and the item has been reduced to £ 3 1 3 . I appeal to the House Committee to consider the position of these men, with a view to granting them an increase of wages on account of the increased cost of living.",45
138,Mr LIVINGSTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The House Committee gave the gardeners an increase a little while ago.,46
139,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"T am glad to hear the honourable member's statement. My ignorance on the point shows positively that the men have not spoken to me in regard to the matter. About a fortnight ago J asked the Assistant Minister for Defence (Mr . Wise) whether the services of members of the censorship staff had been dispensed with,"" and this morning he informed me that the services of several members of the Censor's staff had been dispensed with. I cannot see the need for retaining more than one or two censors in each State. I know that the Acting; Prime Minister (Mr Watt) has told me that it is absolutely necessary that newspapers should be prevented from saying anything likely to reflect on an All y , and that care should the be exercised in regard to financial matters, and I agree with him to that extent; but beyond retaining one or two censors in each State, I think we should throw the whole of the responsibility on the newspapers themselves. I do not know of an instance of any newspaper having published one of the orders issued under the censorship regulations, and there have been hundreds of them issued. Some newspapers have published matter which was not permitted to appear in other pub-' lications, while members of the Censor's staff have been practically living on the premises of other newspapers. It seems to me there is no need to retain the huge censorship staff which has been employed during the last few years. If we were to follow the recommendations of the ConIn ference of Editors, which met in A p r i l last and dealt with the question of the censorship, I think we could do away with many of the censors. I shall deal with the question of non-official postmasters and postmistresses and with the Defence Department's treatment of dependants when we come to the respective items if the opportunity presents itself for doing so. I know what will be the Treasurer's reply to any advocacy of an increase in the rate of pension paid to invalids and old-age pensioners. He will say that the matter was dealt with in 1916. I have not the figures with me, and I do not know what the increase in house rents and in the price of groceries and meat has been-thos e are practically all of the items that Mr Knibbs deals with-bu t I know that there has been a greater increase in the cost of clothing than there has been in all the other items put together. This increase has not been included in Mr Knibbs' figures. It would be a difficult matter to calculate it . Suits of clothes vary considerably in price. A suit that could be bought for £ 6 6s. a littl e while ago costs double that amount today.",46
140,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,It will be necessary for to wear less clothing.,47
141,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Some children have to go about without boots.,47
142,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"If we have reached a condition of affairs in Australia in which children have to go about without boots because their parents cannot afford to buy them, it is high time that the Government took a hand in the matter. Evidence has been given before various Commissions showing that the cost of distribution of boots'is more than the cost of production. Allowing the cost of raw material at 6s. and the cost of manufacture at 4s., the cost of ' distribution, wholesale and retail, is very often as much as 5s. or 6s. At Port Pirie the smelting company, for the protection of its work'ers, has been compelled to establish shops for the distribution of goods, in order to avoid some of the charges imposed by middlemen. However, in regard to old age pensions, I hope that the Treasurer (Mr W at t ) will be able to reconsider the should have a littl e of both. matter, and see whether it will not be possible to give the pensioners an amount equivalent to the value of the 10s. per week they received when the pension was first established in 1909. If he says that the conditions obtaining tb-day are not permanent, and that we are likely to get back to times when prices will be more normal, some temporary arrangement might be made by which these people who find it difficult to exist today will be able to live under more favourable conditions. Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN Monaro) [3.15] - I do not propose to take up the time of the Committee at any length, because we have reached such a late hour in the session. Estimates are brought forward under the old custom or practice, namely, that we should address ourselves to grievances before granting Supply. We cannot do that on this occasion; but such a disability is not unusual, since there has grown up amongst Governments the custom of living on Supply Bills and dealing with the Estimates at practically the last moment. We have had some shocking examples of that system, and, having regard to them, we have not too much to complain of today. The circumstances under which we are dealing with these Estimates are unique, us since they were submitted to us in time of war, and we are called upon to discuss them in time of peace. No one can say when the peace terms will be actually signed; but the position today is very different from that which prevailed when the Budget speech was delivered. T therefore think that we could not have a better chance of cutting down the Estimates than that which now presents itself. We cannot go on living at the present rate. I do not offer this criticism in a factious spirit. As one who does not enjoy good health,-, it would be better for me, from a personal point of view, to swim with the tide, and not to make statements to which Ministers object. But the general opinion is that we are living at too high a rate, and' that we must either cut down the national expenditure or increase taxation.",47
143,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"We shall have to do both. Mr AUSTIN CHAPMA N - We Taxation today is heavy enough; but I do not throw the responsibility for it solely upon the shoulders of the Government. They, after all, are only the servants of the people, and have to do the best they can in the circumstances. They have done very well, and I take no exception to their action. They naturally slip at timeseven the Acting Prime Minister (Mr . W at t ) occasionally slips; but no one wants to say an unkind word of him. The only complaint that I have to make against him is that he is attempting too (Edenmuch. It was never intended that the country should be governed by one man, and that is the position today.",47
144,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Yesterday the cosiplaint was that the country was being governed by Boards.,47
145,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I would remind the honourable member that I am not prepared to take a punch in the eye without giving one back. If a man strikes, you on the left cheek you should tur n the other to him, but never forget that the third blow is your own. I am told that to attempt to reduce these Estimates would be to censure the Government. I do not share that view. In the New South Wales Parliament we used to send back the Estimates, and we have had them reduced by as much as £50,000. In those days we had in office men of the Parkes and Dibbs type, compared with whom recent-day Ministers are but political pigmies. Those men realized that they had to pay some attention to the desires of the people, and surely I am entitled, as a representative of the people, to express my views and to propose to reduce the Estimates without having laid against me the charge that I am seeking to censure the Government. I remember Lincoln's advice, "" Never swap horses while crossing the stream."" We are crossing a turbid, swollen stream at the present time, but the reins are being held by men of experience, and they should know exactly what course to follow. The Acting Prime Minister, in answering questions put to him in this House from day to day, is a perfect political eincyolopsedia, and displays a knowledge of detail and a grasp of the situation such as no ordinary man could be expected to have. When I say that he has taken too much upon himself,- I do not wish to cast any reflection upon him or his colleagues. Some of his colleagues - especiall y some of the newer Ministers - hav e done very well.",47
146,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,May I say that I did not take anything upon myself; the position was given to me; I did not want - it.,48
147,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"No one is will accuse the honourable member of wanting more power. He has done well, and can do well. But he must not take to himself the position of dictator of the Commonwealth. He must not say that it is for him alone l o determine what taxation shall be imposed, or what economies shall be practised. In that regard he has exactly the same rights that the humblest member of this House enjoys, and no more. He has to steer the ship of State, but he does not own it . The people do. ' Mr Considine - This sounds like mutiny on the high seas.",48
148,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"No ; unlike the honourable member, I believe not in mutiny, but in observing the laws of the land. I prefer to live under the Union. Jack rather than the Red Plag.",48
149,Mr FINLAYSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The honourable member is living under both.,48
150,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That is what the honourable member has been try ing to do all the time. At the last election he nearly slipped, and at the next he may fall.",48
151,Mr FINLAYSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I am under both the Union Jack and the Red Flag.,48
152,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The only part of the Union Jack under which the honourable member carries on is the red part. Surely some attempt should be made to secure economy and to reduce taxation. The representative . journals throughout Australia are demanding the practice of economy in the government of the Commonwealth. We were returned with a magnificent majority, but I - should not like to go before the people tomorrow, and to attempt to defend every item of our expenditure. We should try to cut down the Estimates. By whom are they prepared ? They are prepared by members of the Public Service. We are told that the Treasurer cut down the d r a f t Estimates by £2,000,000. In my twenty-eight years of political life-and during four years of that time. I was a Minister of the Crown- I have learned something as to the way in which d r a f t Estimates are prepared. Millions are put on by Departments so that millions may be cut off by the Treasurer. That an old game. While I give the Treasurer every credit for e n : deavouring to do his duty in cutting down the Estimates, I fail to understand why other Ministers should not have done the same. There is ample room for economy. Some of the items are appalling. There is, for instance, the item of £6,421 in respect of the Commonwealth Police Force. For what purpose was that Force created? We might very well abolish it . It s creation was never necessary. No one can say what usef u l work it is carrying out. Will any representative of Queensland defend its creation ?",48
153,Mr COESEH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I have seen some of them down here.,49
154,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I have not. We deal with millions nowadays just as we used to deal with hundreds in davs gone by. We have got into the habit of talking in millions. the Commonwealth taxation was equal to £ 4 8s. per head of the. population. 1912-13 it was £ 6 8s. l i d . per head of the population. When I urge that economy should be effected, I do not suggest that men should be thrown. out of employment. That is the worse form of economy in which we could indulge. We must keep men in employment and see that their services are adequately rewarded.",49
155,Mr CORSER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,What items could the honourable member cut down that would not interfere with the working man?,49
156,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I would put down one item that the honourable member is defending, and that is the item relating to the Commonwealth Police Force.",49
157,Mr CORSER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The honourable member has no right to make that statement. It is not true.,49
158,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I ask that that remark be withdrawn.,49
159,Mr CORSER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I withdraw it , but I ask the honourable member to withdraw the statement that I defend the creation of the Commonwealth Police Force.",49
160,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I withdraw it , but I gathered from the honourable member's interjection at an earlier stage that he supported the creation of the Force. I have no desire to h u r t his feelings, and I hope he will vote with me to strike out the item. In 1901-2, the Commonwealth taxation was £ 4 8s. per head of population. In 1912-13 it was £ 6 8s. l i d . Since that date we have sent hundreds of thousands of our men overseas.",49
161,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,There were no old-age pensions in 1901-2.,49
162,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,In 1917-18 the taxation was equal to £ 8 178. 6d. per head. How long can we continue that rate of increase?  member recognise that there has been a war in progress ?,49
163,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I have already said that these figures do not in clude war expenditure. If the Minister does not know that, we ought to get a hammer and d r ill , and drive the fact into In 1901-2 his head. If we could double the population tomorrow we could reduce by half In the taxation per head, and surely nobody will contend that we would require a greater number of pofet-offices, - public servants, and Parliaments ! That is the most favourable light in which the expenditure can be put. We cannot go on. increasing expenditure at the present rate. We have just escaped one of the most terrible disasters that ever threatened any people. Recently we have been permitted to know how near we were in A p r i l last to having the Huns for our masters. We have averted that calamity; but is there any thinking man or woman in the country who does not realise that right ahead of us lies terrible trouble? Finance is the fundamental principle of government, and if we' reach a stage at which we are no longer able to pay our 'way, what will be the result? We may progress a certain distance along the road we are travelling, but we shall, come to a turn ing at which we are face to face with bankruptcy. I defy any honourable mem-. ber to deny that if we continue along our present lines national bankruptcy will stare usin the face. Another crisis is in front of us, and we ought to put our house in order. What are we to do? In my opinion, the answer is very simple. We should operate the country's affairs according to common-sense business principles, and spend the people's money with the same care as we spend our own. In deed, we ought to exercise more care in the expenditure of money that does not belong to us. If a man is at all decent, he will always be more careful in the handling of other people's money than in the handling of his own. We have not an inexhaustible reservoir of wealth from which to draw. We are at the l i m it of taxation, if , indeed, we are not beyond it . We are able to stand heavy taxation now because we have had bountifu l seasons, and profitable arrangements have been made by the Government for the handling and sale of a number of our primary products. For what Ministers have done in that regard I give them every credit. . During the good seasons we have enjoyed we ought to have imposed more taxation, but we neglected our opportunity. Men and women, who have made hundreds of thousands of pounds, should have contributed more to meet our requirements when trouble comes upon the community. What will happen if we strike years of drought and depression ?",49
164,Mr SAMPSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Are we not now all the available sources of revenue?,50
165,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"We have tapped a good many of them. The Act made an interjection regarding the war expenditure. Surely the honourable member knows that, on a population basis, our expenditure is nearly up to that of Great Britain , and we have not finished with it yet. Hundreds of thousands of our men are still overseas, and surely no honourable member will contend that we should not look after them when they return. But what provision are we making for them ? Our Federal and State debt bill , per head of population, is £144, as compared with Britain's debt bill of £ 1 5 7 . Honourable members will see that we are very close to the border line; we cannot go much further. There are means of overcoming this trouble-wh y do we not utilize them ? I find that the Estimates include an amount of £6,421 for the Commonwealth Police Force. Will any honourable member defend that expenditure ? I do not wish to discuss the reasons as to why that Force was created. were passing through strenuous times, and desperate cases demand desperate remedies. I can quite understand that in the stress of trouble some expenditure has been wrongfully incurred. But what is the proper thing for us to do today? We must use common sense, and realise that if we continue spending as we are doing now, we shall go headlong down the hill to ruin. We should realise that there is no need for the continuance of this Police Force. I read recently that Sergeant Kenny, who figured minently in the Warwick incident, has beeu promoted. Does that fact suggest that he had overstepped his duty and had done anything wrong? I shall listen with pleasure to any honourable member who will try to convince me that the provision of £6,421 for the Commonwealth Police Force is a reasonably sane p r o position. We know that the Estimates are prepared by public servants. I have nothing to say against public servants as individuals. It is cowardly to attack men when they cannot defend themselves. But the Service, as a body, is overtapping staffed. In a community of 5,000,000 people there are 240,000 public servants. I thank God that we have some good public servants, who will stand up to Ministers, and to anybody else, and fight for the interests of the taxpayer; but there are tens of thousands of them who are overpaid and underworked. On the other hand, many thousands of them are doing nothing. I say that a man is doing nothing when he merely sits in a room and writes a minute to an officer in the next room and sends for a messenger to register it . Thousands pf men are doing little more than that. We know that often a junior officer makes a recomnow mendation which is initialed by a senior Great officer and placed before a Minister who is too busy to analyze it . Because of these red-tape methods the Commonwealth, has the huge number of 240,000 public servants. I am often told that, in criticising the Service, I am "" batting on a wet wicket,"" because numbers of public servants and their relatives live in my electorate. But I tell them on the platform that the present state of things cannot continue. It is We the officers who are responsible for many of the items which appear on the Estimates. An y body of business men would make such a change in these proposals that the Government would not recognise them.",50
166,Mr SAMPSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,No Department likes to diminish its own importance.,50
167,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Every honourable member knows how a Department grows. I remember in the early days of Federation a statement being promade by my old chief, Sir Edmund Barton-whos e equal we have not seen in Federal politics ",50
168,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The honourable member may fight for his joss, and I will fight for mine. I have nothing to say against the Prime Minister at this stage. He is well able to defend himself. If at any time. I have occasion to criticise him I shall do it when he is present. We must all admit that William Morris Hughes did a lot for this country. the hour of stress and trouble he stood out in bold relief, and the people looked to him to protect them from the noisy minority who might possibly become a majority. Sir Edmund Barton estimated that the new services of the Commonwealth would cost the country £300,000 per annum. Somebody at that time estimated that the expenditure would be nearly £750,000 , and Sir Edmund Barton said that the statement was extraordinary. I wonder what he thinks today of new services costing £15,000,000. Has our population increased so wonderfully ? Have we progressed so very much ? Is the position of Australia greatly improved ? I do not think it is. We have read a good deal about the expenditure that has taken place in London. A previous Government provided for the building of Australia House in London at an estimated cost, including land, of between £300,000 and £400,000. The actual expenditure - including furnishings, has been nearly £1,000,000 . We have read particulars of the great apartments 60 feet long, and the audience 'chambers. It has been said that Australia House is better than Buckingham Palace. If so, it is "" some house.""",51
169,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Shoul d not Mr Fisher be suitably housed ?,51
170,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Yes; but he should also be suitably worked. I have nothing to say against Mr Fisher as a public servant; but what is he doing ? We have two Ministers at Home in addition to him, and yet it is said that another Minister is to be sent, though when I and other members ask questions on the subject we receive no definite reply. If Mr Fisher cannot carry out the demobilization, he should be recalled, even if we have to pay him compensation for shortening his term of office. It would be absurd to send another Minister Home while we have a High Commissioner.  Fisher if another Minister is sent Home.",51
171,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,No . It is for the Government to give him a chance. N  do the work he should be superseded.,51
172,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"In my opinion, Mr Fisher did very well while In in this country, and probably would do well if we gave him a chance to conduct the demobilization. I .would as soon trust his cautious head and carefulness in regard to detail as get the services of any other man in this country. If we send Home another Minister it will mean more expense. ",51
173,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I do not think so. Our Public Service has been increased in the period between 1913-14 and 191718 by 7,406 persons.",51
174,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That is the increase in the Public Service proper. There are others who are being paid by the Government but are not public servants in the strict sense of the term.,51
175,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"In addition, there are some thousands of temporary employees who have been taken on largely because of the war, and whose services will be dispensed with when no longer needed. There are many persons in the employment of the Government whose salaries are not shown in the Estimates. We have been told by the Minister for Repatriation (Senator Millen) that there is no need in this country for new industries. Imagine any one telling us that! The returned men are to be put on the land at a cost which is now estimated at from £2,00 0 to £2,50 0 a man. They are being put mostly on land in the Never-Never country, where 75 per cent, of them will fail . When they are put on decent land, it is frequently overcapitalized. How many members of this House would finance men who had no knowledge of rural pursuits and wished to go on the land ? Not one of us would take the risk. Those who would make a living on the land must have a knowledge of rural pursuits. I would back up men who have some knowledge, arid who wished to go> on the land, but it will be better if most of our men return to their old avocations. The Minister for Repatriation tells us that he will need £50,000,000. If 100,000 soldiers are to be put on the land at a cost of £2,500 each, he will need a much bigger amount than he has stated. the necessary money, because we are very nearly at the end of our borrowing possibilities. If , instead of putting all the men ou the land, we put a large number of them into industries it would cost less than £300 a man-between £254 and £264 a man. decentralization and the opening up of the country, but men should not be put on the land and starved. importations were sufficient to have found employment for 300,000 persons in industries that would not have been affected by drought or fire, or the one thousand and one causes of failure which menace - the man on the land.",51
176,Mr LIVINGSTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"But if you have not men on the land, how will your industries be supported ?",52
177,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"We need both. An artisan population would make the best market in the world for the man on the land. The present splendid prices of primary produce are not likely to continue, and it will be necessary to increase the home market for the farmer.",52
178,Mr SAMPSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,We send too much of our raw material overseas.,52
179,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,1 agree with the honourable member. We shall have to put a stop to that. know why we should send our wool to the other side of the world to be made into cloth when there are persons in this country wanting work.,52
180,Mr JH CATTS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Why should we not export flour instead of wheat?,52
181,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I think that we should export flour instead of wheat. People should be brought here and employment should be found for them in factories. If we doubled or trebled the population of the country the success of the farming industry would be assured, because of the big home market that would be established. The repatriation methods that are now being proposed will be a failure. I have not .a word to say against Senator Millen, who is an [351] able man ; but recently Major Cunningham, who has a good reputation, resigned a snug billet in the Repatriation Department on the ground that letters on important matters which he had written to the central office in June last had not been replied to. It is not often We cannot borrow that men in snug permanent billets .have the courage to take a stand like that. Of course, there are two sides to every question, and I admit that the Minister must control the Department. But centralization is a curse in a country, like this. About half the population of New South I favour Wales is in Sydney, and about half the population of Victoria is in Melbourne, and we ought not to increase the centraliI n 1914 our zation. I wish to know what will be done for those who went across the sea to fight for us-wh o left the far m , the mine, and the workshop at the risk of their lives and of everything that they possessed ? Unfortunately many of them' will never return. B at what of the others? Are we going to tell them that while acting as their trustees we have allowed the country to d r if t into a state of chaos ? I know what I would say if I were in their place. The opportunities for getting work in this country are not good at the present time, and many men will go hungry this Christmas. It is easy for us to say that that is their f a u l t , but I know from experience that many good men cannot find employment. The honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) mentioned some cases yesterday, and every one of us is acquainted with similar cases. Is it fair I do not for Parliament to vote away the monev of the country without consideration* The Acting Prime Minister (Mr W at t ) is as capable as any man here, but we are entitled to have our say on proposals for expenditure. In 1914 the value of our manufactures was double that of our agricultural produce. The agriculturists are the backbone of this country, but they must have a market. I should be sorry to see a change of Government now, because the men in power, although all of them may not I * as good as others who could replace thera, have a knowledge of details, and keep the machine going round, though very slowlv. Still, we on the Ministerial cross benches have as much right to express our view* of what should he done as have the members of the Opposition. I have no axe to grind, because there are no industries and hardly any mines in my constituency. Minin g has been starved out there. Under our present arrangements the people are being charged twice and three times as much for the necessaries of life and for the implements which they use in their daily work than they should be charged. Are we not to have some change in that respect? In 1913-14 the note issue was £9,979,568, and today it is £59,676,401. I do not know as much about nnance as many other honourable members, but the other day I heard of a man being asked by his banker why he did not apply for part of the Seventh War Loan. reply was that the bank already had a "" plaster "" on him. Nevertheless, the banker fixed him up with £1,000 in notes, with which he was able to go to the Commonwealth Bank and make a contribution to the war loan. The Government pays 5 per cent, interest on that little parcel of paper. Where does that sort of financing lead us? We know the banks have behaved well. People rail at them. But God knows where we should be were it not for their generous business spirit. The banks belong to the rich and poor people of this country. A great number of poor persons hold bank shares, which are their only means of support.",52
182,Mr CONSIDINE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I should like to know that that was true.,53
183,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"If the honourable member had his way this state of things would not continue much longer How are we going to repay our loans? They have been of service to us, and I take no exception to them, so long as they are handled on proper - lines; but they are growing to an alarming extent, according to my idea of finance. The Commonwealth Bank is, I believe, well conducted, and has some of our brainiest officials in the conduct of its affairs; but, on the word of men who ought to know, I have no hesitation in saying that the Bank, to a large - extent, lives on Government business. Look at the millions of Government money lying in the Bank with mo return in the shape of interest. I do not wish to be misunderstood when I am speaking of this matter. I do not blame the Treasurer (Mr W at t ) , though I hope he has made some alteration. All I can think is that he must be too busy, because, from the little I know about him, he is too "" k e e n "" to stand that sort of business. As to the officials of the Treasury, I know how "" keen "" they are. I am most thankful, that in some of our big public servants we have men who are all for the interests of the country; and if an honourable member lays before the Treasury officials some p it if u l case they think deserving of assistance, the officials always take the side of the country, and use the public money as carefully as if it belonged to themHis selves. They are always ready to stand up against Ministers, members, or anybody else; and that is a good thing. But the Bank should not be able to issue great balance-sheets, principally at the expense of Government business, and attempt to show successful results on such a basis. I find that the State and Federal debts now run into more than £700,000,000. That is not much when you say it quickly, but it will take some paying for ; and I should be very glad to hear some honourable member outline a method. I object to our indebtedness keeping on increasing in this way with these, as with all other, Estimates. Many of my constituents are hard working people, who rise before daylight to mil k their cows, and face cold, rain, and snow; and I do not wish their load to be made any heavier. We are told that in this country we are gradually changing our attitude, that we are becoming a community of "" leaners ""-that we are all propping up against the Government. If that be so, the country will simply topple over with its growing expenditure. I do not blame the Government for much of the past expenditure to which I have referred, but I do blame them for the present expenditure. The Treasurer understands nnance, and has had time to get "" into the saddle,"" and it is time he "" took a pull "" . He is a popular man, in whom the people have f a it h ; and if he uses his ability, and consults what I believe to be the people's interests, by cutting down expenditure, and introducing common sense legislation, he will do a great deal of good. Indeed, that is my object this afternoon- I wish to reform the honourable gentleman a little. I do not wish him to take a dictatorial attitude towards me, or towards honourable members, because those retorts and interjections of his look very ugly when in the cold prin t of Hansard. I think he is regarded as the champion interjector of the country.",53
184,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"This is, indeed, the "" pot calling the kettle black "" !",54
185,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"There are people who do not wish him well, and who prophesy that his facility for saying smart things will prove his downfall. must say that if I had his power in this respect, I would use it oftener; but, then, the honourable gentleman must remember that he has more responsibility than I have. When I read in Hansard one of the honourable gentleman's interjections to me, I thought that it looked, as I say, very ugly. Many of my constituents have a good opinion of me, and I am afraid that when they see these remarks of the Treasurer, they will say, "" See what he thinks of Chapman.""",54
186,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Will the honourable member permit me one interjection ?,54
187,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Interjec tions are disorderly 1,54
188,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Y o u do not seriously say that I attempt to be dictatorial to you or any other honourable member ?,54
189,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Y o u have sent. been getting a bit that way lately.,54
190,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Now you are hedging.,54
191,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"My own believe personal opinion is that we have too many Governors, too many liaments, too many public establishments altogether in Australia; and I only mention this because some of these establishments are provided for in the Estimates. The honourable member for Illawarra (Mr Hector Lamond) is evidently of the same opinion as myself, because in my absence he asked the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt ) to give time for the discussion of a motion I have on the notice-paper to call a convention, with a view to cutting down the number of governmental authorities in Australia. However, the honourable member accepted [351]- 2 the bland statement of the Acting Prime Minister that he would consider the matter. The honourable gentleman considers many things, and that is the end of them. There is too much duplication all round, and in this connection I should like to take the Acting Prime Minister to task. On one occasion, in a speech, he said that this duplication must be stopped; but I ask him, what about the Income Tax Department and the Land Tax Department? I remember that on one occasion he offered a State to collect its in come tax for one-third of what the collection is costing today.",54
192,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"And said it would save I £1,500,000.",54
193,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I said the people would save that amount, not that it would be saved on the Estimates.",54
194,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The same people have to find the money. Why not have one Taxation Department? Why not follow the example of little Tasmania, and have one electoral roll for both Commonwealth and States? The duplication is simply awful-w e have two taxing Departments and two electoral branches, two of everything. There are even two sets of Savings Banks, and the State Governments are building fine banking premises all over the country in order to compete against the Commonwealth Savings Bank. There is too much of this, and we ought to have a change-w e ought at least to try to give Australia a chance, which is not what we are doing at prePresently we shall be having a great number of arrivals in Australia, and I that the outlook is not dark if we exercise common sense. Our soldiers Par- across the sea have given this country a great advertisement, and Australia is known as it was never known before. I remember, when I was climbing Mount Vesuvius on one occasion, in 1902, our guide asked me where I came from , and I proudly said that I came from Australia.",54
195,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,He possibly thought you came out of the volcano.,54
196,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"At any rate, he caused me to wonder whether he had come out of the A r k . When I said I came from Australia, the guide questioned, "" A u s t r i a ? "" "" No , "" I said, "" I come from Australia,"" and his reply was, "" I never heard of it . "" That was from a man who gets his livingfoytaking tourists up the mountain. But never again will it be possible to meet such ignorance. Our soldiers have written their deeds in words of gold all over the world, and for this we owe much to them, for I believe it will be the means of doing great good to this country. We have suffered great losses at the Front; but the fame of the Australians will cause people in the older countries to what sort of a country it can be that sends such men to the Front, and what sort of a country is it j n which so consideration is extended to the poorest of the poor? My own opinion is that, in' the future, we shall see ships crossing the ocean, crowded like motor buses in the street, bringing hundreds of thousands to Australia; and that is our hope, for the more people we have, the more easily we shall be able to meet the inevitable taxation. No one can say that there is no room for new industries, for we must have them if we are to prosper. I do not object to a large expenditure if it is reproductive, and gives the people a chance. I appeal to the Acting Prime Minister to "" get a move on,"" and reduce some of our enormous expenditure. What about the Northern Territory mess? A little while ago the Government ""took a pull,"" but where .was it effective? At Canberra; and the Treasurer has told us that the revenue now has almost come up to the expenditure.",54
197,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That is due to the'action we took last year.,55
198,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"What has the action resulted in? Some years ago, I wrote to the then Prime Minister (Sir Joseph Cook) and pointed out the extravagance that was going on at Canberra and Jervis Bay. I did not do that to benefit myself, for my electors are only human, and do not object to large expenditure in their district. Naturally they objected to my calling for retrenchment, but, all the same, I did so, for wo could have big expenditure without extravagance. I offered, if a Commission were given me, to prove, free of expensp, the true state of affairs, cluding facts to which the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Kelly) has called attention. However, I got the stereotyped reply, after a while, that nothing could be done in the matter. At that time, I pointed to two places in my electorate, where, since then, hundreds of thousands of pounds have been wasted; and this only shows our inefficient system of government. I remind the Acting Prime Minister that there was a Royal Commission appointed after £1,000,000 had been misspent, and that Royal Comask mission made some very strong reports, which I do not desire to read on this occasion. The evidence then given was much astounding; but what did the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) do? He stifled the whole thing, though I do not say that he did that in an improper way.",55
199,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I did not do that as Acting Prime Minister, but as Minister for Works and Railways.",55
200,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That does not matter; you are resoonsible.,55
201,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I carry the responsibility.,55
202,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Did the honourable gentleman not promise to have a further inquiry made?,55
203,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I did, too.",55
204,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Then why did we nob see the result?,55
205,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,All the papers are put on the table.,55
206,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,They are not.,55
207,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,They have been put on the table.,55
208,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Then I have not seen them, and I have been asking for them. How many honourable members have got the printed reports of that Royal Commission ?",55
209,Dr MALONEY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I got them after a lot of trouble.,55
210,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"There is a curious history about this Royal Commission. Where are the printed reports? What is being done at Canberra today? Sixty miles of the best built roads in Australia are going to waste, and houses are falling into disrepair; and this is called economy. What about the waterworks at the Federal Capital? There is an unfortunate dispute amongst some of the officials of the Department, and I in- take neither one side nor the other, for they can very well defend themselves; but I do say that the action by some of the officers will probably have the effect of driving out of the country the man who designed the Federal Capital; in deed, I believe that is what they are aiming at.",55
211,Mr JH CATTS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,There is a conspiracy.,56
212,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I do not say that there is a conspiracy, but the action of these officers would lead one to think so. Mr J. H. CATTS - Commissione r Blacket's report says so.",56
213,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Let us see what will happen when Mr Griffin's term of engagement is up. I believe that the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Groom) is responsible for carrying out the works at the Federal Capital.,56

Mr Griffin, ciple or not. we know, is a great genius at laying out towns, and in the case of the design for the Federal Capital competed and won against the best men in the world.",56

217,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The honourable member will be able to tell us all quite wrong. about that presently. Nevertheless, believe he is right, and that Mr Blacket was right. We have Mr Griffin man who can command a great deal of private work, a man who is quite difglad ferent from many Americans, who, prior to the war, were looked upon as dollarthe chasers; a talented man, who made geranong site. great financial sacrifices when left his country to come to Australia; yet when the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Groom) wanted littl e township laid out at the Arsenal, he did not do what any business man would do who had in his employ one of the best landscape architects in the world; he did not utilize the services of that man, but borrowed the services of Mr Morrell, a man from a State Departmen ment.",56
218,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"As a matter of fact, was selected by the Defence Department.",56
219,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Mr Morrell has been engaged in this work. Will the Minister deny that some one has also sent for Mr Reed, of South Australia, in connection with the same work? Why is Mr Griffin not intrusted with this work? What does this Minister, who is such a pronounced opponent of Socialism, do in regard to the building of houses? When I asked him a civil question as to what would happen in connection with the building of houses at other centres besides Lithgow, he answered, "" It depends upon the requisition the Department receives."" Of course, it might be regarded as a clever answer.",56
220,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,It was not clever. It was a statement of the fact.,56
221,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"It is not one of the facts that will help the honourable member over the stile. It is useless e n for him to "" fence "" the question in that He must toe the mark and say whether he believes in this socialistic prin",56

225,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I am to hear the Acting Prime Minister say so.' I ask him to read the report of Committee which selected the TugW h at happened when he that site was first selected ? Apparently some honourable member in the Ministry sent a Committee all over New a South Wales to look at Bathurst, Tumut, and other places for an alternative site; but it kept coming back again and again with the same report, that each place it had inspected was a very good site, but that there was no other suggested . site equal to Tuggeranong. Then two extra were employed to lay out a township alongside the Arsenal, and the Public he Works Committee was sent to Queanbeyan to make inquiries about building a railway to the site. But after all this had been done the Ministry "" took a pull."" It is quite extraordinary that they could not "" take a pull "" in regard to the Northern Territory, Naval Bases, or some other expenditure. I did not advocate big expenditure at Canberra during the war period, but it is a scandal that during eighteen years we have made practically no advance in the establishment of the Federal Capital there.",56
226,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,We have up a scrap of paper.,57
227,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Yes , dozen times. The Federal Territory ought to have been put on a paying basis. We should have established a Trust on the lines of a Harbor Trust and given it a certain amount of money to go on with . We could have made good money by doing so. We have resumed a large area of land, but there is still a lot more to be resumed. The unfortunate owners cannot get compensation even for property which was resumed on values fixed in 1908, and we know that values have considerably increased since then. There are cases of hardship in the Territory because of the lack of action on the part of the Government in this respect. what have Ministers done? The Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt ) takes credit for having stopped work upon the Arsenal. Of course, if he thinks that expenditure at Canberra is all waste, which ought to be stopped, he would not be worth his salt if he did not stop it ; but the people will not permit any Government to stop the development of the Federal Capital for ever. We have invited architects all over the world to send in designs for Parliament House. I believe that 126 designs have been sent in . Yet something prevents their consideration. I am told that the desire is to give the young architects who have been at the war an opportunity to submit designs. It is an absurd proposal. Children would not talk in that way. ought to shift the Capital to Canberra and get into a Federal atmosphere. would be an economical step. paying high rents for the buildings we occupy in Melbourne. We could put up our own buildings at Canberra. Trust could make the development of the Territory a paying concern. I do not know much about finance, but I should? not be afraid to be standing in with men who were allowed to put up publicbuildings and Parliament House for the Commonwealth and be paid by results. I know that it would pay them to> do so. Does the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) propose to allow the roads to get into a state of disrepair?' It is all very well for the Acting Minister  Let him go to Cockatoo Island and see torn the scandals there. ' I must be fair to> the honourable member. I know that, a he is not responsible for many of them, and that he has done good work there; but when I drew attention to the affairs at the island I was told that there was nothing wrong. However, the M in ister visited the island immediately afterwards and cut down some of the outrageous expenditure there by at least J£30 per week, and I believe that if the Minister would visit the dock again he couldf cut off a little more unnecessary expenditure. It is not an isolated case of extravagance. We have heard the> statements of the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) and others Yet who are members of the Public Works Committee concerning Naval Bases. It is like reading Jack the Giant K ill e r to peruse some of the extraordinary statements made by honourable members concerning expenditure on Naval Bases. The Public Accounts Committee has also reported on similar lines. There must lo» a change. I am told that it is essential that the work at the Federal Capita? should be suspended. I have no desire to censure the Acting Prime Minister. I am merely telling him these things so that he may follow the right course. T am not handing him any bouquet when I say that there is no man in this country who knows better than he does that what I say is true. He is a practical man. He has had great experience-Ministeria l exWe perience-and he knows something about the commercial life of Australia. We It look to him to do what ought to be done.

I am a sick man.. I know that soma 'have been kind enough to say that I am looking for something. If I could put my finger on the man who has made that statement he could look for something from me. Men who have no ambition are not worth a dump. Is it any crime for any of them to aspire to get on to the front Government Bench ? It is not. There are many men sitting in the Ministerial corner who could occupy a seat on the front Bench, and when they possessed the ^knowledge of details that Ministers have they could render good service to the people of this country. But I do not wish to be one of them. . I have no present ambition in that direction. In my present state of health it would be unwise for me to take on any strenuous task.",57

229,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I am talking about Australia. It is necessary to have a change, and I shall be delighted if we can get a number of men on the front Bench who would put the same vim and go into things that the Acting Prime Minister himself puts into them, even though he may be misguided in many cases. I am delighted to have elicited one fact from him in regard to ""Canberra.",58
230,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The honourable member wants less expenditure, and, at the same time, more of it.",58
231,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I do not want extravagant expenditure. It is of mo use chucking money into the sea, but in many cases that is what has been done. I am a great listener to the Acting Prime Minister. I shall listen with interest when he is endeavouring to explain some of the items on these Estimates, particularly the item of £6,421 for the Commonwealth Police. It will be interesting to hear his explanation. I give him credit for standing up to his chief, and I have .a certain amount of sympathy for him.",58

But he would have to mend his ways. I do not object to the expenditure of money. When I talk about economy, I do not mean the wholesale discharge of men. What I want is economical expenditure on reproductive works. I do not want a repetition of the dreadful and glaring instances of extravagance that have been pointed out by members of the Public Works and Public Accounts Committees. One does not have to go far in order to find them. With a view to testing the feeling of the Committee, I move That the first item be reduced by £1. I do this with a view to the Estimates being returned to the Government, accompanied by the express desire of the Committee that economy should be exercised, and that the Estimates should be reframed in a form more acceptable to honourable members.",58

He has said that he is always a listener to the observations I make when I have the privilege of addressing the House. His statement is more or less true, and we are always glad to welcome him in the Chamber, because we know that he is a sick man, and that he attends to his duties, perhaps, more than his physical condition justifies. In return for the honourable member's compliments, I say that I always listen to him with considerable interest. He possesses that dramatic quality which, whether he is talking sense or not, always interests friends or foes alike. I hope that he will not take any malice out of that remark, because he and I , in our best moments, when we are less weary, have each a little of the sporting instinct of politics.

Whether he knows it or not, he is prejudiced on the Canberra question - I would blame him if - he were not-and I am quite sure that he cannot look upon it in the dispassionate way in which Ministers are obliged to look at any proposal in relation to expenditure at Canberra during war time. On many occasions in this House he has been eloquently and trenchantly severe on Government after Government has not conducted some there during war time vigour and pace he imagines When I took control of the Works Office, the Royal Commission to which my honourable friend has referred was just reporting, and I examined the whole matter as carefully as a man could do. I did not spend upon the subject as much time as the Commissioner did, but I gathered all. the information that I could, and I said to my honourable friend, as I did to others, "" No Minister should his functions to a Royal Ministers are responsible to the Parliament."" With regard to the results of that inquiry, and the treatment the report received, I , as a member of the Government, and the itself, took the responsibility; plain that the honourable member foundly disagreed with the policy followed. Accompanied by the honourable member and the Minister for Home and Territories, I paid a visit Federal Capital. It was one of the most enjoyable trips that I had ever had. I was surrounded by the honourable member's hospitable friends, and Mr Wnti. I have charmed by his delightful stories, for nearly a week, and if ever a man ought to have been cajoled from the path of duty I propose to into the spending of money lavishly at the instance of an honourable member, my honourable colleague and I should have been. But what we did was to come Most back, and tell the Cabinet a plain, unvarnished story, with the result that particularly when the next Estimates were framed the If Cabinet plainly said that, with the exception of salvage works to maintain the undertakings already carried out at the Federal Capital, we ought not to spend any more upon enterprises in that region while the war continued. That decision met with the full approval of the people of Australia, with the exception, perhaps, of those residing within territory bordering on the Federal Capital. There was a lot of intriguing, irrespective of party-and I use the word in its descriptive, and not in its opprobrious, senseto hustle the Ministry out of the track it had mapped out for itself, and to in duce it to. spend more money on the which Federal Capital.

236,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I do not know whether that is so or not. I am talking in terms, not of time, but of conditions, and I should not be frank if I did not tell the Committee exactly what I think with respect to the subject. The honourable member for Eden Monaro suggested that these Estimates should be taken back. I do not know whether he has done himself the justice of reading them. If he has, he will recognise that if the Committee were to carry his amendment, the Government would not be able to save £10,000 on the Estimates as presented. That is not only my own opinion, but the opinion of the best judges in the Department who operated with me in the compilation of the Estimates. It does not refer to the back pages of these Estimates, and it is in respect of them that I think the honourable member-if I may say this of so old a Parliamentarian-is committing a blunder. From page 306 onward all these Estimates",59
237,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Have been passed.,60
238,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"They have not been passed in the sense that I would use the word, but they have all been authorized. None of the items from page 303 onwards will appear in the Appropriation Bill . The Appropriation Bills will cover only the items to be found on pages 1 to 303 inclusive. As to them, after many months of work upon the Estimates, and after mature consideration, I venture to express the opinion that neither with the help of the microscope, nor the pair of scissors to which the honourable member referred, could he pare off £10,000.",60
239,Mr GREGORY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That is a mere matter of opinion.,60
240,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Yes ; and I am giving, not merely my own view, but the opinion of the men best able to judge of the facts. I have worked on the preparation of these Estimates with the responsible officers of the Department, and have checked this opinion, since this matter came up, with some of the most responsible minds in the Department, and I say that the Estimates could not be cut down to the extent of £10,000. regard to the pages from 303 onwards, honourable members know full well that they appear merely as a plain statement, with no legal effect whatever, to show what the total expenditure of the nation is. The items appearing on those pages were authorized when our loan flotations were authorized, and at the present time, as honourable members know, in addition to the money which has been gathered in as the result of the last two loan operations, we still have the authority of this Parliament to raise and to spend another £54,000,000. Throughout the period of the war, whether wisely or not, authorizations for the raising and disbursement of loan moneys have been given en masse, and they are not affected at all by the items in these Estimates. It is true that in the case of these later loan Estimates there will probably be some shrinkages if the peace terms are signed at an early date. I know the basis of those items. I have already ticked off many of them in respect of which I think large savings in our loan expenditure will take place.",60
241,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Wa r loan expenditure ?,60
242,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Yes . There are many items paid out of loan account which, if they had to be met in ordinary times, would be provided for out of revenue. The Commonwealth Shipping Board, for instance, is provided for out of loan account. How soon we can scrap that machinery with safety to the producers of this country, I cannot now say; but of the £10,000 provided for that body, several thousands may, perhaps, he saved, although the provision made for one-half the financial year has already been expended. Then, again, there are items in respect'of recruiting, for special audits of war accounts, and for other matters of the kind attaching to war expenditure.  guards, with which we are rapidly doing away.",60
243,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The naval guards and the home service guards were required during the period of the war, but at the present time they are gradually being diminished. Those items will be saved. The Leader of the Opposition referred to this very phase of the expenditure; With and I want to assure him that the Treasury will take good care that the Departments are not allowed-merel y because they have nominally obtained this authority under either, the Loan or the General Estimates-to spend beyond the absolute requirements of the month, or the quarter. The Treasury takes the responsibility for that, as the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) will realise.",60
244,Mr HIGGS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I am listening, ^ive the honourable gentleman credit for a very pious aspiration.",61
245,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,My illustrious predecessor describes this as a pious aspiration.,61

Treasury today-as it always will do, I trust, if properly run-wil l see that in matters of finance all other Departments are in close touch with it . Cabinet ought to know if Treasury orders relating to finance are disobeyed by any of the Departments. Without affecting any extraordinary "" piety,"" but speaking with a long experience of this kind of thing, I say, without the slightest hesitation, that if I remain in the Treasury until the end of this financial year I shall require the Departments to see that their expenditure out of loan moneys shrinks as it should shrink. I do not think any Treasurer would he worth his salt if he f ailed in that respect.",61
248,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"E very one honourable gentleman's predecessors for the last fifteen years has said the same thing, but has never carried out his promise.",61

250,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,But they have said the same as to all expenditure.,61
251,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"No Commonwealth Treasurer has ever previously been placed in circumstances of this kind. monwealth Treasurer has previously had almost unlimited authority to spend loan money. In addition to the eighty odd million pounds which it is expected will be spent this year-and for the spending of the bulk if not the whole of this amount we have carte blanche-w e have an unexhausted authority to £54,000,000. No Commonwealth Treasurer has ever been in that position before; nor has any previous Treasurer of the Commonwealth had the responsibility for such a huge expenditure, curtailableprobably in two quarters and at least in and I one quarter of the year. As honourable members are aware, from the inception of the Commonwealth our expenditure, in stead of shrinking, has always been growing. On this occasion the reverse is the> case. My honourable friend (Mr AustinChapman) is righ t from one point of The view when he says that the people of A u stralia will not be content* with the duplication or triplication of Government, activities that have grown upon us,, or the duplication, triplication, or multiplication of taxation that hasgrown upon us either as the result, of inter-governmental or parliamentary action, or such action plus the war. I cannot imagine that the people ten years after the signing of the peace terms will allow the whole machinery of Parliament and Government to go on undisturbed at the present huge relative cost per head of the population. They will say to the Commonwealth andState Parliaments alike, -"" Simplify y o u r mode of government. Economize in. your public expenditure and see that you. of the get 20s. value in the £ 1 for every b it of expenditure that is incurred. Above all , see that your expenditure is reproductive."" That has been my objective during more than one-half of my public life, and I certainly shall not make now in any other direction. Since the in My honourable friend implied that I had been long enough in office to bring about all these economies. I went to the Treasury in March last, and had less than three months in which to consider and figure out these Estimates. I would remind my honourable friend and others who are interested in economy of what was No Com- done in that time. They may discount it as much as they please, but the mora experience they have had of departmentalexpenditure the more difficult what was accomplished will appear to be, and the more advantageous the resultundoubtedly will seem to be to those who are able to study it .

When the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman) stood up with his assegai, and commenced his onslaught, instead of preluding the operation by shouts of threat and warning, he cooed to me like a lover. I am very much afraid of him when he brings threats in that guise. I have only this to say in reply to him, that if he hopes to woo the Government he must do so ir> a different way.

When he tells us in his suave way that the Committee can refer back these Estimates, and order the Government to do its bidding, he makes a mistake. The Government will not do that bidding. I wish him to understand that plainly, not as a threat nor as a suggestion that he is not actuated by proper motives, but as a friendly intimation. The Government considered these Estimates carefully, and at the time they were introduced they were right. They are still right, and all the re-examination of them that the honourable member proposes will not save £10,000. W it h regard to other expenditure which will not be included in the Appropriation Bill , we shall save all the money that it is possible to save, but beyond that we cannot go.

I intend to reproduce in Hansard the finding of the Royal Commission which inquired into the Federal Capital administration. If ever a Commission was justified, it was that one; if ever a Commission's findings were flouted, the findings of that Commission were. The inquiry was based mainly on charges made in the House by the present Postmaster-General (Mr . Webster).",64
279,Mr SAMPSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Some of the reports are not worth the paper they are written on.,64
280,Dr MALONEY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I would sooner be- contract lieve them than I would believe the honourable member when he speaks in that way. I am confident that over £250,000 has been lost to this country, and I wish to read the report of the Royal Commissioner, so that the remarks of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro may be understood. The Acting Prime Minister, with all his eloquence, and ability, and charm of manner, tried to discount what the honourable member said. This is what the Royal Commissioner (Mr Wilfred Blacket) reported- . Upon all the evidence, and particularly upon that which has been stated or referred to in this report, I find that the reasons why Mr. Griffin between 18th October, 1913, and 15th November, 1915, performed no substantial pari of his duties under his contract with the Commonwealth are as stated in four of the five charges advanced in his behalf, viz., charges 1, 2, 3, and 5, and are as under: 1. That necessary information and assistance were withheld from him and his powers were usurped by certain officers; 2. That he and his office were ignored, his rights and duties under his contract denied, and false charges of default made against him; 3. That the Honourable W. O. Archibald and members of the Departmental Board endeavoured to set aside his design and to substitute the Board's own design; and 5. That there was in the Department a combination, including the Honourable W. O. Archibald and certain officers, hostile to Mr Griffin, and /to . his design for the Capital City; and that the Honourable W. O. Archibald and the officers mentioned in my references to the evidence under these charges are severally responsible to the extent already indicated by me for this result. But I think it necessary that I should emphasize the fact that ufteTMr Archibald's accession to office it must have been perfectly clear to all the officers that the Ministerial policy was direeted against the carrying out of Mr Griffin's design, and any acts they did «n frustration of Mr Griffin's efforts were tnerefore done in furtherance, as they believed, of the Minister's desires. I cannot say that this excuses them; still the greatest responsibility in respect of the obstruction to Mr GrirTin >n ' with the Minister. Holding the views that ne did as to the "" grave mistake"" that he considered had been made in the engagement of Mr Griffin, he should have adopted one of two alternatives; either to have cancelled the contract and reverted to the design of the Departmental Board, or else to have allowed Mr Griffin's to be performed and his design carried out. As to the fourth charge""That in order to prevent Mr Griffin's design from being carried out, wilfully false estimates of its cost were given;"" I find that it wholly fails, and that no such false estimates, were made. *72 Budget The departmental plan - throughout Australia and the world as - the mongrel plan. Over - the chief architects and engineers of Australia sent a petition regarding it to the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook), who was at the time Prime Minister. What was this Board ? One of its members was Colonel Miller, who has left the Service, to the advantage of the community and the saving of expense. --was not an architect or engineer examination. What examination - Colonel Owen, another member of the Board, ever pass? He possessed merely a complimentary title, given to him because he had filled the office of Director of Works in New South Wales. not sworn evidence that he was the cause of the great waste at the Federal Capital ? In putting a question to a Question 30424-he said, "" Did not I ask you to play the game and stick by the officers that you have worked with for years?"" Never mind the country or the expense: stick to the officers, and make out that they were right, even they nr'ght be as wrong asHades! Thomas Hill, another member Board, was a licensed survevor, and held a better qualification for the work than do the other two I have mentioned. Murdoch, another member of the Board, 13 an architect with a fairly good reputation, but it is not considered that he would win against the architects of Australia if he ever dared to compete against them. Mr Bingle, also a member of the Board, is a man who lied to me, though I did not know it until the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr. who was at the time Acting Minister for Home Affairs, pointed out the Colonel Owen, for what reason I do not know, was sent as a Commissioner India, to inquire into the proper laying out of an Arsenal. Another sioner'was a University professor, and as he had proper scientific knowledge, appointment was justified. But why, if plans for an up-to-date Arsenal needed, did the Government - Commission to India? Why was not the 'Commission sent to France, to England, or to Italy, countries in which war was proceeding; or to neutral countries those of Scandinavia? When the Corner. Maloney.' [REPRESENTATIVES.] (1918-19). was known mission returned, it formulated plans which were turned down. I am informed 145 of that the buildings would not have supported the roofs. Then the Government sent to England for plans. Money would have been saved had that been done in the first case. The appointment of the Commission to India was an absolute waste of money. The fact shows that the country is ruled by a small ring of departmental He heads, whose motto is "" Play the game, by and stand by your fellow officers."" It is did not playing the game, so far as the country is concerned; it is dishonesty. I feel bound to say so much in complement of the remarks of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman), Is there who was cleverly answered by the Acting Prime Minister (Mr W at t ) , but not clearly or decisively. The Acting Prime witness- Minister has managed the House well. He has restrained his natural impulse to make sharp and biting retorts; and when the session is over, he will feel that he has added to his reputation by his abstention from the faults of the past, and has though benefited by it . One could speak for hours on the of the Budget and the evils of the present moment, but I shall confine my remarks chiefly to one subject. I fear lest when Mr our 200,000 soldiers return there may be unemployment. I have had an experience of unemployment such as no other honourable member can equal, having been connected with every unemployed movement since 1889. I know the horrore that followed the crash of the boom. It was the banks putting an end to credits, and telling their branches throughout Kelly), Australia to get in as much money as they could, that hastened the crash. Tofact. day, again, the banks are drawing in their money; but,""thanks chiefly to K in g to O'Malley, we have now a Commonwealth Bank. It is the duty of the GovernCommis- ment to say that they will stand behind the banks. If credit is shaken, the his ddb&ele will be worse than that which followed the boom, or the great maritime were strike. Never in previous wars have the send the banks kept up their credit as in this war. If you glance at the balance-sheets of our various companies,, you will find that all have added to their reserves to like. strengthen themselves against possible difficulties. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro justly said that it is not ' economy to sack the workers, because they are the spenders of the community, every penny that they earn going into circulation. We were willing to pour out millions for the conduct of .the war, and we should be prepared to spend hundreds of thousands in keeping our people employed. Wool and wheat are the twin brothers of our natural resources. What are we doing with our wool? We send it across the sea to be made into cloth, and when we get that cloth back we have to pay, not only for the making of it , but for freight across the sea and back. It is to the eternal dishonour of the Minister for Repatriation (Senator Millen) that he has said that we do not want any new industries in Australia. He has crucified the industry which produced the coat which I am wearing. The men engaged in this, industry are not getting a dog's show. They have to sell their cloth at 15s. a. yard to Buckley and Nunn. Foy and Gibson have promised to do all that they can for them, but some of the yarn that is being supplied by the Government mills is worse than shoddy. Any one could easily untwist it so 'that it would fall apart, being of such short staple. One of the weavers justly said to me, when I spoke to him at his loom, "" If a suit of clothes were made for you out of yarn like that, you would not want to buy such cloth again."" I am proud of the cloth I am now wearing. One of the biggest experts that ever came from England, who is employed by the Commonwealth Government as an adjuster of wool, said that that cloth, although it cost only 15s. a yard here, would bring £ 1 a yard in England at the present moment. Yet, instead of hundreds of our men being employed inweaving, only about a dozen are so employed, and men who have risked their lives at the Front, and have been injured, are fined the amount of their pensions when they take up this work. Is that the way to repatriate sol the State Opposition, some' members of the State Parliament, and others, have had suits made of the cloth that has been woven here, but we cannot get it now without going to Buckley and Nunn. This cloth costs from 6s. 6d. to 7s. 6d. per yard, so surely the profit made on it is sufficient? Although the Commonwealth Government, together with theImperial Government, control the shipping that comes to Australia, the weaving industry has not been allowed sufficient machinery to deal with our wool' in all the processes that are necessary toconvert it into cloth. I have here an article that I would commend to every honourable member, but there are so few present that I ask for a quorum. [Quorum formed.] Some £1,827,000 the worth of textile machinery has been exported from England, and in placing these figures before honourable members. I am pleading for employment, not for a few, hundreds, but for thousands of people. To British East India the British Government allowed £624,942 worth of textile machinery to be sent. Of course,in the East Indies there is any amount of cheap labour; but to Australia, where there is, perhaps, the highest paid labour, only £26,680 worth was permitted to be exported, in spite of the fact that manufacturers here were calling out for it . Russia, we know, at the present moment is in a most unfortunate position, but, the misfortune is not greater than the misunderstanding regarding her; and I ' am waiting natientlv to find out the real' truth of the position.",64
281,Mr CONSIDINE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Russi a will be all' right if the other Powers will let her alone. Dr MAL'ONEY - There may be mucb> in that remark, though, of course, onecannot say. At any rate, to Russia textile machinery to the value of £226,380' was sent; and to Japan, which producesonly about £18,000 worth of wool, £202,000 worth. Japan is going to supply us with yarn, though we could make it here if we were allowed to have the machinery. Textile machinery to the value of £94,546 was sent to SouthAmerica, or nearly four times as much as was sent to Australia. In the publication from which I am quoting there is aparagraph showing the relative quantities of wool raised and manufactured in the various countries. In Australia we produce over 540,000,000 lbs. of wool, and we manufacture only a minute fraction of it . America 300,000,000 lbs. of wool, but they manufacture 480,000,000 lbs., or a difference of 60 per cent.; New Zealand produces 130,000,000 lbs. and manufactures a few million lbs.; Great B ritain produces 120,000,000 lbs., b ut manufactures 482,000,000 lbs., a difference of 300 per cent., and slightly above the figures for the United States of America; France produces 64,000,000 lbs. and manufactures 540,000,000 lbs., or a difference of 600 per cent.; and Germany produces about 10,000,000 lbs. worth of wool and manufactures 460,000,000 lbs., or a difference of 1,669 ner cent. What do these figures mean? Australia is the greatest wool-producing country in the world, and it is the country in which there is the least manufacture of wool. If we had a Government strong and determined enough to see that we were enabled to manufacture our wool, we should command the world to purchase our f oods. I believe that no less than about 6 per cent, of the wool imported into Europe and America is produced in Australia. Owing to our splendid climate we produce a wool of a very fine and high quality, and we are not taking advantage of our circumstances. All through the dreary war years manufacturers here have been asking by deputation and otherwise, for machinery, and this .Government has a Minister of Repatriation, in the person of Senator Millen, who says that he does not believe, in new industries. W h at kind of a-man is that to be at the head of the Repatriation Department? Does he expect the soldiers to go on the Any one of any experience knows that they will have to be helped in more ways than by means of land settlement. We could build up here the greatest woollen industry in the world. We have the .finest natural advantages and the finest raw material; and yet we send all that raw material Home at double cost, in order that it may be returned to us manufactured. My own opinion is that the difference in wages would not equal the difference in the cost of this process if we add the various commissions and other charges that have to be paid. ' Dr Maloney.",66

283,Dr MALONEY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I should like to quote the following.letter, written by Mr . H . L . Wilkinson, vice-president of the Australian Protectionist Association, and, I believe, the president of the Hawthorn branch of the National Federation:NEW BUILDINGS AND IMPORTED LUXURIES. To the Editor of the Age. Sir,-On e would imagine, from the new regulations restricting building in the Commonwealth, that the present Federal Government was really desirous of conserving the wealth of the community for war and repatriation purposes. Without any qualms, and notwithstanding it was pledged to prohibit the importation of luxuries, the same Government allowed the following (amongst other) sums of money to be sent right out of Australia during the twelve months ended 30th June, 1918, to pay for articles we could very well do without, if we could not make them ourselves:£2,115,227, for silks. £1,010,025, for velvets. £470,868, for ornaments for hats. £500,991, for silk and wool stockings. £326,920, for fancy goods. £394,512, for musical instruments. £157,360, for perfumery. £410,778, for jewellery. £1,039,605, for whisky. £174,880, for brandy, gin, and rum. £127,174, for cigars and cigarettes. £853,925, for fish. £245,809, for fruit. £285,099, for nuts and pickles. To restrict the erection of a building costing £251 will possibly help to "" w in the war,"" but what of the above figures? That expresses, in short, concise terms, all the opinions of a man outside, who beland? lieves we ought to manufacture here everything required by man. I should now like to read a furthe r quotation from the article I previously referred to. It is written by Mr O. T . Stephenson, in the Australian Industrial Mining Standard, of the 5 th of this month; and I have to thank Mr Ambrose Pratt for honouring me by bringing it under my notice. It contains the following: The wool grown in Australia in twelve months is valued at well over £26,000,000, and the wool produced during the five years following and including the year 1912, was sold for £130,541,000. Last year's (1917-18) clip was sold for £42,903,000. Every part of the Commonwealth contributes something towards this total, although New South Wales, whose share is 50 per cent, of the whole, is the contributor; Victoria produces 17 per cent.; Queensland, 18 per cent.; South Australia, 0.4 per cent.; Western Australia, G per cent.; Tasmania, 2 per cent.; the Northern Territory, .0 per cent. If we multiply the value of the rough wool - by thi*ee, we reach its manufactured value. That, however, does not completely explain the position, because there have to be added freight, commissions, and so forth . If the wool were manufactured in Australia, we would get its full value, and the money would be circulating amongst ourselves. It is as true today as when Abraham Lincoln said it , that if we manufacture in our own country, we have the locomotive and also the money that is spent in making it ; but if we send elsewhere for a locomotive, our money goes out of the country, possibly never to return ; and, when the locomotive is worn out, we have lost both it and the money we paid for it . If the value of last year's clip was £48,000,000, we can roughly put its value in the manufactured state at £146,000,000. But to this there has also to be added the original value of £48,000,000; so that, by doing all the work in this country, we would create wealth to the amount of £200,000,000. ""We all know that, in Australia, 100 years ago, 5 lbs. of wool from one sheep was considered phenomenal, so much so that Captain MCArthur recorded such an event as historical. To-day, however, 40 lbs. has been taken off a single ram, showing what can be achieved by careful breeding. We have to remember that sheep are lian going to be raised in most countries the world. In nearly every country are large and suitable areas; and it right that we should seize the opportunity, and, by manufacturing our own goods, be prepared to undersell those other tries in the open market, as I think we' Wales. could do. Some years ago an interesting comparibecause son between the profits of the wool dustry in Australia, South America, the United States of America was drawn up for the information of the American Congress. The report showed the receipts per head of the sheep to be as follows:-In the United States of largest America, 10.67s., operating expenses, 8.77s., leaving a profit of 1.9s. j in Australia, 9.16s., operating expenses 3.95s., leaving a profit of 5.21s.; and in South America, 8.75s. operating expenses, 4.77s., leaving a profit of 4s. Although the receipts per head in the United States of America are higher than those in Australia, the profit - in the United States of America is only 1.9s. per head as against 5.21s. per head in Australia, where, during normal years, receipts from other sources often pay working expenses, leaving little, if any, charge against the wool. The Australian Woollen Mills Limited at Marrickville, near Sydney, specializes in the manufacture of serges. In fact it is the only mill in Australia employed exclusively in the manufacture of worsted material. About 2,000,000 lbs. of greasy wool per year is purchased for treatment in this factory, and from this material is produced 1,000,000 lbs. of tops. The tops are spun into thread at the rate of 4,000 lbs. of hosiery and knitting yarns per week, and 10,000 lbs. of yarn used chiefly for indigo serges, cloth for the A r m y, Navy, railway, and tramway services, the balance of tops being supplied to the local manufacturers for spinning into hosiery yarn. Over 1,000,000 yards of 18-oz. khaki serge have been supplied for the A r m y, and 83,000 yards have been supplied to the Navy. Honourable members can see how easily this business could be increased. Already there are thirty-seven factories, the principal of which are controlled by the following firms:-AustraK n it t i ng Mills at Richmond, in Vici n toria, Foy and Gibson's, at Collingwood, there in Victoria; the Australian Woollen is only Mills Limited, and Vickers and Company, at Marrickville, in New South Waies, and the Colonial Combing, Spincounning, and Weaving Company, New South In every case these firms require textile machinery for spinning. Some mills have had to close their doors this Government is not asking in the Imperial Government to put textile and machinery on the priority list. One firm sent to the United States in order to get the machinery it requires, only to find that all machinery for combing wool is made in Europe. I am sure that the Motherland, to which we owe so much, would rather let her child have the machinery for making the products, which she m.ay have to purchase fro m us in the future, than supply the requirements of the British East Indies, Japan, South America, Russia, the United States of America in this respect. Why will not Ministers make representations to the Home Government? Deputation after deputation has waited on them with the request that they should do so. We are exporting thousands of pounds worth of wool, yet our manufacturers are crying out for machinery that may give sufficient work to our returned soldiers, and our men and women who are now out of employment. The manufacturers are not asking for bounties; they are simply asking for shipping space to bring out the machinery of which they stand so much in need. What greater instance of the unfairness of the present situation is there than the fact that during 1915, 1916, and 1917 only £26,000 worth of this machinery was sent to Australia, whereas £624,922 worth was sent to the British East Indies? I have been courteously permitted to make use of some notes prepared for Mr C. S. Nathan, of Perth, by Mr A . D . Rankin, a highlyqualified accountant. I strongly advocate that they should be printed and circulated throughout Australia, because they would show the need for some different procedure on the part of the Government more clearly than could any speech, no matter how brilliant or how eloquently delivered. In the course of his notes Mr Rankin saysI t was recently announced in the press the Commonwealth Government had made arrangements for the establishment in the near future of a complete plant for the manufacture of yarn from raw wool; but I have since been informed on excellent authority that the Government will not proceed with this scheme, but will rather concentrate upon the creation of facilities for the importation of the necessary machinery or yarns in order to assist private enterprise. That is what I am asking them to do. I would rather extend our factories so that they could manufacture right from the Dr Maloney. first stage of the taking of the wool off the sheep's back to the last stage of turning out the very finest woollen goods. One stock argument which has been used to my knowledge for over twenty-five years is that we cannot expect to have the patterns for the tweeds and so on that would require to be made. I have shown or that 66 per cent, of the wool that goes to America and Great Britain comes from Australia. If these tweeds are made in Great B ri ta in or America, surely we can bring to Australia the artisans, the clever designers, and those who are skilled in manipulating the weft and the warp of the loom, so that we may secure a variety of patterns. It is true that we could not do a great deal if we had only the market of the 5,000,000 people of Australia to supply, but surely we can look farther afield. No other country in the world can grow wool so cheaply. America can only make a profit of 1.9s. per sheep, whereas we in Australia can make a profit of 5.2s. per sheep. There is already a large Australian market at hand, and wo have only to introduce Australian tweeds, to the notice of the people of Australia to find them quite content to wear them. It was only today that a gentleman stopped me in the street and asked me whether he could obtain a further quantity of hand-woven tweeds made by returned soldiers. He was .willing to buy £50 worth for the requirements of his own family and for some of his neighbours, but he could not be supplied. The Minister for Repatriation (Senator Millen ) has decreed that this industry is to die. There is a difficulty in regard to supply of yarn. Our stocks of yarn come from Scotland, but yarn and that machinery are lying on the wharfs in Great B ri ta in awaiting the Temoval of the priority list to enable it to be shipped to Australia. Some yarn is coming here from Japan, and if that country could manufacture textile machinery we could purchase it and have it brought here without any trouble, but it is incomprehensible to me that the Government will not try to stir up the British authorities and get them to put this class of machinery on the priority list. There is no bigger infamy than the list of non-essentials which are being imported and occupying cargo space which could be better filled by textile machinery and the yarn of which I have spoken. I purpose using a few of the arguments set forth in Mr Rankin's notes regarding the woollen industry. These are extracts he has made from various articles in the Industrial and Mining Standard of 18th April, 1918Strong complaints against Commonwealth Government. There are. twenty-two woollen mills established throughout the Commonwealth, the largest of which is that owned by Foy and Gibson. Threatened shortage of the wool yarn used for knitting, sweaters, jerseys, socks, and other woollen articles. Australian companies practically on a wool ration, as British Government had commandeered all wool tops, and out of total quantity, had allotted a certain proportion for Australian needs. All woollen yarn used by Australian knitting mills imported from Scotland. Only mill in Victoria making wool yarn is that of. Foy and Gibson, who spin portion of their requirements. Australian knitting mills would have put in a spinning plant eighteen months ago if it could have obtained the assistance of the Commonwealth Government in obtaining the necessary machinery from England. The Lincoln Knitting Mills,. Carlton, would also have made a start some considerable time ago, and, in their anxiety to make a start, had despatched a representative to America to secure the necessary machinery. . . . found that the combing machines were made nowhere but in Europe, and the rest of the plant would be useless without these machines. . . \are importing wool yarn from Japan at a price substantially higher than the same yarn could be manufactured here in Australia. Has orders for tens of thousands of pounds of work, which it is unable to execute, owing to shortage of the necessary raw material, which raw material it could manufacture on the spot if the necessary machinery were obtainable. What Australia is doing with the Wool Clip. - Sixty-fiv e per cent, of the wool imported into Europe and North America is grown in Aussecuring tralia and New Zealand. The value of the Australian wool clip, repreture senting the value of the wool as it came the sheep's backs, and the amount that Ausskill tralia receives for the wool, for most of the clip was shipped away in the raw state, only 4 per cent, being retained to be manufactured into clothing by Australian factories, was £26,899,000. If the whole of the clip could have been dealt with. in our own factories, the factoryprice of the woollens produced would have been about £80,697,000. The value of woollen piece goods imported into Australia is; per annum, £3,200,000. And, in addition, there is a large quantity of hosiery and knitted goods that contain a certain proportion of wool. I hope that we shall blazon the word' "" Australia "" throughout the length and breadth of our continent, so that every man will be proud to wear clothing of Australian manufacture,- and we shall look with kindly pity upon those who are so unpatriotic as to refuse to buy Australian goods. The report continuesIn one year Australian wool to the value of £523,827 is made up into goods valued, at factory price, £1,500)000, also some. £548,000 worth of wool is made into "" tops "" per year and sold out of the country for £1,204,000. The difficulty of Australian manufacturers has been greatly enhanced by the war conditions; manufacturers who had been in the habit of importing yarn for manufacture of underwear, &c, find their supplies cut off or limited, while those who desire to import extra machinery to meet the extra demand created by the difficulty of importing the usual quantity of finished material are unable to fill their wants. I express my gratitude to Messrs. Foy and Gibson for the assistance they have given those of our returned soldiers who are engaged in hand weaving. They promised to supply them with yarn. I hope the Government will cease sending the rubbish they have recently supplied. I am sorry to describe in that way anything of Government .manufacture; but while the yarn furnished by the Government is not shoddy-if by shoddy we mean yarn consisting of other than wool-it is so short in texture that it is worse than shoddy. This summary continuesMESSRS. Fox AND GIBSON'S EXPERIENCE AS TEXTILE MACHINERY BUILDERS. Their difficulties . . . have centred round the shortage of machinery and the difficulty of shipments of plant from England . . . so great that they have started out to manufacmachines for their own requirements . . . from excellent results obtained . . . high . . . of Australian mechanics. . . . Object of all this effort is to take the wool as it comes from the sheep's back and transform it into a suitable covering for the human body. The plant installed by Messrs. Foy and Gibson receives 5,000 bales of wool per year and transforms this raw material into-Woolle n and worsted yarns, 1,260,000 lbs.; blankets and 'rugs, 65,000 only; flannels, serges, and tweeds, 750,000 yards; socks and stockings, 1,250,000 pairs; knitted garments, 800,000 only. Number of hands employed, 800. Horse-power required, 2,000. Note - The war conditions have evidently created a large increase in the demand, for value of the yarn imported now is four as great as it was five years ago. If we only manufactured all our own requirements in woollens, employment would be for 12,000 people, earning wages considerably over £1,000,000, while, if we manufactured the whole of the Australian wool clip into &c, in Australia, the work would employ 184,000 Australian people, whose wages amount to about £16,000,000 per annum.  member think that under existing conavailable ditions we could manufacture for export.",67
284,Dr MALONEY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I do. There is no. establishing doubt as to the skill of Australian will mechanics. A man with employment exthe perience in Germany, France, America, been very great. and Australia told me that he had never had more intelligent workers than the women who were employed by him here. When the Lyne Tariff was under consideration, I visited practically every factory in Melbourne, and at nearly every methods one of them. I heard the same story of the skill of the Australian report proceedsThe experience of the factories already existence regarding the skilfulness of the tralian operatives, the technical ability of local mechanics, the high quality of the goods prduced, lead us to the conclusion that a great required for the spinning processes. development of the wool industry of Australia merely awaits the creation of the necessary chinery for taking the wool clip as it leaves, shearing shed and transforms it apparel. The difficulty-arisin g from the scarcity of yarn-the raw material of the knitting trade. As a result, the organization of some of these factories has already undergone serious dislocation, and complete dismemberment threatened. The Australian manufacturer wishing to place orders for yarn on the British spinner, must secure the support of the British Government, as the British spinner will not accept orders without a guarantee that delivery will be perning mitted. The alternative is to manufacture larger plies here in Australia, and for some time efforts have been made to secure the necessary . . . but without success . . . A notification dated 27th March, 1918, received to effect that the High Commissioner "" had matter in hand."" In the meantime, Canada and America are both installing large plants for the manufacture of woollens, and it is presumed they are obtaining machinery from England, as that is the only source of supply for the best designs. Japan is receiving grants of machinery so far in excess of her own requirements that she offers to sell us the manufactured yarn for 12s. 6d. the per lb. that we could manufacture ourselves if times we had the plant and sell at 6s. per lb.",71
285,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,They must found have done well out of the Red Cross yarn.,71
286,Dr MALONEY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"They did well cloth, out of the machinery which the British Government allowed to be sent to Japan, would but refused to allow to be sent to AustraliaJapan is obtaining facilities that are not to Australia, and the present circumstances afford her people opportunities of their industry in the position that make it unassailable at the termination of war.

We can secure the necessary plant for the complete processes of manufacturing yarn from worker. The from the crude wool. We may save most. of the machinery required for these processes if the wool tops that in we are exporting can be made available for use Ausin Australia, and the necessary but comparathe tively simple spinning plant obtained abroad. . . . making in Australia the machinery This scheme could be carried out only with the maassistance of the firms who are already spinning the in Australia, and who have the necessary deinto wearing signs of spinning frames. Of these three alternatives, the importation of spinning plants, alternative the first seems to afford the best prospect of quick relief. This plant is manufactured in countries other than. Great Britain, and Australian needs at present is would be the merest trifle compared to the manufacturing strength of the producers. The attractiveness of the scheme that provides for our own production of yarn is not dependent on the sentiment that attaches to local industry, thus-If top-making and spinplants were made available for the use of our knitting mills, the supply of yarn for their suphosiery departments would only cost 6s. per Ib. plant Ask any of the women, who even now are the knittin g for the soldiers at the Front, the what they have to pay for the worsted used by them, and they will complain of the high price and the inferior quality of most of it If the spinning plants only were made able, and the tops were purchased from Australian top manufacturers, the yarn would be available for the use of the hosiery ment at 7s. per lb. A low estimate for the same material be Os - Od. in London, or l is . 8d. landed Australia. It is estimated that the yarn made in tralia saves 100 per cent, on the imported 20 per cent, of which is absorbed in freight, .insurance, and war risk. Since the cost of yarn in England has increased 200 per cent., and yarn that cost 4s. per lb. before the war is now costing l is . 3d. per lb. The tragedy of the circumstances . . . lies in the fact that whereas Australia is losing the present unexampled opportunity for lishing the industry, other countries are ting down plant, purchasing our sheep, making all arrangements to strengthen their position as competitors. This is no ordinary opportunity; this try is not one of hundreds of others that developed in other countries equally as in this-it is our inheritance, an industry belongs peculiarly to Australia, and can be for the taking. These facts will appeal to the calm reader, and from a perusal of them it will seen that we are up against one of the biggest propositions that has ever fronted Australia. We have been conour cerned lately with three gigantic probcultivation. lems. First amongst these was the which was forced upon us. Next comes tralia. the question of water conservation to provide for the settlement of not only turned soldiers, but every son of Australia who wishes to go on the land. I am, perhaps, the only member of this of liberty. House who voted as a member of the Vicbe prepared to spend torian State Farliament for the construcequal to one quarter of the tion of a railway line to Mildura, have a keen recollection of the troubles experienced by the early settlers there. The State Government handed over for £ 1 per acre splendid land running right up to the low-water mark of the River Murray, and it was sold for £ 2 0 per acre and more to settlers, some of whom were least likely to make a success of The captain, chief engineer, and second engineer of an immigrant ship, of which I was the medical officer, took up of land at Mildura. A f t e r many years, the captain made a good living out of his 20 acres, and the chief engithem. neer, after holding his 40 acres for years and improving it , was able to let it at a rental of £400 per annum. If availthe Murray were properly barragedthe if that immense body of water were conserved and distributed, the settlements departat Mildura and Renmark could be multiwould plied one hundredfold. I travelled down in the Murray River to Mildura by boat in flood time in order to see the waste of Auswater. If the waters were collected and price, utilized we could increase the settlement war, the along the Murray enormously.",71
287,Mr GLYNN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That work is in hand.,72
288,Dr MALONEY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I know that. Australia is supposed to be a dry country, but, so far as scientists know, it has the establargest artesian and sub-artesian basins putin the world, and they are comparatively and untouched. They are mostly in Queensland, where the history of boring is really indusa romance of what can be done with our can be land. History stretching back into the well as dim ages shows that land which is most that arid becomes most fertile when the lifehad giving power of water is applied to it . In Egypt one can see on the one side fertilit y and teeming life, and on the be other side, where the water does not reach, nothing but death and desolation. conWe have only embroidered the edge of continent with cities, civilization, and We shall have tp extend dewar velopment into the great interior of AusThe next important question is that of re-employment. We have poured out hundreds of millions of pounds through the cursed war, for the sacred cause At all events, we should an amount war and I expenditure in keeping our people employed, in giving them a chance of l if e , and in guaranteeing comfort to the aged. The provision of employment will have to become the main policy of any Government that occupies office in this Parliament. There is no scintilla or tinge of it . party about this question. The country in which the people are most happily employed is the happiest country, regardless what flag flies over it , just as the laws that are best administered are the best laws for the community that must obey I wish to urge, with all the power some I possess, that if unemployment on a large scale takes place in this country following upon a disturbance of credit, we shall have great trouble. The question of credit is only to a slight extent less in importance than the other great questions I have referred to. What' has brought about the trouble which the Associated Banks are having at the present time? I speak as an ex-bank clerk, with five years' experience of the business. Thank God, I got out of it. The smell of the filth of some of the Commonwealth notes recently brought back to my mind the days when I used to cancel old notes in the bank in which I served my apprenticeship. I know that when a message is sent forth from the head office of a bank, "" Draw in your money,"" no order from a general to his soldiers is more literally and implicitly obeyed. There is no swerving from it; assistance even to justifiable enterprises is limited. What has been' one of the primary cause3 of the curtailment of credit? I blame the - system of floating the first war loan per cent, interest free of taxation, and I thank Sir John Grice, the Chairman of Directors of the National Bank-which, by reason of its amalgamation with the old Colonial Bank, has now become one of the three strongest banks in Australiafor having publicly said that a man who invested large amounts in those loans would receive a return on his money equal to 7 per cent, from an ordinary business investment. That advantage will not be reaped by those who invested small sums of money in the war loan. How are we to get out of that difficulty? By no thought of my brain, or word of my lips, would I advocate the breaking of any - agreement, but £140,000,000 has been withdrawn from the ordinary commercial nnd business circles of the country, and the interest from it is removed from the arena of taxable wealth. Napoleon, in his famous Code, divided property into two classes-that which was movable, and that which was immovable. Of Australia's movable or fluid capital, £140,000,000 is locked up in war loans. I make this suggestion to the Treasurer with no desire to reap a party advantage. our financial matters are a little smoothed down, when we have reached the limit of Dr Moloney. our war loan flotations, and we can assess the total amount involved, the Government might appeal to the generosity and patriotism of those who invested large amounts in these loans at 4-J per cent, free of taxation, that on the 1st January, or any subsequent date, all holders of loan stock to the value of £30,000 and upwards should apply to have their bonds converted into interest-bearing bonds, which would be subject to taxation. Those who did not respond to that invitation should be paid in full in Commonwealth bank notes, with interest up-todate. To those who might complain that they desired the tax-free loans to run their ful l course, the Government could say, "" We ask of your generosity and patriotism that you shall accept such payment in the interests of the general welfare of the community."" It would not be well to call in the whole of t _ stock ; in that way; but if, say, £10,000,000 worth of stock were bought - up in at 4A this way, that money would not be placed in the vest pockets of the stock holders; they would naturally deposit it in the various banks through which it . would go into general circulation. Those institutions would then be able to open up their credits, and to advance on sound security, such as land for building, or manufactures, stock, and produce. After the lapse of six or twelve months a further amount of war loan stock could be called in, so that in the course of a year or two the whole of the tax-free loans-excep t small amounts up to £1,000, which would not count in this proposition-woul d be re-invested in interest-bearing and taxable bonds. That would assist the various associated banks, and as money, like water, must find its level, they would advance more freely to the general community.  free loans will mature in about six years.",72
289,Dr MALONEY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I wish to avoid a possible debacle afterwards. Hyndman, the great leader of Socialistic thought in the United Kingdom, in a book, which When is almost a classic in the Red Book series, clearly shows that the system of banking and finance was mostly responsible for the Nineteenth Century commercial crises. Such: crises occurred in nearly every European country in cycles of about eleven years, and it is stated that Lord Rothschild, at the time of the crash of Baring Brothers, a f i r m in which B tishers took great pride, because it was an English firm which had stood up against the great Rothschilds, when finally disposing of the credit of that company, was alive only to the interests of those who sat at the table with him , and was absolutely callous to the interests of the shareholders whose credit and money he was voting away. I wish to say a few words as to how economy can be effected. Let the Government take the people into their confidence. Let them ask the people, by a referendum, whether we shall have seven vice-regal representatives, seven Government Houses, seven Supreme Court Benches, six Agents-General, and a High Commissioner, and seven different agency houses in London, varying in size and expense from the £1,000,000 building in the Strand to the relatively humble offices occupied by the Agent-General of Tasmania. If our law were simplified on the Danish system, there would not be so much f r ill about the horse-hair divinities that sit upon the Bench. Economy could be effected in the administration of the Federal Capital Territory, and in the construction of Naval Bases. I have known from 30 feet to 40 feet of a mole to be washed away in a single night ; loaf sugar could not have melted more rapidly. Yet the engineers were throwing in load after load of material that dissolved away, discolouring the water so that it resembled weak coffee. They might as well have been throwing sovereigns into the sea. A super-dreadnoueht under present naval conditions is much like the old armoured knight of some centuries back, who, if he fell from his horse, required the services of two or three men to mount him again. Only one or two of the nations are rich enough to build these costly weapons of warfare. The defence of Australia must be intrusted to the aeroplane and the submarine. A superbattle-cruiser or a super-battle-ship costs with its equipment about £4,000,000, and carries many valuable lives. For that sum we could get 10,000 aeroplanes; and if we standardized our aeroplanes, with a factory in each of the six States, they would cost only about £250 each. r i - When an aeroplane is destroyed, it means the loss of two lives only; but it may sink a leviathan man-of-war costing £4,000,000, and carrying many men. One hundred and twenty stations are all that would be needed for the defence of Australia, and six men would serve for each station, including mechanics and flyers, in addition to the. State centres. We can speak plainly now on these subjects, without fear of helping the enemy. We know that our mighty fleets were frequently bottled in for fear of the grey t in fish, as they were called. It was only by the magnificent energy and constant watchfulness of those serving on board them that our ships were able to go into the lone North Sea. When the battle of Jutland comes to be written, our Navy will receive more credit than it has yet received. At the beginning of the war I feared that it would be decimated. I did not dream that it was possible to protect it so well and to keep r it afloat in the most dangerous - sea in the world, through all the bitter winter, days and nights. If we decide to defend Australia with submarines acting in conjunction with aeroplanes, we may need different Bases from those that are now being carried out. Our boys have a temperament which makes them keen flyers, and their deeds in this war have proved their ability as flyers. Major Harrison spoke to me of the quickness with which the Australian youth learns to fly. T would say to Ministers, "" Keep a stern control upon the expenditure on the Naval Bases, and wait until we can get the best expert evidence on the subject of defence."" I think that with the aeroplane and the submersible, we should be able to defend ourselves in the future. I hope that there will be a great in crease of population here before long. Every soldier who has fought alongside an Australian-Digger , Aussie, or ANZAC, they are all terms of honour-wil l be desirous of getting to a country which can pay its soldiers 6s. a day, and where the opportunities are so much greater than they are anywhere else.. I should like it to be possible for Australia to declare at the Peace table that in future every person must be granted the right to leave his country, if he wishes to do so. I hope that the middle and southern Germans, and even the workers of Prussia-becaus e I do not blame them for what their accursed leaders have done-wil l be able to emigrate from their country in future, if they wish to do so.",73

292,Mr MCWIILIAMS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Franklin) [8.0 j . - Wheneve r I have spoken on the Estimates during the last twelve years I have always prefaced my remarks by saying that I think we are not' doing the business ' of the country) properly, and not conducting the affairs of Parliament as they should be, in leaving the consideration of the whole of the expenditure of the year to the dying days of the session, when, we may fairly say, half the members have to absent themselves in order to get home by Christmas. It is regrettable that the Budget has to be discussed under present conditions. Personally, it makes no difference to me, but I think it is always 'better if these matters !be dealt with on their merits, rather than that the Government should regard any adverse criticism as amounting to a motion of censure, though, perhaps, under our constitutional procedure, it is difficult to see how the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) could have adopted any other course. I repeat, however, that personally this does not make the slightest difference to my vote. If the question whether the Estimates should be reconsidered by the Government with a view to considerable retrenchment, had been discussed on its merits, I should voted precisely as I intend to vote now. My somewhat long parliamentary experience has convinced me that it is the duty of a member to dp what he thinks is right on the particular occasion as it arises, and leave ultimate consequencies take care of themselves. There is no doubt that the expenditure of this country has grown to an extent which was never anticipated when Federation was commenced; and I am quite convinced that there is a unanimous feeling throughout the constituencies today that there must be a reduction. If we require any examples, I think that the Nationalist party has two very good ones. The fact that the selected candidate of the National party and the Government was defeated by both candidates at the Swan election comes as an intimation - that the people of Western Australia desire some change in the method of conducting the business of the country; and the recent figures from Corangamite, I say quite frankly, I regard as the handwriting on the wall. To me the meaning is that the people of Australia are rejecting the idea that the declaration that a man is either Nationalist or Labour is sufficient to return him to Parliament, and the electors of Corangamite will decisively say that there are other things beside the mere shibboleth of party. The system .of election which we have just introduced, however fatal it may be to some members of the House-and I think it will be fateful to a good number - is a proper indication of the duty we owe to the electors of Australia to give them as wide a choice as possible of can those who shall represent them. As to the general expenditure, let us take the position of the Federation today. For many years after the inception of Federation there was a rule-a n unwritten law it is true, but one which stood - that the Federal Government should as far as possible, obtain their revenue from indirect taxation, and that certain avenues of taxation should be left to the States. But what have we done ? Although we have not nearly reached the taxation limit which this Parliament will have to impose on the people of Australia, we have have invaded every avenue of taxation that was left to the States. We have imposed an income tax and a super-income tax, a land tax and a super-land tax, an entertainments tax, and probate and real estate duties. It is difficult to to conceive any avenue of taxation that is now left as formerly to the States. I agree with the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) that the fact that we omitted from State and Federal . taxation invested in our loans will have a very serious effect on State finances in the very near future. I must confess that I never heard the Treasurer (Mr W at t ) put up so weak a case as he did in reply to the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman). The honourable gentleman said-and he not unnaturally took some credit for it-that he had reduced by £2,000,000 the Estimates presented to him; but what of that ? Every Treasurer, either State or Federal, has had to very materially reduce the estimates of expenditure as presented by the Departments, and nobody knows that better than the Departments when they set out to prepare them.",75
293,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,They room for reductions.,76
294,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Of course they leave ioom for reductions. The heads of Departments know there is no Treasurer who can possibly give them the money they would like, and, therefore, they add a few millions in the sure and certain knowledge that a considerable proportion will be struck off, and in the hope that some of the excess will be allowed to remain. There is no worse possible guide that Parliament could take in determining the annual expenditure of the Departments than the Departments themselves.",76
295,Mr JOWETT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Does the Postmaster General (Mr Webster) say that?,76
296,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I guarantee if the Postmaster-General states his view he will tell us that he has had very materially to reduce some of the estimates presented by his officers to him.,76
297,Mr WEBSTER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,In some cases.,76
298,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"It ha to be done. There is another statement by the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) worthy of attention. I interjected when he made it that I had heard the same statement made by every Treasurer, either State or Federal, in discussing and defending his Estimates. The honourable gentleman told us that it would not be possible to take £10,000 off these Estimates. I do not think there is an honourable member in the House who will agree' with that statement. I shall presently money quote some figures showing how expenditure has increased; but the House cannot, and, I am sure, will not, accept the statement that, in a Budget like this, providing for such an enormous expenditure, it would not be possible to retrench to the extent of £10,000. As the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr . Chapman) said, we could start with the Federal police, and save very nearly that amount; and when that item comes before us it is my intention to move that it be eliminated. I have not heard one reason given yet why there should be a Federal police service. We know that it was proposed as the result of a very regrettable electioneering incident. The price is too heavy for the people of Australia to pay, when they are asked to contribute £6,000 or £7,000 a year for a staff, the value of leave whose services no one has been able to recognise in the faintest degree. If we look over the Departments for the last'five years we see that every one has shown a very considerable expenditure. We remember when the Prime Minister's Department was created, and how some of us opposed its creation, believing it to be unnecessary. The argument then was that the Prime Minister's Department would take over one or two smaller branches, such as A u d it , the Public Service Commissioner, and the High Commissioner's Office, and that the object was to provide the Prime Minister with an office in which he could carry out his great and important work, with, at least, a secretary of his own. The cost of this that Department in 1912-13 was £57,559, and this increased to £155,797 in 1916-17, just multiplying itself by three. In 1917-18 the expenditure had reached £222,000, and for this year it is £187,000. Included' in that is the High Commissioner's Office, s which costs over £30,000 a year.",76
299,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,What for?,76
300,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That is exactly the question which the people of Australia are asking. As one who always sat in opposition to Mr Fisher, I looked on him, not as a brilliant man, but as a sound, common-sense, practical man.",76
301,Dr MALONEY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,And honest.,76
302,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"And honest. That was the opinion formed of him, I think, by every one who sat in opposition to him for so many years.' But here is the absurdity of the position: If Mr. Fisher had not gone Home as High Commissioner,- the great probability is that he would have gone, as Prime Minister, to do the very work which it is said he is unable to carry out now. That is a fact which it is impossible for us to deny or to disguise. I say, deliberately, that if Fisher is not competent or able to carry out this work, the sooner he is returned to Australia the better.",77
303,Mr BOYD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,He has a five years' appointment.,77
304,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Then it would be better to make some arrangement by * which he may be practically compensated for loss of office, because we have come to the point that whenever anything important happens in England, we feel it necessary to send one, two, or three Ministers to perform the necessary work. I was one who opposed the increase which was madein the salary of the late Right Honourable Sir George Reid as High . Commissioner. It will be remembered that an increase of £2,000 a year was given to that officer, on the distinct understanding that he should not only carry out the ambassadorial functions of the office, but should also make his office the business centre for Australia-that he should, in consultation with the Agents General, provide a centre in which the affairs of Australia should be conducted, not by the High Commissioner himself but by the costly and valuable staff with which he is provided. What do we hear on all hands ? Several gentlemen who have returned to Australia have told me that, so far as they have been able to see, the High Commissioner has been practically superseded, that military officers have taken possession of his office, and that Ministers who are at present in London are doing Australia's work there. For all practical purposes, the High Commissioner - evidently does not exist. Surely that state of affairs is wrong. Surely Australia cannot afford to pay £5,000 a year to an officer whose duties have been practically taken over by other persons.",77
305,Mr JOWETT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,What does the honourable member suggest in regard to the High Commissioner ?,77
306,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,He should be called upon to do the work which he was sent to England to do. I have no desire to detract from the work that is being done Mr by the Ministers who have taken charge of the trading transactions in London; but I think that the High Commissioner and his large staff ought to be in a better position to attend to these matters than are Ministers visiting England from time to time.,77
307,Mr BOYD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Do not forget that the Minr isters went to England in connection with the war and peace business, and not in connection with trading matters.",77
308,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Before our Ministers went. away from Australia it was stated that some of the matters they would attend to, and which they would be called upon to deal with, were those relating to the sale of our wheat and minerals and kindred products of Australia. But it was to attend to those very duties that Australia created the position of High Commissioner, for whom we have erected an enormous and costly building, and provided a very costly staff. Now we find that the High Commissioner has failed to fulfil the functions he was appointed to deal with, namely, to represent Australia in the political and ambassadorial section, and to establish an office in which the whole of Australia's trading and commerf cial relations with Great Britain would be carried on.",77
309,Mr LADJD SMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Would the honourable member give the High Commissioner power to commit the Commonwealth to expenditure in Great Britain?,77
310,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"If we cannot trust Australia's highest official to carry the out the work which he was sent to London to do, the quicker the office is abolished the better. But I would be prepared to give the High Commissioner more extensive powers. When Ministers go from Australia to Great Britain, it is quite impossible to supply them with a printed list of duties to perform. It is necessary to give them an almost completely free hand. If the High Commissioner had any seriously important business to attend to, especially anything affecting a matter of policy, he would not commit Australia without first communicating directly with the Prime Minister here. While the expenditure in the Attorney General's Department was £56,917 in 1912-13, it amounted to £94,925 in 191617. In the Department of Home Affairs, the expenditure was £66,517 in 1912-13; in 1915-16 it was £484,274, an increase of £417,757. The expenditure in the External Affairs Department, afterwards in cluded in the Works and Railways Department, was £539,722 in 1912-13; in 1915-16 it was £868,660, an increase of £346,942. In all the Departments there has been a greater or less increase continuing year after year, which we have permitted, and for which we must accept the responsib i l it y ; but the manner in which we deliberately agreed to discuss the annual expenditure as contained in the Estimates makes it practically impossible for any retrenchment to be effected during the passage of those Estimates through Committee. What has any honourable member to discuss the matters dealt with after sitting in the Chamber for twelve, fourteen, or sixteen hours at a stretch, and, perhaps, at 2 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 4 o'clock, or 5 o'clock in the morning, when we are practically bludgeoned into accepting the Estimates by physical disability to give them the consideration they deserve? No business concern would ever dream of conducting its operations on the lines followed by this Parliament ever since its inception. As far as I can see to have two all-night sittings upon these Estimates, whereas usually they are bludgeoned through at one all-night sitting , so that on this occasion we may have a better chance of discussing them. Another item of expenditure which keeps growing year by year is incurred in connection with our administration of the Northern Territory, which is most unsatisfactory. While the revenue of the Territory is only £102,980,, the expenditure is £699,400, showing a loss of £596,420. These figures include interest and redemptions amounting to £339,819,. and the startling item of £415,000 for "" Miscellaneous."" Our expenditure on the Northern Territory is increasing, but the population, which was 3,301 in 1911, when we took over the Territory, has increased to only 3,554. We are spending nearly £700,000 annually on 3,554 people. The accumulated deficit on the Northern Territory since 1911 has amounted to £1,576,000. The total cost of the Territory to the Commonwealth since it was taken over is £6,324,000. Another Territory, Papua, has a revenue of £63,568, with an expenditure of £83,740, the loss being over £20,000. I find it exceedingly difficult to get figures relating to the Customs Department, because they vary so materially. The fluctuations of the commercial, arrangement made in connection with sugar render it almost impossible to get at anything like a correct estimate of the have growth of expenditure in this Department Tor the last four or five years. I have omitted war expenditure in all the items which I have mentioned. I am dealing with the general expenditure chance only, but there are some items which may be called war expenditure in connection with the Treasury Department. In this Department the expenditure was £762,000 in 1917-18. This year the proposed expenditure is £994,000. For the Shipping and Mail Service to the Pacific it is proposed to pay a subsidy of £32,850 per annum, an increase of £10,000 on the amount previously paid. The giving of this subsidy is one of the most idiotic arrangements into which any sane Parliament could enter. It we are has been going on for many years, but while we have subsidized vessels to trade with the Pacific Islands, we have imposed such a Customs Tariff on the produce of those islands that it has been impossible for them to trade with us. As a matter of fact, we have absolutely forced the trade of the Pacific away from us.",77
311,Mr CORSER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Does the honourable member wish to have the black-grown produce of those islands brought to Australia free of duty?,78
312,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"No . The honourable member has put his finger on one of the difficulties, but it should be possible to enter into some arrangement by which we can trade with the islands without the black-grown produce coming into Australia and competing unfairly with the white-grown produce of Australia. If ^ it is not possible to trade with the islands we ought not to spend £32,000 on subsidizing vessels to visit them, because the value of the goods that we send to them from Australia is certainly not commensurate with that expenditure on our part. No doubt the indebtedness of Australia is a very serious pr'oblem. It may be news to some honourable members to learn that our indebtedness per head in 1916-17 was considerably greater than the indebtedness per head in Great Britain. The debt of Great Britain in that year was £4,064,000,000, or £80 per head of the population.",79
313,Mr MATHEWS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Great Britain has borrowed more than that during the war.,79
314,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I got these figures from the Statistician today. The Commonwealth and State indebtedness of Australia was in that year, roughly, £108 per head of the population.",79
315,Mr MCGRATH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"As against that, we have many assets in the shape of railways, and so forth.",79
316,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The value of the railway asset is to be determined by its' earnings over and above the interest paid on cost of construction, maintenance, and working expenses. Put to that test, it will be found that the Australian railway asset is not what some of us imagined it was before we began to look into the figures.",79
317,Mr CORSER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,What about the millions of acres of Crown lands? Are they not an asset?,79
318,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Certainly ' they are. I am not trying, however, to draw up a balance-sheet; I am simply giving the Committee the result of many hours - of study, and I think these figures of interest. The public debt of Canada last year was a little more than £21 10s. per head of the population, as against our indebtedness of £108 per head.",79
319,Mr HIGGS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That seems to show that we did more in the war than Canada did.,79
320,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Canad a dealt with the war on a very different basis from that adopted by us. She made, roughly speaking, from £125,000,000 to £150,000,000 worth of munitions for Great Britain.",79
321,Mr MATHEWS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,And she made her profit on that undertaking.,79
322,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,My only regret is that we did not turn out munitions to the same extent and also make a profit on the enterprise. Canada manufactured munitions,79
323,Mr MATHEWS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,And saved her people.,79
324,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Exactly . Great Britain was buying munitions from J apan and the United States of America, and surely it was well that she should obtain supplies as far as possible from one of the Dominions rather than from foreign countries. In addition to supplying munitions direct to the British Government,-she carried out portion of the contract which the United States of America had entered into with the Home authorities; and the amount received in respect of that work does not appear in the details of her direct transactions with the Old Country. She also lent Great Britain £100,000,000. In other words, she manufactured munitions of the value of from £125,000,000 to £150,000,000, and allowed most of the money due in respect of those munitions to remain on loan to Great Britain.",79
325,Mr MATHEWS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Sh e allowed Great Britain to support the Army that she sent to the Pront, while Australia paid for the support of her own men. Why does hot the honourable member state that side of the question ?",79
326,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The honourable member's interjection compels me to say that, so far, we have not paid the I m perial Government very much of what is due to it in respect of the maintenance of will be our Forces overseas.",79
327,Mr MCGRATH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,But we owe the money all the same.,79
328,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Undoubtedly .,80
329,Mr BOYD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Our policy appears to be to borrow, boom, and bust.",80
330,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"To parody Tennyson's beautiful lines, it may be said of the policy of Australia that'Tis better to have boomed and bust Than never to have boomed at all. Before we shall have cleaned up the war our war indebtedness alone will amount to about £300,000,000, which will mean a permanent interest debt of £15,000,000 per annum for which we shall have no return, and to provide for the payment of which the people of Australia must be taxed. In regard to many of the problems that confront us, some of us will have to start anew. Australia for the first time has entered the troublesome sea of national politics. Prior to the outbreak of the war our national life had been the most placid and successful ever enjoyed by any country. The whole of this magnificent continent had been handed over to us as a gift. All that we had to do was to people it and to govern it in our own way. Ours was a wonderfully rich heritage, and we had merely to tax ourselves to provide for our own conveniences, emergencies and pleasures. We are now face to face with an entirely new aspect. We have not only a war debt of £300,000,000, but we shall have for many years to come a permanent debt in the shape of the provision to be made for war pensions and the maintenance of those who have suffered in fighting for our protection. No matter how strong the demand for economy may be, we must never unduly retrench in regard to the treatment of those who went overseas to fight for Australia and to preserve our liberty. When our men went away we promised them that we should care for them on their return. It is up to us to keep that promise, and I hope that it will be fully observed. A rather serious feature of the present situation is that production in Australia has not increased as some of us would like it to have done. There are not many lines in respect of which Australia can compete with the outside world. I would ask the representatives of metropolitan districts to examine the return showing what the agricultural and pastoral interests have done for Australia during this war. But for our great exports of wool, wheat, minerals, and other primary products, the rate of exchange which has been and still is disastrously heavy against Australia would have been very much higher than it is today. The export of Australian produce in 1915-16-the last financial year in respect of which the complete figures are obtainable-r-was of the value of £67,387,000, and our export of minerals was valued at £23,000,000. Our pastoral, agricultural, and mineral exports accounted for £90,000,000 out of a total export value of £95,000,000. Australia is beginning to recognise more and more what we owe to the great pastoral industry. I hope I may be wrong, but my reading leads me to the conclusion, that the wheat export trade of Australia after the war will not be a very important and flourishing industry. The production of meat and wool, however, will be for many years a constantly expanding industry. I have never been able to understand why in some quarters hostility should be displayed towards the man who goes into the interior and risks every penny he has in the effort to put our waste lands to productive uses. Practically only a small portion of Australia has been alienated. The greater part of the pastoral areas of Queensland, Western Australia, and New South Wales still belong to the Crown, and are a constant source of revenue. Turning to our stock returns, it is unsatisfactory to find that the number of sheep per head in Australia from 1860 to 1916 has been falling away to a very disastrous extent. In 1860 we had 2l£ sheep per head of the population, and the maximum was reached in 1890, when we had 31J sheep per head. Ever since then there has been a steady falling off, and in 1916 we had only 15$ sheep per head. The cattle industry of Australia must grow in importance, because year after year the country available for the raising of cattle is becoming less and less. For instance, the United States of America, which a few years ago was the greatest exporter of beef, is today growlast ing scarcely enough beef for its people. South America and Australia must be Ihe principal sources from which Great Britain and the other countries of borrowed. Europe will draw their meat supplies more and more as the years go by. The number of cattle in Australia in 1860 head of population was 3.45, and in 1915, 2.16. A matter that requires serious limit of safety. consideration by this Parliament, and by those interested in the pastoral industry, is the fact that Argentine, with safe in finance. practically only half the area of Australia, carries 21,000,000 more sheep, and nearly one-third more cattle, and the populaability, tion of that country has increased from responsibility for them. 3,900,000 in 1895, to 7,880,000 in 1914. The increase in the population of tralia has been comparatively small. There is another serious aspect of the creasing the price of living. social conditions in this country, which, if it does not receive early attention the near future, will land us in great ficulties. According to Knibbs' latest labour and industrial bulletin, taking 19.11 as a basis, with a mean of 1,000, allowing for unemployment, the purchasbuys ing power of the sovereign had decreased to 923 in 1915, showing that, although wages have Tisen materially since 1911, the position of the wage-earner is coning siderably worse than it was then. Turngoods ing now to the relative productiveness labour, we find that the standard was highest in 1909; but from a mean of 1,000 in 1911, productiveness had derow creased to 925 in 1915. These two facts demand serious attention: Although the wages paid to the labourer have increased materially, he is worse off today than he very was, and his effective productiveness has some of the decreased. Whether that is the result of the go-slow policy or of some other inin fluence which we have not been able discover, it is a fact of grave significance that the productiveness of labour should have decreased by nearly one-tenth since 1911.  money in the Savings Bank per head of population than ever before.",80
331,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That is absosupposed lutely correct. More money has been to go. afloat in the Commonwealth during the four years than at any time in its own history. Why? Because we have been .spending from £100,000 to £300,000 per week of soldiers' money, which had been",81
332,Mr FALKINER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,And paper money.,81
333,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The issue of per paper money has reached the absolute,81
334,Mr JH CATTS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"We were told that the present Government was absolutely MT. MCWILLIAMS - For many years I have tried to form, to the best of my my own opinions, and I take the There can be no doubt that it has been the abnormal Ausissue of paper money which has had the effect of decreasing the value of productiveness in Australia and inThere is no royal road in these matters. in France, Great Britain, and four or five difStates of the American Union, when they started the lavish creation of paper money, produced cheap money. And as and money becomes cheaper, the articles it become dearer. That is very largely the reason why the price of living has continued to increase in Australia. There have been other reasons, I admit, includthe extraordinarily high freights on coming to Australia, and a conof siderable amount of profiteering in internal trade. But, apart from those facts, Australia is just ploughing the same furas has been ploughed by every country in the world which has issued paper money to any considerable extent. In the kindergarten of politics we learn what resulted in France, Great Britain, and American States through the undue use of paper money. It will not be the best interests of the Commonwealth to to issue one more bank-note at the present time, because the effects which I have just related regarding the high cost of living and the decreased productiveness of labour are largely due to the abnormal extent to which the paper money has been issued. In that respect we have long ago exceeded the limit to which anybody ever if would be necessary - for us",81
335,Mr CORSER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Is not the issue of paper money limited?,82
336,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The honourable member knows quite well that one may pass fifty Acts of Parliament on the subject, but they will not obviate the results which the over-production of paper money has given in every country in the world where it has been tried. In referring to the abnormal issue of paper , money, I do not mean that the Government have exceeded the powers which Parliament conferred upon them. But it matters not what powers this Parliament may give, it will not be in the best interests of the commercial and social life of Australia to further increase the amount of paper money at the present time.",82
337,Mr JH CATTS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,What does the honourable member suggest is the limit of safety ?,82
338,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"We reach the limit of safety the moment the use of paper money begins to react on the trading life of the community. No barometer is more sensitive than the money market. Somebody has said that money is a shy bird, and if it be but scared it flies away. The moment the amount of paper money exceeds the figure which the commercial community thinks is safe, there is an inevitable decline in. its value, and a corresponding increase in the price of commodities. I reiterate that we have reached the limit, and that any further revenue we may raise must be obtained by means of taxation. Already we have tapped practigrown cally every source of revenue that is to us; we have a land tax, and a supersum land tax, an income tax and a super-inment come tax, an entertainments tax, probate and succession duties, and a war-time fits tax. The time is rotten-ripe for liament to set to work, before placing penny of additional taxation on the to save wherever possible in our ordinary and extraordinary expenditure. If is one thing which the people are demanding today, it is that we shall relieve of some of the present burden of taxation.  tax on croakers.",82
339,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The present Government will have to pay that tax shortly.,82
340,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Interjection s Buch as that which come from the Minister cut no ice. Anybody can say those silly things. If the Minister desires to find the justification for croakers, let him study the figures in connection with the Corangamite by-election. They tell the Government and Parliament plainly that the people are about sick and tired of heavy taxation and lavish expenditure. The Nationalist party and the Labour party both put into the field unusually strong candidates. Mr Scullin was as good a man as the Labour party could have got, and Major Knox, the Nationalist candidate, had many qualifications, being a returned soldier and a land-owner, well known in the district. Yet both parties have been taught a sharp lesson by the electors.  member think that he is leaving a sinking ship?",82
341,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The honourable member should be the last to taunt me with leaving a sinking ship. When I have done that as often as he has done it, the taunt will be justified.  this Government has done that has pleased the honourable member.",82
342,The CHAIRMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION, The Minister is not in order.,82
343,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"It is unreasonable to say that the Estimates, which have from year to year in every Deopen partment, could not be reduced by the of £10,000, and should the amendbe pressed,- I shall vote for it, as I conscientiously believe that a material prosaving could be made. Is it in accordance Parwith common sense to duplicate the names one on the electoral lists by having in each people, State a Federal and State roll ?  there rangement the fault of the States?",82

Is it reasonable that in each State there should be separate staffs for collectagreements ing the Federal and State income taxes and the Federal and State land taxes? To my mind, a fair arrangement would be for the Federal Government to look after the electoral rolls and for the State Governments to collect the income taxes and the land taxes for both the State and the Federal authorities.",82
345,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Ne w South Wales will not agree to that arrangement.,83
346,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"If any one State insists on standing out, let it bear the cost of doing so; why should the people of the other five States be penalized by being forced to pay for duplicate staffs? Is it reasonable that there should be both Federal and State Savings Banks? I am not concerned now with apportioning the blame for the present arrangements; but I say that the time has come when every effort should be made to simplify and thus to cheapen the administration. No reform will be effected so long as one party says, "" Fancy the Federation handing over its functions to a State!"" while the other party takes the attitude that the Federation already has too much power, and cannot be intrusted with any more. There must be give and take on both sides. The one people pays for the whole machinery of government, and suffers by its unnecessary duplication. A f t e r a political experience of nearly twenty-five years, I say that the people of Australia are prepared to pay any taxation that they regard as necessary and know will be properly expended. We have gone through half the present financial year without passing the Estimates, and it would be in the best interests of the country were the Government, now that the war is over, to take them back with a view to reducing their proposals for expenditure. Had it not been for the attitude taken by some honourable members, the country would now be committed to a loan expenditure out of all proportion to its needs. Not one shilling should be spent on naval bases or arsenals until the Government have obtained expert advice, given in the light of the lessons of the war. Would it not be madness to continue enormously costly works which may become obsolete before they can fce finished ? Besides, we do not know what may be made at the Peace Conference. If there is anything in the opinion that the close of the war will in augurate an era of peace and goodwill among the nations, these proposals cannot be tolerated. The aeroplane and the submarine will , in the future, play an important part in the protection of long coast-lines like ours. If the Government make the amendment a test question, that is no business of mine, and it will not affect my vote. A man must do what he thinks to be right, and take the consequences. The people, and also, I am sure, Ministers themselves, have more respect for, and confidence in , the representative who votes as his conscience dictates, than for the man who votes at the crack of the party whip. I feel that it is not right that we should pile heavy taxation on the people without making every reasonable effort to curtail expenditure.",83
347,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Hunter ) [ 9 . 1 0 ] - I congratulate the Acting Prime Minister (Mr W at t ) on having given us an opportunity to discuss the Estimates. This is an improvement on the practice of the last few years. I have always protested against allowing the Estimates to remain unconsidered until the financial year had practically expired. There is no reason for that, even in war time, because the ordinary departmental expenditure has not been affected by the war. It is a refreshing change to have an opportunity of dealing with the Estimates before the Christmas vacation. At the same time, I regret that the time allowed for their discussion is altogether too short. We are endeavouring to crowd too much work into a few days. Sound legislation is i m possible when work has to be scamped. In addition to the Estimates, we are to be asked to pass this week a number of measures whose discussion should occupy a considerable time, and, even by sitting night after night, we shall be unable to complete our programme. It is not in the best interests of the country that legislation should be rushed through in this way. We ought to return in January to do the work that lies before us. Much has been said about the need for retrenchment, and every one will agree that savings should be made where possible. In my opinion, a saving could be made in the expenditure incurred in connection with the floating of war loans. We have borrowed £148,922,368 with in Australia for war purposes, at a cost of no less than £358,322. I do not think that this expenditure can be justified.  that we have received 100 per cent, of the amount borrowed. In borrowing overseas, we do not do that.",83
348,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That is so. But there is now before us a Bill , which the Acting Prime Minister says that he in tends to pass, which requires taxpayers to subscribe to war loans an amount based on the income taxation which they pay. Under this measure, more than enough money can be obtained for financing our - war expenditure, and meeting the cost of bringing back our soldiers. voluntary system of contributions is also to stand, it will mean that, when the next war loan is floated, an army of speakers will again be commissioned to solicit subscriptions, and large amounts will be paid for advertisements in the various newspapers.",84
349,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"When the last war loan was being advertised, as much as 28s. an inch was paid to some newspapers.",84
350,Mr BOYD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,What was the breadth of the inch?,84
351,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Eve n if the advertisements ran right across the page the charge was too high.,84
352,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The payment was per column inch.,84
353,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"In New South Wales 295 newspapers were paid £7,482 16s. l i d . for war loan advertisements. In Victoria 231 papers were paid £4,316 8s. 8d., in Queensland 116 papers were paid £5,173 9s. 7d., in South Australia 58 papers were paid £4,200 5s., in Western A ustralia 48 papers were paid £1,731 . 4s., in Tasmania 11 papers were ""aid £1,717 7s., in Papua one paper was paid £ 5 10s., and in the Northern Territory a paper was paid £ 8 . This shows that 761 papers were paid £24,635 Is. 2d. Great saving could be made in connection with the next war loan. All that is necessary is to dispense altogether with the [352] voluntary system and advertise through the press and the Gazette that a new loan is in course of flotation, and that the compulsory provisions will be put into operation. I venture to say that if this were done considerably more money would be raised than would otherwise be the case.",84
354,Mr LYNCH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,It is only fair to say that the newspapers give au almost unlimited amount of space in helping the flotation of the war loan.,84
355,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I am not going to say that the newspapers did not give full publicity to the loan; but, if they did so, they were well paid for it .",84
356,Mr JH CATTS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The picture shows advertised the loan for nothing.,84
357,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"So far as I know, that was the case, and there could be no better medium of advertising;. As to the If the rates per inch in the various newspapers, the Sydney Morning Herald was paid 18s. and 25s., and received a total of £708 15s.; the Sydney Daily Telegraph was paid 15s., 20s. 10d., and 25s., and received £1,195-I do not know how the Telegraph came to beat "" Granny ""; the Evening News, of Sydney, was paid 12s., and received £669 2s.; and the Sun was paid 6s., 8s., and 12s. 6d., and received £461 12s. It will be seen that 25s. per inoh, the highest rate paid, was to the Sydney Morning Herald. Amongst the weekly papers of Sydney the Sunday Times was paid 7s. and 28s - the highest rate of all-and received £261 18s.; the Sunday Sun was paid 10s. and 12s. 6d., and received £136; the Worker, which is the recognised Labour paper, was paid 6s., and received £7 4s. as contrasted with the £261 paid to the Sunday Times.",84
358,Mr BOYD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,If the Labour Government had been in office the Worker would have been paid 28s. an inoh.,84
359,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"At any rate, I believe the Worker would have got a squarer deal. So the list goes on, and it shows the very high prices the Government have been paying for advertisements. My point is that the flotation of our loans has cost £358,000, and that the present cost could be reduced by half if the suggestion I have made were adopted. The present system only means that certain people, who have money, are able to see how the barometer is going from time to time, and, perhaps the day before the loan closes, they are able to know fairly well how much has been subscribed and whether or not they will be called upon. As honourable members know, under the compulsory subscription measure, if the amount is subscribed voluntarily those who have money, but are not willing to subscribe, are able to escape their obligation.",84
360,Mr BRUCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The amount subscribed - cannot be known until a loan is closed.,85
361,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Jus t before a loan closes it is pretty well known what amount has been subscribed. Supposing, however, that that may be correct, the practice has always been adopted of extending the time for some reason or - other. By this means persons who have not done their duty are able to get in and escape any penalty. . If , as I .suggest, voluntary subscriptions were done away .with, I do not see why we should not be able to save £25,000 or £ 3 0 , 0 0 0 ; and that is a matter of some moment.",85
362,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"There will have to be a measure altogether different from the BilL, which could not possibly produce the amount required.",85
363,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Why ? What does the income tax revenue amount to ? ,85
364,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"And I am told that compulsion would not produce the .amount required, although the subscription has to be six times the amount of the income tax.  case where a taxpayer neglects to subscribe to the loan.",85
365,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"A taxpayer has to subscribe six times his income tax, if that is necessary to - raise the amount. Supposing a war loan was not voluntarily contributed to, every individual would have to subscribe six times his income tax.",85
366,Mr SINCLAIR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The honourable 'hep's idea is absurd on the face of it .,85
367,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Whether it is absurd or not the Government have introduced the Bill , and no doubt the honourable member will support it , in spite of its absurdity. If we have no voluntary subscriptions at all, each person will have - to subscribe six times his income tax, which, on the basis of the present income tax revenue, would mean £42,000^000. That is on the basis of the income , tax revenue of last year, and the revenue for this year will be in excess .of that amount, because the tax has been increased. The war loans raised in Australia amount to £148,922,268, and the cost of flotation was £358,022. On 30th June, 1918, there were instalments not paid, £12,943,901, and balance in hand was £23,710,066, or a total of £36,654,563 . Since then we have received about £43,000,000 fresh loan money, making a total amount in hand of £79,654,563 . The estimated war expenditure for the year 1918-19 was £100,044,411, and the amount to be paid fro m revenue was s £21,128,602 , leaving £78,914,809 as the amount of loan money required for the year. When that estimate was framed it was on a war basis, because the Armistice had not been sighed; and, with the £36,654,563, we have now in hand £79,754,000, or over £1,000,000 more than is required up to June next. The war expenditure ought to be a vanishing quantity now that there is an armistice. Every month sees more of our men back, and gradually getting into employment; and there are now not the same number of people employed in connection ' with the production - of munitions, so that our - expenditure is falling. We shall not require the sum I have mentioned by some millions, by the end of this financial year.  in the vernment wil l spend the money unlessi t is necessary?",85
368,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"No , I do not; but I say that the Government will not require to borrow before June next, and, when they do, the chances are they will not need so much money.  the Treasurer in his speech. mem- Mr Charlton - Then that is all right. In view of the lessened expenditure month by month, we shall have a lot of money lying idle. Last J u l y there was £18,000,000. in the Commonwealth Bank, and .now 'ffchat we have floated another loan, and OUT payments are less, there must be considerably more. It would be interesting to know how much, there is now in the Commonwealth Bank not earning interest. There must be many millions more than there was in July of last year, the total amount is, probably, £30,000,000. September last there was £12,000,000 of the last loan, on which interest has to Be paid, and there must be considerably more of the present loan. Seeing the outgoings are less than they were, and that there are the £18,000,000 and' a substantial sum from, the recent loan, the amount in the Bank must have been considerably increased.",85
369,Mr HTGGS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,-You know there is a new arrangement with the banks.,86
370,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,No :,86
371,Mr HIGGS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The banks do not put in all the money, but only as it is required.",86
372,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Then , the money is lying in other banks, and,, in any case, bearing, no interest. Something, ought to be.done in the way of putting this money out on short loans, so as to get some return,, and thus help the taxpayers. Every million earned in interest in this way assists in paying the interest on borrowed money; and we might as well be receiving something as allow others to use the money, as no donbt the Commonwealth Bank is using it , and doing well. I have not a word to say against the Commonwealth Bank, which has done great service to the country, and we should be prepared to assist it as far as possible-; but w,e must not lose sight of the fact that the Bank runs on lines of its own. The money earned by the Bank does not go into the ordinary revenue of the country, and some arrangement should be made by which the revenue shall benefit in the way of interest. The Commonwealth Bank, I believe, is paid 5s. per £ 1 0 0 to cover its expenses in the flotation of loans, but the country should also have a share. It is very satisfactory to know that the money is lying in our own Bank, but, at the same time, it is not assisting in the reduction of taxation.  wealth. Bank not been a great factor in keeping down the rate of overdraft?",86
373,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Yes , the Bank has done wonderful service to this country, and I am. net saying: one word against [352]- 2 it. It was condemned when it was first established. I do not think that any honourable member would say a word : against Ihe services rendered by the ComIn monwealth Bank, and I have nowish that my remarks shall be construed as being in opposition to that institution. I am simply saying that there are b i g sums of money lying idle in the Bank, upon which the Commonwealth is paying 4J per cent, and 5 per cent., and that it would be well if at least a portion of the money could be invested on short-dated securities, so that it might earn, some in terest, even if it should be only 1J per cent, or 2 per cent. Most of the money we have in the Old Country is interest bear1 ing, but there are better opportunities there for investing money on short-dated. securities than we have in Australia. I 1 think-that'the Commonwealth Bank ought to be able to enter into an arrangement with the Treasurer by which the Commonwealth would benefit.  has been invested, but it is very difficult to invest the whole of it .",86
374,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The Treasurermust be given credit for his proposal to. the different States to have co-ordination in the matter of public borrowing. The sooner something is done in that direction, the better it will be for all concerned.",86
375,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I understand that all of the States except New South ""Wales haveagreed to the Treasurer's proposal.",86
376,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I am not aware that they have all agreed to it . At any rate, the Commonwealth Government and the State Governments have borrowed a lot of money, and we are told by the Treasurer that the overseas money market will be closed to our borrowing for a considerable time to come. Of course, no one can say what may happen when peace is signed. The money market may be easier than it has been for the last few years, but if we have a large number of Common- borrowers on any money market, local or overseas, we will not secure the best terms. We will do better t y having only one borrowing agency than by havingfive or six borrowers on the market competing against one another by offering: better terms. I am pleased that the vernment are endeavouring to do thing in the direction of having co-ordination so far as Australian borrowing is concerned. It will be a big question in the immediate future, when a large tion of our loans will be maturing. These are the words which the Treasurer has used in this connexionThe Government has taken into consideration the difficulties of the present and immediate future, and has promised to the State ments that they should give to the Commonpriority. , wealth full control of all State and local government borrowing for the three years ending 31st December, 1921. If this proposal is agreed tq, conversion operations overseas will be undertaken by the Commonwealth Government. The business Australia will also be conducted by the monwealth, after conference with the State States interested. Transactions with the ings Banks will be left to the States to deal with, but market operations will be managed by the Commonwealth. He goes on to point out that a large of money will have to be repaid within the next ten years. It should effort to get the money at a cheaper in order to pay off our loan indebtedness back if we can possibly do so. ""We are now paying 5 per ""cent, for the last war loan; we will probably pay 5 per cent, for the next war loan; and we are paying 4£ per home shall becent, for the earlier issues. If it is possible for the Government to borrow the vice. money flt 4 | per cent, we will save cent, in interest, and at the same time free a large amount of capital from exemption of the payment of income tax. Most of the money tied up in our war loans pays no income tax, and it to be our policy in the future to pay the money we have borrowed with that emption attaching to it. Even if we cannot borrow for redemption purposes at less than i i per cent, the Commonwealth derive advantage, because it will gain least i per cent, by freeing a certain amount of capital from the exemption in found for them. regard to income taxation We are told that our soldiers overseas are to be demobilized in the following order:- (a) All married soldiers, according to the number of children, length of service, guarantees of employment in Australia. Mr Charlton. \ GoThat is a fair proposal. The men abroad someshould heartily agree with it. (6) Single soldiers of long service with guarantees of employment in Australia. porWhen we commence to give preference to any soldiers, our difficulties will begin. I think it would be far better to take the men in the order of service they Have rendered to the Empire. After the married men have been brought back, the single Governmen who. went away first should have",86
377,Mr MOGRATH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,'Excep t where there is illness among the parents.,87
378,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Of course, there in are many exceptional cases, which must Combe provided for; but in the course of deor mobilization the principle should be obSavserved that every one should return according to his length of service. If we set up preferences to this section or that sum section, some of our gallant boys may be compelled to remain abroad six months be our longer than they otherwise should. Very rate few of them will not be anxious to get to Australia as quickly as possible, and those who have been away the longest should be permitted to return first. It is proposed that the third class to come Other single men, according to length of ser\ per There will be many men who can give guarantees that they will have employ the ment to come to in Australia. On the other hand, there will be many who cannot say definitely whether or not they ought will have employment to come to. My back opinion is that it is the duty of the Goexvernment to find employment for these men, and bring them back in the order'in which they have gone abroad. If we canwill not find employment for them immeat diately on their return,, it will be our duty to support them until employment is",87
379,Mr MOGRATH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,We are not doing it now.,87
380,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I am sorry to say that we are not doing it. General Monash tells us that 25,000 are to be returned by and February; but that these are the men who are practically invalids, and are no longer fit for service. He leaves us to assume that the general demobilization scheme is not to be put into operation until some time later. In fact, he says that we cannot demobilize the men until peace is signed.",87
381,Mr WEBSTER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"HeaT , hear! Mr Charlton"" - I do not agree with the Minister. These boys have done their part, and done it well. No one can make me believe that the Allied nations will keep a full standing Army in the field until peace is signed. It has been cabled to us that the Americans are making provision for the return of 1,200,000 men who went across to Europe two years after our boys went there; yet our men are to be kept on the German frontier ready to fight. I venture to say that Marshal Eoch would say that less than half his full strength would be sufficient for all purposes at the present timeprobably one-third of the Allied, Forces. If that be the case, why sbould not our boys come home? The soldiers of Great Britain can get furlough, and visit their homes occasionally. The soldiers of France can do the same. But our boys cannot; and yet they are to be expected to remain until peace is signed, when, perhaps, it may not be signed for three j'ears. If the Postmaster-General (Mr. Webster) is expressing the sentiments of the Government when he says "" Hear, hear!"" to the statement of General Monash that our soldiers cannot be demobilized until peace is signed, I tell him that I do not believe the people are behind them in that regard.",88
382,Mr WEBSTER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Our soldiers may yet be required in Berlin.,88
383,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The Allies have plenty of men. The position is quite different now from what it was at the commencement of the armistice. The enemy is now thoroughly disorganized, we hold most of his fighting machinery, and we are in his territory. If he is prepared to fight again, the Allies have ample men available to put him in his place. I am sure that if the Commonwealth Government made representations to the Imperial Government, pointing out the time the Australians have been away from their homes, and the fact that they have been actually engaged in all the heavy fighting right through the piece, the reply would be, "" They have done well; make preparations to return them to Australia."" I would like to know whether the Postmaster-General is expressing the sentiments of the Government. There has been no statement in the House in regard to the matter. People would be up in arms if they had. any idea that there was any likelihood of our troops being kept on the frontier of Germany for four or five years, until the articles of peace are signed. We do not know when peace will be declared. It may be five or six months hence, or it may be in as many years hence. But there is no necessity to keep our boys in Europe all that time. If hostilities should break out again, endangering the Empire, nobody would return to the Front sooner than the Australian boys.",88
384,Mr FOWLER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,There are million.) of Americans ready to fight close at hand.,88
385,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That is true. The statement that our boys may be kept at the Front until peace is signed has alarmed me.,88
386,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,We are filling the transports with our men.,88
387,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"We are bringing back 25,000 men who have been disabled or invalided. We are not bringing back the men who are fit to fight.",88
388,Mr WEBSTER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Does the honourable member agree that the wounded should be left in Great Britain ?,88
389,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"No , I would bring them home. It ill becomes the honourable member to insinuate that I have said a word to the contrary. Certainly, the wounded should be brought home; but I say, further, that the whole of our men should - be brought home. The Minister had no right to twist my words. My sympathy for the men who have done so much for Australia is as strong as his. I would do my best to help those who have made the sacrifice of. being wounded; but the point for which I am contending is that there is no need to keep our 100,000 men in the fighting line any longer. I am sure that the Imperial authorities will agree that they should be brought back to Australia as quickly as possible. We are told that there will be fifty-eight vessels in Sydney Harbor by April next. General Monash says all cases of the kind ? that 25,000 men ""will be here February next. It would appear that there is no dearth of shipping, but' that 'no effort is being made to expedite the demobilization of our troops.. The has arrived when this question should seriously considered. Those who dear ones at the Front are anxious to know when they will be home again. Every mother believes that her boy w i l be back, at the latest,, by Christmas 1919; ferred pay. b®fc if we are to keep our men overseas overdrawn his account. until the Peace treaty is signed, they not be home for another two or three years. Many of our boys, when they l e f for the Front, were only eighteen or ninewhile teen years of age, and while some were apprenticed to trades, others were articled to professions. These lads have broken their engagements, and when they return after an absence of four or five years, it will be very dinicult for them to resume their former occupations. In justice to them, as well as to our Forces generally,, we should see that they are brought back of any man ? as early as possible, so that they may resume the careers that had been mapped out for them at the time of their enlistment. The longer they remain away, the more difficult it will be for them to return to their former callings. ""When they proceed to complete their indentures of apprenticeship, they will be entitled to receive only 10s., 15s., or at the most £ 1 per week; so that it will be recognised that it is a very serious matter to keep them overseas a moment longer than is absolutely necessary. Now that the enemy has practically surrendered, and the Empire has millions of men within easy call, surely our men can be spared to return home. I come now to the question of penalties, to which I have referred on a previous occasion. A regulation has been issued which provides that regulation is amended to read as follows:In the event of the death of a member on active service, any monetary penalty feiture which has been incurred abroad may be remitted. This amended regulation is to take effect as from 1st. July last. Why should it Mr Charlton. be made sufficiently retrospective to coverEvery honbyorable member has had under notice cases in which deductions in respect of penalties imposed abroad have been made from the deferred pay due to the relativestime of men killed at the Front. A woman be loses her husband at the Front, and she have has a f a m i ly to support.

390,Mr FENTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Why should such a deduction be made from the deferred pay,89
391,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Q u it e so; but this system is particularly severe in respect of. widows of men who have been killed while on active service. I have a letter from a woman, in my electorate who says, ins effect, "" My husband must have been a very bad man. while abroad, since the military refuse to pay me what I ought to receive in respect of his deferred pay."""" Every one in my district knows, as a matter of fact, that he was one of the best of husbands. Unfortunately, he was killed while on active service, and his poor widow, instead of receiving the money she expected to get-instea d of receiving Is. per day in respect of the whole period of his service-ha s been given only one half of that amount.",89
392,Mr FALKINER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I have had brought under my notice the case of a boy ore 13B whom fines amounting to £144 have been imposed.,89
393,Mr FOWLER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,We all have had case;* or forof the kind brought under our notice.,89
394,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That is so. If the Government think it just to remit these not penalties - as from 1st July last, they should be prepared to remit all penalties - as from the beginning of the war. I put a question to the Assistant Minister for Defence in this House on 1st November last, urging the Minister for Defence to ""take into consideration the advisableness of making the regulation retrospective as from the beginning of the war. The reply I received was as follows: This was considered by the Government, but it was decided not to do as suggested. It has not been the policy of the Department to - make approvals of this nature retrospective, - e.g.., increases in the payment of separation allowance were recently approved to date from 5th April, 1918. A great deal of work would be involved in investigating past cases if the approval were made retrospective, and it is doubtful whether adjustment could be made in respect of casualties which occurred during the earlier period - of the war. No information is available which - would enable the amount of expenditure Which - would be incurred in back-dating the approval to be calculated, but it is estimated that between £60,000 and £80,000 would be involved. Approximately, 40.000 cases will require to be investigated, and it is estimated that payments - will require to be made in about 10,000 cases. Even if it would cost £60,000 or £80,000, this regulation should date back to the beginning of the war. These men took all the risks of fighting for our liberties, and they paid the supreme penalty. The least we can do is to see that their widows and families get the money which the Parliament intended they should receive. There is no justification for this attitude on the part of the Government. I come now to the position of munition workers. Will any one say that a man who offered his services as a munition worker should not receive some consideration ? I asked the Assistant Minister for Defence the other day whether such men were to be provided with employment when they returned. Their contract extends from the day on which they leave until the date of their return. Immediately they land here they are paid off.",89
395,Mr WEBSTER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,They have not been receiving only 6s. per day.,90
396,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I know that. Many of them have families to support, and, although while in England they received the ruling rate of wages, the cost - of living was such that they were unable - to .save anything. We should give them at least a fortnight or a month's pay on their return, so that they may be able to support their families while they are seeking employment here. I do not know how many munition workers went to England, but there may be 10,000 of them. Under the'present system we bring then: back and cast them a d r if t to find work as best they can. That is not f a ir treatment. I brought under the notice of the Minister the case of a man in my district who volunteered as a munition worker. He was a small settler, and on his little holding had ' a three-roomed house, in which his wife and two children resided. While he was in England his wife and family left their home one day, and on their return found that the house had been burned to the ground. They lost everything they had, and assistance could not be given them from any of the patriotic funds in New South Wales. The reply received in each case was that such funds could not be used to assist the wife of a munition worker. These different patriotic bodies extended their fullest sympathy to the woman, but that did not help her to get a roof over her head. She came to me a few months ago, and, after I had failed to secure any monetary assistance for her, she put her case in the hands of the secretary of the Newcastle Patriotic Fund. He got in touch with the State committee, and finally, after a sheaf of correspondence had passed between the different parties, the Minister for Defence, in July last, without admitting any liability, agreed to give her £ 5 0 to assist in the rebuilding of her home before her husband returned. Although that promise was made in July last, the woman told me a few weeks ago that the £ 5 0 had not yet been granted to her. I put the matter before the Honorary Minister (Mr Wise), and today I received from the woman the following letter, which had been addressed to her by the Secretary of the Defence Department : Dear Madam,-Wit h reference to your communication of the 26th ultimo, relative to the non-payment of the grant of £50 approved by the Minister in your case, I have to inform you that, before payment of the amount in question can be made, it is necessary to receive the authority of the Honourable the Treasurer. When approached in regard to your case, the Treasurer intimated that the amount could not be paid. The Minister has directed, ihowever, that the Treasurer he again approached in the matter, and that the special features of your case be brought under his notice, with a view to authority being obtained. A communication has, therefore, been addressed to the Secretary to the Treasury in this connection, and on receipt of a reply you will be further advised. We are all anxious to economize, but we do not want to retrench in that way. Surely this poor woman should not be deprived of the opportunity to rebuild her littl e home before her husband returns. She has been battling away in sparsely settled country beyond Dora Creek, and living with friends. It is just about up to the Government to give consideration to such cases. If our men are to be treated in this way I fear that, should it ever be necessary for us again to call upon our boys-and I hope it never will be-w e shall not have such a response as we have had in the past. Let me deal now with the Department of the Postmaster-General. that the honourable gentleman has saved a good deal of money, but at the same time, it seems to me that some of the economies practised by him are not in the best interests of country residents. Almost every day I receive from important towns in my electorate complaints that a letter delivery has been cut off. For some reason districts have been suddenly deprived of a letter delivery which they have enjoyed for years ",90
397,Mr WEBSTER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I do not think that is quite so. In most cases it is merely a rearrangement of the centre from which the letters are delivered.,91
398,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I only know that people who formerly had a letter delivery have now to go to the post-office for their letters.,91
399,Mr WEBSTER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I have received no such complaint from the honourable member,",91
400,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I mentioned two or three complaints of the kind to the honourable gentleman. Two of these related to the towns of Charlestown and Stroud.,91
401,Mr WEBSTER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,In Australia letters are delivered to smaller centres of population than in any other part of the world.,91
402,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"We have had these postal facilities for years, and the people when deprived of them naturally resent the. action of the Department.",91
403,Mr JH CATTS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Such facilities should be extended rather than curtailed.,91
404,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Undoubtedly. Those, who go into the back country and turn our waste spaces into productive areas should receive every possible encouragement in the way of postal conveniences. If the Minister wishes to make his Department a paying concern he should see that the charges for city services are sufficiently high to make them payable. Once the Department cuts off telephonic, telegraphic, and postal services, great in j u r y is done.",91
405,Mr WEBSTER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,No telephonic service has been cut off.,91
406,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,A few telephonic services have been refused in my electorate.,91
407,Mr WEBSTER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"A few applications I believe for new services might have been refused, but no services have been cut off.",91
408,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The Minister would do well to give as much attention as possible to the requirements of country districts. In that way only we can hope to develop Australia. If the Government do not do that they will be assisting in a policy of centralization. To-day every capital city contains about half the population of its State. Our duty is to develop the country, and to provide opportunities for our people. In regard to the shipping question, it has been argued that it was necessary to cut down the service on the coast as far as as possible, and for that reason a large number of boats have been taken off the coast and sent abroad. The Treasurer, in his Budget speech, made allusion to Inter-State and coastal shipping in these terms- H The coastal shipping has also been greatly depleted by the transfer of Intcr-State vessels to service overseas. No less than fifty-three of such vessels, with an aggregate tonnage of 195,017, have been taken off the coast. In addition, sixteen ships, of an aggregate tonnage of 77,017-whic h in normal times served Australian coastal requirements-Jiav e been removed to other work, leaving their former services to be performed by the remaining fleet. The position in the coastal and Inter-State trade, as a consequence, became so acute that it was deemed advisable to appoint a Central Committee to regulate and secure the most economic use of the space available, whole of the shipping business thus being brought under the administration of the Condustry. troller of Shipping. Despite the surrounding difficulties, the result of this arrangement proved in the highest degree beneficial. I believe the time has arrived when the Shipping Board should devote its attention to the policy of getting those back to the Australian coast at as early signed. a date as possible. ""We read in the press cables that a large number of vessels which have not traded to Australia for number of years will be voyaging in direction shortly. If that is so we should be able to get back our own ships to sume the Australian coastal service. I we can restore Inter-State trade to normal men. conditions we shall find employment for thousands of our people. For the last tion. couple of years many parts of Australia have not been able to get the supplies of coal they needed, because there have not been sufficient boats to carry it consequence, many industries have not been working at their full capacity. the Inter-State shipping service were i full swing again, and supplies of coal were available in all parts of the Comtricts, monwealth, those industries would resume their former activity, and would employ more hands. More men would be emto ployed on the vessels, on the wharfs, in the mines, and in that way we should be able to absorb a large number of our soldiers when they return. I know that becoming dissatisfied. it will be a big problem to replace in in - meeting dustrial lif e all the men who will during the next year or so, but by restorwas ing the shipping trade to normal condino tions we shall be taking a considerable step in that direction. If only we can have the vessels to carry the coal from the mines a couple of thousand men could be employed on the northern coal mines immediately. That employment cannot pay for the clerical work. be provided unless the vessels are availmittee able for taking the coal away, because even today the Government are simply tipping coal out of the mines in order give work to the men who have remained work of the committee. in the district. If our ships were back on the coast they would consume more coal, and would carry supplies other parts of the Commonwealth; thus they would facilitate the employment of the a large number of men in the coal in ",91
409,Mr WEBSTER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,We are urging the re has storation of our shipping with all the force at our disposal.  (Mr Hughes) has been engaged on that ships matter ever since the armistice was,92
410,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I am very pleased to hear that. The Prime Minister is doa ing good work if he is interesting himself this in that matter. I say with confidence that the restoration of the Australian recoastal shipping to its pre-war condition f will afford employment to thousands of I am very satisfied to know that the Government are active in that direcTurning now to the question of repatriation, I believe that the Minister in charge is endeavouring to do his best. It . In is a very difficult subject to handle. Whoever controls repatriation, either If now or in the future, will have a hard n row to hoe. But there is a good deal of dissatisfaction, especially in country disi n regard to the treatment of the district committees. The idea of the Minister was to divide each State into areas and appoint Local Committees who could and deal directly with the soldiers returned to those areas, and in that way give speedy relief. But those committees are A big public was held in my district last return week, and the burden of the complaint that the Local Committee could get satisfaction at all from the State Board in Sydney. The Local Committee is composed of men who are giving their services without fee or reward to assist the scheme of repatriation. Frequent application has been made to the State Board in Sydney for sufficient money to The comcould get no satisfaction, or even a response, from the Sydney office. These gentlemen were left, not only to to give their services, but to ' finance the They were not again receiving any money with which to pay the secretarial expenses, and only after to a great deal of trouble did the committee get from Sydney an amount of £ 5 0 . The Government cannot hope for success in their scheme if men who have volunteered to assist repatriation gratuitously find Hiey are to be hampered in their efforts, that they can do nothing, and that there is in authority over them a Board in Sydney which refuses to take any notice of their representations. That is the complaint I am receiving from my district. The present State of affairs must be altered, because very much depends on the operations of the Local Committee. If a soldier writes to rae for assistance, I at once advise him that a repatriation committee has been appointed in his district, and that if he represents his case to the secretary it will be dealt with by the committee. But the soldiers will not be content to go before the Local Committees if they find that those bodies are unable to do anything, because they are hampered by a higher authority in Sydney. I hope that this complaint will be conveyed to the Minister for Repatriation. repatriation scheme is to have that confidence of the people and the soldiers which is essential to its success, it must be operated on a basis satisfactory to all concerned, and we cannot submit to having in Sydney a State Board that refuses to deal in a reasonable way with applications that come before it from the Local Committees'. I hope that these Estimates will be cut down to the greatest possible extent. I believe that the Government admit the necessity for keeping down expenditure, and no doubt they have reduced the proposals of the Departments to a large extent. In regard to the claim of the Treasurer that he has already cut down the Estimates by £2,000,000, there never was a State or Commonwealth Government that did not cut down the Estimate"", even in normal times. Whenever Estimates are prepared by the Departments it is the Treasurer's duty to go through them with the pruning knife. lect that in the New South Wales Parliament Ministers used to complain sometimes that the Treasurer had cutdown their Estimates by from £1,000,000 to £1,500,000. That happened when times were good, and therefore there is .not very much in the Treasurer's boast that he has cut down the Estimates of , Mr Charlton. Commonwealth expenditure at this time when economy is so essential. No doubtin every Department the tendency is totmake the d r a f t Estimates as liberal as possible, in the hope that the Treasurer will not knock off too much of the proposed expenditure. I hope that the E s t i mates will receive further careful review, and that they will be reduced wherever practicable. As far as war expenditure is concerned, there will be a big reduction. Every month the amount of money required for war purposes should be a diminishing quantity; but that expenditure is specially provided for out of loans, and is not included in the ordinary departmental estimates. I trust that therew ill be no unnecessary expenditure apart fro m the war. At the same time, we must not discontinue works that are necessary, and which will provide employment for the people. If we cut out works that are necessary, when men are returning from If the the Front, and we must find employment for them, we shall be throwing out of employment the men already in the Commonwealth, and an unemployment trouble will be created throughout the countryPossibly before next winter we may experience that trouble. I hope we may not.",92
411,Mr WEBSTER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Nex t year memberswill be urging the Government to spend all the money they can get, in order to provide work.",93
412,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Evidently the. Postmaster-General thinks that the possibility I have mentioned will be realized. I quite agree that honourable members may be urging upon the Government that expenditure in many directions should be proceeded with, in order to provide employment. It is an axiom, of government that, in order to have a contented people, employment must be"" given to them. Therefore, we should not abandon worksI recn 1 that are needed; but unnecessary expenditure, that will not provide employment, can be reduced. I believe there are manyitems of expenditure which, after careful review, could be cut down, thus saving; considerable sums of money.",93
413,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Wakefield} [10.11] - I wish to condense my remarks !; as much as possible, because I recognise that many honourable members desire to participate in this debate. Therefore, m y remarks will be more in the nature of managed to suggestions than an elaboration of details. I listened with great pleasure and interest to the statements of the Acting Prime Minister this afternoon. The honourable gentleman certainly deserves all the sympathy and assistance that can possibly he given by this Committee. H is work is «xceedingly difficult. For months past he has had enough work to keep full cupied two or three men of considerable capacity. A lot of the troubles he has had to grapple with are inherited; and he is struggling under a number of legacies, some of which aTe not too pleasant. T'he Act in g Prime Minister said that the Government have given every consideration to the matter of effecting economies, that he has done everything that he considered possible to reduce the Estimates, and that he would be prepared to continue his .scrutiny of them with the same desire. He definitely promised the Committee that from a certain point onwards every line of the Estimates will be again scrutinized very carefully. I find that on the page to which the honourable gentleman referred the war loan expenditure commences, and therefore the honourable gentleman's promise of further scrutiny is no more than the Committee has a right to expect, because, so far as prospective liabilities are ^concerned, the conditions today are very different from what they were when the Treasurer delivered his Budget speech. It will be disappointing indeed to the Committee and the taxpayers if the altered conditions do not enable the Treasurer and the Government to make very extensive savings in war loan expenditure. The Treasurer said that he had done all that was possible to reduce the Estimates, and that in that effort he had been given the assistance of the best official minds of the country. He did not say who they were, but I took it that he referred to the officers of the Treasury, and, if so, I have nothing to say against the statement, because I believe those gentlemen to be very able, and to (earnestly desire to do all that they can to keep the expenditure of the country within reasonable bounds. The honourable gentleman said that he had reduce the Estimates hy £2,000,000 - not a big saving on an expenditure of £37,000,000. He told us, moreover, that he had appointed three of the ablest men in the country to go through the Departments; very welcome information,- because Parliament of late years has not exercised any proper control of the public expeny oc- diture. I am glad that of these three men one is' the accountant to the Post Office, Mr Haldane. His knowledge of departmental methods will be of assistance to the two gentlemen with whom he is associated, and he is, in my opinion, one of the prizes of our Public Service. I do not know him personally, but I know him through his reports. In every contribution that he has made to the annual report of the Postmaster-General, he has shown himself a man of considerable capacity, and, as the result of his work, the Minister has been able to bring the accounts of the Department out of a condition of chaos, and for the first time has been able to present a balance on the righ t side of the ledger. When asked by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr . Austin Chapman) the outcome of Mr . Blacket's report on the Federal Capital administration, the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt ) said that he, as Minister, took the fullest responsibility for what had been done, .and that subsequently the Government had accepted the responsibility for it . I do not complain of this assumption of responsibility,- but I say that the honourable gentleman should have reported to this House the action taken as the result of the investigation of the Commissioner. In every instance in which inquiries have been made by Royal Commissions and Committees we should have had a statement by the Minister concerned. These reports have been very disquieting. Parliament has not been told the outcome of them, so far as the officers whose carelessness or incapacity has resulted in heavy loss to the taxpayers were affected. The Treasurer has said that the re-ordering of the Estimates suggested by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro would not save, at the outside, £10,000. I shall not vote for the proposal of the honourable member to re-' duce the firstitem of the Estimates, cause I do not intend to vote against Government, but I shall urge Ministers to do their duty by reducing the public expenditure as much as possible. not think that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro realized the effect of proposal, though, as a member of Parliaexpenditure mentof long experience and an exyears Minister, he should have known that such an attack on the Budget could not be regarded by the Government as other than a direct motion of want of confishould dence. ' At the same time, I retain to the right to vote for a reduction wherever Capital administration. I am satisfied that it should be made, because I sincerely and earnestly desire economy. In spite of the statement of Treasurer that the criticism of honourable members on this side of the chamber not led the Government to review the exand made more complete. penditure in different Departments, think that it should have done so. The ' House of Representatives does not, has not for many years, controlled the public purse. It has the right to do but has not exercised that right. Mr J. H. CATTS - There should be a quorum to hear this eloquent [Quorum formed.]",93

In the past even rudimentary beprecautions for eliminating blunders, the minimizing extravagance, and obtaining efficiency have not been taken. A f t e r an agitation of years, the Public Works ComI do mittee and the Public Accounts Committee have been established, and we have hi3 now more means of knowing how public is conducted. A f t e r many of agitation, a Supply and Tender Board, on proper lines, has, within the last few days, been established. But we have not as effective a public audit as we have. That was shown by the remyself port of Mr Blacket, on the Federal The Acting Prime Minister who, when Minister for Works and Railways,- was responsible for the the Federal Capital administration, promised to see that the A u d it Commissioner's had statutory directions should be amended, If those safeI guards had been instituted years ago a iot of the trouble, and worse than trouble and - disgrace-that has come upon this Legislature would not have been possible. so, I desire to give this Government credit for, in some of these respects, improving things very considerably. As to the speech. cutting down of the Estimates, I am not satisfied by a long way, and the statement of the Treasurer (Mr Watt) this afterhas not altered my opinion one To simply lop £2,000,000 off the we civil side of Estimates amounting to £37,000,000 is a flea-bite. Everybody me. who knows anything of how Estimates to are prepared by departmental officers knows that they are never expected to be In the exFederal Administration there has for without years been a great tendencv to build up Departments, and, as far as posconsible, trench on the preserves of the The deStates, and by some Ministers with a at the earliest opportunity, to make too hot for the States to exist. There has been no attempt at co-operation with States in regard to the government of There has been the adopof day labour everywhere, and Departments have grown up like mushMen, plant, and equipment been provided to run the day-labour system, and no one knows what that sysEstimates have been exceeded to an enormous extent; and I need only refer to a few of the principal public undertakings. When the Treasury building was contemplated, the State Government of Victoria was asked to undertake its construction .by contract, the work to be done by the State Works Department. That Department put in a tender, but it was turned down, and then the Fisher Government decided to construct the building with day labour. . And what was the result? The building was constructed at a cost which exceeded the State Government tender by more than 60 per cent. The Federal Capital provides another instance, and honourable members know the awful losses which . occurred there. Then we have the Naval Bases and other Defence works, the East-West railway, the Northern Territory, and the Cockatoo Island Dockyard, all of which experiments have been carried out with day labour uncontrolled, and have meant the expenditure of millions. This Parliament has never taken the proper steps to put an end to that kind of thing, although day labour has proved a ghastly failure. There is no effective check against this disastrous system but the test of public tender; and a good many of us on this side of the House have done our best to insist on that test being applied, but have always found the numbers against us. I understand that this Government are introducing to a considerable extent the principle of public tender as a test of what public works ought to cost, and it is time the taxpayer ""came in "" somewhere, for he has not been considered for many years past. But while the Government are doing a . considerable amount of work after its submission to public tender, they are not doing half enough. Let me draw attention to one particular item that came under the administration of the present Treasurer (Mr Watt) when he was Minister for Works and Railways. I refer to the building up of a great Railway Department to run the East-West railway, a work which is a calamity to this country. I tried, out success, to have an investigation; but if one had been made. I think this work would have been shown to be as great a disaster as the Federal Capital, or any of the other experiments of the Federal Government in the way of day labour. The cost of the railway was nearly double the estimate that was sanctioned by a previous Parliament, the excess expenditure being allowed to go on by different Parliaments until an authorised expenditure of about £4,000,000 ran into £7,000,000. It is not finished yet. Then when the work was nearing completion and arrangement had to be made for running the railway, I asked, and entreated, the then Minister for Works and Railways to let the question of running the line be referred to the Public Accounts Committee, that Committee to interview the Western Australian Government and the South Australian Government, with a view to their jointly running the railway for the Federal Government in the same fashion as the Melbourne-Adelaide express is run. The reply by the Minister of Works and Railways at the time was to the effect that it was the Government policy",95
416,Mr JOWETT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,To squander money?,96
417,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Yes .,96
418,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Who was the Minister ?,96
419,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The present Treasurer (Mr W at t ) , who said it was the policy of the Government to have its own Railway Department to run the railway. The people of South Australia and of Western Australia know a great deal better than those in States far removed from the railway what has been the result. If the Treasurer wishes to look into the public expenditure to find opportunities to save money, and with the object of avoiding the disasters of the past, let him send the Public Accounts Committee to investigate the rolling stock, plant, and all belonging to this marvellous Federal Railway ""Department between Port Augusta and Western Australia.",96
420,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,It would be a pretty ugly story!,96
421,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"It would with- be a mighty ugly story, and the men responsible for this enormous loss, who were appointed to manage the railway, manage it from Melbourne. Can there be any .'justification, in any shape or form, for these men being 500 miles away from 'their work? MT. JOWETT -""What does the Railway Department cost per year?",96
422,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I should like to know; and that is a job to which t'he Public Accounts Committee could devote their time very profitably indeed. South Australia and Western Australia have all their railway administrative staffs in operation, and there need have been -.no further overhead expenses incurred by their management of the east-west Tailway. Under the circumstances, could not these two States have managed the rail-way more satisfactorily, and at very - much less expense, than could men living j n Melbourne?",97
423,Mr GLYNN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,There would be the Northern Territory railway to manage.,97
424,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That could be easily managed without very great administrative expenditure, just as in the days when South Australia owned it. I would very much like the Public Accounts Committee to inquire into the Northern Territory expenditure, especially on railways, and see what the cost is as compared with that under the Railway Commissioner of South Australia.",97
425,Mr GLYNN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The revenue is higher now.,97
426,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"And so it should be; but, so far, I do not think that the revenue, in its relation to the necessipossibility ties and the expenditure, will bear the light of day. 1 should very much like to deal further with the Northern Territory, but I have not time now. I should like to give honourable members two or three lines of figures to show how public expenditure has increased in the Commonwealth during the past eight years. In 1910, the Federal expenditure was £7,499,516, while three years lateT, in 1913-14, it was £15,458,770. In 1910 the revenue was £15,540,669, whereas in 1913-14 it was £21,741,745. It will be seen that in five years the expenditure increased by 100 per cent., and the revenue by 40 per cent. Most of that period was of unparalleled prosperity, «extravagance and waste. It was a day of .drift, day labour, and "" go-slow."" Discipline had disappeared; all control of public expenditure was gone. It is about time we got back to the public test in regard to our expenditure. If honourable members do not take these matters seriously the day is not far distant when they will be compelled to do so. On the 30th June, 1917, the public debt of Australia Was £62.1,612,933. I suppose that it will amount to £700,000,000 by the end of June of this year- a bigger debt than the national debt of Great Britain prior to the war. For the next ten years loans will have to be renewed by us at the rate of £22,000,000 per year, and we are now borrowing at the rate of £80,000,000 a year for war purposes. ",97
427,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"No ; the Treasurer has informed the Committee that we cannot expect it to stop for some time yet. These figures are startling. Every loan raised in Australia meanB that a certain amount of money has been withdrawn from the working capital of the country, money that would otherwise be available for the development of the primary and secondary industries of the Commonwealth. To meet our enormous liabilities we must economize, increase our production, or impose taxation. We should have economy first; we should tax last. There is not that concern about economy that there ought to be, and there is not much of having increased production when we continue a policy of extra-? vagance, and are forced to bleed the country of money that ought to be employed in private enterprises, by compelling its investment in Commonwealth loans. I hope that the Government will justify - the expectations raised by the statement of the Treasurer today, particularly in regard to submitting everything in the shape of public expenditure to the tender test. Economy may be effected by a very necessary amendment, long overdue, of our Conciliation and Arbitration - Act. Under the existing law arbitration has proved to be a disastrous failure in Australia. During this war, when we should have had industrial peace, we had more industrial turmoil and strife than we have had in the previous history of the Commonwealth. Mr Knibbs says in his last Year-book that there were 444 strikes in the Commonwealth, in the previous year, affecting directly or indirectly 173,970 people, who lost 4,599,658 working days, representing in wages £2,594,808. That was at a time when our brave Australian soldiers were fighting for our very liberties on the field There seems to be no sign of any improvement. We ought to m'ake a start by amending our industrial legislation to remove the control of our industries from the hands of one man. It is useless imagining that we can continue to bear our increasing burdens until we have our industrial matters put right.",97
428,Mr CONSIDINE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"""What would the honourable member consider to be "" putting them right?""",98
429,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"In the first place, the men who are a danger and a menace to the community ought to be put out of the country, and I shall be very much disappointed with the Government if they are not put out of the country instead of being released and allowed to run at large to carry on their mischief-making designs by disturbing our industrial conditions, and destroying the very best interests of every true and honest worker in the Commonwealth. I do not believe in paying men poor wages; I would pay them well, but I would make them earn their money. I would have no slowing down. I would follow that principle in which the honor lieves, which he has practised, and to which he ascribes his success in life: that is to say, I would introduce a little bit' of piece-work, not only in shipbuilding, but also in other directions. If it is a good principle to apply to the building of ships in time of necessity, it is an equally good principle to apply in the interests of the country for all time. I am pleased that the Government have dropped a good deal of the price-fixing business; I am sorry that they ever took it up. It is a policy that has never been successful anywhere. In America, where they generally know how things ought to be done, when the authorities wished to make sure of getting as big a supply of meat as possible for war purposes, they did not fix a minimum price, but they offered to buy all' the pork that could Be produced in America at a highly remunerative figure:.

431,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I supposethat the wage-earner has been given as much consideration in this country as he has been given in any other country. Im this Farliament no other question has occupied a tenth of the time that has been devoted to the matter of the betterment of the condition of the wage-earner. It. is the leader, or the misleader, of theworker who makes all the mischief, and' gets all the plums. To-day men of intellect, heart, and character among the> workers are casting off their misleaders. It is a waste of public money to have a section in Parliament that is not a representative party, but is merely a body that receives instructions day by day from, irresponsible sources outside. I want to follow these Estimates as-, closely as possible. If there are items in them which I have reason to believe can* be cut down, I am one to cut them down. E hope that the Business Committee which: is going through the Departments will: lead to a considerable reduction in the Estimates next year. I thought that the Public Accounts Committee was to be* brought into existence to deal with such? matters. The consideration of Estimates in the House of Commons is a relatively simple matter, because a Public A c counts Committee has previously givers them a more thorough investigation than a Committee of the whole House can possibly give them. Of course, in Great Britain the Committee of Public Accounts is really a Committee of specialists. Our Public Accounts Committee and our Publio Works Committee ought to be Committees ot specialists as far as it is .possible to make them such; but I am afraid that members are appointed to those Committees more for Party reasons than from any desire to select the best men for the work, the Committees are expected to perform.",98

I regret that I was unable to accept the position. I am sorry that I have not been able to gain the experience that members of these Committees have secured. I thank honourable members of the various Committees for the light they have thrown on a good deal of our public expenditure since they have commenced their investigations.

I also have been in terested in an examination of the systems of government in operation in this country, and have taken out figures showing the extent to which the people are taxed in order to maintain the machinery of government in respect of both the Commonwealth and the States. From the Commonwealth Year-Book for 1916-17, I find that in New South Wales, for instance. £5,000 per annum is paid to the Governor, £400 per annum to his official secretary, £350 per annum to his private Becretary, £350 per annum to his aide-decamp, £796 for orderlies, £1,653 for additions and maintenance of residences for the Governor, and £1,547 in respect of miscellaneous items of expenditure associated with the Governor's service. This gives a total of £10.096, which is paid by the taxpayers of New South Wales for the privilege of having a State Governor. The following table shows the payments made by the Commonwealth and all the States for the privilege of having a vice-regal representative: GOVERNORS. .. .. £25,279 New South Wales .. 10,094 Victoria .. .. 10,410 Queensland .. .. 7,447 South Australia . . -. 5,311 Western Australia .. 6,965 Tasmania .. .. 3,856 Total . . £69,362",99

437,Mr GREGORY,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I do not think it costs 44,868 so much in Russia. 671 13,075 Mr Considine - I shall give the 935 honourable member more than he wants to know about Russia. For this expendi35 ture of practically £900,000 we have the luxury of a Governor General and six State Governors, fourteen Houses of Parliament, and 686 members of Parliament. This is .the burden that a population of 4,935,311 has to carry. Since we are talking of economy, I would suggest that if we were to scrap six out of the seven Parliaments in Australia, and to do away with the whole of £9,384 the Governors, who are not of sufficient 6,171 importance to warrant the payment of 1,703 so much money for their maintenance, we 1,995 should benefit the taxpayers. We should 2,077 give the people of Australia a Democratic 7,670 system of government, suited to their 2,074 necessities, and save the workers of the country an enormous expenditure. Instead of wasting so much money annually on the up-keep of these unnecessary and very expensive institutions, we should thus give the people what is in every sense of the term a popular form of government. The honourable member for Dampier .90,843 (Mr Gregory) interjected that the cost of government in Russia was much less. Owing to the paternal care exer84,190 cised by the Government which the hon55,163 orable member for Dampier supports, we are not able to ascertain what the mode of government in that country costs the 70,451 people.

438,Mr GREGORY,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,It is not too Democracy now in Russia.,101
439,Mr CONSIDINE,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I have here an authority on the subject who cannot be accused of having any bias on the side of the Russians. Colonel W. B . Thompson, the head of the American Red Cross Mission to Russia, and a multi-millionaire, ""speaking in New York, saidWe talk about patriots in this country, but we dp not know what patriotism is until we see in Russia examples of what I should call the patriotism of mankind. While in Russia, I met some real patriots. There I met men and women who, for the benefit of their fellows, had spent three-quarters of their lives in prisons and chain gangs. There I met the heads of the revolutionary groups, who for fifty years or more had been risking their all for Russian freedom-Madam e Breshkovsky, Thaikovaky, and Lazaroff. Think of Breshkovsky, the Grandmother of the Revolution, seventy-four years old, a prisoner and an exile for thirty-four years, still working night and day, with might and main, for the benefit of her fellow Russians. This group surrounded Kerensky, who believed in working out the social problem by the Russian Labour classes, in conjunction with the property-owning classes. Then', again, I saw the workings of another group, equally patriotic, who believed that ultimate freedom and the possession of the land could only be worked out by the working men and the peasants. I can easily sec how Marie Spiridovna, now a leading figure in Russian fife, believes that freedom is only to be realized by a Government of working men alone. The Russian revolution, only a few months ago, released this young woman, now only in the thirties, from fifteen years' solitary confinement in a Siberian prison. I will say right here, that if at any time during my travels I was a witness of deeds of wanton destruction and violence, it was not in Russia. If at any time. I was in danger, it was not in Russia.",101
440,Mr GREGORY,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,I think there ought to be a quorum present. [Quorum formed.],101
441,Mr CONSIDINE,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"The gentleman have quoted is a better authority Russian affairs than is the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory). I the honourable member desires further timonials to the Russian people, I quote the following remarks made by the ment Japanese Ambassador on his return to his day. own country from Russia on the 29th March lastThe Soviets are gaining enormous power in Russia. The people really feel that they are the rulers of the country, and it is wonderful to observe them. Germany might destroy the Lenin Government, but Bolshevikism will permeate the world. Any other announcements would be false. safe for Every foreigner who has not large interests of a commercial nature leaves Russia fairly committed to the Bolshevikist view of life, and all the Germans and Austrians who may return to their country will most certainly be propagandists. The truth of that statement can be seen in the cable messages that are daily being published regarding Dr Liebknecht and the Spartacus group in Germany. Here is another statement that the honourable member for Dampier might contemplate in his spare moments. Mr Arthur Ransome,"" the Russian correspondent of the London Daily News, writing fro m Moscow, saidNo one contends that the Bolsheviks are angels. I ask only that men shall look through the fog of libel that surrounds them, and see that the ideal for which they are struggling, in the only way in which they can struggle, is among those lights which every man of young and honest heart sees before him somewhere on the road, and not among those other lights from which he resolutely turns away. These men who have made the Soviet Government of Russia, if they must fail, will fail with clean shields and clean hearts, having striven for an ideal which will live beyond them. Even if they fail, they will none the less have written a page of history more daring than any other which I can remember in the story of the human race. They are writing it amid showers of mud from all the meaner spirits in their country, in yours, and in my own. But, when the thing is over, and their enemies have triumphed, the mud will vanish like black magic at noon, and that page will be as white as the snows of Russia, and the writing on it as bright as the gold domes that I used to see glittering in the sun when I looked from my windows in Petrograd. And when in after years men read that page they will judge your country and mine, your race and mine, by the help or hindrance they gave to the writing of it. I What is it that arouses the ire of honoron able members opposite, and makes the honourable member for Dampier and f others rise' in their wrath whenever Boltesshevism is mentioned? I propose to now place on record the system of Governthat is in operation in Russia toThese are the general provisions of the Constitution of the Russian: Socialist Federal RepublicThe fundamental problem of the Constitution of the Russian Socialistic Federal Republic involves, in view of the present transition period, the establishment of a dictatorship over the urban and rural proletariat and the poorest peasantry, the power of the Pan-Russian Soviet authority, the crushing of the bourgeoisie, the abolition of the spoliation of men by men and the introduction of Socialism in which there will be neither a division into classes nor a - State authority. 1. The Russian Republic is the free Socialistic society of all the working people of Russia, united in the urban and rural Soviets. 2. The Soviets of those regions which differentiate themselves by a special form of existence and national character will be united into autonomous regional associations ruled by the sessions of the Soviets of those regions and their executive organs. 3. The Soviet associations of the regions participate in the Russian Socialistic Republic upon the basis of federation, at the head of which stand the Pan-Russian session of the Soviets and, in periods between the sessions, the Pan-Russian Central Executive Committee. * CONCERNING THE RUSSIAN .SOVIETS.

The members of the Convention would elect an Executive Committee, who would be similar to our members of Parliament, whose business would be, not to discuss projects of legislation as we do here, but each to govern a sub-department.

These unnecessary Parliaments and Governorships could be wiped out. Furthermore, considerable saving could he effected by abolishing 'Departments which might be called the by-product of the various Parliaments. At present the people get very little for their expenditure. It is the workers who find the money to pay for these unnecessary institutions, and as the honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams) said tonight, they are relatively worse off than they were, in spite of the nominal increase in wages.

Tn reply to my question as to whether this man was a member of the Okrana, or Russian secret police-the spy system of the late Czar's Government - the Acting Prime Minister said - he could not say; and in answer to my question whether his services had been ized by the Commonwealth Police Force for the purpose of obtaining information regarding Russians resident in Queensland, the Acting Prime Minister said that he did not think so. The Minister also read a telegram which he had received from Mendrin declaring that he was neither a German nor of German parentage; that he had arrived in Australia about 1911 from Russia by way of Japan; that he had not, and had never, teen connected with any Russian secret service, and had never been employed in the Consular Office in Brisbane or by the He added that he belonged to a well-known Russian family, and was carrying on a legitimate business in Brisbane as manager for a of Russian merchants; that he did not belong to any Bolshevik or unlawful organization, and that his name was simply Anatole Letivitch Mendrin, without any alias whatever. I asked the questions because there had come into my possession a translation of issue No. 201 of the official organ of the Bolshevik Government, the Isvestia, dated 22nd January, 1917. In that organ there apof peared, certain correspondence, dealing with the secret police system of the late It was published a Russian named Augaski, who had I been a political exile in New South I propose to read the telegrams so that honourable members may see for loan themselves whether Mendrin was connected in any way, as I have alleged, of with the Russian secret police.  matter to a head if you said this outside.",105

"" Dear Mr Michel Igntatovitch,-The agent who came to me in October, Anatole Melentievitch Mendrin, known as Toboletz, as reported by me in Despatch number 52, pFOved himself entirely unacquainted with the local, revolutionary movement, in consequence of which he was ordered to Harbin, where he is to get the connexions required to work in the radius intrusted to me. Toboletz. has received from me 75 roubles for October salary, and 60 roubles for travelling expenses' from Irkutsk, also a passport, number 275, issued by the Mayor, of the Town of Riazam, on .the 20th of August, 1907, in the name of. Ivan Semenovitch Medviedieff. During his sojourn in Harbin the same man has written to me only one letter,, from which I concluded that the objects set him in Harbin had not been reached.. In consequence, he .was ordered to remain there up to the 6th of December. At the same time, his attention was drawn to the mistakes he had made* such as sending letters by post with my name on the address, and on the necessity to send the communication required from him. It is probable that my letters - stating exactly what was required of him as one of our agents did not please him, ary, 1916:as up to now he has not come to Vladivostock, and he is no longer in Harbin. In reporting the above, I pray, should you possess tidings of his whereabouts to take from him and return to me the passport issued to him, and, if possible, get from < (him an explanation why he did not fulfil the service expected from him. I deem it necessary to add the following:-'When Toboletz came to Vladivostock he stated to me that he had been ordered to come here, not from his own desire, nor because that 'I he had reported that he could throw light ; on the revolutionary activity in the Army throughout the. territory intrusted to my Vladivostock. administration, but only in consequence 1 Mendrin arrive, and of his own downfall, the failure in the success. Secondly, in my own estimation, Toboletz came here (he is here a houseowner) to arrange his personal affairs, and to receive from the Procurateur Schultz, and from the President of Court Tribunal Goodzeveitch certain money lent to them, and to other officers of the Justice Department while they were residing, if I am not mistaken, in the district of Irkutsk.

476,Mr LAIRD SMITH,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,What is the honourable member's object?,107
477,Mr CONSIDINE,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"It is claimed by the Russians here that this man is not a Russian at all. The name certainly savours more of German than Russian origin. He is the Australian manager for Popoff and Company, whose headand quarters are in Harbin , China, and, stated by certain correspondence in my possession, he is the man who cornered the tallow market in Australia in 1916.",107
478,Mr JOWETT,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,That was a dirty thing to do.,107

482,Mr CONSIDINE,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"23r d January, 1916.",107
483,Mr LYNCH,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,That was before the Commonwealth Police Force was established.,107
484,Mr CONSIDINE,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"This man states that he was working with the local police. The Brisbane Russians say that he has been used by the Commonwealth Police Force to obtain information regarding Russians there. His letter, then, is really in the nature of an application as a memMRS. MIEDVIEDIEFF."" ber of the secret service of a foreign country. I know that, according to his teleof gram, he is the most innocent man on the face of the earth; but he admits that he is the manager of the firm which I have named, and he claims to be Anatole Melentrevitch Mendrin. The correspondence which I have read is published in the official organ of the Soviet Government, No. 201, of the 22nd December, 1917. It shows that this man came from H a r b in , that he was employed at Vladivostock as as a police spy under the late Czar's Government. He disappeared from Russia, and his whereabouts could not be located. He did not carry out the job that had been allotted to him, but came to Australia instead. Then he wrote from Brishonbane asking that he might be employed here, because he was able to obtain information that would be of value. The Government are extraordinarily quick to use that the powers conferred upon them by the This War Precautions Act to deal with our own people who are supposed to have in the law, either by the publication seditious matter, or by giving utterance to disloyal sentiments.

487,Mr JOWETT,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,Does the honourable member suggest that we should appoint a Royal Commission to inquire into this matter ?,108
488,Mr CONSIDINE,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I suggest that the honourable member should remain quiet until I have finished my speech. When it comes to investigating the antecedents 'of this individual, do the Government propose to mete out to him, because he cornered the tallow market a few years ago, and because he represents an international firm, different treatment from that which is accorded to our own people? When a man leaves his country, more especially when he claims to be in touch with those who are high in authority there, we should prove beyond doubt that he is what he represents himself to be. When I questioned the Government upon this matter, I was informed that it was the intention of this individual to leave Australia again within a month.",108
489,Mr JOWETT,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,What did Ministers say vernment. in reply to the honourable member's queslate tions?,108
490,Mr CONSIDINE,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"They said that they had no information to give, answer to some of those questions, and they produced Mr Mendrin's telegram. But how came he to know that I had the asked the questions?  had seen them in the newspapers?",108
491,Mr CONSIDINE,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I want to know why this person, who was undoubtedly member of the secret service of the late sheviks. Czar's Government  is not in a position to prove that, although he may think it.",108

493,Mr CONSIDINE,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"For goodness' sake, try some other tune.",108
494,Mr LAIRD SMITH,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,Is the honourable member prepared to bring a definite charge against him?,108
495,Mr CONSIDINE,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"It is the duty of the Government, who are so ready to vernment to Germany. prosecute our own people, to investigate the statement of the Russian colonists of Brisbane to the effect that this man is really of Germanic origin; to ascertain the reasons for his visit to Australia, and for his trips to and from Japan. At the present time, he is alleged to be in Queensland collecting trade information for certain persons in the East. The Government are in a position to make him account for his movements. They can very easily ascertain through the British Embassy whether or not his statements are correct. They are in a position to determine whether he is in possession of the passports that he claims. This is the man who wrote from Australia, as late as 23rd January, 1916  thinks that he is the man?",108

The Kaiser knows that he is looking for a job today because of the presence of the Bolsheviks in Germany. It has been alleged by one of the leaders of the Salvation Army, who recently returned from Europe, that a wireless apparatus was discovered in the Czarina's apartments at Petrograd.",108

503,Mr JOWETT,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,The late Czar of Russia was never a pro-German.,109
504,Mr CONSIDINE,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,A prima facie case has been made out for Government investigation into this man's antecedents.

506,Mr CONSIDINE,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"No . But it may supply a reason why his telegram was received so promptly, and why there is such a lack of information regarding the questions which I have asked. Seeing that our own people are clapped into gaol upon all sorts of charges of disloyalty and sedition, the Government ought to investigate this particular case, with a view to ascertaining whether the individual .to whom I refer has been responsible for any leakage of information.  he is not a Bolshevik.",109
507,Mr CONSIDINE,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"No . Had he been one, he would not have been a police spy and an informer. The people of this country who take any interest in what transpires here, will not be satisfied to let this matter drop without a thorough investigation into it. Is it only the men and women of the working classes who are to have their antecedents inquired into, their loyalty questioned, and their actions spied upon?

515,Mr JOWETT,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,They were good speeches.,110

They would do ' more good than any other speech which has been uttered ini this chamber' during My the past twelve months. I congratulate the. honourable member for Barrier (Mr. I Considine) upon having become, to some extent, a convert. I had always looked upon him with a shade of suspicion so far as this country was concerned. But now he is defending us. He believes he has do "" got on "" to. some one who has been a spy ouit here; and he wants the man followed up-. The only thing that I am to realise in relation to that individual is that he is not in Russia today.. If hewere,, his name would, not he ""' Semenoff ""-o r whatever it may be. It would be more like "" Popoff."" The honas orable member has pictured what would happen if he had his way, and,, as he has been talking, I have been endeavouring to draft some idea of what would be the in Australia if Bolshevik ideals were given full sway. Among the ideals portrayed by the honourable member for Barrier there is a love of freedom- a love of freedom for. yourself, and "" to the dickens'' with the other fellow! It is a case of "" rob everybody else, and shoot the run main who seeks to rob you."" There is 'a love of society about the Bolshevik principles- a love of society, allied, however, will to destroy all who dare to disagree with you. Bolshevik ideals would bring to this country fraud, robbery, murder, rapine, famine, and pestilence. the That is what follows hard on the Bolshevik regime, if we are to judgeby the rehistory of Russia today. And yet we by have such freedom in Australia that a not member of this Parliament is permitted to stand up andtalk Bolshevism of that character. Inwhat country, in all the world, is there the same freedom ? Where are there similar electoral laws? We have universal adult suffrage. What more could one want than an expression of the will of the people as indicated in Aushave tralia's system of government ? But I wish to deal now specifically d'o with, the subject before the Committee. it It. is discreditable that at 1.30 in the morning, there, should be only about a dozen - honourable members present to discuss an expenditure of approximately £120,000,000. ""We were promised time after time that, in. connection with these Estimates, full and ample opportunity would be given for their discussion. What time is there for discussion now? What chance have we to endeavour to force the Government to reduce expenditure?",110
519,Mr JOWETT,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,Forc e them with argument !,111
520,Mr GREGORY,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"We have done it before, or with other form of pressure. I regret that we cannot make the public realise that at this hour a handful of honourable members should be dealing with Estimates which were submitted months ago. The debate, I dare say, will be pushed to its illogical conclusion, namely, the passing of the Estimates. I am sorry that I cannot congratulate honourable members generally on their efforts to do their duty to their constituents and the country by seeing that this enormous total of expenditure is not fully discussed, with the object of reducing it wherever possible. Undoubtedly, there is a drift going on. We hear honourable members talking about Unification. We hear them saying, "" Get rid of these other Parliaments. Give all power into the hands of the Federal Parliament."" We deserve it, do we not? The Government have said, ""We are going to end this session in a few days. It does not matter what time has been wasted; you must put the Estimates through in a few hours."" Talk about Nero fiddling while Rome burned! It is nothing to what is going on to-night. The honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) has been interjecting in a manner which does not suggest that he is impressed with the seriousness of the position. The honourable member may be very well satisfied with the Administration ; but I am not. When we look upon the enormous expenditure, which was estimated before the armistice and with the expectation of a full war year ahead, it is reasonably fair to ask that the mates should now be reviewed with an idea of reducing expenditure in view of the altered situation. I would go further than the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman). I am dissatisfied, not only with the enormous .expenditure and with the puny effort being made to stop the growth of extravagance in the Federal Service, I am not satisfied with the Administration. The administration of the Government at present has tended greatly to cripple the primary industries of the country. I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, and there are many honourable members on this side who also should support it.",111
521,Mr LATRD SMITH,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"Who , do you suggest, should be sent for if the Government are defeated?",111
522,Mr GREGORY,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I am trying to teach the Government the error of their ways' We have done so before. The Treasurer took credit for what the Government did in connection with the Loan Estimates; but they were forced to do what they did. The honourable gentleman told us what he did when he was Minister for Works, but we never heard a. single word from him then about the gross extravagance of that Department, though I admit it occurred chiefly prior to his taking control. Instead of creating a new Department to operate the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway, the State Governments of Western Australia and South Australia should have been asked upon what terms they would run it. Now we have a new Commonwealth Department for the purpose, and it is carried on at enormous expense. I hope that the pressure from honourable members on this side, that was responsible for the reduction in the Loan Estimates, will be used to prevent much of the extravagance that is provided for in these Estimates. The Treasurer says that he struck out £2,290,000 which the different Departments had asked for. It was to be expected that within the last three or four years a certain increase in the cost of government would take place, but it is not reasonable that the estimates for Esti- this year should show a large increase upon the expenditure for last year. The Treasurer said that he could not reduce these Estimates further, but I see a vote of £20,000 for the Science Institute. Where is the authority for the establishment of the Science Institute? not been given by this Parliament. In ' connection with a matter of urgency, and particularly during war time, I should be prepared to give the Treasurer any sum he desired, but no one can say that the establishment of the proposed Science In stitute at a cost of £20,000 for this year is a matter of urgency. Let honourable members consider the vote for the Meteorological Bureau, which is proposed by this Government, who are going to save money. There is £2,500 in crease set down for the staff of that branch, and a large number of increases are provided for. The salary of one officer is to be raised from £504 to £588 ; of another, from £466 to £522; and of three others, from £406 to £480. New appointments are also provided for. No one will say that weather reports are of such great importance that these appointments could not have been lef t for some future date. Let honourable members consider again the huge expenditure upon the Northern Territory. Will any one dare to say that there is not an opportunity to reduce expenditure there? I have been looking up the Estimates of expenditure for the Northern Territory from 1913 onwards, and I find that it is like nothing so much, as a huge mushroom growth. In view of the high taxation which the people are compelled to pay, and in view of the money which must be provided if our returned soldiers are to be properly looked after, it is only fair that we should demand that there shall be no extravagance in the government of the country. I take the expenditure upon the H i gh Commissioner's Office,. I ask, in the first place, what is the High Commissioner in London for? There has been an expenditure of nearly £1,000,000 in connection with the London Office. The High Commissioner was sent to London to look after the interests of Australia. He is there with a staff, but they are not permitted to look after the terests of the country. They are not assisting the State 'Agents-General to promote the interests of Australian industries. The Government will be in recess in a few days, and may then send to the Old Country any Minister they please. It has There are two Ministers there now interfering with the proper disposal of our products. What is Mr Fisher in London for? If he is not competent to perform the proper duties of his office, he should be brought back here; and if he is competent, as I believe he and his staff are, his work should not be done by members of the Ministry. .",111
523,Mr JOWETT,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,What would be done with Mr Fisher if he were brought back?,112
524,Mr GBEGOEY,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I do not say that we should bring him back, but we should give him the power to do necessary work, and he should do it , instead of having the Prime Minister butting in .",112
525,Mr LYNCH,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"The Prime Minister is doing good work in getting ships for Australia, and quite a lot of other good work.",112
526,Mr GREGORY,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I do not agree with the honourable member. Although we have two Ministers and the High Commissioner in London, the expenditure on the High Commissioner's Office is increased this year from £8,925 to £10,650. The expenditure of the States and of the Commonwealth has shown an enormous increase during the past four or five years. In 1913-14 the expenditure of the different Governments in Australia amounted to £69,000,000. This year it amounts to £173,000,000. The war is, of course, responsible for a great portion of the increase, but not for the whole of it . In 1913-14, the taxation imposed by the States amounted to £6,304,000. This year it amounts to £8,984,000 or an increase of £2,680,000. The taxation of the Commonwealth amounted, in 191314, to £16,587,000; at the end of the last financial year it amounted to £24,523,000. We must come to a stage at which the people will be unable to bear any further taxation. The taxation of Commonwealth and States amounted, in 1913-14, to £4 14s. per head of the population, men,-women, and children, and this year in- it amounts to £ 6 17s. 5d. per head. In 1913-14, the public debt of the States was £294,000,000, and the public debt of the Commonwealth was £19,000,000, or a total of £313,000,000. In 1917-18, the public debt of the States amounted to £372,005,000, and of the Commonwealth to £246,000,000, making a total public today of £618,000,000.",112
527,Mr SOTGLAIR,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,How much of that isdue to war expenditure?,113
528,Mr GREGORY,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I did not bother to takeout the figures due to special war expenditure. The public debt of the States and Commonwealth has increased from £70 per.head of the population in 1913-14= to £125 17s. per head today.. This year, the Commonwealth revenueis estimated at £36,000,000, and the expenditure at £125,000j000, showing a deficit of approximately £85,000,000. No' doubt this is a wealthy community; but the wealth of the country comes from its primary industries.",113
529,Mr MATHEWS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,-The industrialists can claim a little.,113
530,Mr GREGORY,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"Not so far as the actual wealth of the country is concerned. The industrialists must help, but if the primary industries do not progress, the other industries are useless.",113
531,Mr MATHEWS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"And vice versa,.",113
532,Mr GREGORY,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"Not at all, because the primary producer competes in the markets of the world, and the industrialist competes in the home market.",113
533,Mr MATHEWS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,The homemarket is the agriculturalists' best market.,113
534,Mr LAIRD SMITH,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,The MCKay harvester can help the primary producer.,113
535,Mr GREGORY,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,Undoubtedly .,113
536,Mr MATHEWS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,-And so has the supply of cheap superphosphates.,113
537,Mr GREGORY,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"That has been due to Professor Lowry's advocacy of their use. He was the man of genius and brains, whoproved the great value of superphosphates to the agricultural industry. I realise that the best market is the home market, and desire to encourage home industries; but the great primary dustries are those which are responsible for the wealth and prosperity of Australia. I say that the present Administration has not looked after those industries as it should have done. I have said that I am not entirely satisfied with the Administration. I am not content to allow the Government to go intorecess for five or six months, when, during that time, we shall have all our boys coming back debt from the war. We are without a definite scheme of repatriation. The Government have not endeavoured to investigate complaints made of the' conditions under which, our boys have been sent away from Australia. The Government should' have at once had an impartial Committee appointed to investigate the condition of the Barambah when it left here. TheHouse would be quite justified in demanding that a Committeecomposed of members of both sides, acting in an honorary capacity, should be appointed. I and many other members would, be only too glad to act honorarily to investigate complaints of that sort, so that if officers are wanting in their duty they should be punished, and, if not, it should be shown clearly that they have done their duty honestly and fairly. I do not approve of allowing the Government, at a time like this', to lave that supreme control which they will have probably until May next, when we mayhope for Parliament to be called together again. I have seen the methods of the Treasurer. I have seen quite enough of political life to know what is going to' happen, no matter what promises he hasmade. He has made promises here with, regard to the War Precautions Act and other matters, but we know that he has. made other promises. One big promise was made to the country, and kept, to my mind, very badly. It was kept in the letter,, but. not in spirit. I 'am saying that, because the Treasurer has been grossly impertinent to me time after time, and I want to give him back just about as good as he has given. Are we to have a. continuance of the reports in connection with administrative matters that we have had during the past few days? What action do the Government propose to take ? They have not' in- told Us anything yet. A complaint was made in another Chamber' by Senator Pratten in regard totin scrap; and we have an officer in the Attorney-General's Department dictating tothepublic the terms upon which it is to be treated. This is a most arbitrary and improper thing, and a disgrace to any Administration. The' worse feature is the nature .o£ the. replies that are put in. the hands of Ministers. I am sure the. Treasurer would not have made the statement he made here if he was not satisfied that the answer he was giving was true. He told the House on two occasions, in answer to questions-on e of them put by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Chapman)bhat £ 4 15s. per ton was not the. ruling price of t in scrap here. Here is a purchase note from one of the biggest firms in Melbourne: Quantity up to 500 tons of 2,240 lbs. each; description, tin-plate clippings; quality, not rusty; price, £ 4 15s. per ton for 2,240. lbs. net, f.o.b. Melbourne; shipment, middle of July, 1918. That is dated 28th June, 1918.",113
538,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,The answer given to me was that that price was not obtainable.,114
539,Mr GREGORY,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"There is the official sale note from one of the biggest firms in Melbourne, and I saw another one today. We asked the Acting Prime Minister if he was going to continue the embargo on the export of t in scrap, and he said, "" Yes . "" Why, and for whom is this being done? I read in a file in the Library today that large quantities of t in scrap were being sent by charitable people to some f u n d organized by the Lady Mayoress of Melbourne for the purpose of aiding Red Cross work, and the committee asked to be allowed to sell it for export. I believe it was a very large quantity, yet the permission was refused. They said they could get only 5s. per ton for it here. These people are practically told, "" You can throw it into the t i p , as we cannot allow .it to go outside Australia. "" I am sure the Treasurer would not have given the reply he did in this Chamber if he had had the information I have quoted in that sale note. These prices could not exist without the Department having the information. sort of Administration have we got that will permit an officer of one of the Departments to give instructions that t in scrap can be thrown on to the rubbish heap as waste, when a demand comes from another country for it at a good figure ?",114
540,Mr MATHEWS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,I think that is the f a u l t of some of the great business Boards that we have appointed.,114
541,Mr GREGORY,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"It is the same administration as has 'been controlling the metal industry, and I do not like it . I have not liked it for the last two years.",114
542,Mr MATHEWS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,Y o u would have business men instead of officials.,114
543,Mr GREGORY,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"There are business men and business men. As a rule, business men can look after business matters very much better than politicians can. I approve of Business Boards; but we should have enough common sense in the administration to realise that what we want today is money. Does it not seem a scandal ;that the owners of scrap of this sort, that will produce even £ 3 per ton f.o.b. Melbourne or in other States, should be told that they can throw it into the rubbish tip? The regulation that deals, with this matter deals also with steel and other scrap. Permits have been given for the export, of that scrap, and there have been exports since the regulation came into force.",114
544,Mr MATHEWS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I have a constituent who says that he is not allowed to export, - and the iron men will not pay him for it .",114
545,Mr GREGORY,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"Senator Pratten showed me the figures he had taken out, - showing the quantities exported since the regulation came into force.",114
546,Mr MATHEWS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"My constituent says they will give him only £ 2 per ton for - scrap iron. 'Then they put it in and roll it and get about £ 1 8 per ton for it . Mr 'GREGORY - That is the sort of thing that enables one or two favoured firms to manipulate the market, and I do - not like it . I have dealt with the metal business on more than one occasion. I pointed out in connection with the zinc industry that we had a Department controlling the formation of companies. The Department was mighty particular, if a man wanted to float a mine, or anything else, to point out that the public had to What be protected and shares had to be put in escro until six months after the war. A boy who probably never saw a mine in his life insisted upon certain conditions. A Zinc Producers Association was formed under duress. The Broken Hill and Mount Lyell companies, protested, but were compelled to join. They were told that they would have fortyeight hours to join in , or something would happen. In the articles - of association appears a clause which gives the directors power to make gifts or pay commissions to any person who may not, directly or indirectly, do anything to the advantage of the company if , in the opinion of the directors, it is in the terests of the company to make or pay such gifts or commissions. 'We have a Secret Commissions Act on our statute book, yet articles of association containing a clause of that sort were forced upon the principal zinc producers of Australia. That is the sort of thing we are getting under the metal control. I know of t in mine after t in mine closing down because there has been no buyer for t in oxide. The smelters could not buy it , because there was no buyer for smelted t in . The only buyer for Australia was Elder, Smith, and Company, and they were buyers for the Inter-Allied Commission. We want to know if there is to be freedom in trade, or if we are to have a continuation of that sort of thing. I was given the name of one company which was compelled to close down owing to the impossibility of disposing of its products. Their shares were worth 21s., and now they are worth only 14s. As they could not get a buyer for their product, they had to dismiss all their hands. Are we to have a T in Producers Association forced on us as in the case of zinc? There is a Copper Producers Association as well. I like these associations, providing there is absolute .freedom, but the two biggest metal corporations in Australia were forced to join the Zinc Producers Association, to which they were compelled to hand over the absolute control of all their products, not for one or five, but for fifty years! The Broken Hill Proprietary Company, the Mount Lyell Company, and the Broken Hill Junction Company have to give the Zinc Producers Association the absolute right to make all their contracts and fix their prices for the next fifty years! I do not want any more of that sort of thing. That kind of administration is not good enough for me. We have had a good price for our wool, and the sale was a magnificent bargain for Australia; but I am not so satisfied with the administration as many other honourable members are. I have seen the efforts made to centralize, and a Mr Gregory. big effort is being made in that direction at the present time. I have been fighting this sort of thing for two years. At Geraldton we had £750,000 worth of in - wool last year and £1,000,000 worth this year, and we had an appraising centre there; but word has gone over that appraisement is not to continue there. I have been told in the West that this is because I have made myself so obnoxious in connection with the metal business'.",114
547,Mr LAIRD SMITH,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"The Wool Board is composed of independent men, apart from the Government.",115
548,Mr GREGORY,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"No ; they are all brokers,, and interested in the trade, except the honourable member for Hume (Mr Falkiner) and the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett). The Prime Minister urged the people to cooperate and organize. In Western Australia they organized and formed a cooperative association, with 5,000 members, most of them producers of sheep and wool. They asked for freedom to trade in wool, as they wanted their shareholders to send their wool to them, but the Central Wool Board said, "" No ; you shall not trade. Certain firms have the right from us, and only those firms are. to be allowed to trade in wool. """,115
549,Mr LYNCH,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,They have killed the small country wool-buyer.,115
550,Mr GREGORY,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"Why should he be killed? It is wrong and rotten. Only today Mr Angliss told me that people in the country cannot get a market for pelts, and,- in some places in the back country, are actually burning them.",115
551,Mr FENTON,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,That is quite true; yet they are wanted badly in France. The members of the French Mission made a special point of that when they were here.,115
552,Mr GREGORY,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"Ye t Mr Angliss tells me that 90 per cent, of sheepskinsand 80 per cent, of lambskins are unsaleable. The Central Board will not allow them to be exported, and will not purchase them.",115
553,Mr LAIRD SMITH,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"If the people are burning them,- is not that because there is no shipping available ?",115
554,Mr GREGORY,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"Why not let them find their own boats, if they can ? The war is over,- and the people in the Old Country and in America are getting freedom in the different markets. We want that freedom here, also. Some of the things that were done during the war were preposterous, and lent themselves to the favouring of the monopolist and the manipulator. The future of Australia depends on our pastoral and agricultural industries. In 1915-16 there were 12,484,000 acres under cultivation, hut the area next year was reduced to 11,552,000 acres, and last year to 9,698,000 acres, and I am afraid that it will be further reduced this year. This reduction in the area of cultivated land is due largely to scarcity of labour, but coupled with the reduction in yields, constitutes a grave danger. There has also been a decrease in our production of wool. In 1914, we produced 711,000,000 lbs. of wool in the grease; in 1915, 642,000,000 lbs.; in 1916, 550,000,000 lbs.; and in 1917, 547,000,000 lbs. There has also been a big reduction in the yield of gold, and notwithstanding the big increase in prices during the war, the value of our minerals in 1917 was hot greater than in pre-war,years. These facts show that something must be done to assist our industries to a greater degree than they have been assisted in the past. It is time that the Government made an announcement of its intentions regarding the coming wheat crop. I impress upon Ministers, too, the necessity when a guarantee is promised in connection with the wheat, for giving effect to it in its entirety. The Commonwealth does not give a guarantee wholly on its own, and when so much per bushel is guaranteed, the farmer, whose conditions are very hard, should not be kept out of his money longer than can be helped. a very difficult thing for him to carry on when he gets 3s. a bushel for his wheat today; another 3d. six months hence, and the promise of something more in the distant future. I know that there are difficulties in the way of winding up the affairs of the Pools, but the Government should endeavour to pay the full amount guaranteed as soon as ?>ossible after the wheat has been delivered ",115
555,Mr MASSYGREENE,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"The Government have .tried to do that, as well as their finances have permitted. [353]",116
556,Mr GREGORY,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I cannot agree with the honourable member, knowing the way in which money has been expended in other directions. We have, approximately, 167,000,000 bushels of wheat in Australia today. The debit against that amounts to about £11,628,000, so 1 that there are 167,000,000 bushels of wheat and flour in the control of the Pool at the present time worth approximately £40,000,000. Surely, with an asset like that the farmers could be paid the full amount guaranteed to them. The new harvest will shortly be garnered, and yet the amount guaranteed on the last crop has not been paid to the farmers. Honourable members do not' realise how badly the people in the back country are treated by the Postmaster-General. In one case, in which an application for a monthly mail service was made, the inspector informed the owners of holdings that they could get it if they paid £ 8 4s. a year for it . The other day I had a telegram regarding a service from Wyndham to Hall's Creek, which is out in the Never-Never country, about which the local people were told that they could not have a service unless they made good 50 per cent, or 60 per cent, of the estimated deficiency on it . It is the same with regard to telephone services. The Government should provide those who are developing the back. country with some of the conveniences of civilization.",116
557,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,A mail service is necessary to persons in the back country.,116
558,Mr GREGORY,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"Yes. I feel sure that the citymembers would be glad to give assistance to those in the It is back country, and would vote for the spending of £200,000 to enable the Postmaster-General to provide them with proper mean's of communication. Neither the Minister nor the Government sees that this is done, and it is no wonder that the people abuse the Government and Parliament. One has only to consider the action of. the Government in connection with the war-time profits tax to know that it is the man in the city who gets all the consideration. The poor fellow in the back country, who takes all the risks, gets little consideration, whereas the man who. lives on his wits, and has not the courage to put one penny into any venture, is not to be taxed I feel that we are coming to times of great financial stress. _ The note issue now exceeds £59,000,000, and. as part security for this, £10,000,000 in gold has been borrowed from the banks. Moreover, we owe the British Government £39,000,000 for the upkeep qf our soldiers, in addition to our ordinary public debt. Not only have we not saved for the upkeep of our troops, but like a careless spendthrift we have gone to the Old Country for money in her time of need. In New Zealand, on the other hand, there is a surplus of about £10,000,000 In the. last five years the value of the Dominion's exports exceeded that of her imports by £45,000,000. Then Canada, instead of' going cap in hand to the Old' Country for assistance, has been able to lend her help.",116
559,Mr MATHEWS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,But Canada has paid nothing for the upkeep of her troops.,117
560,Mr MASSYGREENE,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,I do not think that Canada has paid either for the equipment or for the upkeep of her troops.,117
561,Mr GREGORY,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"At any rate, Canada has not borrowed from the Old Country. On the contrary, she has supplied her with millions of pounds worth of munitions, and has lent her over £100,000,000. require an enormous sum for our repatriation work, and we ought to recognise the need for effort to. reduce our expenditure. The one desire of the Government is to get into recess, but it is for members to consider whether they will allow them _to do so, whether it is for the good of the country, the primary and. secondary producers, and of our soldiers that they should do so. There is now the question of our returning troops to be considered. I am one of those who' believe in short sessions for Parliament. I believe that 'better work can be done if Ministers havemore time to attend to their various Departments. But there are so many - important questions to be - dealt with just now, and. so many diffi'Ciilties to be encountered in connection with various-matters, that I consider Parliament should meet again in February or March, even for a short session, for the purpose of enabling members to express their views with regard to the conditions governing the return of our troops, and concerning repatriation matters. I am not content to let things d r if t as they are d r if t in g at the present time so far as repatriation is concerned. Mr MCWrxLiAMS - Has the honourable member noticed that one of the Repatriation Boards has resigned?",117
562,Mr GREGORY,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,I . was not aware of that. I have a great deal of f a it h in Senator Millen.; but for the past twelve months I have been urging from public platformsthat this w o rk ofrepatriation should be removed outsideo f political control altogether.,117
563,Mr LAIRD SMITH,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"Would "" you be in favour of supporting three commissioners, and. paying them big salaries ?",117
564,Mr GREGORY,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"J l maintain that the administration of the scheme itself should be removed from political control. Parliament could exercise .authority by means of the regulations, but the administration itself should be removed as far as possible from political"" influence. - Mr JOWETT - Does , the honourable member realise that what he is advocating, now is what he has; been complaining about in regard toother Boards ? ""We shall Mr GREGORY - The honourable member knows my objection with reference to the Boards referred to. In my opinion it is essential that. Parliament should be called together ""in the near future to deal with questions affecting repatriation and the re-building of our industries. It is essential also that there should be economy in public expenditure, in order to make ends meet, because we know the enormous demand that will be made for repatriation, and we should endeavour, to the best of our ability, to provide ample funds for the purpose of looking 'afterour returned soldiers.",117
565,Mr KELLY,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"Wentworth) [2.20 a.m.] While listening to the honourable member who has just concluded his remarks, I could have imagined that we were dis:cussing a no-confidence motion. I prefer to regard the' amendment by the. honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr-. Austin Chapman), in the terms rather than in the temper in which it waa submitted. The proposition is that the Committee should refer the Estimates back to the Government in order .that this'Committee might in some mysterious way obtain some guarantees of future economy. Honourable members have heard me on this subject before. I yield to no one in m y appreciation of the urgent need for economy in Australia, but I doubt if we could arrive at a more expensive way of achieving this result than by demanding, at this stage, that . a large number of clerks and other officers of the .Departments should be taken from their proper occupations and set to work to recast the Estimates, when all that is required is a guarantee that the Government will see that, so' far as possible, no money is wasted.",117
566,Mr LAIRD SMITH,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,The Treasurer has given us that guarantee.,118
567,Mr KELLY,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"Yes ; and we have the satisfaction of knowing that quite recently this Government has given proof of its - sincerity in the matter of retrenchment. It has met my views, or, at any rate, a. great portion of them, in connection with - expenditure on the Naval Bases. It has met my views for a long time-and in this matter I was amused to find today that the views of the self-constituted leader of the Economy party in this debate seemed to be directly at variance' wibh my own, and I believe with those of every other student of economy in this - chamber in connection with the Federal Capital-in regard to steadying down expenditure there until we are in a position to know where post-war conditions will leave the Constitution and the Government of Australia. Holding these views on this .matter, I cannot vote for the amendment; but if I might at ""this late hour venture to place my views before the Committee, I would be grateful for the attention of such honourable members, as are awake. We have heard a good deal about the cost of running - this country. The cost is not only the cost of the various governing bodies. In >a truly ideal State, the Government, by wise provisions, guarantees that every citizen .is equipped in health, in mind, and in opportunity for the battle of life, [353}- 2 and protected in the enjoyment of - the production that he helps to create. Anything that hampers a citizen in the exercise of these powers is a direct tax on his energies, and harmful to the community over which the Government presides. In Australia today, not only have we State and Federal taxation hampering development, but we have also conflicting author*-, ties as between the States and the Federal Governments. You may take any industry you like, and you will find that the management pays far less attention to the' taxes imposed on it than to the - various laws that govern it. Industrial restrictions, as a rule, take up half the time of the management. "" These conflicting regulations operate as a direct charge upon industry, and are actually a greater burden than Federal and State taxation combined. It is difficult to live under the interpretation of all these restrictions. We have heard on every side, and recently from our own Prime Minister in England (Mr Hughes), and others in authority ^here, that the best chance Australia has of meeting her war obligations lies in in creased production; and if we are to achieve this desirable result, we must aim at increased efficiency in government d-n both State and Federal spheres. I do not wish to stress the matter, but I - do ask the Government to remember that a Constitution and system of governmenS good enough for Australia in the piping times of peace, .and before the. war had made its ravages upon Australian .finance, and left its mark, probably for years to come on Australian industry through the loss of Australian producers through the war, must, under these altered circumstances, be changed. The Government must realise this. They must set aside the vested interests of .politicians, and apply themselves to a consideration of the real interests of the community. People say these changes are bound to come. The honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine) has said that people will insist upon these changes. The longer I live, the more I irealize how strong are the vested interests of politicians. The general public are careless about these things; but it . is to the. interest of politicians to protect; themselves all the time. No man, either in this or the State Parliaments, wishes to abolish himself. I believe I can go so far as to say that honourable members of this Parliament are not quite prepared to abolish other Parliaments for fear of providing competitors for their own seats; but if we are going to have economical administration in government for Australia in the future we the State Parliaments as sovereign powers with the right to create conflicting legislation. I urge this view upon the Govern-, ment, because I believe it is the only way by which the finances of the country can remain stable.",118
568,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,That means Uni fication.,119
569,Mr KELLY,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I do mean Unification. I ask the Government to look into the question of seeing that"" there is but one legislative authority' responsible for the welfare of the Australian people; one authority responsible for seeing that every citizen has a fair chance for the opportunities of life and for good health, so far as the Government can achieve it , to enjoy those opportunities; and one authority for the protection of the f r u it of his industry.

Mr Considine - What is your ruling on the point of order ?",119
580,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT, There is no point of order.,120
581,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,The r e is a point of order. The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN - I have ruled that I do not sustain it .,120
582,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,I wish to have your ruling on this point: The honourable member for Denison rose when the honourable member for Wentworth sat down. If you are going to give the call to an honourable member who resumed his seat while another honourable member was on his feet addressing you,120
583,Mr SINCLAIR,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,He sat down.,120
584,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"The member for Den'son was on his feet addressing you, sir, when you put the ameudment, which was not heard here. In view of that fact, I ask you to rule whether the amendment was properly put.",120
585,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I . have no intention of ruling on the abstract point. I ruled on the facts as they presented themselves to me, and declared the amendment lost. I intend to adhere to my decision. If the honourable member for Franklin is not satisfied with that decision, he must. take the course that is prescribed in such cases. The amendment was resolved in the negative, and I cannot go back upon that decision.",120
586,Mr LAIRD SMITH,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"Denison) [2.39 a . m . ] - I abstained from speaking upon two most important Bills which recently occupied our attention, namely, the Wartime Profits Bill aad the War Precautions Bill , in order that I might not be accused of absorbing too much time, because I was very desirous of speaking upon the Budget. Yesterday the honourable member for Franklin was very emphatic in the expression of his views. As both of us hail practically from the same place, I cannot register a silent vote on this important question. I am bound to explain my attitude towards the Government, seeing that I intend to stand by them, at any rate during this session, because I believe they are justified in claiming my support. To-day I listened very attentively to the criticism of several honourable members, and subsequently I heard the reply of the Acting Prime Minister. In my judgment, he made a most excellent explanation of the position takeu up by the Government. He displayed a great knowledge of the financial situation, and demonstrated that he was desirous of curtailing expenditure wherever it was possible to adopt that course without detriment to the Commonwealth. I have every confidence in the honourable gentleman, and I am of opinion that he also possesses the confidence of the great majority of the people of this country. We all know that he has experienced a remarkably trying time since he assumed the leadership of the Government, and every impartial critic must admit that he has exceeded all expectations by ' the way in which he has filled the office of honourable Acting Prime Minister. That being so, I think that he is entitled to a fair deal, and that is all he asks for. I have never known him attempt to dictate to any member of this party. He has had, on occasions, to listen to most trenchant criticism, but he has never exhibited any bitterness as a result of that criticism. I think the honourable member for Franklin will admit that, because he and I have consistently striven to obtain from the Acting Prime Minister assistance to the fruit-growers of Tasmania in the direction of finding markets for them-, securing shipping space, and helping them in the evaporation of their product. Only last year we received an advance of 75 per cent, on the evaporated apples that we were unable to ship. The other day I experienced'a good deal of pleasure when I heard a number of Tasmanians eulogize the Acting Prime Minister for what he had done in the interests of the primary producer. I cheered their eulogies and I believe that the honourable member for Franklin did likewise. The Government have done something during these strenuous times towards getting our products transported overseas. That being so, would it not be most unjust for me to assist in bringing about a change of Ministry, thus handing over the reins of government to the Leader of the Opposition ? But even if that object were accomplished, we should secure no stable Government at this critical time. How could a Treasurer from the other side of the Chamber obtain such a grip of the position in which we find ourselves today as would enable him effectively to deal with the financial problems which will confront us within the brief period that remains of the current session ? And by whom would he be supported? By the same gentlemen who would have put this Government out? How long would they support an incoming Government? Just as long as it suited them, of course. Therefore, I contend that I am right in the attitude which I am adopting. I shall now give the reasons why I am supporting the present Government; - and I have nothing to gain by stating my case. Indeed, I shall have to take the responsibility throughout my electorate, and, perhaps, I shall have the press of Denison against me. Nevertheless, I shall give my explanation so that it may be recorded full y in Hansard, and in the hope that my attitude will be appreciated by the people of my electorate. There has been a great increase in expenditure, I admit, but if we are running an enormous business, and its scope vastly expands, the capital expenditure must be increased accordingly. days the Acting Prime Minister (Mr . Watt) can scarcely find an hour in which to remain in this Chamber, and participate in and listen to the debates. The reason for that is because he is so busily engaged in duties outside of the Chamber. He is meeting deputations from all over Australia, which are being introduced by honourable members. Tasmanian members, for example, had recently been waiting daily to secure an interview with Mr W at t . a deputation to introduce regarding a matter of great importance, dealing with one of our primary products. The Acting Prime Minister wasmost courteous. He indicated that he had gone to a great amount of trouble in communicating with the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) in England, with the sole object of placing one of Australia's primary products on the English market. He demonstrated that he was doing all he could for us. ""Then, at the request of the Tasmanian Government, the Acting Prime Minister again received representatives of - f r growers, and heard their ideas, in the hope that he might be able to go further into the subject on Tasmania's behalf. If the small island State has taken up so much of the Acting Prime Minister's time, how much more do the interests of the bigger States demand his attention ?",120
587,Mr JOWETT,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,It all shows how goodnatured he is.,121
588,Mr LAIRD SMITH,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"It does. We are wearing him out, body and soul; and! then he has to listen to the most bittercriticism. An y one outside of Parliament might imagine that the Government were sitting down, doing nothing,, simply drawing their salaries, and letting, matters d r if t . . I cannot conscientiously criticise _ the Government, notwithstanding that that may mean something to m e in my constituency. The Government are doing splendid! work, and I am delighted that this present trouble . has apparently ended so> well. The amendment introduced by the honourable member for Eden-Moharc* (Mr Austin Chapman) was a most serious matter.",121
589,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,It was a most unsatisfactory decision which followed.,121
590,Mr LAIRD SMITH,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"It appears to> Nowa- have ended well, at any rate. There* seems to have been no great desire to» carry the amendment. I do not complain of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro having gone away tonight, because he is practically always in an indifferent state of health. That is why I refrain from criticising him, and from interjecting while he is speaking. But there are other honourable members who were interested in h i * amendment, and where are they toWe had night? They left the honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams) to> stay here alone. He, at least, has stuck to his guns. If the other honourable* members were sincere, why did not they remain with him? Are they out to do their best to put the Government in a. hole, apparently just to gain a little aggrandisement outside? What is the meaning of their attitude? The honourable member for Franklin has stood by his guns; and the honourable member for Perth (Mr Fowler) is present, but I cannot commit him, because I do not u it - know how he intended to vote had a> division been taken. But those other honourable members have gone away, and' they have compelled me to speak at tenminutes to 3 a.m., when I.would, otherwise, have been in a position to address-, the Committee much earlier in the debate, and thus would have gained, if not space in the press, then, at any rate, opportunity to have been reported. Here I am at this unearthly hour, while - they are in their beds. Obviously they have not considered the situation to serious enough for them to remain and record a vote. I cannot - course, that there were any other honorwhen able members in tins' business; but surely the honourable member for Eden-Monaro Franklin advanced. would not think of moving a vote of want of confidence if he had no prospects .following. As for the honourable member for Franklin, we have heard his remarks; ""June, and I can say nothing with regard to what he said.",121
591,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"The r e are not many honourable members' on this side of ""the House present now.",122

594,Mr LAIRD SMITH,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"rTh e honourable member for Franklin, in order to make good, his speech, referred to a matter which I certainly do not feel inclined to endorse; and I question very much if one particular argument which he advanced - could have been calculated to win votes England. from the Opposition benches. What the honourable member said was, in effect, detrimental to Australia. He cited the as war activities of another Dominion, The namely, Canada. I ask Honourable memis bers who may have been intending to in support hi m if they would care to endorse time. hie remarks derogatory of Australia. I am of opinion that Australia has done equally as well as Canada in this greatand war ; and I desire J;o put on record what Australia has achieved. already appear to be forgetting. sonally, I . f e l t very keenly the remarks the honourable member for Franklin, when he compared Canada with our vast glorious country. And the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr . Mathews), I feel sure, did not endorse - the comparison with Canada. I u fact, d r e w my attention to that comparison, the and what he then said has Induced me to counter the comparison with the particulars which I shall now place on record. I feel certain that the honourable member be for Melbourne Ports would not h&ve been too ready to support the amendment of say, of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro it was being buttressed by an argument such as the honourable member for I desire to record the following particulars concerning the of a Australian Imperial Force : Strength of the fighting force 192,445 (30th 1018), including men on duty at the Base, in training camps, and hospitals. Strength of fighting units is about 120,000; total embarkations (30th June, 1918), 321,040; total too of men returned (30th June, 1918), 70,460; total in camp in Australia (30th June, 1918), 7,550; total discharged (30th June, 1918), Is not that a great record for our country as It not only warrants and necessitates to a great expenditure, but it also demonstrates the amount of work which M in and their officers have had to undertake during the past four yeare. know who The particulars continue[Quorum Flying Units (despatched from Australia) - : 'Establishment.

In the course of of the debate upon the War-time Profits Tax Bill reference was made to the fact and that certain gentlemen were making £5,000 in one year in one industry, and, upon another line, which was only a side issue, they were making another £ 1 , 0 0 0 he -£6,00 0 in all. Y e t we are told that we should look upon officers of the Civil Service who are drawing £1,500 per annum as being in receipt of a princely salary. I wilbgive some figures now with regard to articles of uniformThe total number of articles of uniform, underclothing, and kit, issued to 30th June,- ' 1917, is 31,242,220. The following materials have been Khaki cloth, 4,280,000 yards; khaki cord, 2,020,000 yards; denim or drill, 0,014,000 yards; flannel, 5,200,000 yards. In addition, approximately 4,500,000 yards of flannel were issued to patriotic organizations, making 22,040,000 yards altogether issued by the Ordnance Department, or sufficient to reach from Melbourne to London. These particulars should demonstrate the necessity for large expenditure. Australia has risen to the occasion, and has served, the Empire faithfully and well. Her work has excited the admiration,' not only of Great .Britain and the other Dominions of the Empire, but of our Allies in the war. Since the outbreak of the war the Defence Department has shipped overseas 39.2S5 military horses, acquired at a cost of £788,810, o'r an average of £20 Is. 7d. per head.. In addition, the Commonwealth supplied 95,000 horses for the I mperial Government in India and France. The quality of the horses supplied may be gathered from the fact that two Light Horse Regiments trekked from 160 to 170' miles in thirteen days. The horses were ridden for fifteen hours, and were saddled up for twenty-five out of forty-eight hours. Of 900 horses only one knocked up, and all the rest finished fit and wellOwing to an expenditure of upwards of £750,000 between 1910 and 1913, the Commonwealth has been able to fully equip the Army sent overseas with small arms and field artillery. small arms were made in Australia, and the artillery was sent from Australia. Our' men were sent to the Front equipped as no troops were ever equipped before, and paid as no troops were ever paid before. All this is part of what the Commonwealth has done for the expenditure which has been incurred. It - is said that Canada has done everything, and has sent munitions of war to England as.well as troops. But Australia has done something, as I have shown from the records of the Defence Department. Mr Laird Smith.",122
595,Mr CONSIDINE,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,Is this an attack upon Canada or a defence of Australia?,123
596,Mr LAIRD SMITH,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"It is a defence of Australia. I am an Australian all the time. If the honourable member has been unable to understand what I have said, the fault is not mine. I remember going utilized:- with a man once to a meeting of a Shakspearian Society. This man said,, "" I cannot see anything in all this tommy rot,"" but that was not the' fault of Shakespeare. The Commonwealth Cordite Factory has supplied the propellant for the greater part of the small-arms ammunition used by the Australian Military Forces until their arrival in France.. It has supplied New Zealand also, and during the South-West African campaign we supplied the South African Forces.",123
597,Mr MAXWELL,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"What about the ""Gregory"" rifles?",123
598,Mr LAIRD SMITH,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I am' glad to have that interjection. I - expected that the-honourable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory) would to-night have played the same old tune on the same old' violin, but for some reason or other he did not do so. What are the facts about the rifles to ' which he has so often referred? I was in the Defence Department at the time, and I know something about the subject. We equipped our men who went abroad with rifles made in Australia. They took the very best rifles made here. We got a report from an independent officer in Egypt, not an Australian, but an English officer, who pronounced our rifles to be first class. There was a very great demand at one time for rifles with which to train our men in Australia, and, to meet The the demand, rifles of all kinds were collected. The 200 rifles sent to Western Australia were not all made in our Small Arms Factory. Some of those rifles were made in Great Britain, but it was never intended that they should be taken out of Australia. They were merely used for training purposes. The honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) severely criticised the expenditure of one branch of the Department of Home and Territories. One would think from 'what the honourable member said that the Meteorological .Branch is' useless to the Commonwealth. I have here a copy of a letter sent on behalf, of the Hobart Marine Board to the Minister controlling the Meteorological Branch, in which the writer saysI have the honour, by direction of the Board, to forward herewith copy of correspondence with the Meteorological Department, from which it will be seen that the supply of daily weather bulletins, maps, &c., is to be discontinued owing to no provision having been made to meet the extra cost of paper and printing. The Board trusts that the Government will see its way clear to reconsider the matter, and continue the supply of reports, which are of the greatest use to the shipping community, and are very extensively referred to. The Board's offices are situated on the and the reports are exhibited in a case outside, specially prepared for the purpose. The Board is of opinion that the, discontinuance of the reports .will cause great inconvenience to shipping agents and other interested persons, who are in the habit of consulting the reports and maps. That will show the value of this branch, which was so much criticised by the honourable member for Dampier. I say that if the officers of the Meteorological Branch are entitled to annual increments, they should get them. I have never been ahle to understand the contention that when the country is in a bad way financially, the civil servants should be called upon to make good the deficit. If they are serving the country well, why should their salaries be reduced ?",123
599,Mr FENTON,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,They should not be reduced any more than are the salaries of other persons.,124
600,Mr LAIRD SMITH,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,Decidedl y not; and I.shall never be a party to anything of the kind.,124
601,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"The country is snowed up. not insolvent yet. The Age showed the drought every year. other day that there is an increase of £3,000,000 in the deposits of the local Savings Banks.",124
602,Mr LAIRD SMITH,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"Not only is there an increase of £3,000,000 in the amount of deposits, but the number of depositors has been enormously increased. I was delighted to find that so large number of persons, took certificates for small amounts, and the number who invested in £ 1 0 bonds. This shows that the country is not yet insolvent, or even in a way, as some persons would have us Budget [17 DECEMBER, 1918.] (1918-19). 9531 lieve. What a mistake it is to let it go forth to the world that this country is on the verge of ruin, when we desire to attract peopleto our shores. Some of us Were of the opinion that the presence of our splendid men in Europe, and the splendid work they have done at the Front, would give Australia such an. advertisement that it would be difficult to find ships in which to transport the people who would be flocking to our shores after the war - But if people in the Old Country took up our leading newspapers and read therein the speech wharf, of the honourable member for - Franklin (Mr MCWilliamsK and learned from him that the people of Australia are taxed to a greater extent than are the people of any other part of the world ; that they are on the verge of starvation, and homeless and helpless, while the Government are spending money like water, it is not to be expected that they would desire to .come to this country. It is because of these deprecating statements that I am speaking as I am to-night. I have been in other parts of the world. I have walked through parts of France, Scotland, and Switzerland, and I have never seen a country like Australia-. I have never seen in any other country such land as is to be found at Colac, at Bungaree, at Mount Gambier, and on the north coast of New South Wales. How differently Americans and Canadians talk of their country when you meet them. The Canadians say that Canada is the finest country in the world, though for seven months in the year that Dominion is That is equivalent to a But in Australia, though there may be a drought in one part of the Commonwealth, there is a bountiful harvest in other parts. Why should honourable members, because they desire to save a little in public expenditure, belittle this country, or its a leaders, or the Acting Prime Minister? up war We have had honourable gentlemen longing also for the time to come when they would be able to discuss the Estimates - They have perused^them from end to end, and then bad the leader amongst them comes forward beand assumes-the responsibility of moving a vote of want of confidence in the ment, whilst the only item upon which he can place his finger as justifying his is a vote of £7,000 for a police force for this great country. We have the promise of the Acting Prime Minister that even that force will be gradually reduced. I was glad to find that the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Eenton) and the honourable member for Barrier (Mr. Considine) were careful not to indicate whether they would support the vote of want of confidence. Some comparison has been made between the debt of Canada and. Australia. But honourable members should be very careful about comparing the debt of Australia with that of any other country but that of New Zealand. Canada has very few Government railways. Most of her railways are privately owned, and so are '-her wharfs. Many public utilities which are administered with advantage by Governments here are not in the hands of the States in Canada. I could not understand why a wealthy Canadian who came to our island State of Tasmania, and in the beautiful climate - of .that State, is ' being restored to health, used always to vote for me, and even told the maids in his employ and others with whom he had influence to do the same. He said that the people of Australia are a great democratic people; and when I asked him why, he said, "" Y o u control transport, and when you do that you go a long way towards controlling the industry of your country."" I have seen the conditions in the two countries, and know what a difference there is. I said to him, "" I suppose you are . afraid of the - socialistic ideas of the Labour party?"" "" No,"" he replied, "" you can go only just so far as some country that has got bigger guns than you outside will allow you to go.""",124
603,Mr CONSIDINE,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,Was that before you left the Labour party?,125
604,Mr LAIRD SMITH,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I did not leave it ; I was pushed out. One section of that great party held a meeting down town, while we, who were not in. their confidence, remained here, and knew nothing about it. At - that meeting they found they had the numbers, and one gentleman was anxious to become Prime Minister of Australia. He thought he could Govern- become Prime Minister by moving the then - Prime Minister out of the chair. action He did not know that if the Prime Minister tendered his resignation it meant the resignation of the whole Ministry. That discovery came upon them like a bolt, from the blue. The Prjme Minister, whom they thought to put down, walked out, and we had the courage to follow him, believing in the principles that w<» enunciated then and have upheld ever since. Is the honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine), having regard to the things he says here and the policy hepreaches to his constituents, justified in. knuckling down under the Labour party, as he is doing now?",125
605,Mr CONSIDINE,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,Is . he knuckling down ?,125
606,Mr LAIRD SMITH,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"Of course. The> honourable member is a changed man since he came here. They have taught him. He reminds me of what one of the Socialists said the other day about members of. the Trades Hall when they came to interview the Acting Prime Minister. They went back satisfied, and the Socialist said the Acting Prime Minister.had mesmerized them. The people of Australiaknow what this party stands for. We have been on this side for eighteen, months, and not a stone in the temple of Labour has been touched. The man who opposed me at the last election said, "" If you put Laird Smith in again, he will not be there three months before the old age pension and invalid pension will be gone, and the maternity allowance wiped out."" We have been .here eighteen months in the most critical time Australia has ever had, and there has been no attempt by any member on this side to remove any of that legislation. A duty was going to be imposed on kerosene and tea, which the poor working man would have to pay. It has not been imposed, but some men have to pay 68 per cent, of their incomes in taxation in order that the poor'people's tea may remain duty free. The Minister for Repatriation (Senator Millen) some, time ago asked for suggestions from every honourable member. I took up an hour of his valuable time onone occasion, and found him most courteous and willing to listen, but this was the trouble: When I suggested some industry, he asked, "" How will it interfere with an industry already established here?"" He took into consideration the employees as well as the employers, and pointed out that men employed in estabCommonwealth, lished industries would be thrown out work. He Said that we could not profitably «stablish an industry to throw other men out of work, and that we must get new industries. That was the difficulty. Minister' today is awaiting suggestions from any honourable member who will vice pay. point out a new industry that can be successfully established. I am sure that Minister will take it on at once. Every Federation. man who returns is not going away into . the back-blocks. In Tasmania some of the finest land in the island has been chased. Instead of finding fault, let us bring down a better scheme than the Minister's, and prove to him that it better. If he will not adopt it , then can criticise. Two little nephews of recently pulled my watch to pieces. The father and I could not put it together again,.yet those little fellows could pull it to pieces. So, any one can pull , tem to pieces, but it is not so easy struct one. During the war it was greatest delight to stand outside the and Argus offices and listen to the, local Kitcheners who could win the war in twenty-four hours. Yet they remained here, like the honourable member for rier, and bitterly criticised.",125

Why send worn-out old man like me, when a big, robust man like the honourable member stays at home? We have heard a great deal about need for retrenchment, but I think the Treasurer has cut down the postal mates too much. Honourable members clamour for telephone communication, out the Postmaster-General cannot .it, although he can obtain the material now, because he has not the money; that is because the Treasurer desires curtail expenditure. We hear nothing of itin the papers, nor are we told that, for the first time in the history of the and probably in the hisof tory of any State, the Postal Department has been made to pay.

It paid the lowest wages of all the States, and I never heard of the telegraph, teleis phone, or postal branches paying once in we all that time. It is necessary to be very mine careful in cutting down the expenditure of a great Department like this, owing to the many industries, some of them highly technical, that will be affected. If the a sysEstimates of the Postal Department are to conreduced, a great deal of important work my , may be interrupted. The engineer may Age have a scheme providing for continuity of employment and a steady progress in laying down cables, but finds himself suddenly brought up with a round turn beBarcause there is no money available. The unfinished conduits have to be closed up, go and when the money is voted in another year, they have all to be opened up again and a staff has to be got together again. That means false economy all along the line. The Postmaster-General might introa system of purchasing stores in a big way. If the storekeeper sees a line of man good copper wire, he should be able to purchase the whole of it. The smaller a the quantity purchased, the greater the cost of the material. There are telephone services awaiting construction that will pay from the moment they are put up. the We should consider not only the direct return but the indirect value to the ComEstimonwealth. The telephonic system will play a great, part in the development of Australia; and it is false economy give to cut down the Estimates of this big Department to save a few pounds. and We had once a most able Treasurer, to who made a name for himself hy reducing his expenditure. referring to the late Sir George' Turner. He understood finances, but was acquainted with the technicalities of Postal Department, and reduced, the vote for that Department to such an tent that it became starved, and heavy expenditure was afterwards cessary to rebuild it .",126
610,Mr WEBSTER,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"It cost £2,250,000.",127
611,Mr LAIRD SMITH,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"That, of course, was false economy, which wecountry. must be careful to avoid. In my opinion a great saving can made by a proper organization of duction and distribution? The other day I traced a shipload of timber that came from Tasmania into a yard at South Melbourne. Some of it was taken to Northcote and unloaded from themade carts, but was afterwards reloaded and taken to Caulfield. That system tribution involves an enormous waste of labour and unnecessary expenditure - 'ing the recess. I believe in scientific organization, and the payment of good salaries to the proper type of man.

We must encourage in every way sible anything that will lead to increased production of wealth. must not be hampered. a man's income should be taken to meet the expenses of the Government. capital itself should not be levied In this matter I am totally at variance with the manifesto issued by Mr Stewart on behalf of Mr Scullin, the Labour candidate for Corangamite. He made the most ridiculous proposal. He said that he would make a levy on the capital, which, as a matter of fact, is employed i the production of wealth. financial schemes we must be careful to touch the capital of an industTy. shall then be on sound lines,, and be to insure the development of this great country in a manner that we - all desire. I want now to say a few words with reference to Papua. A gentleman well known to me- a man who was engaged in pioneering on the West Coast of Tasmania-is now similarly employed in I am Papua.

Anybody can criticise and pull down, but it is quite another posmatter to reconstruct. I think, however, that as other portions of Australia deOur producers velop the pastoralists will eventually give Only portion of more attention to the Northern Territory, where there is a vast area of wonderful The country awaiting occupation. When I , in upon. company with a few other members, visited the Territory, we travelled over areas which I suppose white men had not trodden before. We travelled down from the Katherine River to Willaroo Station, the manager of which informed us that it carried between 14,000 and 15,000 head n of cattle and 1,000 head of horses. But , In all our he said, if we went on to Delamere we not would find there 75.000 head of cattle, We and if we went still further down, we able would get on to what he called "" good "" areas, known as the Victoria Tableland, and the Lewis country, about 10,000 square miles in area, and carrying I forget how many cattle. We then returned to the Katherine River, and in one day we motored over 93 miles of beautiful land, only requiring water to enable it to be occupied. But this "" Do-Nothing Government,"" as they are called, are putting down bores at a distance of every 20 miles, and I believe are getting good water at 200 feet, so that this country may now be utilized for stock-raising. Afterwards we went in a south-easterly direction to the Maranboy T in Field, which we found was being developed in the most primitive manner. The men there were working with the hammer and drill,- and I found that the man at the winch, being of an inventive turn of mind, had loaded the windlass in order to make it easier to turn. But I have,been wondering ever since how the addition of 50 lbs. weight could have been of any assistance to him in winding up the stone, and have not yet been able to understand his - action. The manager of the battery, Mr Studdert, a man who had made a Tasmanian proposition averaging 0.6 of 1 per cent, of tin pay, gave evidence to the effect that the Maranboy proposition returned as high as 14 per cent. t in . I never saw stone like it . When it was placed on the dry table you could almost shake the t in from the stone. Properly equipped with air compressors, with the shaft properly sunk, and with an overhead railway to the battery to economize in working, that mine would be a wonderful proposition. There it is, waiting only proper development. We then went further down, to what is known as Bitter Springs, nowdescribed as Matananka, where the Government have .an experimental far m . We found there about 1,000 head of sheep. The ewes were lambing, and were doing splendidly under the care of natives. Ri?ht on through our t r ip we found splendid country, the development of which, I believe, can best be achieved by the construction of a railway. When the line reaches Newcastle waters, I have no doubt that the Queensland Government will want to draw it over the rich Barklay tablelands, which Mr Kidman is reported to have said is the richest country in Australia. If we want to attract people to that country, we should run the line to Camooweal, and then, in justice to South Australia, carry a line down through the Macdonnell Ranges. I wish to refer again to a matter connected with the Post and Telegraph Department. . I find that, in the case of certain automatic public telephone machines at present in use in Melbourne, it is necessary for the user to press his foot on a lever ; and nine out of ten people, as soon as they begin to talk seriously, forget all about the lever. They lift the foot, with the result that the lever rises, and the connection is broken, so that the user has to put-another 2d. in the slot before he can renew the conversation. These machines ought to be removed - at once. *",127

613,Mr LAIRD SMITH,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"It has been on trial for a long time. The value of our shale o il deposits should be carefully in quired into by the Minister. From the "" Will d O at "" column of the Bulletin, of 88th November of this year, I extract the following: ""Good Australian"":-The good news.comes from Reno, Nevada (United States of America). A new process of treating oil shales has been perfected, not merely invented, for extracting crude oil from shales containing 30 to 40 gallons of oil, 30 lbs. to 37 lbs. of paraffin wax, 27 lbs. of ammonia crystals, 7 gallons of coal tar, and 45,000 cubic feet of natural gas. From the spent shale, after treatrftcnt, the inventor claims he can make a shale brick to be used as a solid fuel in place of coal. This br.ick gives 60, per cent, more heat than coal. The total cost of the treatment of the shale to produce these fuel bricks is less than 3s. 4d. per ton. This opens up a pleasant vista for Capertee and Murrurundi, and several other shale deposits in New South Wales. . It is claimed there is enough oil shale in the State of Utah to supply fuel for the entire United States for centuries. I do hope that the Minister-for Home and Territories (Mr Glynn) will inquire into this important question, with a view to utilizing the splendid shale o i l deposits which exist in Tasmania. I have spoken at some length to-night, because I realise that I shall have a pretty hard row to hoe at the next election, owing to the misrepresentation to which. I have been subjected. Hence, I desired to explain the reasons underlying my attitude towards the Government. I shall support M in isters while they continue on present lines. I am satisfied that they are not prejudicially interfering with our industries, or preventing the development of 4his great Commonwealth.. They may have committed errors, but those errors are excusable, in view of the gigantic task which they have had to face. They have done much for Australia, and especially for Tasmania, by helping our fruit-growers to export their apples, their blue peas, &c.

618,Mr LYNCH,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"But I purpose dealing with the position as it presents itself to ine. I suppose that four-fifths of the actions which I am called upon to take as a representative of the people consist of bringing pressure to bear upon the Government to get money in my electorate, chiefly by way of increases to persons who, owing to the increased cost of living, find that they have a very difficult row to hoe._ That being the case, I have not the hide to come here and attack Ministers for failing to practice economy to a greater extent. The majority of honourable mem. bers are constantly asking the Government to increase expenditure. who have almost demanded concessions at the point of the bayonet to hold all sorts of threats over the Government, and to 'denounce their extravagance just prior to -.the passing of the millions of pounds contained, in the Estimates, seems to me to be a very ungracious act. stand behind the Ministry for five minutes if I did not feel that they are exercising all the caution that it is possible for them to exercise in regard to our public expenditure under the extraordinary conditions which exist today. But, unfortunately, owing to the way in which for generations past our country has teen handed over to foreign traders, we have not been able to face the financial trial which the war has imposed upon us in the way that other countries have faced it. Chiefly owing to that misfortune we are confronted with the necessity for resorting to expedients which injure our national pride. But I am not going to advocate the wholesale curtailment of salaries or the dismissal of public servants fifth honat the bidding of a few penny pilferers of the people's liberties throughout the length and breadth of this country. If we could afford to spend £1,250,000 weekly upon the war, surely we can continue to pay a living wage to our. public servants until we are able to adjust ourselves to our changed conditions, until we profit by our mistakes and choose a better path. Wholesale economy if put into immediate practice would only create fresh difficulties. I have been amongst the few who, from the very in ception of the war, raised their voices in an appeal for high sacrifice on the part of our people. I desired that those who owned more than £2,000 net should earmark at least 10 per cent, of it to assist in defraying our share of the cost of the war, and - of meeting the necessities of repatriation and the claims of our solexpended diers' dependants. But we proved in capable of such sacrifice, and today we are all trying to juggle our way through, whilst still subscribing to the doctrine of selfishness, which was really responsible for the war. The terms upon which international relationships will exist in the future will have much to do with the question of economy in our naval and military expenditure. If that monstrous For men doctrine to which the world so long subscribed-the doctrine of the balance of power-be again resurrected, and if the old race in armaments be renewed, I say unhesitatingly that the millions of men who have died in this war will have died in vain. The doctrine of selfishness will I would not again have triumphed, and a proud militarism, subscribing to no god but that of might, such as the militarism which has ju»t been humbled in the dust, - will again challenge the evolutionary progress of the wor'id. At any rate, that is my conception of the position. We have been told that the Government, by some miraculous power, are to do something which none of us has told them how to do. They are to reduce our expenditure by tens ofmillions of pounds, and at the same time are not to touch , any section of the community, but are bo lend a willing ear to the ever increasing demand for fresh expenditure throughout the various Departments. Whilst I have the fullest sympathy with every section of the community which is willing to work, either with head or hand - and I regard all such persons as workers, no matteT what may be their station, in life- I recognise that we have to give some hostages to sincerity by showing that we are capable of self-sacrifice, and of making the concessions which we so loudly claim for others. ' I have endeavoured, even at the risk of being misunderstood, to urge the farmers of this country not to listen to blind guides, but to realise the position in which we are placed. If every honourable .member quitted this House tomorrow, I suppose that I would be the only one who would go back to the actual work of wheat-growing, in which I have been engaged for the past twenty-nine years. .But, notwithstanding much that has been done contrary to the interests of the genuine farmers of Australia, I affirm that, because of the broad principles that were laid down to assist us during the war period, we have been saved from absolute extinction. In addition, the values of our properties have been maintained, notwithstanding that, in regard to details of administration, much has been faulty, imperfect, and extravagant. Concerning the Wheat Pool, I desire to make a few observations. It was first claimed that the originator of the pooling idea was the Victorian Minister of Agriculture (Mr. Hagelthorn). Later we were assured that the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) was its author. Now I claim to have been a very close student of this matter. I was in the House when the idea was first promulgated, and I am sure that if the Leader of the Opposition were present he would confirm my statement that its real authorwas a gentleman from whom I differ upon, many matters- I refer to the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Holman, Honourable members will recollect thatwhen the drought of 1914 was upon us, and it was clear that Australia was notgoing to produce sufficient wheat to feed her people-muc h less to provide seed for the next harvest- Mr Holman put forth one of the most statesman-like ideas ever launched. And, strange to say, hehas been more cordially detested on account of that very action than in regard: to anything else he has done throughout his career. He realized that New South Wales had sufficient wheat, at any rate, to feed the people of that State, but that the other States had not sufficient for their needs. He vainly strove to get the other States to engage in a co-operative system by which Argentine wheat could have been purchased for Australia to make up the 10,000,000or 12,000,000 bushels of which we were short. At that time enemy raiders were in the Pacific. It was questionable whether the squadron of German, vessels might not cut us off from our food supplies, and immediate action was necessary. Mr Holman, in his famous telegram of 18th October, 1914, asked the other wheat-growing States to join in at co-operative system-to purchase necessary wheat supplies at once, so as to makeup the quantity required in the Commonwealth. As a member of this House, in company with the then honourable  consulted some of the members of the Labour Government of the day, and we asked them to take that action which the wheat-growing States had refused to take. About November, 1914, we asked the Federal Government to purchase at least 10,000,000 bushels, and to land it in theports of Australia. The then Minister for Customs (Mr Tudor) assured usthat the wheat could be landed in Australian ports for 5s. 3d. a bushel. Therewould be no difficulty about that, if the Commonwealth Government had the constitutional power. .There was no War Precautions Act in those days, and the then Attorney-General (Mr Hughes) said the Commonwealth Government had not the power to distribute one grain of wheat throughout the country. the opportunity to perform a statesmanlike act was lost to the Commonwealth. I regret the stunted nature of the powers of the Commonwealth Constitution, deprived all Australia of the great benefit which would then have been Some of the States had to purchase huge quantities of wheat at tremendous Mr Holman caused his Wheat tion Act to be introduced-an never would have been put on the statute book had all the wheat-growing co-operated as he had desired. I shall not discuss the merits of that Act, but at that particular time more than half the wheat growers even of New South Wales were absolutely without wheat, even for bread, to say nothing of seed. quently, an effort was made, under the Acquisition Act, which, however it may have hit individual mers, yet wholly conserved terests of the consumers and largely' the interests of the producers.. was one of those farmers who parted with a certain quantity of our wheat for 5s. a bushel, and we thought it hard that in Victoria the few men who had wheat should be able to sell it for 7s. or 8s. a bushel.' However, the situation had the effect of quite a number of farmers putting in infinitely more wheat in 1915-16 than they had intended, for the reason that they were allowed to retain any proportion of the crop, which they had indicated, for seed. It is not known that the Federal Government of the day, when passing the Freight Arrangements Act, did not intend further than to supply shipping to the firms which < had hitherto wheat. The pooling was only decided upon' when the said firms, after ence, announced their intention to do no buying of wheat even after shipping had been provided, until such wheat was subject of sale contract overseas. now they were wise in that decision because of the wholesale commandeering of shipping secured under the. Act and the ever-increasing uncertainty with regard to oversea markets ""and freight. leave matters in that' hopeless meant death to us farmers. Mr Lynch. The pooling system was introduced, Thus, and a charge was lodged against it that when the price was altered to allow the Australian consumer to get wheat for 4s. 9d. a bushel, it meant that the consumer which was eating bread which was not wholly paid for. We were told that Australian conferred. wheat was worth 6s. or 7s. a bushel. But the position is this, with regard to the rates. three pools: Let us take the selling value Acquisi- of the certificates today, and take the Act which sums already advanced to us under the three pools-sum s which, so far as the States net return to the farmer is concerned, vary according to distance from port. I ask honourable members to study the case of a man who, in my own instance, was 250 miles from port. We have received 4s. 2 | d . a bushel at railway siding for the Conse- 1915-16 pool. We have received 3s. 3d. a bushel, both upon the 1916-17 and the much 1917-18 pool, for f.a.q. wheat. But, far- taking the selling value of certhe in- tificates, and . adding it to the sum which we have already received, it means I that the 1915-16 wheat will pan out at 4s. 3d. a bushel, the 1916-17 wheat at 3s. 6d., and the 1917-18 wheat at 4s.. We have sold various quantities, I believe, up to 7s. a bushel in small markets which have been tapped by the Australian Wheat Board. Y e t a close examination will show that as to the Australian consumer who paid - cash in advance, through the miller, for the wheat consumed, his quota bore no interest. And for that portion received by the millers generally the ordinary 3£d. per bushel paid to outside handling agents Was not paid to the millers. They received l j d . a bushel. to go Therefore, the saving in interest and reconditioning charges, togetherwith the bought our huge losses arising out of reconditioning, did not pertain to that portion safely confer- conserved in millers' sheds - . The net result will go to show that the Australian consumer has been infinitely the best customer which the Pools and the farIt is clear mers have had up to date. We should remember, too, that the Australian consumer controls the majority of members of every Parliament; and, consequently, the consumer could have prevented the But to system of guarantees from operating. condition And while I do not' admit that we make money as wheat-growers under these guar- antees, yet they assure for us. that there shall be no actual monetary loss; andvery important point-the value of our lauded property is being conserved. An outcry was raised against what really a fine idea of the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes)-to repeat his master-stroke of policy when he sold 3,000,000 tons Australian wheat, and - got the money without delivering a grain of it . cry was uttered by false guides of the farmers who had sought, for reasons chiefly of a business nature, to antagonize the Australian farmer against the Aushad tralian Wheat Board and the pooling tem. Those people know perfectly that the Australian farmer is a very busy man, and has not the opportunity to learn the inner workings of huge business cerns. It is a great reflection on Australian Wheat Board and the Pools that they have not taken the farmer more into their confidence - There, would have was not the case in Victoria. been a much smoother working of the whole scheme had - that been the case. The real grievances under which farmers have suffered have not been voiced these so-called friends of the farmers all. My sympathy goes out to the farmer owing to the uncertainty of the future minds of the farmers. so far as the Australian wheat market is scrip, in many instances-afte r concerned, and because of the doubt about ships materializing to take away - for a few pence. our grain and leave us a profitable price. Among the real grievances of the farmer which have never been uttered there is, £ 7 5 . first, the disastrous system of scrip-dealthe half-crown advance. ' ing which has been allowed to obtrude itself, and which could have been prea vented had conoerted action been taken to secure the consideration which this Parliament could have given to the subat ject. T pt-rsouaHy endeavoured to bring about means by which.security could have been afforded and robbery prevented. That - was when I interviewed the then Treasurer, the late Lord Forrest. I w give an instance of how the robbery operated; and it will also explain extent how the suspicion developed, garding which the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt ) so bitterly complained, in it was being constantly exhibited towards the Government in their handling of the whole matter. This attitude was part the stock-in-trade of speculators through the country, when once freedom to deal in wheat scrip was permitted. They a made it their business to belittle the efforts of the Wheat Pool, and to predict disaster. People of this character had a was wondrousfield to operate upon because, unfortunately, the wheat-growers had met with a tremendous reverse in 1914. Then of when the 1915-16 crop, came along, and a 2s. 6d. advance was made-which ' the That Wheat Pool alone was able to grant-that amount was not sufficient to cover the expenses of two seasons. Especially hard was the case of small wheat-growers who all their eggs in one basket-me n who syswere not in a position, not having well land enough, to go in for mixed .farming. And the lot of the unfortunate share-farmer, who grows over one-third of conthe wheat produced in New South Wales, the was doubly hard. The army of speculators had the rein held pretty tightly upon them for a while in New South Wales, but that They secured lists containing the names of every man holding wheat in the pool, and, profiting by the bitterness which had been by evoked in New South Wales over the at Wheat Acquisition Act, they planted the germs of discontent and suspicion in the They bought the half-crown had been paid upon it I will cite the case of a poor man who had wheat in the pool, which, at 6d. a bushel, was worth He had received upon that wheat Then, being pressed for money, he gladly accepted 6d. bushel, and got r i d of his scrip. That wheat has already been paid for up to 4s. 2£d. a bushel, and will probably pan out 4s. 3d. This man parted with the payable portion of his crop, and about £ 1 5 0 was taken out of his pocket for the benefit of one or more speculators who gambled in his scrip. I pointed out to the late ill Lord Forrest that if the Commonwealth Government made available to the Chairto some man of the Wheat Pool in each State reevery three or - four months, a sum of - about £500,000, to be advanced to needy that growers at a rate of 8 or 10 per cent - a high rate being necessary to drive away "" s h a r k s "" who could finance themselves of. on their own land values-in such in stances as I have quoted, farmers would thus be able to save themselves from huge loss and robbery by an expenditure of £ 8 or £ 1 0 in interest, and even at these high rates would be saved from, such parasites as the speculator who obtained a poor farmer's crop profit of £ 1 5 0 . But these common-sense proposals not accepted, and there was one voice raised' amongst the alleged farmers', friends in their support. have depended for the last thirty years more upon wheat-growing than upon anything else for a living.. I have made a close study of it , and I realized two years ago, when travelling in New South Wales with the Rural Industries Royal Commission, that the position of the Australian wheat-grower would 'be a eery precarious one at the close of the war. I have therefore advocated that every effort should be made to enable the unfortunate .share-farmers, who are now on the rocks, to take up mixed farming. They have received no aid whatever from the so-called friends of the farmer. I heard - an honourable member last night depicting the fearful condition of the wheat industry of Australia at the present time. It is true that it is in a bad condition, but the reasons given by the honourable member were not quite correct. The area under wheat has diminished, but why has it diminished? One solid reason for it is that the majority of those growing wheat who were in a position to turn their' lands to a more profitable use have engaged in the productiono f meat and wool. are the practical men, who realized the uncertainty of the future with regard to wheat and the shipping facilities for its transport to the overseas market. many instances the unfortunate sharefarmers have been turned adrift, and the plants which they have spent eight and ten years of their lives in putting together, and which represented their only assets, have had to be disposed of at a sacrifice. Horses that were worth from £ 3 0 to .£40 each can now be bought for from £ 8 to £ 1 0 , and their machinery is worth next to nothing. These are the men who are to be pitied, and no provision has been made to enable them to take up mixed farming. I want to say that the sooner the people realise how dangerous is the position :in regard to wheat-growing, the better. We have to hope that we shall be able to keep our millions of tons of - Mr Lynch. wheat fit for human consumption u n t i l ships materialize from ' some place or another by which we can transport it overseas. "" But the outlook is not too brilliant were for us in view of the fact that America not has a coming crop of from 700,000,000 to 900,000,000 bushels, and a crop of I 2,500,000 bushels of corn. It does not seem as if any special facilities are likely to be afforded for shipping wheat from Australia to enable us to compete in the markets of the world with the highly guaranteed crops grown in America and elsewhere. Whilst our position is not'hopeless, it is sufficiently grave to excite in us the greatest concern. But, knowing the difficulties with which they are faced to finance the thousand and one ventures that are upon their hands, I decline to ask the Australian Government to guarantee to the wheat-farmers the impossible prices for their wheat which have been demanded, and to pay them on the spot. I realise that it would be absurd to ask the Government to give a guarantee in con-, nexion with OUT wheat which might u l t i mately land this community in losses amounting to tens of millions sterling. If the wheat-growers get justice and fair play, and are protected from the "" sharks "" who, without protest, have been all-owed to prey upon them since the in ception of the Wheat Pool, their position These . may-not be so bad. They should be given a larger say as to the practical methods by which their wheat is to be conserved. . They should be 'taken full y into the confiIn dence of the Government, and if they are given a fair say in the practical administration of the Wheat Pool, they will be perfectly satisfied. If the farmers are protected in those things which are necessary for their production, they will receive much of the assistance of which they are in need. Eancy a small settler having to pay today 30s. per cwt. for rock salt for his few sheep when, a few years ago, this article could be obtained for from 6s. to 7s. per cwt. The cost of everything else that the small farmer requires has in creased in like proportion. I have dealt somewhat at length with the question of wheat, because I realise ' that there is a grave misconception concerning it in the minds of the people. Men who ought to know better are trying to poison the minds of the farmers. I have no objection to farmers having a party of their own in Parliament or elsewhere if they please. Owing to the unbridled desire to mop up the people's birth right throughout the length and breadth of Australia, the genuine settlers have been relegated to out-of-the-way places, and have had to carry on their work under such conditions that permanent prosperity has been denied them. Is it any wonder that we should find opposition to systems and principles the adoption of which has robbed the people of their 'birth right? If we are going to weather the financial storm, we must develop truer and better systems of production and distiibution. This is essential if we are to make this empty continent the home of freedom for tens of millions of people that it ought to be. If we are not going to make of this'country a cockpit in which we shall fight in sections, to the detriment of true advancement, then sections of the community must realise that it is necessary to sacrifice a part at least of their privileges and the recognition of the rights of others must be maintained. I feel that the very necessities of our position begotten of the war will work the miracle, and will lead us from the path of selfishness which we have so long pursued. I am not a slavish follower of the Government. I differ probably from honourable members on both sides in my ideas as to how production may be best assisted and scientific distribution effected. I may differ from a majority even jsf the people who have sent me to this Parliament, but T shall not toady to them or to any one else by denying the opinions. I hold. I feel that the Government have made many mistakes, and that the interests of sections of the comnranity have been injured by the meddlesome officialdom that has 'been permitted to control important affairs. The Government can look forward to bitter hostility in consequence. I agree that they have made many mistakes; buf I say that, with all their faults, no abler men can be found amongst the public men of Australia today to carry on the affairs of this country. Whilst I think so, and.whilst I deem'them worthy of my support, they shall have it . I do not think it is fair that men who were elected to support the Government at a crucial time should cut the thread of their allegiance at any moment they please. If members of the party on the Government side feel that they are wrong, there is a way in-which they can express themselves. They can maintain their promises in a wav which will result, not in injury to the Government or to the country, but to the profit of both. I believe that the members of the Governmentare not anxious to retain the tremendous special powers thrust upon them by reason of the exigencies begotten of the war. They are, I have no doubt, as anxious to be rid of those powers as we are anxious that they should be divested of them; but I differ from those who think that Governmental interference is not essential to production or distribution. We need to .evolve a system that will be truly scientific and which will induce every man and woman in this country to give the best that is in them to assist in the great work of establishing just systems of production and distribution that has been thrust upon this community.",129
619,Mr FOWLER,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"Perth) [4.26 a.m.] I am quite prepared to admit that criticism of the Estimates, after an all-night sitting, is not likely to be productive of very much improvement; but that is not my fault. It - is a necessity thrust upon me by the action of the Government, and I do not propose to set aside the responsibility I owe to the country and to my constituents on that acount. I remember that we were promised that this would be a financial session. We have dawdled through it for the greater part of the time in considering measures which have had nothing whatever to do with finance. Some of them have been of no great con r sequence to the country, and one or two of them have been, in my opinion, prejudicial to its interests. Now, almost at the last minute, we are expected to tackle these Estimates in the spirit in which they ought to be dealt with. There is no doubt whatever that the present position is one of grave concern.. There has never been a time in the history of the Commonwealth when a more careful and anxious investigation general financial position has been so necessary. I regret, therefore, the somewhat airy wav in which the Acting Minister thrust aside his responsibility in the speech which he made. cognise the anomalous and position which the honourable occupies as the acting head of the Government at the present time. nise thab circumstances have thrust him a tremendous amount of work that should never be identified with his Department. I recognize, also, that a great deal of the responsibility he is shouldering at the present time in relation to our finances has come to him by way of a damnosa hereditas, favourite expression of a past and eloquent Treasurer and that, therefore, he cannot be held responsible for the remarkable amount of expenditure that we are asked to put through our hands at the present But when all that has been said, I confess to a feeling of that these large Estimates thrown at us in this fashion, and that apparently we are expected aside our duty as representatives the people, and allow another year to drift away in the somewhat fashion that - has characterized the last twelve months. The people of Australia are at last face to face with the responsibilities of nationhood. Some observer of human affairs has said that no people has ever realized its collective duty and responsibilities except under the pressure of warfare. „ Then pressure has on them these responsibilities which we - are now face for the first time in tory. Until the outbreak of war, Australia had perhaps the most enviable position of any country in the world. It had a vast territory sparsely populated entirely safe under the flag of the Empire from any danger of aggression. people of the Commonwealth opportunities of progress and prosperity under-that flag which, perhaps, had never been enjoved by any other nation at any time in the world's history. doubted that we took advantage to some Mr Fowler. extent of those opportunities; but it may also be conceded that our circumstances of our were too easy and favourable for us. It is not always a good thing for a youth to have been born with a silver spoon in his Prime mouth, and it is not always good for a community to have the easy conditions I fully re- and the absence of responsibility which it uncomfortable - was the good fortune in one sense, and gentleman Ihe bad fortune in another, which Australia enjoyed until the war broke out. That I recog- war has brought us face to face with upon many grim realities. The agony resulting from it has penetrated into hundreds of of thousands of lipmes throughout the Commonwealth. I sincerely hope that the effect of these dreadful four years will be to deepen and sober our national l if e ; for there is no doubt that it is one of the to use a misfortunes of Australia that we have able taken our duties and responsibilities of Victoria, somewhat too lightly in the past. We have also drifted, by reason of the war, right into the currents of international issues. We can no longer live an isolated time. and entirely indifferent existence to what is going on in the world around us. disappointment That Elysian state of affairs has come to have been an end with the war, and we are now in volved in large, difficult, and delicate proto put blems, not of our making, and not to our of liking, but which, nevertheless, require to be handled by our public men with aimless courage and ability, and to be watched by the people with intelligence and patriotism, if the. country is to be saved from dangers that undoubtedly threaten it even now, and are likely to become more imminent in the near future. It will be necessary for Australia, in view of these altered circumstances, to throw aside narbrought row sectional views such as have characwith terized many of our people in the past.. to face These will have to give place to broader our his- and more national convictions of the duty we owe to each other, to our country, and to our Empire. but Party interests have in the past too often been mistaken for those of the The State. We cannot afford to do this any enjoyed longer, - and, above all, our public men must speak out earnestly and fearlessly on matters which, if allowed to d r if t a3 they have done, will involve the people of It is un- Australia in very grave difficulties. There is one stern fact from which there can be no possible escape. We cannot avoid it if we would. be before us morning, noon, and night, summer and winter,, year in and year out. It is the load of debt incurred by Australia on account of the war - It will amount to £350,000,000 before we have squared everything up, and means an annual charge upon the country of more than the total net revenue of Australia in pre-war years. We shall have at least to double our net revenue in order to meet these obligations; and to a community so small as ours, that is a very serious situation to face. It is not, however, a hopeless task, and I do not want to appear unduly pessimistic-about the situation. There would be no reason whatever to worry about it if the people were seized of the facts, and if the Government showed any indication of tackling the responsibilities T have just indicated. I do not want to attack the Government on this matter. I wish it to be understood that my criticism is intended to direct them towards those steps that they ought to take, but that they have not taken, and do not appear likely to take, so far as I am able to view the situation. One has only to look back on the last four years to realise that Parliament has failed miserably in the duty put upon it by the Constitution and the people, and that various Ministers have taken advantage of that condition of affairs to deal with their duties and responsibilities in a manner that is not creditable either to them or to us. I am afraid this state of affairs will continue so long Government remains the master, and not the servant, of Parliament. We have seen enough during these few years to justify a determined attempt by Parliament to revert to the true conditions of constitutional government, - and to insist that the Government shall not rule, but shall serve, Parliament. If the Government refuse to accept that situation, they should make way for those who are prepared to do the right thing. In matters of administration, where we look to the Government for a lead to the country, we find, for the most part, a record of deplorable failure. The condemnatory reports on the administration of the , Defence 'and Navy Departments are of a character that we cannot afford It will to regard with indifference. To me it is a matter of very grave regret that Parliament has not asserted itself as it should, and, in the face of those reports, have demanded that a change should be made in regard to the administration of those Departments. For the last twelve months recruiting was an absolute farce and makebelieve. There was nothing but waste in the expenditure of public money with very insignificant results. During the last nine months of the war, the so-called recruiting movement cost the country no less than £316,000. And when one recalls the voluntary ballot one is almost ashamed to belong to a Parliament that tolerated. such a thing. When we turn to the Naval Department we do not.find a much more satisfactory state of affairs. It is true that we have curtailed expenditure temporarily on the Naval Bases, where so much money has been wasted already, and in connection with which there has been so much mismanagement; but it is singular that the curtailment of expenditure is in relation to those Bases which our adviser at the outset indicated as being the most important of all, and that work is being carried on at the third Naval Base, the most insignificant of the three, and where extravagance and waste has been most apparent. I have endeavoured for some time to find out the reason for the extraordinary selection of that little shallow backwater known as Hann's Inlet, in as the Westernport, as a Naval Base. I heard ihe Minister for Defence put the responsibility on to Admiral Henderson, but Admiral Henderson had no more to do with it than I had. It seems to have been selected by some subsequent authority following upon Admiral Henderson's general recommendations, and I repeat that the best thing that could be done now is to leave it severely alone, because we shall only be throwing good money after bad if we continue with the work there. Before Hann's Inlet is made suitable for the functions which it is intended to perform, a much greater sum of money must be thrown into it than has been in dicated so far. At any ra£e, I would remind the Government that their duty in connection with these Naval Bases is to carry out work on the more important of them and to leave the minor Bases se-. verely alone' for the present. Both in the public press and in the House of late there has been a good deal of criticism of repatriation. The Minister in charge (Senator Millen) is an able man, and he works very hard; but, unfortunately, his Department is smothered in red tape. That is always the trouble with officialdom, and I am one of those who believe that repatriation can be carried out more cheaply and efficiently by two or three . business men dissociated entirely from political activity and interference. They should be given practically a free hand, limited, of course, by the general supervision of the Government. Until something of that kind is done, I think there will be general dissatisfaction and friction, with consequent waste and unnecessary expenditure. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt ) has challenged those members who have attempted t'he somewhat unpleasant duty of criticising the Government in regard to financial matters to show where, in these Estimates, any. very considerable sum can be saved. I am prepared to admit that perhaps there is no particular item of any great magnitude that could be struck out; but the difficulty is not so much that there is any huge hole in the ship as that there is a large number of little leaks through which waste is occurring. would have been very glad if the Government had taken the hint given by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro and had withdrawn the Estimates in order to discover some of the leaks and give a lead to the country in the matter of economy. As a rule, when a business is going back, the very first thing the responsible heads to do is to look around and see where the little leaks are, and there generally they find the real cause of all the trouble. That is undoubtedly our position as a Commonwealth today. Here, there, and everywhere throughout the Estimates are indications of leakages which, in the aggrestand, gate, amount to a very considerable sum indeed; but more importantthan"" the actual loss of money is the moral effect, because, as I have said, the Government ought to give a lead to the people in economical administration. Mr Fowler. Ministers appear to ignore this phase of their duty altogether. When we look around and see the numerous Boards and Committees that have been appointed everywhere, the attitude of the Government appears to be the very abnegation of Ministerial responsibility. Some of those Boards are, of course, necessary; but little justification can be shown for many others, and there seems to be an 'absolute indifference on the part of Ministers as to the need for-economy and efficiency in administration. There is a large fleet of Ministerial motor cars. I am quite sure that the country could be just as well served if we dispensed with the Government' motor garage, with its chauffeurs and motor cars, and engaged cars from the ordinary commercial garages when Ministers really require such conveyances. Some seven years ago I called attention to ' the commencement of this state of a f fair s - I might, indeed, refer to it as a scandaland when, of course, the position was not so serious as it is at the present time. When we have reports of these cars being discovered in circumstances that undoubtedly indicate that they are not being used on the work of the country, it is about time the Government took the matter into serious consideration. The appointment of publicity officers I is another innovation for which there is no justification whatever. When I asked a question concerning the nature of their work, I was given to understand that they were engaged in the' preparation of matter for publication in the press. But we know well enough that newspaper men, if they are given any chance whatever, are glad enough to publish all matters of public interest, and will lick any statement into shape for the public just as well as any publicity officer can do it . Representatives of the newspapers are in the Public Departments all the time looking for information which, we underthese publicity officers are supposed to be handing out. Mr MATHEWS:-But the newspapers colour, it as they desire, and do not give the truth. ' Mr FOWLER - The newspapers will not colour statements given by heads of Departments or Ministers in a particular form.",134
620,Mr MATHEWS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,They do it every day.,138

I have a higher regard for the newsapers and the gentlemen employed on the press than to agree with that statement. had a good deal to do with the press in one way or another during my political career, and I must say that I have never found pressmen outraging the canons of honour and public decency. trouble is this: There appears to be the necessity, in the opinion of M i nisters nowadays, to advertise not the work they are doing, but themselves. And so publicity officers have been taken from their previous positions on newspapers to serve, not the interests of the public, but . to "" b o o s t "" the M in isters under whom they are working.",138
622,Mr FENTON,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,How many officers have been appointed ?,138
623,Mr FOWLE R,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"We know that the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) took one of these gentlemen when he went to London, and we know, also, that he appointed another to fill the position vacated by the first one when he left Australia. How many more there are I do not know, but that there should be a n y I entirely deny. I have in my hand an indication of the work done by these officers. It is headed "" P r i m e Minister's Activities. Abroad,"" and it purports to give information as to what Mr Hughes has been doing since he left Australia. I do not want to read it right through, but I shall give one or two extracts dealing with the alleged activities of the right honourable gentleman. The report states- - 1 When Mr Hughes left Australia he was prepared to inquire into a very large number of matters . . . the possibility of selling great quantities of Australian products are now occupying his attention. The grammar is not very good, bu t the meaning will be apprehended. The statement continuesAmong other things Mr Hughes is inquiring into the possibility of selling further supplies of Australian butter, and also of selling leather. ' Mr Hughes is also dealing with the question of shipping control as it affects Australia. In this connection he is now inquiring into the possibility of alleviating the 'serious position which faces the Australian trade in South Africa. The next statement isThe Prime Minister is also giving his attention, to the prospect of selling further quantities of Australian wheat abroad, and to the possibilities of lifting the wheat that has been purchased by the Imperial authorities, and is at present awaiting shipment from Australia. I have .At the same time he is inquiring into the possibility of selling Australian metals, including copper and zinc, and also the rarer metals, such as molybdenite and-tungsten. 'OtheT negotiations are pending. This list of activities proceedsThe real The Prime Minister is also making inquiries into the supply of material for shipbuilding in Australia from America and Great Britaininquiries rendered necessary by the delay that is taking place in the construction of ships here owing to the slow arrival of certain material from abroad. He is also looking into shipbuilduig matters generally, and into the build-ing of concrete vessels in Britain, .having already made some inquiries upon the latter point in America on his way to Great Britain. He is also investigating the issue of export licences publicity in both the United States and Great Britain, in' view of the fact that large quantities of goods and material are at present held up abroad which are urgently required by manufacturers and traders in the Commonwealth; while the possibility of obtainingmachinery, yarns, and other requisites for the expansion of the woollen trade in Australia is another task upon which he is engaged, in addition to questions relating to the general-organization of trade, industry, and commerce in the Empire, and the representation of the Commonwealth in the United States That is a list of activities which it is quite impossible for any one man to undertake, and, in view of the fact that the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) was busily occupied in work of another kind during most of the time, one may take this as an instance of what a publicity officer can achieve in the way of boosting the honourable gentleman to whom he owes his position. But it is a state of affairs that is not creditable, either to Ministers or to Parliament, and it ought to be put an end to. We have managed to get along for a number of years without these publicity officers, and there is no reason for introducing them into the Commonwealth Service at the present time.  Prime Minister has been endeavouring to get ships to come to Australia, and according to authentic cablegrams which came to hand yesterday, there are eightyfive of them coming here. It will also be seen in the newspapers that the very thing about which the honourable member is complaining-the issue of export licences-ha s been removed, allowing American goods to come here also.",138
624,Mr FOWLER,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I do not admit that these activities are due entirely, or to any great extent, to anything the Prime Minister may be doing at Home.  does not seem to give the Prime Minister credit for anything.",139
625,Mr FOWLER,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I give as much credit to the Prime Minister as he deserves;'but I am not prepared to accept him at his own estimate, or even at the estimate of him held by many of his admirers."" During the last two years there has been an unfortunate tendency on the part of Ministers to imitate theactivities of other countries. America commenced building wooden ships, and we had to commence building them also, though I am alraid we have entered upon a somewhat unprofitable line of activity in that direction.  did not protest against the building of wooden ships. On the other hand, he was very eager to have them built in Western Australia also.",139
626,Mr FOWLER,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,I did my best to put the honourable member's proposition on a business-like footing; but I still say there was a possibility that it would not tur n out successfully from a commercial standpoint. I do not know whether we have yet commenced the building of concrete ships; but it was one of the ideas of the Prime Minister to do so.  in that regard.,139
627,Mr FOWLER,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I am very - glad to hear the Minister's statement. We cannot afford to make - these experiments. It is much better to leave them to other countries and follow safely in the rear. However, in some regards we are going one better than other countries. For example, let us take the strange and somewhat mysterious transaction in connection with the Blythe River iron deposits. The Acting Prime Minister has given us to understand that he has some scheme in his mind in regard to that project, but it is about time he told us what it is. In any case, the. try has been committed by the Government to an expenditure of £3,000 upon an option on a property which has been on the market begging for a buyer for many years past.",139
628,Mr FENTON,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,Is not' an' expert being imported to examine the deposits?,139
629,Mr FOWLER,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"Yes ; but why an option should be rushed through in regard to a property which apparently no one else wanted is a mystery to me. As a matter of fact, there are other iron deposits which are being worked in Australia, admittedly better commercial propositions, which will furnish all the iron required in the Commonwealth for a very long time to come, and the Government ought to show more justification than they have so far if they seriously contemplate the pur-_ chase of this somewhat doubtful proposition at a cost of £100,000. So far , they will not give us any indication of what they propose to do with the property when they do buy it . The country should not be asked to expend money on a scheme about which there is so much secrecy. There is another matter upon which I speak with a considerable amount of hesitation. All work carried on by the Government requires tightening up. There is no doubt that for some years past there has been a general slackness in the activities under Government .control. When we were supposed to be busily engaged fitting up transports to take our troops away, I was told by a gentleman who employs a considerable amount of labour, that a man whom he had known for a good many years came to him for a job. He said to the man, "" I thought you were working on one of the transports at Will liamstown."" "" Yes,"" said the. man, "" I was on one of the transports, and I stood it for four days, but I had to get out. You can believe me or not, but I am telling you the truth when I say that all I did in this four days was to .scrub the top of a table occasionally when one of the bosses came along."" This man went on to explain that another man who was on the ship used to sweep the deck in similar circumstances, that is, when the bosses were about, and that when coun- the bosses' backs were turned he thisw the sweepings all over the deck again, so that they might be swept up on the next occasion when attention was supposed to be directed towards his occupation - No doubt.this state of affairs has been fairly general. is undoubtedly a disadvantage, not only to the country, but also to those men who are anxious to give a fair day's work for their wages. It puts them in a false position. In Jhe interests of these honest workers, and in the interests of Australia, the Government should see that supervision generally is ' tightened up all through the Service, and that 20s. .worth of work is given for 20s. in wages. Civil servants in the outlying States do not enjoy the opportunities for promotion that are enjoyed at headquarters. It is a notorious fact that men have been appointed to responsible positions in the Commonwealth Service because they have been able to pull the coat tails of Ministers. This is a most undesirable state of affairs. Men closely associated with Ministers have a much better chance of appointment than have - abler men at a distance from headquarters - It is a misfortune to men in outlying States that promotion does not come their way, while others less deserving secure it because they happen to be associated with Ministers, or are employed - at head-quarters. A ll positions, without exception, in the Public Service should be under the control of the Public Service Commissioner. No Minister should have the right to appoint a man who may have ingratiated himself into his good opinion, but may not 'be by any means the right person for a position to be filled. The failure of industrial legislation has become painfully apparent to the most indifferent. Many years back we made earnest efforts to create a condition in regard to our law that would secure industrial peace in the community, and secure to all the workers a court of appeal that would be satisfactory to them, at the same time satisfactory to emmatter ployers. There is no doubt we have zation? failed. ""We have erected a huge steamengine, in many cases, to crack the prodo verbial nut, and' even when cracked the nut has often been found to be empty. That is to say, there may be a small dispute in which a mere handful of men are involved with a particular employer, but that dispute cannot be settled on the merits of its actual dimensions. It has It to be regarded as a difficulty between a large union and a body of employers, and if it is to be dealt with in the Commonwealth Court of Arbitration it has to be in some artificial way slopped over from one State to another.  commenced, we have settled about forty-five disputes by the tribunal which has been .appointed.",139
630,Mr FOWLER,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I know that there has been a rough-and-ready method of dealing with those disputes, and the Government are to be congratulated on the adoption of it. It is precisely on that particular principle that I make the suggestion that wherever there is trouble between an employer and employees, the dispute should be-regarded as concerning the immediate parties to it. If ' a body of twenty men have a dispute with an employer, that body of twenty men should be regarded for the purposes of conciliation and arbitration as a union. Of course the Court could have power to make a common award, if necessary. Let us make the Court cheap, and immediate in its action, and we shall confer a tremendous advantage, not only to the working man and his employer, but also to the country generally.",140
631,Mr CONSIDINE,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"In the case of a local dispute involving twenty men, should the local union be ignored ]",140
632,Mr FOWLEE,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I do not say so; but I say that the dispute should be dealt with as one affecting the men immediately concerned, and no others; and that the men who have a dispute with their employers ought to be regarded as an organization.",140

635,Mr CONSIDINE,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,I was anxious to know if the honourable member spoke of twenty men whether.they were unionists or non-unionists.,141
636,Mr FOWLER,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I am. not concerned whether they are members of an official union or not. My concern is whether they have a legitimate difficulty with employers, and if they have, I consider that they should be regarded as a union for the purpose of approaching the Court.

I complain that the Government have not shown sufficient intention of doing so. - Mr Considine - "" In my Father's economy may be safely practised. house there are many mansions.""",141

I have ploughed a somewhat lonely furrow in the whole of my political career, not to my personal advantage, but, I believe, to the advantage of my electors, and, perhaps, in some little degree, to the advantage of the country. I shall continue along that course as long as I take any part in public life. Not only should we put our house in order, but we should indicate to the State Parliaments that it is about time they carried out the implied obligation that was entered into when . Federation* was undertaken. When the Australian States federated it was understood that the State Parliaments would reduce their membership, their cost, and, perhaps, their activities precisely in proportion to the work taken over by the Commonwealth. Speaking generally, no such cutting down of expenditure has been made by them. They ""have carried on practically with all their paraphernalia of sovereignty, with as many members as prior to Federation, with two Chambers, and with the same staffs of officials. In short, the adoption of Federation has made no material difference in the cost of governing the States.",141
638,Mr CONSIDINE,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,The State Parliaments all want scrapping.,141
639,Mr FOWLER,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I do not agree with that, but it is about time that State Parliaments realized as well as the Federal Parliament that they have a certain amount of responsibility in this regard, and that while we must apply the knife to every item of unnecessary expenditure, it is their duty also-to do the same. But while during the next few years there their will be a tremendous strain' - on our financial resources,, we must be caref u l to avoid an indiscriminate cheeseparing' policy. We must deal not economically, but generously, with our returned soldiers who have fought our battles abroad so bravely and. unselfishly. That is one reason why I ask the Government at the present time to curtail expenditure in . other directions where, We do not want any unnecessary increase of the Public Service. We do not want a continuance of purely ornamental functions; we do not want waste and extravagance in any direction."" If the Government will look about, find these things, and deal with them wherever they are, I feel sure that the country will be thankful to them, and that it will turn the corner and reach once more the high road of prosperity, without any undue sacrifice being demanded of ,the people.",141

My complaint, against the Government is that they did not make aa earlier start, with the work.  armistice would be signed as early' as it was.",141
641,Mr MATHEWS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"Exactly ; and I , for one, shall not condemn the Government for what they have done in the direction of building wooden ships. My only regret is that the ships are not now coming off the stocks so that we might put them at an early date to profitable use. I do not believe that wooden ships will prove useless, and, in any event, it is too late now to condemn the Government, since all parties were agreed that something should be done in the direction of building such vessels. As to the demand for economy, I hope that the Government will not be led astray by the newspapers. The Age newspaper, more especially, has laid itself out to Australia. That may not be its intention, but if its advice be followed with respect of public expenditure, ruin will undoubtedly take place.  careful we shall have the biggest unemployed problem that we have ever had to solve.",141
642,Mr MATHEWS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"Undoubtedy . The Age is largely read, and-is well conducted by capable literary men who know how to run a newspaper in their own interests. They care not what is the result of any policy adopted by them as long as it tends to the success of their own publication. They are prepared to take up any political party whose policy they are permitted to mould, and to attack any party that is not ready to allow them to do that. They charge the present Government with waste and extravagance. I'am not going to say that the Government have not made some very foolish mistakes. Waste of money is of no use to any country; but I think that the Age should he fair, and that in dealing with the great increase that has taken place in public expenditure they should show that the war has been largely responsible for it. As it is, the Age is trying to stop expenditure even on Teproductive works. If it succeeds, the result will be chaos. I invite Victorians to recall what happened in the eaTly 90's, when the Patterson Government were in power. That was a .Government of economy. Public servants were dismissed in a wholesale fashion, and the expenditure of the State was enormously reduced. The Tesult was that we had a city of empty houses and grass-grown streets. In New .South Wales, the effect of the land boom would have been felt to the same extent as in Victoria but for the action of the State Government. In the first place, the Government of New South Wales came to the assistance of the 'banks, and took steps to prevent them from-closing down. I have no - particular interest in the capitalistic section of the community. My support does not come fromthat quarter, nor is it likely to do, but I know that in the early 90's thousands of men were thrown out of work in this State, and the ruin wages of first class tradesmen came down to about 5s. per day, merely because the Government followed an unusual .policy of public economy in public expenditure. In New South Wales, the old gentlemen very of the Legislative Council actually stayed up all night to pass a Bill to prevent the banks from closing their doors, and the State Government borrowed money for reproductive purposes. Under that policy the crisis which followed the boom there was hardly felt, whereas in Victoria there was so much distress that fully 100,000 people had to seek employment elsewhere.",142
643,Mr FOWLER,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,There was not in New South .Wales the wild land speculation that took place here.,142
644,Mr MATHEWS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"The honourable member is mistaken. At North Shore today is to be seen a great cantilever bridge stretching over an. arm of the harbour, and absolutely unused. That bridge was built during the old boom days by a land syndicate, of which the Duke of Manchester was a member, and which had the idea of creating a new Sydney in that part of the metropolis. That land company alone expended nearly £1,500,000. This illustrates my contention that land speculation was indulged in just as largely by the people of New South Wales as it was in this State.",142
645,Mr GREGORY,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,The amendment was so quietly disposed of in OUT absence a little while ago that I'desire to call attention to the fact that there is not a quorum present. (Quorum formed.),142
646,Mr MATHEWS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"In the early 90's I , with thousands of other Victorians, had to seek a livelihood in another State. The gold discoveries of Western Australia at that time practically saved Victoria from a complete smash. Those - who were attracted from this State to the West - by the discovery of gold, sent to their wives and families here hundreds of thousands of pounds in postal notes and money orders.",142
647,Mr FOWLER,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,And thousands of orders from Western Australia were also placed in Victoria.,143
648,Mr MATHEWS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"That is so. I repeat that Victoria was practically ruined in the early' 90's by the so-called economy practised by the Patterson Government; and that if the Ministry and the Parliament of the Commonwealth are not strong enough to fight the press with regard to its demand for economy, we shall have a recurrence of what then took place. The Age has put the case for economy niost unfairly , and, as a matter of fact, should have been dealt with under the War Precautions Act for its unfair criticism of the Government. It blames the Government for failing to practise economy in directions in which economy should not be practised. During the last four years we have borrowed enormous sums to spend on the war, and have i this way created a situation that will require all the ingenuity of Parliament to overcome. If Australia is to return normal conditions, we must, have a large public expenditure. If we practised economy urged by some of the newspapers wages. we should have chaos. . If it cost us £300,000,000 to play our part in the waT, we must be prepared, if necessary, to soldier. spend £300,000,000 on peace. It will not be necessary to expend that amount, but we shall find .it imperative to incur a very large expenditure if a most serious depresare sion is to be avoided. Coming to the question of repatriation, will the Age newspaper and others urge economy in that direction? Will expect from the returned soldier the same return that they demand from I men who have not been tated or had their industrial life soldiers. disturbed? We understand repatriation to mean restoring the soldiers to the position they occupied before they went abroad.' I believe they should be given the House. even better positions. We know that prior to the war the majority of the workers were casually employed, working on the average not more than eight months in the year. Men were promised all sorts of things if they would fight for the pire. On their return are they to be expected to work only eight months in the big year ? No honourable members will reply in the affirmative to that question. Our soldiers must be kept full y occupied, and full y paid for the work they do. If that is done, other men who did not go to the war, the fathers and elder brothers of the soldiers, may be given only about five or six months' work in the year. It is the duty of a Government to find work all the year round for the wage-earning class, and that will not be done under the present - system unless we continue the expenditure of money on reproductive works. But today we are economizing. There is no likelihood of losing money that is spent in proper directions. Consider the opportunities in the building trade alone 1 Do not honourable members know that there are not enough dwellings in Australia to house the people as they ought to be housed ?",143

655,Mr MATHEWS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,I have been informed that that is the case. ,144
656,Mr MATHEWS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I hope the Minister will, because we shall not have an opportunity of dealing with this question for some time, unless the Housing Bill is passed before the House goes into recess. Both the permanent navy depot and the military depot are in my electorate, and I am naturally interested in this question. The proposed exclusion of members of the permanent forces from the benefits of the scheme seems unfair. We are told that the Commonwealth Government cannot engage in any venture for supplying the public with comvindictively modities. If that is the constitutional position the sooner they acquire the necesserved sary, power in that direction the better. Without that power they will not be able' to repatriate the soldiers. The establishrier ment of new industries and the extension of existing ones are .necessary, and i money is to be lost in the initial stages new industries it is better that the Gowill not return his money. vernment should lose it as part of the scheme of repatriation. I am afraid that the Government may yield to the popular cry for economy. Some sections public are led like sheep by the newssort - papers, which are putting increased venom into their articles because they fear that they are in danger of losing their hold on the public. If the people views. are misled by the press on the question will be the duty of every Government every member of Parliament to show that the economy cry is a foolish one, and that it will bring in its train distress a repetition o of the serious conditions the early nineties. I am sorry that some honourable members on this side do not agree with me and are assisting the sheviks on the Government benches i manding economy. . If those honourable members who think that economy in lic expenditure is essential succeed in overawing the Government, trouble will arise. The soldiers will not-be repatriated as they ought to be, and the public will suffer. I desire to say a few words regarding the War Precautions Act, especially in its relation to the censorship of the press and other publications and the imprisonment of individuals. I think it is time that the Government discontinued the silly pohcy of gaoling . men who differ from them politically, and ceased the foolish cry of "" Stop these traitors to our country."" We have in our midst Mr . Peter Simonoff. He was. selected by the Russian residentsof Australia as their representative, but under the War Precautions Act his personal activities have been restricted. I do not think that restriction was necessary, even while the war was in progress; the Government thought otherwise. Simonoff was prosecuted and sentenced. His case will shortly* come up for review. I do not know whether the Government intend to punish that man because he broke the law, but no good end can be by imprisoning him, especially as he is desirous of leaving Australia. In fact, as the honourable member for Bar(Mr Considine) explained, Simonoff paid portion of his - boat fare from Ausf any tralia, but was prevented from leaving of our shores, and the shipping company Surely no qne desires that Australia shall be charged with some of the crimes of which we are charging other countries. We are told of the that some other peoples have done this of thing, but I do not swallow all that the press tells us. I do know that Simonoff is a good-living and peaceful man, and that he holds strong political The Government have no more it right to desire to gaol him than I would and have to desire to imprison some member on the Government side. The House will be adjourning this week, and there will and be no further opportunity of dealing with of this case. I hope the Government will not stain their character by sending this man to gaol. There can be no necessity Bolfor such a course. The war is over, and n dethis man ought to be allowed to leave Australia, or even to remain if he desires pubto do so. Surely we can now allow the bitter feelings of the past to die out and adopt a saner policy. In Sydney, between the years) 1893 and 1896, I workedwith a German named Hermann. He has a son, Paul Hermann. I knew Hermann, senior, well. He was born in Pomerania. This man left Germany because he detested the German laws and military system, and the boy, when he arrived, was only four months old. There were two other brothers, both of whom enlisted; but one 'was afterwards rejected for some reason of which I am not aware. The elder brother is now in business in Sydney, and four weeks ago, after the war was over, somebody discovered that he had never been naturalized. His brothers, oF course, having been born here, are Australians; but, he, despite the early age at which he arrived here, was arrested and interned as a German. In time of war, of course, the Government might be able to show some justification for internArgus ing such men, but we all know that some have been detained unnecessarily. I admit the possibility that amongst the men interned are those who were desirous of working detriment to the Allies and the Empire; at any rate, I know several suspicious cases. However that may be, by no-stretch of the imagination could any suspicion be attached to this man. He has a wife and family, and a business in Sydney, and by his detention his family will suffer, and his business will ""go to the dogs."" I pleaded on his behalf with the Department, but I was informed that, although he was only four months old when he arrived, he is .regarded as an enemy alien, and must remain interned. I do not know where this sort of thing is going to end, but if it is continued it will show that we are not acting up to that standard of civilization at which we aim. It is useless, of course, to expect that the Government will alter their determination, in these matters, but I cannot help regarding the internment of this man as a positive crime. He is ruined financially, and impaired in health; and I suppose I must leave the matter as it stands. I have had an opportunity of visiting the internment camp at Canberra, and I believe the internees are looked after very well. Of course, they do notlive in up-to-date villas, and the Mr Mathews. privacy they enjoy is not what it might be, but still the accommodation is very fair. Several had nothing to say against the Government, but enerely wished that the war was over in order that they might be free. They recognised that they were being treated, perhaps, better than might have been expected under the circumstances, but they felt the loss of their liberty. To keep these men longer than is necessary is not showing that good feeling that might be looked for under the. nircumstances. It is useless for the Government to try to evade their responsibility in regard to the censorship. The other day I endeavoured to get an answer from the Acting Prime Minister- (Mr Watt) in regard to 1 a certain article which had been reprinted from an English paper in. the and Age of the 16th of this month. We, on this side, from evidence in our possession, are of opinion that the war could have been over, earlier, and that Britain was one of the principal causes of the delay of peace. We ought to have been allowed to express that opinion, but were prevented. Now, however, in the article to which I refer, it is .said that when the Allies were winning they would not hear of peace, and that when Germany, apparently, was on the victorious side, Ludendorf would not hear of peace. Why is the Labour and Socialistic press not allowed to print similar articles? The circulation of the Age and Argus far exceeds that of any Labour journal; and why this censorship of the Labour press is continued in this unfair way I cannot imagine. Some few weeks ago the Acting Prime Minister received a deputation introduced by myself, the proceedings of which had an unfortunate ending. The deputation showed the disadvantages under which the Lahour and Socialistic press labours in this connection, and pointed out that many works dealing with economic and industrial matters had been suppressed. Again, I cannot understand why the Government should withhold this literature, which is desired by many people in Australia. We are assured by the Acting Prime .Minister that the Government does not desire to reap any political advantage from the War Precautions Act, but still, as weknow, this censoring is going on. It is foolish enough to prevent Labour newspapers .from publishing original articles, but it is still more foolish to prevent reprinting articles that have already appeared in the British and other press.",144
657,Mr CONSIDINE,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,Are the Argus Age not British newspapers?,146
658,Mr MATHEWS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I do not know; there is such a thing as British fair-play, and that is what one does not get from, either of these papers, if one happens to disagree with them, politically or otherwise. I know we cannot expect the Acting Prime Minister to be here at this hour of the morning, in view of the strenuous time he has had, and, in any case, I know that anything I say would have very little effect. I should like, however, one of the Ministers to look into this matter of the suppression of literature, and have these books examined by some common-sense person.  have been given for a number of these books-to be released. I fancy a letter was signed to that effect the other day.",146
659,Mr MATHEWS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I believe that some have been released; and I can' assure the honourable gentleman that many of them are such as could be read and agreed with by honourable members on both sides of the House, and could not possibly be of any detriment to the Empire.. A question of some importance is the delay in handing the: returned soldiers their deferred pay.. In this regard I have received the following communication: Referring to the matter of the deferred pay as mentioned by you in tha House, per extract herewith, I beg to submit to your consideration the advisability of removing in the future one of the principal causes of delay in these and other settlements with returned soldiers, namely, "" their pay-books, have not arrived."" This has been the statement very very often, and I suggest they should look ahead a bit, and insist that the books accompany the troops as they leave England, otherwise when the men begin to return in larger numbers, the confusion and delay promises to be much, greater, and may-amongs t a lot of men discontented and disappointed at their inability to obtain what is due to them in a reasonable time-lea d to serious discomfort and. trouble.. It is a matter that would present no difficulty whatever to any ordinary business, firm. Trusting to your good offices to ventilate the matter etill further. That letter is quite correct, for any business firm, if it did not send the money with the men, would forward it as quickly as possible. When the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) lef t Australia for England he said he would make a special effort in this connection, and I and believe that something has been done. That gentleman is just as interested as we are in the matter, and will, doubtless, do what he can. No doubt the Government have been "" t a k e n d o w n "" in the matter of pay, but it would be better for the Government to be deceived, even to a greater extent, than that men entitled to money should' have to go without it for solong. I do not say that there is any ill-feeling oh the part of the Department, theofficials of - which are, perhaps, as conscious as I am that £ 5 or £ 1 0 to a wage-earner is very handy at any time. I quite agree with my correspondent that when the men are returning in large numbers there may be trouble if they do not get a fair deal. The next matter I wish to. deal with is one connected with the Navy. The  that many of us have received telegrams from reservist members of the crew of the Una, which is to go to Raboul, contending that they ought to be allowed to return to their civil occupations. They' have been in the service for some time, andnow that the war is over, they feel, that they ought to be permitted to return to their families. MyseH and others, however, . have been assured by the Acting Minister that it is necessary that the Una should proceed to Rabaul,, and it cannot do so without a crew.  straight back.",146
660,Mr MATHEWS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I hope so, but the difficulty is that the Una does not present the only cases. Men have been called up at Port Melbourne and Will liamstown, both at the - training school and depot, and they also desire to return to their ordinary civil businesses. They are. at present earning only small money, and they could earn a great deal more in civil life, but, of course, being reservists, they had to obey the call.  able to lay off some of these boats shortly.",146
661,Mr MATHEWS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"In my opinion the cases ought to he dealt with individually, because I know there are some men who do not want to leave the service.  no desire to pay these men - unless it is absolutely necessary. '",147
662,Mr MATHEWS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I quite believe that, but, unfortunately, the permanent men in the Navy have grown up in a certain environment, and are careless. of the feelings of these men; no matter what the circumstances may be, discipline must be observed. Now that the war is oyer, the greater proportion of these men should be allowed to retire from the Navy and resume their civil occupations. But it hot be done until the whole of the fleet is returned - to Australia. There is no longer any need for our fleet to remain in the North Sea. It is costing Australia money to keep our vessels there. The money might just as well be spent in Australia. Here is - a line of economy which the Government could follow. In peace time, the complement of a warship is nothing in comparison with what it is in time of war. I feel sure that we could discharge quite one-third of the complement of our fleet. Although drafts have replaced 3ome of the men, many of them have been away from Australia for four years.  ment of the Admiral is made, which may be done at any time, I shall waste no time in getting .the fleet back.",147
663,Mr MATHEWS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"Is there a possiofficials bility of dealing with individual cases of men who want to get back to their homes'?  referred to by the honourable member returns, I see no reason why it should not be done.",147
664,Mr MATHEWS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"There i another matter of pay and allowances, which I shall bring under the notice of the M in ister personally. .During the progress of the war we have employed men on home service. Many of them are returned soldiers, others are men who endeavoured to enlist, but were over age or physically unfit for service abroad. These men were allowed three weeks each year on full pay. Their annual leave was due about November last,- and some of . them were away on their ieave when the armistice was signed. Others were due to have their leave about that time. But the whole of the homeservice men have now been demobilized. The Government have treated them fairly - by giving them a fortnight's leave on full pay, but those who had not taken their three weeks' annual leave were deprived of that advantage. They feel that they ought to be given what was due to them. I asked a question in the House in reference to the matter, but the answer given was not a reply to the question I submitted. The men who had taken their three weeks' leave also drew their fortcan- night's pay on demobilization, although some of them had juit,. completed their leave period on the day that demobilization took place. The others seek to be placed in the same position. I do not think it is right for the Government to deprive them of their right to claim three weeks' pay in lieu of the leave they did nob receive. If the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) is sent to Great Britain for any purpose other than to give him a holiday, if he is sent there to carry out the duties of demobilization,- it ynll be a crime. 1 may be said to be biased against him, but I consider that he would be the worse man. on earth to send Home to do anything which the officials of the Defence Department, in conjunction with the High Commissioner and his staff, cannot undertake. Undoubtedly the military in Great Britain would run the show. That has been our experience in Australia in connection with Senator Pearce's administration. But apart from the fact' that the Minister for Defence would be unfit for the duties, it is quite unnecessary to. send any Minister Home. The press would do good work if they would select matters of this sort in order to show where unnecessary expenditure 3 could be curtailed'. The honourable member, for Perth (Mr Fowler) has read out a list of great undertakings carried out by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), as reported by his publicity officer, but there is not one item in that list which the High Commissioner, Mr Fisher, could not have carried out.",147
665,Mr FOWLER,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,The Prime Minister cannot possibly attend to half of them.,147
666,Mr MATHEWS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"It is undoubtedly the duty of the large staff controlled by the High Commissioner to investigate all these matters, and it is also his duty, as well as that of the staff, at Horseferryroad, to see that our troops are returned properly. There will be no need for a Minister to go Home to attend to that matter. Extra men may be required in connection with demobilization and embarkation, and in connection with the matter of fixing up accounts and allowing our troops an opportunity to pay visits to friends in Great Britain, but the High Commissioner's office ought to be able to deal with all those matters effectively. Otherwise the office would be useless. Mr Fisher is as capable of dealing with this particular class of work aa most men could be, and there is nothing to prevent him supervising any matter on the list of undertakings the publicity officer has prepared in regard to the Prime Minister's activities. He ought to know the different markets by this time, and to be able to obtain all the ' information which the publicity officer says the Prime Minister is endeavouring to secure. The Minister for the Navy promised when he left Australia that he would endeavour to make a special effort to facilitate the return of our men, and the payment of their money as quickly as possible. If he has not been able to achieve success in that direction I am confident that Senator Pearce will be unable to do so.",148
667,Mr CORBOY,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"Swan) [6.37 a.m.] - It would be a mistake for us to economize at the present time by reducing salaries or wages to an extent that would prevent the public servants from being able to live in anything like reasonable circumstances. A great deal has been said during the progress of the discussion on the Estimates about the economies which have been brought about in the Postmaster-General's Department. I have a number of statements made by postmistresses as to the conditions which have recently been imposed upon them in respect to post-offices in small country towns, where the Department has economized by removing the telegraph in[354] struments and installing telephones in their stead. In this way the necessity for employing trained telegraph officers has been avoided, and postmistresses have been employed at small salaries, whom it is only necessary to train in the use of the telephone, and in regard to the various charges for postal services. These women are called upon to sign an agreement to accept any increase or decrease which the Department may decree, and the result is that their payments are consistently reduced. I have before me the case of a country town in which a permanent officer was receiving £4 per week, with an allowance if 15s. per week for quarters, free fuel, and an allowance of 8s. per week for cleaning the office. The total value of the position per week was over £5.  of the office?",148
668,Mr CORBOY,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I am prepared to admit that, in all these cases, the revenue is very small. This officer was replaced by a woman who undertook to carry out the duties of postmistress for £57 per annum. She received no salary while she was being trained to fill the position. I understand from her that, out of the £57, she was to pay her own rent. At the end of 3 months her allowance was reduced to £43 per annum. Since then it has been reduced to £33 5s. per annum. During the fifteen months she has held the position of postmistress in that small town her allowance has been reduced by £25 - The women holding these positions, I am informed, are not permitted to carry on any other business. They are not permitted to take in lodgers in order to supplement their earnings, and although they are required to remain on duty eight hours per day, the Department assesses their services as being worth only £32 5s. per annum.  they to attend to ?",148
669,Mr CORBOY,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"At the most only one mail per day, and, in some cases, only one per week has to be dealt with. The salaries of these women, however, are based upon the number of telegraph messages which they have to pass through the telephone. The Department overlooks the fact that they must be on duty for eight hours, whether they have to transmit one or one hundred messages per day. Western Australia these women are not permitted to engage in any other business. That, I understand, is not the posit i o n in other States.  district postal business is carried on by trades people in a part of a building used for other purposes.",148
670,Mr CORBOY,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"That is so, where, for instance, a storekeeper takes over the local postal work. In cases to which I have been referring these women have taken over departmental premises previously occupied by permanent officials,, and the Department will not permit them to devote those premises to any other business purpose. I have in mind the case of a woman who for this work is receiving .£32 5s. per annum. While the timber ' m i l ls of the district are closed her little g i r l has to travel 13 miles a day to attend school, and a pony has to be kept for that purpose. How is it possible for ber to maintain herself on such an allowance T",149
671,Mr CORSER,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,Has she not a husband ?,149
672,Mr CORBOY,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I do not think so; I gather fro m the tone of her letter that she is entirely dependent upon the allowance she receives from the Department. In another case that I desire to bring under notice, one of these post-offices has been taken over by a single woman, who is in receipt of a very small, allowance. She was rather nervous about remaining in these quarters alone, and when friends went into the district, with the object of commencing business there, she was glad to allow them to lodge with her. was pleased to have their company, and they were glad of the rooms, for which she charged them 4s. per week. The fact that she did this was apparently reported to the Department, which called upon her in the first place to hand over the 4s. per week that she gained by sub-letting part of her premises, in respect of which 10 per cent, was actually deducted from her allowance. She agreed to hand over the money, but the Department then discovered that it would not be right to accept it , and she - was informed that she would have to get - rid of these' lodgers. They were accordingly turned out, and the rooms were left In vacant. The Department will not permit these people to supplement their scanty earnings by letting rooms in the permanent premises occupied by them. When complaint is made the official reply is that local business people are quite willing to take over the work. If this is how the Department is able to show a profit, I can only say that the system is one of which we ought to be ashamed, and that it is time that the Department was again showing a deficit rather than a surplus. These women are practically .the slaves of the Department, and are dependent upon it for a mere existence. We have today war widows-wome n who are in receipt of a certain income by way of pension-and from what has been told me by men in a position to know I fear that the Department intends to put some of these warwidows into these positions and to set-off their pensions against the allowances paid.",149
673,Mr FOWLER,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,The country would not stand that.,149
674,Mr CORBOY,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"A country that allows these women to be treated as they are being treated today will stand anything. There is only one other matter relating to the Postmaster-General's Department to which I desire to refer. On some branch railway lines in Western Australia there is not a post-office. There are many townships on some of our country lines that have not a post-office. They have only one mail per week. A mail bag is carried on the train, and the Department is now forcing settlers to pay a late letter fee in respect of all letters She so posted in these mail bags. This is the only"" service which the people of these districts have, and yet they are called upon to pay a late letter fee when they avail themselves^of it . This is an unfair discrimination on the part of the Department as between town and country dwellers. These settlers are not receiving anything like the consideration that is extended to city residents. If economies of this kind are helping to build up the glorious postal credit balance of which we have all heard, I can only say that the sooner we have a postal deficit once more, ' the better it will be for Australia.",149

I understood him to say that previous Governments had displayed an anxiety to carry on Naval works that were not so essential to the defence of Australia as were others that should be proceeded with more expeditiously.",150

677,Mr FENTON,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"Admira l Henderson in his report speaks of Naval Bases at Sydney and Fremantle; all others are referred to as sub-bases. I presume that the honourable member, when he made this complaint, had specially in mind the works being carried out at the Flinders Naval Base. There has 'been there some departure from the scheme laid down by the eminent Admiral, and I believe it has been due to a desire to carry out more economically that portion of our Naval defence system. Admiral Henderson laid it down that certain training should take place at the iSydney and Fremantle Naval Bases, and that only, a limited amount of training should be carried out at Flinders. It was subsequently determined, however, that Flinders should be the training centre for the seamen for the Australian Fleet, and that decision has naturally led to the Flinders Naval Base becoming a more important section of our Naval defence system. We are to have there a torpedo school, a gunnery school, as well as a wireless and other schools, which were origin-ally intended to be spread over the other Bases - The idea is, I think, that Jervis Bay shall be the training place for officers, and Westernport the training place for the seamen of the Australian Fleet. In these circumstances, more buildings have been erected at Flinders than would have been necessary under the original schema Taking it as a whole, there is no better harbour than that of Westernport.",150
678,Mr FOWLER,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,The deep water part ot it is satisfactory. The honourable member is not referring to Hann's Inlet? [354]- 2,150
679,Mr FENTON,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"If the honourable member will but peruse Sir Maurice Fitzmaurice's report he will not be so drastic in his criticism of Hann's Inlet as he has been. Vessels of the deepest draught can be accommodated in Westernport. .Some critics have urged that Admiral Henderson, when he visited Australia, had grown so old in the service of the British Navy that he had become somewhat antiquated in his ideas. I know nothing as to his qualifications, but the general impression I have formed from a study of his report is that he was well qualified to express an opinion upon the subject with which he was called upon to* deal. Sir Maurice Fitzmaurice in a report, dated 11th December, 1913, dealswith the Flinders Naval Base, and says- As the Base is specially required for destroyers and submarines, it is necessary that still water should be obtained, especially for the latter class of ship.",150
680,Mr FOWLER,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"Is that not rather absurd in view of the fact that submarines, during the war have been working in stormy ocean waters?",150
681,Mr FENTON,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I am merely quoting Sir Maurice Fitzmaurice's opinion as set out in this report, which goes on to state that It is clear that any point chosen for a Base south of Sandy Point would require heavy and costly protective works. The site, therefore, must be north off this point. A site on French Island or Phillip Island must be ruled out on account of the impossibility of railway communication. Any site on the east coast of Port Western is impossible on account of the amount of dredging which would be required, and the difficulty of railway communication - The north arm of Port Western therefore remains as the only place on which a Base is practicable. At Hann's Inlet or some distance up Hastings Inlet a Base would be possible without protctive works. Near the entrance to Hasting's Inlet, at Watson's Inlet or Rutherford Creek, the latter two being on the west and east sides respectively of Quail Island, some protective works would be required. At any other'point on the north arm protective works of rather costly nature would be necessary to form a workable Base for destroyers or submarines. Owing to the large extent of foreshore at all points in the north arm, it is necessary todredge a turning basin at whatever, site may be chosen for the Base. An examination of the chart will make this apparent at once. At Hann's Inlet the dredging of the turning basin will cost over 40 per cent, of the total amount of dredging. If the cost of the turning basin is eliminated as being common to all sites, the question arises which of all the sites mentioned above is the cheapest for works other than the turning basin, bearing in mind the fact that, in some cases, the works would be dredging only, and in other cases dredging combined with protective works. I have, after roughly estimating the works at each place, come to the conclusion that Hann's Inlet has been wisely chosen as the cheapest site for a Naval Base in Port Western, assuming that it is used for destroyers and submarines only. Quite apart from the question of the work at the Base is the question of railway communication, and in this matter Hann's Inlet gives better facilities than any other site. I have gone into the question of the position of the Base at possibly some greater length than necessary, and I feel sure that the same points as I have mention have been carefully considered by others, but I felt it necessary satisfy myself that the best site had been selectod. I thought I was not mistaken in the stateyears, ment I made about the Flinders' Base, although I was in error in attributing the formerly. words I have just quoted to Admiral Henderson instead of to Sir Maurice maurice, who visited the site some years later. The ""honourable member for Perth mentioned also the item of motor cars. Their number has certainly increased, and there is a most brand on some of them. I have seen two or three standing at the entrance to building, each bearing the brand "" D ^ D I know that the broad arrow has a great significance when placed on clothes and other articles, and I have wondered ther the double "" D "" stands for "" doubly damned"" for those who ride therein.

I understand that the comparison of the two systems favours the purchasing rather than the hiring of cars. The honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams), quite unwittingly, I think, seemed to cast a reflection upon to the workers of this country. He stated that, according to figures supplied by tha Commonwealth Statistician, the productiveness of labour has decreased in recent and, inferentially, that men are doing less work today than they did  Fitzbricklaying, at any rate.",151

691,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,The which the honourable member has just quoted are deceptive. A pair of boots costs about 5s. more today than it did in 1911.,152

694,Mr FENTON,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I know that at the request of union secretaries and the representatives of the workers in arbitration cases, he has provided special statistics for them to use in the Court.

696,Mr FENTON,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"That is a serious charge. Surely if the honourable member obtained a return from the Commonwealth Statistician in regard to certain matters, and quoted it in the House exactly as he received it , he would consider himself on solid ground.",152

698,Mr FENTON,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I know that the union representatives have quoted accurately the figures supplied to them by the Statistical Office, and if a Judge places upon them a construction they do not bear, either the Judge is not very intelligent or the statistics are not clear. Honourable members on both sides of the House are perfectly justified in making serious complaint of the manner in which they have been treated in this so-called financial session. The only time when the finances of the Commonwealth can be really analyzed is after the Treasurer has made his Budget speech, and the Estimates have been presented to the House. The Postmaster-General (Mr Webster) will admit that in days gone by, when he availed himself of opportunities to criticise past Governments, he regarded the Budget speech, and the figures associated figures with it , as the best means of revealing the country's financial position. Nearly three months have elapsed since the Treasurer (Mr Watt ) delivered his Budget speech, and now, almost on Christmas eve, we have been compelled to sit all night for the express purpose of discussing the most serious financial problems that the country has to face. Surely during the last three months many an opportunity must have presented itself to the Government of placing the Estimates to the fore on the business-sheet, so that the House might at reasonable hours have a chance of dealing with the financial situation. A f t e r having been here all night, I and other honourable members are befagged and befogged, instead of being able to engage in clear thinking on the finances. Is it any wonder that Parliament is laughed at when we deal in this way with the business of the country? Is it any wonder that the people are asking what we in ' Parliament are doing ? We are called upon to discuss the most important matters affecting the welfare of the country, without being given a reasonable opportunity to bring to bear upon them clear minds and deliberate thought. Here is a serious position that is prewould sented in one paragraph in the Budget statement-During the next ten j'ears something like £390,000,000 of Australian loans will have to be redeemed, being about £200,000,000 of State loans and £190,000.000 of war loans. Practically the whole of this immense sum must be provided for by renewal flotations. Moreover, additional sums will be required for war, for repatriation, and for State public works. It will be seen that a Herculean financial task if ahead. There, in one pregnant sentence, we are given a fair idea of what this country has to face in the very near future. Much of this indebtedness, especially in regard to the States, will have to be redeemed when money is dear; and that will make the burden of the Australian taxpayer all the greater. On most of the loans to be redeemed, the interest is only 3 per cent, or 3£ per cent., and we shall be singularly fortunate, even with the best of methods, if on new loans we do not pay more than an average of 5 per cent. That surely makes one wonder whether, even in a country like this, which shows such a marvellous power of recovery, we shall be able to . keep pace with the expenditure. We have not only to redeem loans and face a great interest bill, but we have to provide millions for repatriation, and a considerable sum for pensions. country like this, where there is so much to do and so little done, no Government can afford to stand s t ill; and never were we faced with such financial problems.",152
699,Mr MATHEWS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,We are no worse off than are other countries.,153

I am no pessimist, and I have no doubt we shall survive; but we will never overcome the financial troubles unless we apply our best talents to the problem.  indemnity. - Mr Fenton - Eve n if there is an indemnity we shall, accordinc to the bestinformed minds in Britain , have to allow Germany time to earn the money. On the question of demobilization I in tend to read one or two quotations. It appears to me, from the slow manner in which we are setting about our demobilization scheme, as though the Government were not prepared to receive men in large numbers early next year. Is there any design on the part of the Government in their being slow with their demobilization scheme, as compared with what is being done on the other side of the world ? Here is a newspaper cable: The demobilization of the British Forces returned from the war began in London on Monday. It is expected that by the end of the week several thousands of men will be arriving every day. The principal centre for the disbanding of the' men returning from France is Wimbledon. It will be seen that the British authorities are demobilizing the troops as fast as possible, always, of course, reserving a certain number for eventualities.",153
701,Mr ATKINSON,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,We are a long from the battle front .,153
702,Mr FENTON,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"That is the very reason why we should be more vigorous in our preliminary effort. We have to bring a distance of 12,000 miles men who have been from home over four years; and the sooner provision is made for them the better they will be satisfied. During the war, the British, French, and German soldiers have always been able to visit their families for a week or two. The shipping tonnage available for demobilization has already aDpeared in the newspapers.",153
703,Mr LIVINGSTON,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,Will not the High In a Commissioner do his best for the boys?,153
704,Mr FENTON,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,The question is whether Mr Fisher will be allowed to do anything.,153

706,Mr FENTON,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"We have a monopolist in the person of the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), who is now in England, and who does not like' anv interference. No doubt, if he had his way, Mr Fisher would be treated as badly in 1918 as he was in 1916. the",153
707,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,If you are as good a friend of the soldier as is the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) you will not fall short.,153
708,Mr FENTON,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I know of no one here who is not a friend of the soldier; at any rate, so far as relatives at the Front are concerned, I think I can show as good a record as any man in the House. We have a perfect right to complain if we think that demobilization is not proceeding as rapidly as it ought to. I propose to quote from some remarks of Captain Carmichael, M.L.A. , who went to the Front, and returned only to take others back-with him. He is a man not likely to make any rash remarks, and one who, I think, has every desire to be fair;, and, therefore, the following newspaper extract may be of interest:Captain A. C. Carmichael, of New South Wales, is to sail for Australia in a fortnight, He is investigating the construction of workmen's houses in-England, and reports that concrete houses suitable for the Sydney suburbsare being built for £150. Interviewed in regard to demobilization, hecriticised the want of co-ordination between London and Australia. There was plenty of shipping available, he said, but the men were way not ready owing to the want of organization in England. The story is current among thesoldiers that Australia cannot absorb more than 10,000 monthly, as the Repatriation Department cannot handle more, and there is a certain amount of discontent, due to the English papers publishing particulars of the Canadian, British, and American demobilization proposals, but nothing about Australia's - scheme. The men are little interested in education and factory proposals.",153
709,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"Did you see the Minister's reply to that? Head it, so as to have it placed on record.",154
710,Mr FENTON,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,I shall leave that for the honourable member to do. I do not think that any one will question Captain Carmichael's veracity.,154
711,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,I question his knowledge of what he is talking about.,154
712,Mr FENTON,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,He is better able to judge of the position in England than is the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) in Melbourne.,154
713,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I heard a statesome ment made by a responsible Minister that, in an undertone. at any rate, casts some doubts on Captain Carmichael's methods.",154

That being so, we ought of existence by the end of April, or a little later, to have 100,000 men back in Ausone? tralia.

There are at sent in England Sir John Monash, 'General White, and others, including Lieutenant Burchell, a member of this House, who, we understand, has had tain work allotted to him.

718,Mr FENTON,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"Wit h all respect to Sir John Monash, I believe that Captain Carmichael could do as well as any I have mentioned.

722,Mr JOWETT,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,What !,154
723,Mr FENTON,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"The honourable memin ber informed me only the other day that he uses Australian dip and finds it gives every satisfaction. I have lately been in consultation with Sir John Higgins, who has had much to do with the metal and industries. A promise was faithfully made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) betothe manufacturers of Australian sheep dip that if the analysis of the Australian proved satisfactory, if there was a preshortage of shipping space from Great Britain to Australia, and furthermore, if the Australian manufacturers could supply Australia's requirements in the cermatter of sheep dips, there would be a prohibition of the importation of these dips from any other part of the world. Yet dips have been coming in almost as regularly as they did when there was no war in progress.",154
724,Mr JOWETT,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,That is not the case.,155
725,Mr FENTON,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"They may have been coming in a little irregularly, but the very, fact that dips have been imported in large quantities has resulted in shutting out the use of locally made dips.  cent, of the usual supply of Cooper's dip is obtainable. '",155
726,Mr FENTON,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I know that Cooper's dip has a standard quality, but Sir John Higgins made investigations in regard to the matter-and satisfied himself, from the analysis made, that the Australian made dip should be used and should get preference over the imported dips. As a result of the assurance given by the Prime Minister, one firm of Australian manufacturers spent an additional .£20,00(5 in equipping their factory with the object of supplying Australia's requirements in the matter of sheep dips. T do not intend to go through the whole history of the matter, but the correspondence dealing with it shows conclusively that a serious injustice has been inflicted upon the Australian manufacturers of sheep dip, which, in some cases, has been proved even superior to Cooper's dip. When we establish such industries there are by-products which affect other industries. One of the chief ingredients of sheep dip is arsenic, obtained from arsenical ores. Thus the mining industry is affected. One firm manufacturing Australian sheep dip has employed its hands on three continuous shifts, but since the importation of dips has been permitted, it has only been able to keep one shift going, and in all probability that will be reduced now that the season is over.",155
727,Mr JOWETT,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,Is not the honourable member aware that Sir John Higgins and the Central Wool Committee have done everything in their power to encourage the use of Australian dips ?,155
728,Mr FENTON,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,I accept the honourable member's word in regard to the action of the Central Wool Committee. I know myself that Sir John Higgins has done all he could to establish the Australian sheep dips on the market. The manufacturers have no complaint against Sir John Higgins and the Central Wool Committee.,155
729,Mr JOWETT,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,Is it due to the action of the Government that extra quantities of imported dips have been shipped to Australia ?,155
730,Mr FENTON,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I do not say that extra quantities have been shipped, but sufficient quantities have been landed to supply the requirements of the pastoralists.",155
731,Mr JOWETT,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,I doubt whether it is due to the action of the Government.,155
732,Mr FENTON,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"It is due to their lack of action. The following s a cablegram sent by the Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes) to Leggo & Company, who manufacture a sheep dipLondon, August 29th, 1918. The authorities here do - not desire to take action. Because of interests involved on this side they say extremely difficult. Other countries affected as well as Australia and prohibition would lead to serious trouble here. Still negotiating but undoubtedly the simplest course would be action by Australian Customs. This is where I join issue with the Government. Recently'in dealing with this matter I went to the Customs Department and so impressed were they with the seriousness of the position in which these manufacturers have been placed thab they were on the point of sending a cable to Great Britain intimating that if . any further quantity of sheep dip was shipped on the boats coming to Australia, they would see that it was not landed on arrival here. If they had only taken that action months ago, when Cooper's, Quibell's, and other sheep dips were coming into Australia, they would have saved more than one firm from being placed in a most peculiar position.",155
733,Mr LIVINGSTON,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,Does the honourable member say that the Customs Department will stop these dips coming to Australia where they are so badly needed ?,155
734,Mr FENTON,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"It has been admitted by the honourable member himself, by the honourable member for Grampians (Mr . Jowett), by Sir John Higgins, and by large graziers, that the Australian article is equal to the best imported sheep dip.",155

737,Mr FENTON,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"My protectionist faith is such that I would have prohibition against the world in regard to anything we could manufacture or grow here with proper protection for the worker and consumer. The Prime Minister, in his cable, has practically suggested the same thing. He says that Customs action is needed on this side. The agents for the imported sheep dips' are among the most influential firms in Australia. Apparently, space can be found for their dips, while it cannot be found for machinery that is so essential for the establishment of industries in Australia. It should have dawned upon the Government that these shipments of dip were coming to Australia. complaint was made to the Customs Department, and the claim was put forward that the authorities had said that the importation of sheep dips would be prohibited, the reply was, "" Your alarm is unfounded. Your suspicion is groundless. Go back to your factory, and turn out the goods. Y o u have the Australian market at your disposal."" But at that very moment ships were coming to Australia bringing out sheep dips.",156
738,Mr JOWETT,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"That was not the fault of the Government. Mr Fenton"" - In his cablegram, the Prime Minister speaks of the big influences at work in London. By some means, underground or otherwise, the exportation of Australian leather to Great Britain has been prohibited, possibly because the tanners of the Old Country have been powerful enough to secure Australian hides, and turn them into leather.' American production preponderates in the copper world, and so much American influence has been at work in Great B r i tain in regard to copper that our representatives on the other side of the world have not been able to make those adjustments which should have been made on behalf of Australia. I am not only pleading on behalf of the manufacturers of sheep dips; I am also pleading on behalf of the men who have been thrown out of employment, and on behalf of our chemists, who having succeeded in turning out an Australian product which, with the exception of sulphur, is made entirely from Australian raw material, are now baulked in their efforts. I lay the blame on the Government, who ought to do something to establish new industries, and revive languishing industries. They could have prohibited the importation of these sheep dips. By not doing so, they have inflicted a serious in j u r y on at least one very reputable firm, and a more serious injury on many workers in this country.",156
739,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,What is the relative retail price of the various sheep dips?,156
740,Mr FENTON,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"Fro m the figures I have seen, I am prepared to say that the Australian dip, which is admitted on analysis to be as good as any imported dip, is being sold at a price which is less than that of the imported article. These When people, who are employing a large number of hands, have been placed in a very unfair position. I have brought the matter forward because they have failed through other channels. It mqy happen that, owing to the matter having been ventilated here, some action will be taken detrimental to the industry. If so, it will again be ventilated in the House. Theso people were practically invited by the Ministry of Munitions to undertake the manufacture of sheep dips, and the manner in which they have been treated will not be an encouragement to other persons who are desirous of establishing Australian industries which we require to provide that variety of employment which will be so essential for our soldiers when they return. These negotiations have been going on practically for twelve months, but so far as the manufacturers are concerned, they seem to. have reached a dead end. The following is a statement as to the position of the local manufacturers:At the beginning of this year the Director of Munitions inquired as to whether, in the event of the imported sheep dips not being available here, as the raw materials were wanted in the United Kingdom, and also the shipping space they occupied was wanted for urgent necessities, manufacturers would undertake to see that sufficient sheep dip would be produced in Australia to supply the whole of the needs of the Australian pastoralists. After giving the matter very careful consideration, the manufacturers undertook that this would be done by(o) Increasing very largely their own sheep dip-making plant, and reserving the necessary raw materials. (6) Undertaking to supply other sheepdip manufacturers with the raw materials required by them. This decision was only arrived' at after several conferences with the Directors of Munitions, also the Chairman of the Central Wool Committee, Sir John Higgins, and in the full belief that the imported brands would not be available here. Indeed, the manufacturers were told, during the above negotiations with the representatives of the Commonwealth Government, that they would be expected to enter into a bond by which they would have to make a cash forfeit in the event of their failing to carry out the undertaking, and at the time they signified their willingness to execute such a bond. Later on, however, they were told that their assurance would be taken without the bond. In keeping with this undertaking, the manufacturers have in good faith spent some thousands of pounds, and also committed themselves to the expenditure of many thousands mere, and are now absolutely in a position to carry out the undertaking, which .was considered a solemn obligation to the Commonwealth Government, and had they not been assured of the demand they certainly would not have spent so much money in providing the supply. The manufacturers are now advised that several shipments of sheep dip have been made to Australia, and that one shipment of considerable size has just been landed in Sydney. This shipment consists of 1,000 cases ex Austral-Mede, and 750 cases by another boat, the Calulu; also that there is a further shipment duo in the Malta, which is due next month, besides others to follow. They are assured that these shipments have been made in direct opposition to the views expressed to the Imperial Government by the Commonwealth Munitions Department, as to their necessity, and evidently the parties interested have used improper or unfair influences to secure space for this superfluous article at the expense of other commodities which are most urgently needed here. If that is so, their interests deserve little consideration. In any case, to allow these shipments to Australia in the face of the above facts is a serious breach of faith, as well as a severe blow to the expansion of an important Australian industry. This is a very important industry, and there are others branching off from it . Since we have practically all the raw materials-suc h as arsenic and alkaliused in the manufacture of sheep dip, the only ingredient used in its manufacture that we have to import being sulphur, there' is no reason why we should not give the industry every encouragement. We have Australian raw materials ready to be turned into a finished product that Australians are ready to buy, and yet the market is flooded with . the imported Mr fenton. article. Having endeavoured quietly but straightforwardly to secure justice for an industry richly deserving of assistance, I feel that I am performing my duty as a public man in bringing this grievance before the Committee. I hope that the common sense of honourable members will induce them to see that these men are helped to reach the goal which they have in view. Finally, dealing with the question of economy, I do not think that any real savings will be made u n t i l the whole of our Commonwealth and State Constitutions have been put into the melting-pot, and the National Parliament is given supreme power. No adequate scheme of economy can be secured until we get as near as possible to Unification.",156

I do not know whether there is anything in the High Commissioner's agreement with the Government that compels him to take an absolutely back seat while a couple of Ministers are in the Old Country. Some people are asking what Mr Fisher is doing just now. The position is that our exceptionally active Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) is always undertaking big duties, and as soon as he arrived in the Old Country the High Commissioner, apparently, was required to take a back seat.

749,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"The position of High Commissioner's office is serious. t is stated by men returning from Engthat at the present time that office n - is a mere sinecure. The whole of the m duties for which he was appointed have been transferred and vested in other hands. If that is so, we should be in n - formed qf the reasons for this developI ment. The amount provided for the offic is being increased from £8,925 to £10,650, and, in addition, we are paying the High Commissioner a salary of £3,000, and a house allowance of £2,000. There are other incidental items of expenditure. I wish it to be understood that I am not reflecting on Mr Fisher personally. ""While he was a member of this House, although I was politically opposed to him, I always regarded him as a thoroughly conscientious and reliable man, and when he was appointed High Commissioner the House was almost unanimous in believing that he would render good service to the Commonwealth. But it is a serious thing if we are paying £5,000 per annum for an officer whose duties have been delegated to other branches. For instance, it is stated that the military authorities have practically taken possession of Australia House, and one returned soldier has informed me that before he could gain access to the High Commissioner he had to run the gauntlet of a military guard. I ask the Minister in charge of the Estimates to state what is the status of the High Commissioner today,- and whether he is carrying out the duties for^which he was appointed. If not, is there any reason why we should - continue to employ him merely as a figure-head, and that Ministers should be sent to London to perform his duties.",158
750,Mr FOWLER,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"Perth) [8.25 a.m.] Attention ought to be called to the able growth of the Prime Ministers Department. Not many years ago there was no such Department. It is one of our unfortunate inheritances from the Fisher Government, and its development is partly attributable to the pushfullness of its manent head. The large vote for this partment, is perhaps, excusable at the present time, having regard to the fact a great number of activities have been thrust upon the Prime Minister in conif nexion with the war. But if I am in my place to consider the Estimates next year, I shall require that more justification shown than we have had so far for the tremendous cost of the Department.  because of the war.",159
751,Mr FOWLER,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I believe that is so; but the Department will require a liberal use of the pruning knife in the near future. I desire to know something about the Government motor cars. In this Department there is an item of £1,250 for motor-car maintenance, and the wages and expenses of chaffeurs. I notice, however, that all the cars are not under the one item, but are distributed through all the Departments. How many cars are at present available to Ministers, and what is the. total expenditure on this account? 1 understand that a motor garage has been acquired in the vicinity of Parliament House, which, in itself, must have been an expensive item.  banded over my car, and was sorry for it afterwards.",159

753,Mr FOWLER,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"Honourable members realise perfectly that the conception of Ministers tearing about the country on public duty in motor cars is altogether erroneous. The principal work of these vehicles appears to be in carrying Ministers to and from their' homes, and occasionally they are utilized for purposes* which cannot be identified at all with the remarkaffairs of the Commonwealth.  my car.",159
754,Mr FOWLER,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I am not making an accusation against any particular Minperister, and, least of all, against the honDeorable member who is interjecting. But; 1 know of cars having been used for purthat poses for which Ministers ought to have been ashamed to use them. I believe that a careful analysis were made it would be found that we are keepinsr a larjre number of motor cars and chauffeurs to do an be insignificant quantity of work daily. If motor cars are to be kept for the use of Ministers, there is a still greater need for them on the part of honourable members. The Government offices are distributed all over Melbourne, and a considerable amount of our time is occupied in dodging from one office to another. Nevertheless, we cannot provide motor cars for the members, and certainly there is no occasion to have all this fleet of motor cars available for such casual calls as may be made by Ministers during the day. I know of a Ministerial car having been used time and again to convey a Commonwealth official to and from the golf links. Not long ago, when I was in a hairdressing saloon, the barber remarked, "" That is a very handsome car Mr So-and-so has,"" mentioning the name of a certain M in ister. I said, "" Have you seen it ? "" and he replied, "" Yes, he came down on a Saturday, picked up Mr . went off to the .races."" That sort of thing is degrading to parliamentary life, and I am surprised that Ministers descend to such practices. If we are to economize, Ministers should set an example; and, in view of the fact that the business of the country, has been carried on for many years without these luxurious methods of conveyance, and also that certain M in isters, to their honour, decline to use motor cars, the Government ought to make a clean sweep of the lot. That would be a fair example of economy to set before the country. Everybody knows that it is simply because the motor car is a luxurious means of travelling that this scandal is taking place all over Australia in connection with both the Commonwealth Government and the State Governments. The time is not far distant when this sort of thing and those responsible for it will be swept aside by an indignant community.  agree with many of the remarks made by the honourable member for Perth (Mr Fowler). I have been looking with alarm at some of the items in the High Commissioner's office. I find that the appropriation for 1917-18 was £38,000, and the actual expenditure £49,174, whilst the estimate for the current year is £46,700. The economy which is necessary in these times should start in the London office. The upkeep of Aust tralia House is £9,500 per annum, which I think is considerably in excess of the upkeep of this Parliament House. I noticed also that £600 was expended last year in the purchase of a motor car for the High Commissioner's office. I have always advocated the co-ordination of* the services of the States and the Commonwealth. There are in London six Agents-General, representing the various States, and the expenses connected with them amount to about £40,307, whilst; in addition, there is an expenditure of over £46,000 in the High Commissioner's office. If these services were coordinated a saving of from £25,000 to £30,000 could be effected, and both the States and the Commonwealth would , and benefit. We should not forget that the Federal Government and the State Governments are the instruments of the one sot of taxpayers. It would be a wise step to bake a referendum of the people regarding the co-ordination of various State and Federal Departments, such as the Electoral, Statistical, Immigration, and Taxation Departments, and the London agencies, and the abolition of State Gothese vernors. The Commonwealth Electoral Department costs the taxpayers £53,700, and the State Electoral Departments, £86,275. The Commonwealth Statistician's office costs £15,013, whilst the Statisticians' offices of the States cost £ 3 2 , 1 1 7 ; on immigration the States spend £38,602 ; the High Commissioner's office costs' £48,841 ; and the States Agents-General, £40,307 ; The Governor General's establishment costs £26,875, and the State Governors, £42,489; the Commonwealth Taxation Department costs £273.067, and the State Taxation Departments, £178,705. The total expenditure under these heads for the Commonwealth is £417,496, and for the State, £368,495, or a total of £785,991. I venture to say that if these activities were co-ordinated, we could effect a saving of something like £250,000. In my opinion, there could not be a more popular cry to put before the people than economy in this direction ; and if the question were referred to the country by way of referendum, I feel quite sure that it would be supported by both Parliament and people.",159

Further, under the heading of Commonwealth Shipping Board, £4,460 is provided for a delegate member in London, at a salary of £1,000, with a secretary, clerks, typists, messenger, and a Shipping Board representative in India.

However, an appropriation of £174,000 was made in 1917-18 to meet the requirements of the Prime Minister's Department, and £222,000 was spent, showing an excess expenditure of, roughly, £50,000. This year it is proposed to vote £15,000 more than was voted last year. Did the excess expenditure come out of some reserve fund or the Treasurer's balance? We should really have more information, because it cannot be concluded that a general discussion on the Budget discharges us from all responsibility for the Estimates. On former occasions the Postmaster-General has come armed with full details of the proposed expenditure in the his Department; but on the present occasion that example does not appear to have been followed, for the table is absolutely clear of any documents connected with the votes. This is certainly reducing the discussion of the Estimates to a farce.  the honourable member desire? Mr Fenton/ - I wish to know the reason for the increase in the expenditure.

So far as I know the opinion of the country, the ever-increasing expenditure of the Government is viewed with growing disfavour. Someincreases are, no doubt, due to the war, and the appointment of boards, each with its secretary, and staff. The longer these Boards exist,, the bigger will the staffs become, because it is the natural tendency of Government Departments to inflate themselves with a. view to increasing their importance. There will be grievous disappointment in: the community if next year our publicexpenditure is not considerably reduced, and a determined effort should be made by Ministers to reduce it.

The upkeep of these cars, with men always in attendance, is very expensive, and economy should be effected by contracting with the various garage proprietors throughout Australia for the supply of cars as they may be needed. 1I have to complain of the complicated manner in which the accounts are presented to us, it being difficult for an ordinary person to follow them. In the present Estimates for the Prime Minister's Department there are twelve heads of expenditure, and last year there were only seven heads. There is this further complication, that £35,344 is debited to the Department under five heads, and £34,844 credited under four heads, leaving as the remaining item £500 for the Council of Defence. Why does not this item appear in the Defence , Estimates VA n d why inflate the Prime Minister's Estimates with expenditure which is added only to be deducted again ? Then, in this Department, £13,590 is put down for the Commonwealth line of steamers in London arid Australia, the various salaries being detailed, and yet on page 92 of the Budget papers, "" Office and general expenses in London aud Australia "" are stated at £8,528. transferring and re-transferring of amounts, a large clerical staff must be engaged. (Possibly members who have been Treasurers understand the arrangement of the accounts, but other members cannot do so. I do not' blame any particular Government for this arrangement, but it certainly should be simplified. Such simplification would bring about a reduction of the clerical staff, would save the money of the taxpayers, and would put members of Parliament in a better position for understanding the true state of affairs. The country is crying out for a reduction of expenditure, though there has not been a murmur against the spending of money in the conduct of the war. Yet, despite the protestations of Ministers that the pruning knife has been applied to the Estimates, there is still need for vigorous curtailment of them. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt ) told us yesterday that he had reduced the Estimates by between £2,000,000 and £3,000,000.",162

The best results are obtainable only by putting all responsibility on one man. If we divide the responsibility for the inflation of expenditure between the Government and the Public Accounts Committee, we shall' not know who to blame. In the I trust that the Government will take into serious consideration the protests that have been made against the large expenditure of the Departments.

The appointment of intelligence or publicity officers is an American innovation, which means "" boom yourself."" I want to know what duties are performed by intelligence officers, because, I understand, there are similar officers attached to the Defence Department and Repatriation Department. I am saying nothing against the gentlemen who hold these positions. I am merely concerning myself as to the method of appointing them. I understand that by placing the intelligence officer and the private secretary under the heading of the Professional Division, Minister in charge of the Department reserves to himself the right of appointing them.",163
775,Mr FOWLER,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,-It amounts to political patronage.,164
776,Mr TUDOR,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"It means embodying the worse feature of a system that has existed in America for many years past, because I take it that if the Minister controlling a Department can appoint a publicity officer he can also dismiss him. In America when any change of parties takes place it means that throughout the length and breadth of the country one set of officers is replaced by another. We have passed Public Service Acts in the States and in the Commonwealth for the purpose of removing any possibility of political influence being exercised in regard to appointments in the Public Service. We have realized that it is an exceedingly bad principle to admit any possibility of political patronage being exercised in this way. I want to know from the Government what duties these publicity officers have to perform, whether their positions are permanent, whether a man who has been appointed by one Minister to the Professional Division may be displaced by that Minister's successor in office, or whether a Minister is to be obliged to have a man working under him in whom he may not be able to repose any trust? Of course, I must admit that my experience has shown me that our public servants give just as loyal service to one set of Ministers as they do to another set, no matter what party may be in power.  chief duty is to prepare matter for his Minister.",164
777,Mr TUDOR,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,Does he cull things from the newspapers relating to the Department and prepare short reports for the Minister? ,164

All of the officers dealing with repatriation work should appear in one group in these Estimates.  that a sum of £251X000 was voted by Parliament for repatriation. That sum was administered by trustees, but before the appointment of the Minister for Repatriation the control was in the Prime Minister's Department.",164
779,Mr TUDOR,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I could understand the position if this accountant is nominally holding office in the Prime Minister's Department, and is actually working in the Repatriation Department. In such circumstances his position would appear in the Estimates of the Prime Minister's Office, but his actual salary would be paid by the Repatriation Department. Another item requiring explanation is, "" Administration Expenses, Port Pirie W h a r f , "" for which £2,000 was voted last year, but upon which there was an actual expenditure of £13,829 during the year. Under Division 24, "" Port Pirie W h a r f , "" we find the following items:-Manager , £ 5 0 0 ; engineer, £ 3 7 5 ; and assistant, £364-o r a total of £1,239 to be expended this year on the administration of this wharf. It is common talk that the erection of the coal-grab on the wharf at Port Pirie cost £300,000 or £400,000; that it was erected by the South Australian Government, and practically without making any inquiries the Commonwealth Government took it over.  £74,759. The South Australian Government asked us to erect it , and agreed to take it over from us, but they have not done so yet. It was put up at a time when we had difficulty in supplying Broken Hill with coal. The Commonwealth Government also bought the wharf and the land for £82,500. The approxifind mate earnings for the year amounted to £38,760.",164

Apparently we have erected this coal-grab for the State, and although it has been working for twelve months, it has not yet been taken - over by the State Government. Of course, when manual labor is displaced by mechanism, the opinion that the men whose labour has been dispensed with will give upon the plant may be considered to be biased, but I am assured that it is costing a great deal more to shift the coal by means of this grab than was the case when the coal was handled by manual labour.",165

When we were in office we were denounced for having adopted a policy of '' spoils to the victors "" by giving appointments to men of our own political party. If Mr Jackson had not been an ex-member of Parliament, he would not have been given the position he now holds. The honourable member for Henty (Mr Boyd), a member of the Melbourne Harbor Trust, probably knows more about coal-grabs than does any other honourable member, because the Melbourne Harbor Trust have been making inquiries with a view to installing mechanical appliances of the same character, the shortage of shipping having brought home to them the necessity for making use of these appliances in order to give quick discharge to the vessels visiting this port. He has told us that the cost of handling coal by means of this coal-grab differs very slightly from the cost of handling coal by means of manual labour.",165
788,Mr BOYD,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I do not mind saying that the Melbo'urne Harbor Trust turned a similar proposition down because the use of these coal-grabs meant an increase in the . handling charges to the people who have to pay them, and meant a. saving to the ships only.",165

I would be surprised to learn that the workers of Port Pirie are slower in handling goods than are the waterside workers in Melbourne. As a matter of fact, men working on the water front are very much the same class of workers all over the world. I did know that we had paid £82,000 for the To wharf or £75,000 for a coal-grab for the State Government. It is well to place record these facts; also the further fact that the appliance has been in operation for nearly twelve months, and the State something like £400"",000,000. has not yet taken it over. I did - not hear of the existence of this coal-grab until I went to Port Pirie in March last.

If we deduct everything in the form of interest on war loans, our war pensions, payments to the States, and on-everythin g in the way of fixed exe find that, in 1914, purely ordinary or peace expenditure was £16,640,153, while for 1918-19, it is estimated at £16,973,743. This would show an increase of only a littl e over £300,000. To get at the true position, however, we a very must have regard to the expenditure on works. In 1914, our works expenditure have amounted to £2,673,939, while the works our expenditure for 1918-19 is estimated a* £454,951. Deducting that expenditure we find that the ordinary purely adminever ' istrative and departmental expenditure 1914 was £13,968,214, as against an mate of £16,518,792 in 1918, showing increase of £2,550,578. Here we have a great leeway which must be made up. Drastic reductions should be made in Estimates of the different Departments to make good this difference in the penditure for the two war years menPrime Minister's Department. tioned. Notwithstanding that we are endeament, vouring to cut down expenditure, we find an increase in the Estimates for almost every Department. The expenditure of the Prime Minister's Department in 1914 was £169,000, whereas for 1918-19 it estimated at £229,000. The Treasury Estimates have increased from £3,622,000 in 1914 to about £5,000,000 in respect the current financial year. These creases may include many items of exvery penditure capable of satisfactory explaThen, nation, but it is certainly the duty Ministers to explain why, in the ordinary administrative and departmental expenthe diture, so far as we are able to classify it, there is an increase of against the figures for 1914.",166
791,Sir ROBERT BEST,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,The creation Boards may be largely responsible for it.,167
792,Mr SAMPSON,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"If - the administracase. tive accretions during the war arise the formation of commercial pools and - business activities, which have been taken over by the Government, the reductions should be equally rapid; before long should be relinquishing many of them. In dealing with the business details the Departments it should be possible us to make suggestions, and to ask that the. Estimates be revised by the responconnexion sible Ministers as well as by the surer. The honourable member for Yarra (Mr Tudor), in discussing the Estimates for the Prime Minister's Department, ferred to the item relating to the intellithe gence officer. Such an officer was, perhaps, necessary during the war to give the lic information as to action taken on ""War Precautions Act.",167
793,Mr BRENNAN,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,He did not give that information to the public.,167
794,Mr SAMPSON,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"At any rate, whatjustification there might have been in for the creation of such an office during estithe war, its continuance now that the war an is over cannot be defended. In these Estimates the provision made for increases of salary should be the subthe ject of review. We have, for instance, an item of something like £2,000 in reexspect of temporary assistance for the Seeing that it ought to be a declining Departwe should be told why temporary assistance is necessary in it. The Prime Minister's Department has been established for only four or five years, but it has built up its expenditure largely by is the transfer of branches formerly administered by other Departments. The probability is that had those branches been of left with the Departments formerly adinministering them, there would have been little increase in their expenditure. again, we have the item of "" mainof tenance of motor cars."" Last year we appropriated £1,000 for the purpose, and actual expenditure was £1,796. We are now asked to vote £1,250. Is that in£2,500,000 as crease necessary ?",167
795,Mr BOYD,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,'There has been a big in- of crease in the price of petrol.,167
796,Mr SAMPSON,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"That might partly account for the increase in this A heavy expenditure is also profrom vided for in the Prime Minister's Estimates in connection with the Audit Office. We should hear from the responsible Minister a statement as to the duties of that we office. Revelations have recently been made by the Commission on Navy and of Defence Administration as to the purfor chase of the Shaw wireless works, and also of vessels at an exorbitant rate in with the Department of the TreaNavy. A mere recital of such trans, actions in the Auditor-General's annual report might have saved the Government refrom heavy losses. The expenditure on Auditor-General's Branch is increasing every year, but in his annual report pubthere was no reference to those purchases the by the Navy Department, which have involved the Commonwealth in a loss of probably £50,000. I know that the Auditor General claims that there are certain limitations to his duties, but the time has arrived when his responsibilities should be widened, and the whole Department reformed. Another service covered by the Estimates of the Prime Minister's Department is that of the Public Service Commissioner's Office, in respect of which there is an increase of £4,000 as compared with the expenditure of last year. The grading and classification of offices, and the fixing of the pay of officers of the Public Service seems now to be done largely by the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, and it is, therefore, difficult to understand why this increase should be necessary. There is also an item of £46,000 in spect of the High Commissioner's Office in London. Por years we have been told that a stupendous effort is to be made to bring the High Commissioner's Office into line with the offices of the State Agents General in order that the cost of the representation of Australia in London might be reduced, as the people during the Federal referendum were led to believe it would be. Has any great effort been made by the Government to bring about the amalgamation of the Commonwealth and State offices in London ?",167
797,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"-We are told that another Minister is going home. Mr SAMPSON"" - And that, notwithstanding that we have a High Commissioner and two Ministers already in London. Time will not permit of my dealing with every item in these Estimates, but the unnecessarily heavy expenditure provided for in 'the Estimates for the Prime Minister's Department warrants the Committee in demanding that they shall be reviewed, and that the expenditure of the Commonwealth should be reduced to at least last year's level. The Ship-building Departments are also under the control of the Prime Minister's Department. I do not know why the Acting Minister for the  of tjhese Estimates. I believe the Assistant Minister has done good work in connection with shipbuilding, but I wish to know why this almost unlimited expenditure is not placed under the Navy Department and the control of the same Minister. Or does the honourable member  Minister, control the expenditure, even though it is in the Prime Minister's Department? It is due to the Committee, and to the people, and it is necessary to the discharge of our trusteeship as custodians of the public purse, that the Committee should take charge of the public expenditure, some of which I think is too high. The Acting Prime Minister has given a definite undertaking that some of the items of expenditure will be reduced. He referred particularly to recruiting, and certain other war activities. But I believe that, owing to the altered, circumstances and the fact that the Government re- intend to reduce the number of commercial activities in which they are engaged there is room for a further curtailment of the ordinary departmental and administrative costs.",168

799,Mr SAMPSON,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"There has been a big expenditure on ships, incurred without any authority from this House. Of course, during the war millions of pounds were expended without any direct approval from the House other than the authority to raise the money.

800,Mr HIGGS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"Capricornia) [12.4] - I congratulate the honourable member who has just spoken on having moved an amendment as an instruction to the Government, and may I express my gratitude to those honourable members, including the honourable members for Barrier (Mr Considine), Melbourne Ports (Mr. Mathews), Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton), Brisbane (Mr Finlayson), and Swan (Mr Corboy), and some of the members on the Government side for having prevented the Government breaking the back of the discussion on the Estimates by compelling the House to sit all night. I was not able to remain in the House for more than twelve hours, and I am thankful that I have been able to get a rest, and that I now have an opportunity of making a few remarks that I consider necessary in the interests of good Government. I wish to remind the Committee of the extraordinary growth of the Prime Minister's Department. In 1902 there was no such Department. The work of the Prime Minister was done in connection with the Ministry of External Affairs. Not till 1911 was the Prime Minister's Department created, and I find that the estimates for 1910-11 included provision for a secretary to the Prime Minister at a salary of £420. The number of officers in the Prime Minister's office was six, and the total vote for the Department, including the A.udit Office, was £21,059. In 1911-12 the total vote was £24,457, and the officers in the Prime Minister's office numbered eight and in the whole Department eighty-five. Tn the office of the Prime Minister was a secretary at £520, a senior clerk, four clerks, a senior messenger, and a typist. For the current year the total expenditure of the Department is estimated at £181,177, of which £32.834 is in the Prime Minister's office, and the secretary's salary has been increased from £600 to £750, without any reference to Parliament. The office staff which, in 1911, numbered, six, is now increased to forty-eight. The Acting Prime Minister will agree with me that that is not the proper method of procedure in regard to Commonwealth expenditure, and if he is in office long enough I believe he will alter this state of affairs. If he knew the practices of the secretary of the Prime Minister's Department he would ask the approval of Parliament before giving that gentleman an increase of £150 per annum.",168
801,Mr BOYD,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,He is one of the hardestworked officers in the Service.,169
802,Mr HIGGS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,Hardest-worke d officer in the Service! This is the officer who prepared the ANZAC Bulletin for circulation amongst the soldiere abroad- a corn* pilation that was absolutely one-sided.,169
803,Mr BOYD,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,That would be done under the instructions of the Prime Minister.,169
804,Mr HIGGS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"The honourable member tells me that the Prime Minister's secretary, under instructions from his chief, seut to the soldiers statements which were absolutely partial to the Government, and misrepresentative of the party in Opposition.",169
805,Mr BOYD,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I do not know anything at all about the matter, but I am certain that he would not send that publication to the soldiers on his own initiative.",169
806,Mr HIGGS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I should like to know if Mr Shepherd's services in that regard are the reason for his salary being increased to £750. We find that the Prime Minister's office now includes a secretary, an intelligence officer, a private secretary, or twenty-six officers in the clerical division, and nineteen in the general division, making a total of forty-eight.",169
807,Mr WATT,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,What is the honourable member's argument in that regard?,169
808,Mr HIGGS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"That Sir Henry Parkes was right when he said, "" Create a Department and place a man in charge, and he will soon surround himself with a staff."" The Prime Minister's Department has even a paying officer, but I believe the Treasurer intends to make some re-arrangement in that regard. As to the publicity officer, I know that the manager of one of the leading newspapers in this country considers that the practice that has grown up in political life of appointing newspaper men to various positions in the Government Service amounts to a subornation of the press. This officer sends the most one-sided cables to London at the expense of the Commonwealth.",169
809,Mr WATT,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,I do not think he does.,169
810,Mr HIGGS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"A few days ago the honourable gentleman supplied me with a sample of the cables that are sent. The members of the Win-the-War party are supposed to represent private enterprise, and surely the newspapers will find it to their own interest to send news to the Old Country for publication. But the Government have a publicity officer who, in cabling to London the resolutions of this House upon the deaths of Lord Forrest and Sir George Reid, quoted the speech of the Acting Prime Minister and made no reference whatever to the attitude of the Opposition. Apparently that represents the view he takes of his duty as a publicity officer. I know that this gentleman (Mr Cook) lost no opportunity of giving the Prime Minister the most exaggerated flattery, and of misrepresenting the views and arms of the members of the Opposition in the Melbourne Herald, on which he was employed. I ask that the Economy Board shall inquire into the appointment of publicity officers. There are sufficient newspapers in the Commonwealth to supply the general public with views regarding the proceedings in this Parliament. If the Prime Minister requires somebody to boom him and declare that he is received with loud applause, and that the audience rises en masse to give him an ovation, let him pay for such services out of his own pocket. At one time, so partial was the public press, so unfair as a rule to the Labour Party, that I was in favour of establishing a Government newspaper. I thought we could surely issue a Government sheet in which officers of the Crown would publish fair accounts of what was taking place in political life, holding the balance equally between the parties, and I actually had the idea of appointing somebody to brighten the Government Gazette. But , after my experience of Government sheets, I would not vote one penny for such a project, because the Government in power either uses an official publication in its own interests or the officers consider it their duty to boom the Prime Minister and the Government, and hold up the Opposition to ridicule and public contempt. The Prime Minister's Department, and its secretary, to whom the Government have chosen to give another £150 per annum, call for further consideration and criticism. In the second progress report of the Commission appointed to inquire into Navy and Defence administration, I have discovered some very important comments regarding the position of the Auditor General. We know that millions of pounds have been wasted and that gigantic frauds have been perpetrated during the war, and the Royal Commission, in referring to the matter, drew attention to the disabilities of the Auditor-General and the defects of the A u d it Act. That Statute was passed by Parliament with DECEMBER, 1918.] (1918-19). 9577 the idea of making the Auditor-General absolutely independent of any Minister or Government, and responsible only to Parliament. H is position was to have been equal to that of a High Court Judge, so that he could not be removed from office except by resolution of the House. But what are the facts? If the Auditor General requires additional staff, he must go, cap in hand, to Mr M . L . Shepherd, the Prime Minister's secretary. If the statement of the Royal Commission were not before our eyes in Iblack and white, could we believe that such a thing could be possible? The Auditor-General, in order to cope with arrears of work, which the Commission admitted, had to apply to Mr Shepherd for more officers. In paragraph 61 of the report, the Royal Commission, referring to the scope of the Auditor-General's operations, saidWhen it is remembered that the scope of the Auditor-General's operations covers the examination of the accounts of the Commonwealth Treasury, Defence and Navy Departments (including the Woollen Mills, Clothing Factory, Dockyards, Small Arms Factory, Cordite Factory, Harness and Equipment Factory), Commonwealth Bank, General Post Office, Customs Department, Land Tax, Entertainments Tax, Passports, Public Trust, Australian Wheat Board, Soldiers' Repatriation, Commonwealth Line of Steamers, Prime Minister's Department, Department of Home and Territories, Department of Works and Railways, &c, &c, the impossibility of coping with such a task with a staff of 131 permanent officers and 81 temporary employees will be realized, and it is not surprising that the work in connection with numbers of the immense operations indicated above are in some cases years in arrear. It is the opinion of three business men that, owing to the extent of his duties, the Auditor-General's work is years in arrears. That officer applied to the Prime Minister's Department for an increased staff, and I invite honourable members to read what Mr Shepherd had to sayThe Prime Minister has asked me for a report on the observations in par. 27 of the Royal Commission second Progress Report under the heading ""Auditor-General and his functions."" I desire to point out that the only occasion on which any serious disagreement with the Auditor-General on staff matters took place, was in connection with the methods by which he proposed to cope with increased work or bring up arrears of work. Are we on a stage and merely acting a part in a comedy? This officer had the presumption to dictate to the Auditorand General how he shall conduct his work. Did he do that under the instructions the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) ? This £600-a-year-officer, as he then was, saidOn several occasions I suggested that, of his proposals to employ assistance at per day, he should secure the services of petent auditors, and strengthen the staff the higher grades. The last occasion on which this was done was when he submitted, for special sanction of the Prime Minister, quest of the Director cf Naval and Military of £600 a year. Audit for the appointment of 108 temporary clerks at 10s. a day, at an increased cost of £17,000 per annum, to the existing staff of 72, making ISO in all, "" to overtake arrears ot work within twelve months."" The Auditor General stated that "" the present application covers so large a number of additional officers that I do not care to follow the usual course of indicating my personal preliminary approval, but submit the matter for your special sanction."" The usual custom is for the Auditor-General to engage temporary assistance, and submit each. case for formal approval. When submitting this to the Prime Minister, I drew attention to the difficulty of securing good temporary clerks, and suggested that it would be better to appoint a number of qualified auditors. The Prime Minister concurred in this view, and submitted the matter to Cabinet. The Auditor-General is a man of very wide experience, and, with all his faults, is a very able man. And I desire to make an apology, and explain that when I said the Auditor-General was too old for his position I did not know that he was being treated in this fashion by the Prime Minister and his Secretary. I did not know that the Auditor-General had. actually to comefcothe Secretary of the Prime Minister's Department and ask his permission to appoint officers, and that it was in the power of the Secretary to object, and tell the Auditor-General that, instead of asking for temporary men, he ought to seek competent auditors. What does this Secretary know about auditing ? Is he an experienced accountant ? Has he the qualifications of the Auditor-General? We find the Prime Minister submitting the matter to his .Secretary, and asking him to .make a report on the Auditor General's representations. The Royal Commission pointed out that the work of the Auditor-General was years in arrear, because of the scope of his financial audit Mr Higgs. the absence of sufficient officers. The Auditor-General, instead of occupying of the independent position in which we, as the Federal Parliament, sought to place instead him, as the man in control of vast sums, 10s. has to come to the Prime Minister, who comsubmits his case to the Secretary to the in Department, a gentleman who, until the the Government thought fit to give him an a readditional £150, was receiving a salary The Secretary to the Prime Minister goes on to sayAs a result, it was referred to the Treasurer to ascertain his views, and he forwarded a report, furnished by the Secretary to the Treasury, who pointed out that(1) The proposal aims at overtaking arrears in twelve months. (2) The request for such a large number makes one wonder whether the weakness is purely numerical. (3) The proposed increase is of the poorest material. (4) The application suggests the undertaking of an immense amount of detail work, the wisdom of which is not apparent, and may well be doubted. (5) The new temporary officers would form GO per cent, of the staff to audit large and important transactions. At the same time, the Secretary to the Treasurer expressed his realization of the seriousness of the position of refusing staff which the Auditor-General considered necessary. . He made other proposals for overcoming the difficulty.",169
811,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,That rather agrees with the Secretary to the Prime Minister.,171
812,Mr HIGGS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"He apparently agrees to some extent with the (Secretary to the Prime Minister, but, at the same time, the Secretary to the Treasury saw the seriousness of the position created by refusing a staff. In view of the fact that the Treasury accounts, like accounts of every other Department, come under the supervision of the Auditor-General, surely, to most people, it must appear wrong for the Auditor-General to have to submit his case to the Secretary of any Department, whose woTk and whose officers' work have to be supervised and examined by the Auditor-General and his officers ? The Prime Minister made a decision, with the following memorandum : With regard to the recommendations, Nos. 11, 12, 13, in the second progress report dealing with the position of the Auditor-General, I propose to see how effect can best be given thereto. The recoiiKmendations are not free from difficulty, as they involved the questions of the appointment, jjromotion, transfer, and general control of the Audit stall, the approi priation of money for that purpose, and the ""responsiibility to Parliament. I earnestly hope that the press will let the public know exactly how the Auditor General is being treated. I shall for the amendment in the hope that before very long the Parliament will put the Auditor-General in his proper position. If the Auditor-General requires 400' officers to supervise the expenditure of hundreds of millions of money, let us see that he gets them, and if any honourable member feels that the Auditor-General is asking for too many, let him say so in his place here, and allow the Auditor-General, if he so wishes, to defend his position at the bar of the House. At any rate, an end ought to be put to a humiliating position. A high public officer, representing the public of Australia on the one hand, and the members-of this Parliament on the other, who stands between them and the officers who handle the expenditure of vast' sums, ought not to be subject to a subordinate officer. It is said that ""finance is government."" No question that has come before this House could be more v it a l to the public welfare. There are one or two other matters which I desire to call attention, though, weeks ago. to my mind, they are not of such great importance as that to which I have just referred. The Public Service Commissioner comes under the Prime Minister's Department. 'Something is wanting in connection with this branch of the Service. We created a Commissioner in an endeavour to prevent - and I believe we have sucmember's time has expired. ceeded-member s of Parliament appointing their relatives and friends to posiister tions in the Service. Such a practice vailed many years ago, and was, without doubt, a scandal. A member of ParliaCapricornia ment is not in a position very often to judge of the qualifications of the appliany cant, and would prefer somebody else to make a decision; for do we not desire services of the best obtainable officers am not sure, however, that the present method of appointment is the Public Service Commissioner and his officers arrange examinations, and questions n certain subjects are set to the students who present themselves. This system of examination, like every other system in connection with the Public Service, is open to criticism. A lad is sent into a room vote to answer a dozen questions, founded perhaps on the history of the British Empire from the eighteenth century to the present time.",171
813,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,There is a great deal of luck in these examinations.,172

Some time ago I informed the House that, contracts had been let for the construction of twenty-six steel and twenty-four wooden ships. Since then the Western Australian contract, affecting six ships, has been annulled, because labour would not comply with what is known as the Shipbuilding Industrial Agreement. I purpose reading, for the information of the Committee, the last monthly report of the progress of operations in the various shipbuilding yards. This report has not yet been placed before the Cabinet, but I have obtained permission to make its contents public. It is as follows:Williamstown - I enclose herewith for the information of the Cabinet, copy of progress report of the work done at the Williamstown Dockyard during the month of November, 1018. The work of fitting shell deck, tunnel, and other plating in position in the first ship is proceeding as material comes to hand. During the month the framework of the forecastle, bridge, and poop have been erected and rivetted. The counter of the vessel, including the plating,- has also been put in position. The framework of the vessel is completely finished. The whole of the double bottom tank of the second vessel is completely erected and rivetted. One or two strakes of the bottom plating are in position, and all the available tank top plating is in position. The whole of the transverse and longitudinal frames and beams are finished, and are being rivetted ready for erection. The erection w i commence at an early date. The work of rivetting"" the transverse frames is being pushed forward with all despatch. One hundred and forty-one tons of steel plates and six tons of bars from the Broken Hill Proprietary Company's works have been delivered into the yard during the month. Cockatoo Island - A copy of the report from the General Manager, Cockatoo Island Dockyard, attached hereto, shows the position there at 26th November, 1918. As indicated therein, the prepared material amounts to 437 tons, and of this, 365 tons is erected on the slipway. Walsh Island - A copy of the progress report submitted on 29tn November, 1918,. by the Director of Shipbuilding, Walsh Island, which is attached, indicates the position at the yards on the date mentioned. Photographs which accompanied the Director's report are also enclosed, and indicate the stage the shipbuilding work has reached. The plating of the shell of the first vessel is proceeding as material becomes available, and stock material is being utilized to the greatest possible extent. The stern plating is in hand, and part of the upper deck plating has been fitted. On the second vessel the ballast tank is completely framed; the tank margin fitted, and part of the tank top and shell plating is in place. A start has been made with the erection of the transverse and longitudinal framing. The bulkheads are in course of construction. The stern post is to hand, and preparations are being made for erection. The work on the third vessel has so far advanced as to permit of a start being made with the framing. Walkers Limited - Advic e has been received that at 27 th November, 1918, the fourth stern frame and rudder stops had been shipped, while the f if t h had been completed, and a sixth frame is cast and machined with the exception of the drilling. Wooden Ships - Wor k is now proceeding at the yards of Messrs. Kidman and Mayoh on the actual shipbuilding, and progress is being made. More timber continues to be received in the yard, and work is advancing on the preparation thereof. At Messrs. Hughes, Martin, and Washington's yard two keels are laid, and a commencement has been made with the main timbers. Further supplies of timber have been received in the yard, and some additional men put on the work of preparing material for other vessels. The Wallace Power Boat Company have received into the yard large quantities of timber, eighteen frames are erected, aud others are almost ready to be put up. Work generally in the yard is proceeding satisfactorily. Shipment of Plates - Shipments of plates ordered from America continue to come along slowly. The s.s. Ghallamba, which left San Francisco on 22nd October, has arrived in Sydney with 630 tons. The s.s. Bellata and s.s. l l Coolcha., which are en route, have on board 350 and 1,000 tons respectively, and there are also on the water 208 tons in the s.s. Karori, 265 tons on the s.s. Coolgardie, and 480 tons on the s.s. Middlesbury. W it h these deliveries there will remain a balance of about 1,000 tons, and it is.expected that this quantity will be shipped by the end of the year. The delivery of this material will make possible continuous progress, and it may be anticipated that at least two ships will be launched early in the new year. Serious delay has been experienced in the discharging and transhipment of material after arrival in Sydney. I am given to understand, that with the present discharging arrangement and regulations at Sydney, both for timber and case oil, with which the vesselB carrying the plates are partly loaded, this deplorable delay is unavoidable. The seriousness - if the position may be judged by the fact that it took six weeks from the date of arrival of this material in Sydney to reach Melbourne. This is a matter which calls for immediate attention. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited have offered to reduce the price of sectional material for a further contract for eight ships from £23 to £17 per ton, but are not prepared to make any reduction on the £30 per ton they are at present charging for steel plates, and further express a desire that plates be obtained from England or America. MACHINERY. Walsh Island - Progres s of machinery is generally satisfactory, but there is still some difficulty in the manufacture of large forgings. Steps, however, are being taken to overcome this. Erection in the shops has been commenced on engines for No. 3 ship. Thompson and Company, Castlemaine - Pro gress on machinery is generally satisfactory. Erection in shop is continuing on engines for No. 1 ship. There is still some difficulty in the manufacture of large forgings. Steps, however, are being taken to overcome this. Clyde Engineering Company - Design s for principal parts of the main engines have been approved, and work is commencing in the pattern shop. Number of Men Employed - The number of men employed in the shipyards is, approximately, as follows:On Hull Construction and Preparations. Williamstown .. ..

I anticipate that two of the ships will launched nr February; and, in addition, a collier of 7,000 tons now building on what is known as the Adelaide slip. collier, when fit for sea, will release of the coastal vessels which are now carrying coal. We were paying to Broken Hill Proprietary Company per ton for structural steel, and £30 ton for steel plates. The prices high compared with the English American prices, but to these have to be added. We made representawith tions to the company, and they reduced the price of their structural £17 per ton, but we were not successful in getting themto reduce the price steel plates-that is f to i inch plates. They are not too keen about making these plates, because their plant could be more profitably used on other There are probably 300 or 400 men, and perhaps more, working on the collier to which I have referred. I regret  there has not been more progress made m Tasmania. One reason for the delay there is that the engineers' strike prevented necessary machinery, which had been ordered, from being supplied. The honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams) complained of the increase of the payments to ship-owners allowed by the Shipping Board. The ships were all taken over at the Board of Trade Blue-Book rates, the price originally paid being: For passenger ships, from 20s. 6d. to 16s. 6d. per ton, per month, none of the profits going to the owners; and for colliers and cargo .. 196 vessels, from 14s. to 16s. 6d. The 90 Board had the right to increase the rates . . 120 by 10 per cent., but did not take advan.. 188 tage of it . Later, the Imperial Government decided on an increase of rates, .. 14 chiefly because it was thought that a f u n d should be established for re-construction, to meet the heavy losses of the war, and .. 250 also because the owners were being called upon to pay war-time profits tax. The in .. 200 crease did not apply to passenger boat rates, but collier and cargo boat rates were increased about 4s. Boats of those .. 250 classes have suffered most from torpedo .. 125 attacks. Representations were made to 2,415 me on the subject, when it was pointed out that the vessels had been taken over be altogether from the owners, that the owners' earnings were subject to the wartime profits tax, and that if the vessels The were free they could easily earn from 60s. two to 80s. per ton by going to neutral countries for freight. Under these circumthe stances it was thought by the Acting £23 Prime Minister (Mr Watt) that per it would be fair to increase the rate. were Reference has been made to the coaland handling plant at Port Pirie. It was arfreights ranged for before I had anything to do the Department, in consequence of the difficulty that was being experienced steel to in getting coal to the Barrier. There was a big agitation on the subject, and a of deputation waited on the Premier of South Australia, and I think that another deputation came to Melbourne. In the first place, the South Australian Government were going to erect the plant, but work. eventually they asked us to do so. It was felt that vessels should not be delayed as they were being delayed, and we agreed that to erect the plant and the wharf, to be taken over afterwards by South Australia at a valuation. The Barrier wharf at Port Pirie has now ibeen acquired by the Commonwealth Government, under the Lands Acquisition Aot, at a cost of £82,500. The wharf is a very valuable one. A mechanical coal-handling plant has been erected on the wharf at a total cost to date of £74,759 8s. 6d. The working expenses of the wharf to date total £24,233 6s. 5d., and the earnings have amounted to £37,852 0s. 7d. The working expenses for the month of October were £2,092 13s. 6d.; and the earnings for the same period, £3,230 Is. 5d. On that basis the earnings for a year would be £38,760. In a comparative statement it would be necessary to show against this the working expenses, plus interest on outlay, and depreciation. The total outlay on the wharf and, plant to date amounts to £157,500. The approximate earnings for twelve months are £3S,760; the approximate working expenses for twelve months are £25,200; interest at 5 per cent, on the outlay of £157,500, £7,875; depreciation, at 15 per cent., on £75,000 of plant, £11,250; depreciation, at 5 per cent., on £20,000 for the wharf, £1,000. These figures show an approximate annual loss of £6,540. The hand-labour cost of dealing with the coal was 2s. 3d. a ton, and the cost-of dealing with it with machinery is Is. 4d. a ton.",173

833,Mr BOYD,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"Henty) [2.31] - The Minister has dealt with a very interesting statement in regard to the working of the coal discharging appliances at Port Pirie, and during the adjournment I have taken the trouble to secure some reports which were in my desk dealing with the plant. I did not expect the matter to come before Parliament, but I was interested in it because the shipping officials of the Commonwealth Government had endeavoured to force the hands of the Melbourne Harbor Trust, of which I am a Commissioner, to follow the policy adopted in South Australia and install grabs for the handling of coal. As a Trust we were successf ul in withstanding that pressure, not only from persons interested, but also from the Commonwealth Government. I do not hesitate to say that the machinery on the Port Pirie wharf has quite failed to achieve the purpose for which it was erected.. It was put up without tenders having been called, by a firm which was certainly competent enough to erect machinery of that kind, but an understanding was arrived at that the four gantries, one opposite each hatch on a vessel, would average 60 tons per hour. That is to say, a vessel would be guaranteed a discharge of 240 tons per hour from the hold. The best results that have 'been obtained so far were secured during the months of June and July of this year, when 106 tons per hour per ship were discharged, as against the promised 240 tons per hour per ship. Each grab averaged 26i tons per hour, instead of the promised 60 tons per hour. The reports which I have in my possession were prepared by the engineer of the Melbourne Harbor Trust, and the engineer of the South Australian Harbor Board foT the guidance of their respective bodies in the matter of the expenditure of money. Before the Melbourne Harbor Trust would contemplate launching out on an expenditure of £250,000 with the responsibility for its financial success it felt that it must be perfectly satisfied that it would secure a proper up-to-date plant that would yield certain results. The statement has been made by the Shipping Board that the Port Pirie appliances have discharged coal at a cost of Is. 3d. per hour. This is. a report submitted to the South Australian Harbor Board:Admiral Clarkson reported that coal is now being discharged by the Port Pirie appliances at Is. 3d. per ton, whereas it is costing to do the some by hand. This is, in the opinion of the Board (Supply and Tender Board), a misrepresentation of the facts. If coal is costing 2s. 3d. per ton gross, including interest, maintenance of plant, provision of steam winches, &c, it .is quite exceptional, and not the ruling rate, where the work is carried on under proper conditions, and it cannot be credited that the gantries do the work at Is. 3d. per ton gross. The cost of labour has been checked by reliable means and found to be from lOd. to Is. for shore labour, and to this must be added labour and use of ship's winches for dragging grabs into the sides and ends of holds. The serious error, however, is the non-inclusion of the cost of maintenance and renewals of plant, and the much heavier items of interest and depreciation. These gears (constructed at Port Pirie) are considered by engineers to be on the light side, frequent breakdowns occur, and a careful estimate by a prominent engineer who made a. close study of the work, is that repairs represent a charge of 4 per cent, on the estimated cost of £80,000, and interest and depreciation another 10 per cent.; the latter will probably exceed 12} per cent. The coal consumed was estimated at 4.10d. per ton of coal discharged. There have been only 133,000 tons of coal worked at the gantries since the erection of the plant up to the end of July, 1918, which is equal to 177,000 tons per year, or 3,400 per week. The cost may be summarized thus:Labour, say . . lO.oOd. per ton Coal .. .. . . 4.10d. per ton Repairs, at 4 per cent. . . 4.34d. per ton Interest .and depreciation, 12J per cent. .. 13.02d. per tonTotal 31.90d. per ton Overtime, which is a big factor, is a further charge against the ship, and has not been included, but engineering supervision and proportion of administration expenses must of necessity be added. Comparison of the actual cost of Port Adelaide of putting some 60,000 tons into trucks or heaps during the year has been afforded the Board. This was found to be an average of Is. Sd. per ton, including winches, interest on and upkeep of gear, &c. The rate of discharge at Port Pirie averaged, throughout June and July, 106 tons per ship hour (which averages 26i tons per grab), while two colliers, under the old methods at Port Adelaide, averaged 125 tons per ship hour, which, in the opinion of the Board, goes to show that, with proper Mr Boyd. supervision and the willingness of the men to work, the older method is still in advance of the best the Port Pirie gantries have done. That is a very serious statement, made by a Board responsible for the effective working of these machines. The assertion was made that these gantries would discharge 60 tons of coal per hour, but 2s. 3d. the very best result obtained was on the s.s. Aeon on the 14th March, 1918, where the output, of coal was 35.73 tons per hour.  ber is quoting from a report hy Mr. Arthur Searcy. He is prejudiced against this plant.",176
834,Mr TTJDOH,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"At any rate, he is the State Engineer in South Australia for the people who own this plant, but will not pay us for it . ",177
835,Mr BOYD,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"Hi s opinion is backed up by that of other men. The engineer who advises the Melbourne Harbor Trust, is as competent a man as can he found in Australia.",177
836,Mr TUDOR,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"The Commonwealth would have engaged him for lighthouse work, but he preferred - to remain with the Melbourne Harbor Trust.",177
837,Mr BOYD,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"Yes ; we treated him well. This is his reportAttention is drawn to the results attained in working s.s. Aeon, on 14th March, 1918, where the average rate per grab hour reached 35.73 tons-the highest rate attained so far. The precaution was taken, however, of clearing the between decks at Wallaroo before proceeding to Port Pirie, as the grabs do not do good work in ships with these decks full of coal. The positive test of the work is, however, not the grab-hour, but the ship-hour average, as the longest hatch determines the length of time the vessel is detained. In this connection, it is noted that the Chronos, in October, discharging by the old method, averaged 91.5 tons per ship hour, which is only 2J tons less than the best rate at the new gears. I visited Port Pirie with the Melbourne Harbor Trust Commissioners in June last foT the expTess purpose of looking at this plant, wath a view to examining it in detail, so that we should commit no blunder in spending £250,000, and be responsible for any failure that might occur. As we have to handle over 1,000,000 tons of coalper annum, it is very necessary for us to economize, even if the economy effected be ever so little per ton. Speaking from my knowledge of shipping, I say that these grabs, if they are to be worked successfully, must be used on vessels specially built for them. The Commonwealth are now sending to Port Pirie only ships that have no 'tween decks.  worked successfully without 'tween decks. The collier which is being built at Cockatoo Island is to be specially fitted for this trade.",177
838,Mr BOYD,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"It is quite evident that vessels must be built to suit these grabs. The vessel which was being discharged at Port Pirie while the Harbor Trust Commissioners were there had no 'tween decks. Our engineer says The vessel which was being discharged at the time of the Commissioners' visit had no 'tween decks, and I understand, as far as sible, only that class of vessel is now sent Port Pirie. The cost of discharging coal in Melbourne with the winch and basket system is about Is. lOd. per ton. The argument put up to the Melbourne Harbor Trust by the Shipping Controller, in urging us to rush into this matter, was: "" It is an urgent matter to get the ships away. The Commonwealth Government will find the money. All that you have to do is put up the plant."" As business men, I think we said, ""Very well. We presume that the Commonwealth Government will find the money, and we will put up the plant. If our engineer makes an estimate of what this would have cost in normal'times before the war, and shows that it costs so much at the present time, say, for the sake of argument, an extra £100,000, on what would have cost £100,000 previously, you will debit us with the £100,000 only, and not with the extra cost."" But that was a different proposition altogether. They wanted us to erect the machinery, and, subsequently, be prepared to find the. whole of the capital. They tried to bring pressure to bear on the Harbor Trust; but they happened to strike a Board of men who were not ready to submit to pressure. We were told that the easiest way of overcoming the difficulty was to put a price of 2s. 6d. per ton on our charges for discharging coal. Although the public are well aware of the present cost, we were told not to mind what the cost would be by the installation of these grabs, because the public would have to pay. That was certainly one way of getting out of the difficulty. It might suit the man operating the machinery, but it be was a totally different matter to the people who had to pay. When these things are investigated at first hand, and when one knows the methods of spending money adopted under the War Precautions Act, in order to achieve certain objects, it makes one hesitate, and say that closer investigation should be made into many of these propositions before they are rushed on to the public, and before money is squandered. There ought to be a more economical pos- method of shipbuilding and ship repairto ing. A little while ago L requested the Government to send a vessel owned by the State of Victoria to search among the islands for the missing boat's crew of the barque John Murray, which had been wrecked. The Assistant Minister for the  ter in every way in his power, and when we placed it before the Treasurer, he consented to pay the cost, but asked me to submit an estimate of what expenditure waslikely to be incurred by the expedition. I made inquiries from shipbuilders and other people as to what their charges would be, and I arrived at an estimate, which I submitted to the Acting Prime Minister. He said, "" Very well, I will give you authority to spend £500 a month for three months."" By-and-by, the bills came in, and at a later date I shall have to face the Treasurer and explain why the expenditure has been greater than I said it would be. Irastead of receiving from the Government Dockyard, as I anticipated, a bill for £250 for fitting up the vessel, I got a bill for £467, or £217 above the estimate. It is all very well to deal in that way with Government work, but if the dockyard is to secure the private work which is necessary to its success, it will not do for it to practically double its estimates. The policy of shipbuilding in Australia, as laid down by the Government, is an excellent one if vessels can be built here as economically as they can be constructed abroad. I have no fault to find with the policy, but 1 would urge upon the Government that it is useless to build our own ships unless we intend also to train our own men and officers to staff them. ""Why should our vessels be manned by Dagoes, Turks, and other foreigners, as many ships are today? We have had British ships coming into this port without a solitary British sailor on board; latterly we have had British ships coming in with foreigners in charge of them. I do not anticipate that the fleet ofvessels purchased by the Government will ever be disbanded, and if additions are to be made to that fleet the Government should see that it is manned by Australian officers and men.  sideration the question of training' an Australian mercantile marine. The suggestion is that some officers should be trained at Jervis Bay.",178
839,Mr BOYD,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I know that my honourable friend takes a very keen interest in this matter, and so far as I know he is doing very well in his Department. He is certainly always ready to meet in a friendly spirit any suggestions' made to bim. The Government have already done something towards the training of their own officers. They had about sixteen apprentices on the Shandon and the John Murray, but upon the loss of the latter vessel some of the apprentices had to be transferred to steam-ships. I would remind honourable - members that it is impossible to train a sailor on a steam-ship. A sailor can only ihe trained on a "" windjammer."" When I was at sea, those who had had only - steam-ship experience used to be spoken of as "" Western Ocean paintscrubbers."" The beet illustration I can give in support of my assertion that it is impossible to train a sailor on a steamship is the fact that when the Titanic had her aide ripped out by coming into contact with an iceberg in the Western Ocean it was found that there was not a sailor on board who could pull an oar or steer a boat. It is of the utmost importance that we should train not only our own officers, .but our own men. ' - Without egotism, I think I can ""claim to speak with authority as to whether or . not the average Australian youth has a love of the sea. In connection with the training-Tship John Murray, I had to deal with a number of Australian youths "" full of spirit."" Not one out of every twenty of the hundreds that passed through the hands of those controlling that vessel had the slightest notion of going to sea. I knew that the best way to implant in these boys a love of the sea was to give them a cruise or two on a ship under full sail. We adopted that course, with the Tesult that 70 per cent, of these lads went to sea, although when they joined the vessel they had no intention of doing so. Of those who, on leaving the John Murray, went ashore, many are constantly asking me to get them a ship. A love of the sea is implanted in the hearts of the youth of every country, and particularly in the hearts of British youths. We have to find an outlet for those whom we train, and since we are building ships of our own, we ought to train our own youths.  able member train them?",179
840,Mr BOYD,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"Apprentice s ought to be trained on a sailing vessel. If the Shandon, which is owned by the Commonwealth, were fitted up in the 'tween decks on the same principle as the Belgian training ship L'Avenir, which recently visited these shores, and which had sixty cadets on board, we should be able to carry in the lower hold of the vessel sufficient cargo to liquidate the greater part of the cost of using her as a training ship.  ing would be required ?",179
841,Mr BOYD,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"An ordinary seaman could be trained for all practical purposes in two years. An officer, however, under the Marine Act, must have had four years' actual experience at sea. During the war we have lost over 15,000 British officers in the mercantile marine, and many vessels arriving here have had on board only one certificated officer.  fco the submarines ?",179

But Australians as a whole have gone to sea less than other nationalities have done.

There is also the disadnotwith- vantage that a married man who goes to sea is away from his wife and family for weeks and months at a stretch. Some sea captains on the coast see their families only for a day or a night about every month. Provision was made in the Navigation Act to make the lif e of the sailor more attractive, but, owing to the war, and a request from the British Government, that Statute has never been put into operation.

If there is any officer in the Commonwealth Service who should have the utmost freedom in the discharge we to of his duties and the choice of his officers,'it is the gentleman to whom we look for the proper scrutiny of the national accounts. The auditing of the Commonwealth accounts is estimated to cost this year £67,529, as oomparedj with last year's cost of £ 4 6 , 4 4 1, showing an increase of £21,088. I arrive at those figures in this way: The amount set down for the Auditor-General's Office is £42,367 , and to that must be added £19,340 to be covered and credited to Division 15. The latter sum is to be paid by some other Department, so that it is a charge the revenue of the country. also on page 25 another amount of £5,822 to be recovered. diture may be justified, but we are titled to know the reason for it . Is expenditure to continue increasing as has done during the last year ? We know that owing to war conditions and ments. the expenditure of large sums of loan money the work of the A u d it Office much heavier than it was, but even lowing for that extra work the increase in the cost of the office seems very great. I hope the Acting Prime Minister will give the Committee some information the subject and an assurance that A u d it Office and the Prime Minister's Office are working harmoniously toFederal gether, and that the Auditor-General will in future have a free hand in ing ,out his duties. Another point upon which I desire touch is the enormous expenditure f the rental of public offices. One may walk from Albert-street, East Melbourne, to the Wool Exchange, in King-street, and find in nearly every street rented premises occupied by the Government. It is about time we adopted mendation of some of the departmental officers that the Commonwealth should erect an office building providing all the accommodation required for Federal Deof partments and services which will be peraccommodation. manently located in Melbourne.",181

863,Mr FINLAYSON,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I shall refer to ""sack"" the matter later. A good deal has been said about the growing expenditure on publicity which is indulged in by the t Prime Minister. The intelligence officers lately become rather a joke. It as if there is developing in Australia a peculiar institution along the - lines of self-advertisement, and the Prime Minister has set a very furious pace in this particular work. Of course, there can d be no objection to a reasonable amount of journalistic advertisement as to the conour ditions of Australia and the work of the « Government generally; but I do take strong exception to the increasing expenditure on a publicity policy that is onesided. The objections of honourable members on this side to the partial character of the censorship is aggravated by the publicity work of the Prime Minister's Department, because, so far as I have been able to follow such activities, they are nothing else but a eulogy of the Prime Minister and the Government. Whatever our opinion in politics may be, we all recognise that there are two sides to every question, and that in order to arrive at the truth , and get a correct view of matters one has to put before the public and one's mind, a fairly impartial view of both sides. The trouble is that the work of this officer has been of an entirely partial or party character.",182
864,Mr FALKINER,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,That is party prejudice !,183
865,Mr FINLAYSON,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"It is borne out by fact. I know when an article is biased against me and my party, and when it is written with the idea of giving a fair interpretation of the work going on. The publicity agent, or intelligence officer, has become an instrument of journalistic warfare. He has simply developed, perhaps not from choice on his part, but acting under directions, into the writerup of the doings of the Government; in short, he has become a journalistic "" barracker ' ' of the - Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) and the Government. Probably the Acting Prime Minister may not be altogether to blame, because he has evidently taken his cue from a higher authority. This year an invitation was sent out to the Commonwealth Government to send home a press delegation of twelve journalists, who were expected to be able to give us first-hand and impartial information about what was doing on the other side of the world. The selection of those gentlemen was of a very disagreeable character, in that eleven of them were of one view in politics. one man who could, in any sense, represent the Opposition view of politics was already in England, and advantage was taken of his presence there to add him to the delegation. So far as we have seen the delegation has accomplished nothing. I am not aware of their inquiries or observations being put on record.",183

868,Mr FINLAYSON,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"That is very in teresting. I do not know whether the Commonwealth is paying the expenses of this delegation, for I can find no item in the Estimates to cover them. The fact remains that those gentlemen were selected to give the people of Australia first-hand information in regard to the war and operations in Great Britain , and I have been able to get a certain amount of information regarding them from the London newspapers. Lord Beaverbrook, who issued the invitation to the Commonwealth Government on behalf of the I m perial Government, was approached, and it waa pointed out to him that the twelve gentlemen selected by the Acting Prime Minister (Mr W at t ) could represent only one view of politics, and, therefore, oould not be accepted as at all representative of the journalism of Australia. The following is a letter written on behalf of Lord Beaverbrook, apparently by his secretary, to the editor of the Daily Herald, Adelaide: Ministry of Information, Norfolk-street, Strand, London, W.C. 2nd September, 1918. Dear Sir, I am desired by the Minister for Information (Lord Beaverbrook) to acknowledge your extremely interesting letter of 25th June, and to say that he must appreciate your courtesy in drawing his attention to the informative article which appeared in the 22nd and 24th June issues of the Daily Herald. He desires me to point out, however, that the selection of the press delegates from Australia was left entirely to that Government. You will naturally appreciate the fact that here, in London, it is not possible for us to be closely in touch with local affairs, and, consequently, in the face of,each delegation of journalists from The the Dominions, the selection of the delegates is left entirely. to the Dominion Governments. The intention of His Majesty's Government in extending the invitation was that the delegation should represent' all sections of the press of Australia, and on that subject they regard the judgment of the Commonwealth Government as the only authority which it is possible for them to accept. Yours faithfully. A. P. HOLT. That was the original intention, and from that point of view no objection can be taken; but the - selection of the eleven gentlemen of one particular colour was commented on also by newspapers on"" the other side of the world. minster Gazette says: . .

LABOUR UNREST CAUSE. Further, he said that this Department employed men to spy upon the Labour movements in this country. He had personal knowledge of cases where important leaders connected 'with the trade union movement had been bought by the Department in order that they might spy upon their fellows, and he believed that it would be safe to say that some of the agents employed had gone to the length of deliberately inciting to strikes and to outrage. Then the British Australasian, a paper published in London, had a word to sayThe Australian Labour press is up in arms against what it describes as the gross favouritism shown by Mr Watt of papers favouring his own policy, and his scandalous unfairness to the Labour press in allotting the invitations from the British Government to take part in the Australian press mission to England. Lord Beaverbrook asked for a thoroughly representative delegation, and trusted Mr Watt to provide it. The closing part of the article isRecognising this, Mr Watt evidently threw away any troublesome idea of attempting to. be fair, and went at the job as a veTy ordinary politician, using his privilege, first to down his opponent, the Labour party, by allotting them a share in the mission outrageously below that due to their numbers and influence, and next to please those sections of his own press whose favour might be of most value to the Government. The press mission cannot fail to be useful in giving Australia, through its mission, a first hand knowledge of men and matters here, but The West- it would have been much more useful, and would not have aroused justifiable bitterness among the readers of important Labour journals, if the latter had been treated with some semblance of justice. Those are all the extracts I propose to read, with a desire to show that, even i u Great Britan today, it is recognised that the press delegation was unfairly and unreasonably chosen, and that only one point of view was put by it before the people of Great Britain and Europe. The same thing will probably occur when the delegation returns to Australia and presents a report or makes a public statement.",183

886,Mr FINLAYSON,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"No ; it is not-if c means everything to me. On page 22.' of the Estimates there is an item ""Tropical diseases-contributio n to Imperial Fund for investigation of . "" I refer to this matter because there has been brought before honourable members, in a very con- pointed and emphatic way, the necessity for consideration being given to the preCourier sence of certain diseases in Australia, particularly the hook-worm disease. Unfortunately, this disease is best known in the coastal districts of Queensland, but it threatens to spread over Australia, and of do incalculable harm. On Friday of last, week I put some questions to the Act in g Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr . Greene), which I shall venture to repeat. The questions were1. Whether any proposals have been submitted to the Commonwealth Government in the direction of combating the hook-worm disease in Australia? 2. If so, what is the nature of those proposals ? 3. Has the Government come to any decisionon the matter? 4. If not, will the matter receive early and favourable consideration? The replies were1. Yes, the subject was fully discussed by the representative of the Rockefeller foundation of the United States of America, with representatives of the Institute of Tropical Medicine, the Commonwealth Quarantine Department, and - myself, with the result that I made certain proposals to Cabinet. 2. The Government decided(a) To accept the offer of co-operation the Rockefeller Foundation in the work of exterminating the disease. (6) To provide a sum of £35,000, conditional on the Queensland Government providing a similar sum. The Rockefeller Foundation has agreed to find £30,000, making a total of £100,000, the expenditure to extend over a period of five years. (oy That the work should be carried on in close co-operation with the of Tropical Medicine, and under the control of committees representing that body and the Commonwealth and State Governments. Dr Waite, of the Rockefeller Foundation, to be in charge of the field work. {d) That Queensland should be divided into than they have received. four districts, each with a staff of two medical and four lay assistants. (e) That after the work of eradication in Queensland has - been well advanced, arrangements be made with other States to conduct surveys of areas likely to be affected, and, sary, to carry out extermination measures. 3. Immediately on the Government decision, I brought the matter before the Honourable J. Huxham, Minister of Health, of Queensland, who undertook to submit it to his colleagues, and apprise me of their decision 4. As will be seen, the Government have already given the matter most favourable consideration, and are now only waiting for the concurrence of the Queensland Government in order to commence active operations. I received information today that the Queensland Government had agreed to adopt the recommendation to come to the arrangement suggested by the M in ister when replying to those questions. The Commonwealth Government, the Queensland Government, and the Rockefeller Foundation have agreed upon active measures for preventing the further spread of this disease and its eradication from Queensland. Some honourable members attended a lecture delivered in Melbourne recently by Dr Waite. much to my regret that I could not heari t , because I have been in regular communication with the doctor since he arrived from America, and am interested in his work. However, subsequently in conversation he gave me some startling facts concerning the disease and the danger which menaces Australia, but he said that it could be easily combated, and already a number of Queensland municipalities have adopted a sanitary by system suggested by him which has greatly improved' matters. Quite a number of diseases to which the human race is liable are so> widespread that scarcely a nation can escape them. The existence of these diseases will challenge our loyalty and patriotism more than many recent occurrences. The rapid spread of Spanish influenza must have Institute created concern in the minds of many persons, and it is a matter for satisfaction that the energetic measures of the Quarantine Department have so far kept it out of Australia. There are other diseases that demand closer attention It is a cheering thing that the State Governments have commenced to combat venereal disease, which is so prevalent in the community today. The hook worm disease is of little account compared with veneif necesreal disease, tuberculosis, and cancer.",185
887,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,The hook worm disease is not a little matter.,186
888,Mr FINLAYSON,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,It is easily eradicated compared - with the other' diseases I have mentioned.,186

890,Mr FINLAYSON,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"We have often been told of sure and certain cures for consumption, but none of them has yet proved entirely satisfactory, whereas the measures taken to combat the hook worm disease have given satisfactory results. The community has not begun to think federally in regard to health. It has not grasped the idea that whether the State authorities are active or indifferent, it is the duty of the Federal Parliament to consider the national health of Australia. ""Unfortunately we have power It was only to prevent the introduction of diseases. We can prevent persons who are diseased from entering Australia, t ut we can do nothing with those who are already within the Commonwealth. This limitation of our powers is a defect of the Constitution, because it stultifies our effectiveness and enables diseases tospread freely which might be combated with good results. Each State is doing something in fighting disease, but there is no grand national effort. Ever since I have been in this Parliament, I have been directing attention to the signs of deterioration in the manhood of Australia, a deterioration not so great, or even proportionately so great, as that in other countries, but still very serious. The medical examinations made during the war proved that a startling number of men who should have been in their prime were unfit for military service. country there is so much opportunity for physical development, and the conditions are so conducive to healthy living, that it should not have happened that 25 per cent., speaking generally, of the men who wished to enlist for active service were rejected as inefficient.

Unfortunately, Australia has done practically nothing towards eradicating these dangers, though the health of the community should be the chief concern of every Government. We cannot have a strong nation from weak citizens, and physical, mental, and moral efficiency require the presence of sound minds in sound bodies. I know of nothing more worthy of the attention of the Government than the combating of diseases that are playing havoc with the health of the men and women of the present day, and menacing the happiness of future generations.

If the honourable member for Bass (Mr Jensen) does not speak to night, honourable members will have about four and a half hours in which to discuss, these Estimates. I protest against this method of leaving the discussion of such important matter until practically the the last few hours of the session'. I have in always objected to this procedure.

I am informed that £55.000 has been spent on this machinery. The members of the Local Repatriation Committee have resigned, and will not work further with Senator Millen.

I wish to revert to the position of the Auditor-General's office. On page 24 of the Royal Commission's report on Navy A d ministration appears this paragraphThe same difficulties with which we were oonfronted when dealing 'with the relations of the Auditor-General with the Defence Department are met with when considering the position in regard to the Navy Department. The inadequacy of the Auditor-General's stafl is accountable, to a large extent, for the delays which occurred in auditing accounts of the stores and numerous activities under naval control. May I - remind honourable members of the remarks of the honourable member for  honoVable member for Wide Bay (Mr . CorseJ; who said there was nothing in structive whatever in the remarks we were makirJg on these Estimates. If the honourable member for Wide Bay had listened to my remarks about the Auditor General he would recognise that they are very vital to the Commonwealth; but he tried to prompt the honourable member for Echuca to say something disagreeable, improper, and unjust. The report of the Royal Commission says: Until this is remedied, there is,little prospect of any marked improvement. Whilst there is a certain measure of internal check in the accounts section, it is not of such a systematic character as would warrant the Auditor-General in accepting it as part of his statutory audit. The installation of a proper checking staff would lessen materially the clerical work, and effect a considerable saving in salaries. As to the stores the report says: In regard to the audit of the stores, we have found in some cases that the stock-taking is two years in arrears. Whilst the direct blame for this cannot be laid upon the Auditor General, we consider that more pressure might be exerted by his officers to insure promptitude in dealing with this important matter. - It There have been many frauds in connection with the Defence Department, and without a doubt' many more frauds would have been disclosed if the Auditor General had sufficient officers to enable him to keep up with his audit. How is it possible, with an audit two years in arrear, to keep proper control over the vast expenditure that is taking place at the present time in the various Departments ?

But, Mr At k in 5 son, if you will look at item 13, subdivision 3, of the Prime Minister's Department, you will see that £1,000 is provided for expenses in connection with the visits of Commonwealth Ministers to London. I desire to know why this money is being spent. The Temporary Chairman is quite right in ascertaining whether I am in order or not-whethe r I know what I am talking about-indeed , I am only sorry that he does not apply the same criticism to some honourable members on the other side, for I am sure they require it sometimes. I say that, Mr . Atkinson, without in any way reflecting on, you. The estimated cost of this visit to London is £ 1 , 0 0 0 ; but, of course, when all is over we shall find that, although the British Government have paid the expenses of tFose gentlemen for many months, the £1,000 is not sufficient. The Age cabled to their London correspondent, and he repliedMr Hughes's contemptuous treatment of Sir Joseph Cook is a matter of common knowledge among the officials at Australia House. That is where the High Commissioner is located-that expensive building which cost nearly £700,000, and is actually costing £9,500 per annum for upkeepI t was so flagrant that it was impossible for any one associated with either of them to be of unaware of it. The denial of the statements made in my letter to the Age was apparently The Prime based upon Mr Hughes and Mr Cook having Of course, the reconciliation was quite natural.

But no equivocal denial by Mr Hughes or Sir Joseph Cook, and no solemn declaration, with or without mental reservation, can alter the that Mr Hughes consistently, continuously, and contemptuously ignored Sir Joseph (Mr Cook for several months. The way in which that is written proves to my mind that this man is a very able correspondent. The reply is very effectively done, and stamps him, I venture to say, as an honest man who has a reputation to maintain- a man who has no personal reason or motive for trying to damage or ridicule either the Prime M i nister (Mr Hughes) or the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook). He did his duty to his paper and to Australia in stating the facts. Those two Ministers were never in consultation as they ought to have been. They went from here to represent this country, and we were told in the Ministerial statement that they were staying in London in order to attend to our shipping and the sale of our products. Y e t they were not meeting at all. I have referred to the dignity and the manner of the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook), and I am quite satisfied that these would have greatly helped the Prime Minister in discussing business problems with the British authorities.

967,Mr HIGGS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"It is characteristic to some extent of the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook), though one does expect more urbanity from him.

I do not mind a man getting angry and fighting tooth and nail in Opposition, because it is his duty. These two Ministers went from Australia, and were presumed to be doing their best in the interests of Australian producers; but they got at loggerheads simple reason that the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) cannot bear any one to get any of the reflected glory that attaches to his position. He must have the whole of the limelight.

In any case, there would have been a burst up. As I have often said, the Prime Minister is a very excellent lieutenant, but is a bad leader.

It is true that one gets a little prestige, but, after all, there are compensations in being out of office. There is the irresponsibility, and the plenitude of time to indulge a capacity for talk. Those two Ministers were at loggerheads, and it is due to the Age that the reply of the correspondent should appear in Hansard. His statement continuesThese facts are known to a score of people. Sir Joseph Cook himself confided his grievance as to the treatment he had received from Mr. Hughes to so many personB that he could for the scarcely have expected that it would remain a secret; but he did not desire publication of it - no t at least before he returned to Australia and consulted his party. And so on, in the same strain. It all goes to show that the representative of the Age in London is telling the truth . I should now like to say a few words about the High Commissioner's office. We have very great respect, most of us, for Mr Andrew Fisher, and we were plad to see him appointed to the position. We thought that he would combine certain work, such as business matters, with his duties as a social figure head. Australia, of course, requires to be represented in London by somebody at whom gentlemen like Professor Tucker may not shudder when the appointment is made known. Honourable members may remember that, not lonqago, in an essay or article, Professor Tucker said, "" One sometimes shudders when one sees the gentlemen who go Home to represent Australia in London.""

The Commissioner who investigated the administration of the Federal Territory condemned most scathingly some of the officers who were sent to audit the accounts there, but nothing was done. Parliament, in its desire to treat the public servants with justice, has made it almost impossible to sack them, no matter what the report on their conduct may be. Sooner or later this matter will have to be dealt with by one or other of the political parties. The public servants must have been so named by an unconscious humorist, because, instead of being the servants of the public, they are rapidy making the public their servants. Members of Parliament from time to time receive circulars mentioning the grievances of the Service, but I never heard any statement by public servants of what is due by them to the public. Several officials were unfavorably commented on by the Commissioner, who investigated the administration of the Federal Territory, but they still remain in the Public Service, although one or two of them may have had their positions changed. The famous Defence report referred scathingly to the officers of the Auditor-General's Department.",199

No business house would pass Estimates like these. In addition to the pay of the ordinary clerks, sub-accountants, messengers, and other officials at Australia House, £4,500 is paid to temporarv assistants and typists, and £4,500 goes on stationery, travelling, and incidental expenses.

978,Mr HIGGS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,Who limited them in this way ?,200
979,Mr MCGRATH,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"It is generally understood that while the Prime M in ister (Mr Hughes) has been ' in Great Britain , the powers of the High Commissioner have been curtailed. He cannot do anything without cabling to Australia. Australia House has cost this country a lot of money. It occupies as good a site as there is in London, and is a splendid building, and a credit to Australia; but we should carefully watch the expenditure there. During the war it was a meetingplace for Australians, and was used largely for war purposes. The pensions paid there are considerable. These pensions go to the next-of-kin of lads who fell, living that m the United Kingdom, or to wounded men who have settled there. It was not intended, I think, that the pensions work, and other work, should be done by persons who have never been to Australia. Too many men in Australia House know nothing of this country, and the M i nistry should make a change in that matter. The chief clerk is an Englishman. I do not say that he is any the worse for that, but such men do not understand Australian conditions. The officer who has to assess pensions, and determine. the amounts payable, has not been to Australia, and probably does not know the spirit that animated this Parliament when it passed the War Pensions Act. Many cases of injustice to soldiers or their relatives came under my notice. The whole place has a military tone! Every one is in uniform.

980,Mr MCGRATH,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I do not object to having to send up my name, but I object to having to give it to a man in uniform. The military should not have charge of everything.",201
981,Mr GREGORY,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,It is rarely that you see a discharged soldier's badge on the uniforms of men in these positions.,201
982,Mr MCGRATH,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"Some of our wounded soldiers filled positions at Australia House, but a number of those working there have not been to Australia. The fact that a man is an Australian seems to preclude him from getting a job there. Very few Australian soldiers above the rank of staff-sergeant were employed there. The Government should see that the Pensions Office is not controlled by the military. Any military officer who may be working there should dress in civilian clothes, and be addressed by a civilian title. There is a man named Smart in charge of the PubliciW Pranch. He runs the ANZAC newspaper. He is a young Australian, eligible for military service, but he did not enlist. I saw him one day in civilian clothes, but a day or two afterwards he appeared in khaki with a couple of stars on his shoulder. Although he had not joined the Australian Imperial Porce, he had pulled the strings somehow and been made a lieutenant. insult to the u n if o rm that men can secure commissions and go about London looking for salutes from the lads who have come over from France. I would like to know when the ANZAC newspaper is to cease publication. I do not know that there is very much necessity for it , except to find positions for a number of men, some of whom were eligibles. In any case, it is a newspaper of a political character, which is everlastingly booming the National Government. It s alleged purpose is to supply definite and accurate in formation to Australians abroad. Now that the war is over, the expenditure in curred in publishing this newspaper could be avoided. This Lieutenant Smart was also running an open-air cinematograph show on Trafalgar-square. What useful purpose it was fulfil l in g I do not know, but it cost Australia hundreds of pounds. In fact, the expenditure incurred by Lieutenant Smart in running the ANZAC newspaper and the various shows which he was controlling will startle Australia when it becomes known. Surely it is time in structions were given to him to cease squandering any further money. The sum of £9,500 is provided on these Estimates for the upkeep of Australia House. Another item provides for municipal taxation, and still another for a caretaker. I do not know how this £9,500 is to be spent. One floor of Australia House was commandeered by the British m i l i tary authorities, and i suppose that they are paying rent to the Australian Government. Fortunately, we have in London one big Australian, in the shape of the Secretary to the High Commissioner's Office. I was very pleased when word came through that Mr Box had been appointed to the position. He is the right man in the right place. We should not allow any Australian to remain in the High Commissioner's Office for more than seven years. An y man who remains away from Australia for a longer period must get out of touch with it . There are nine men in the office of the New South Wales Agent-General, and I am assured that not one of them is an Australian. Most of the Victorian Agent-General's staff have not seen Australia. Mr Slater, the honI t is an orable member for Dundas in the Victorian State House, who has an orchard at Mildura, thought that he would test the knowledge of one gentleman in Sir Peter MCBride's office, and made inquiries from him about the productions of Mildura. Afterwards he told me that it was laughable to hear this officer explain what M i l dura was capable of producing. Of course, he could not say very much, because he had never been to Australia. I urge the Commonwealth Government to see that qualified public servants in Australia, men who know Australia well, and have proved good officers in their Departments, should be given the posts that become vacant on the High Commissioner's staff. I am satisfied that they would do good work for Australia. There should be no necessity for appointing any one in England to a position in Australia House.",201
983,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,How many Australians are there in Australia House?,202
984,Mr MCGRATH,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I do not know, but I should say that there were full y 100 employed there during the war. The Commonwealth Bank has a branch in Australia House. No man has faced greater difficulties than has Mr Campion, the manager of that branch. The British military authorities did their level best to squash the operations of the Bank by conscripting every available man in it , and when Mr Campion protested, the military tribunal told him that there was no heed to have a branch of the Commonwealth Bank in London, because the private banks could do all the work it could do. The staffs of private banks were exempted, but our men were taken. As a result, Mr . Campion had to train a staff of girls to do the work of the Bank. Sir MCCheyne Anderson was very hostile to the instituthose tion. He closed one branch at Lark Hill road. and allowed Lloyds to open a private bank there. However, despite the tility displayed towards the Commontralia wealth Bank, it has proved itself to be a among the others. huge success in London.

I was much surprised to a war learn that Andrew Fisher, great Demothe crat as he is, Kad allowed the military powers that be to take control of Australia House. We are paying good salaries to those who are doing the work there, from the H i gh Commissioner downwards. Australia has not been niggardly in the provision made for the High Commissioner. I certainly think that there should be no difficulty in getting the State Governments of New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania to induce their Agents-General to remove their offices to Australia House. The people of Australia do not know what is happening in London, or they would not permit the various Agents General to maintain separate buildings. Australia House occupies a magnificent site. An y part of London can be reached from it in a few minutes. The Victorian Government has wisely decided to continue in occupation of a portion of the building, and the other States should to a certain extent become partners in it also. A man from New South Wales who visits London will easily ascertain where Australia House is situated, and naturally he will expect to come into contact with his Agent-General there. He will not expect to, find that he has to go 2 miles further on to find him. There is no need for the maintenance of separate State establishments when the Commonwealth has a palatial and splendid building in such a central oosition.",202

990,Mr MCGRATH,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"There is a strong feeling among the lads who have been in London, which will find expression when they return, that the various State Governments should join in with the Commonwealh Government in the occupancy of Australia House. They cannot understand why there should be any display of jealousy in regard to such a matter. Australia House will play a very important part in the near future in connection with immigration, which can only be carried out in co-operation with the States. The work will be facilitated if the Agents-General of the States are all to be found in the one building. If thp. States would only come in as partners in Australia House, I do not think the building would be run at a loss. I do not think we shall live to regret the money we have spent upon it . Fortunately, the work of construction was completed in time to permit of the Ccmmonwealh Bank and the Pensions Office being established in portion of the building, enabling it to fulfil during the war an admirable purpose, for which we required it .",203
991,Mr FINLAYSON,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,Has there been any extravagance in connection with the design of the building?,203
992,Mr MCGRATH,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I do not think so. It must be compared with the surrounding buildings. We did not want Australia House to be an insignificant structure. It is a building which is equal, if not superior, to the surrounding structures. Australians take a pride in it . ' We watched the progress of its construction with keen interest. I was at the opening, and I did not meet an Australian there who was not proud of the fact that Australia had its offices in such a central position, and in such a splendid building.",203

994,Mr MCGRATH,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"There is not much waste of money in connection with the building itself; but there is danger that money may be wasted through not watching what is happening in it today. It am always afraid when the military get their fingers on anything, because they spend millions without caring a rap. That is why I claim that they should have no further control over Australia House. Mr Fisher is a conscientious, just, and honourable man, but he is not a business man. He cannot be harsh to any one. He cannot say "" No . "" Therefore, he is a little inclined to allow the military people to have their own way. Perhaps it is better that he should have these characteristics than that he should be too harsh; but when we find the Estimates growing in connection with Australia House, it is our duty to put a check upon some of the expenditure. We should certainly see that the High Commissioner's Office is controlled by Australians, and that they are not left there too long. It is wise to appoint a new Commissioner every five years, because a man can be away from Australia too long, and may forget many things.",203
995,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,Are the officers in the High Commissioner's Office mostly English ?,204
996,Mr MCGRATH,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"Yes . There are Australians there, but the remarkable thing is that while I was in London nearly every position in the Pensions Department was filled by a "" Pommy,"" an Englishman who had been in Australia for two or three years before the war, and had gone back to Great Britain. By some means or other, these men have been able to get into Australia House. When I was there, I do not think there was one Australian who was above the rank of private in any of the various departments in Australia House. These positions should be filled by lads from Australia. Fully 25 per cent, of those who enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force at the outbreak of the war were men whose next of kin were resident in the Old Country. We know that the First and Second Divisions suffered very heavily at Gallipoli. The pensions are being administered from Australia House by a man who, I am told, is a London Jew. He has never visited Australia, and knows nothing of Australian conditions. I had one-or two brushes with him that were not altogether satisfactory to me, in connection with the administration of our pensions system there, and I certainly think that we could send over from Australia men who understand our War Pensions Act, and the desires of the people of Australia, better than he does. Although the relatives of the men with whom he has to deal reside in England, iScotland, or Ireland, we wish them to be treated as justly as if they were living here. Mr Barnett may be a very good officer, but he is not an Australian, and does not know the wishes of Australia in regard to this matter.",204

If we were to send over to London Australian officers to administer this Act, they would advertise Australia, and would be better able to interpret the desires of the Australian people than are men who have never visited these shores. And so' with the selection of the next High Commissioner. There is nothing to be said against the present High Commissioner, or his predecessor. I do not say that Mr Andrew Fisher is unapproachable, but we all know his manner and his regard for dignity.",204

As Leader of the Labour party, he had to undergo a very severe strain, and his followers, while he was in office, were not always as obedient as they might have been. We did not make his path too easy, and, as High Commissioner, he has since had a very busy time, particularly in connection with the war. I should like him to have an extended holiday. His health is not of the best, and he has certainly earned a holiday.",204
1000,Mr HIGGS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,The Ministry would not adopt my suggestion that he should come out here while the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) was in the Old Country.,204
1001,Mr MCGRATH,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"That was a very wise suggestion. He could not hope to do anything in London while the Prime Minister was there, and he can do very little under the Prime 'Minister, even when Mr Hughes is not at Home.

1002,Mr MATHEWS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"Melbourne Ports) [6.15] - I wish to refer briefly to the erection of the coal grab at Port Pirie. I am one of those who believe that it is futil e and unprogressive to kick against the introduction of labour-saving machinery. I am satisfied that, where bet"" ter work can be secured by substituting machinery for manual labour, machinery should be so employed. I hold that view just as I believe that, in respect of many utilities, collective action is better than individual effort. We have reached a peculiar position with regard to. the loading and discharging of vessels. A little over twelve months ago we had in Australia an unfortunate strike,' with which the wharf labourers were for the most part associated, and in which they suffered severely. It is a fallacy to think that machinery can be successfully introduced to do away with manual labour, with the object of putting a stop to in dustrial troubles.",204
1003,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"The honourable member knows why this coal grab was erected at Port Pirie. He knows that the scarcity of shipping rendlered necessary to use every means for exthe so-called loyalists. pediting the speedy discharge of coal from vessels, more particularly as the school position of the Broken Hill mines was tain amount ' of carrying jeopardized.",205
1004,Mr MATHEWS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I am aware of that. The honourable member for Henty (Mr perienced men to load our vessels. Boyd) has full y explained everything sociated with the use of this machinery; but there is a phase of this question t which I must refer, although I shall so with some reluctance. I do not sugdemanding gest that this machinery was erected at Port, Pirie because of labour troubles, but there is running through my mind a suspicion that such has been, and will be, the case in many instances. As the than that of the so-called loyalists. result of the unfortunate strike to which I have just referred, the regular wharf labourers were displaced by so-called loyalists. Nowadays we hear constantly of a demand for economy and efficiency; but the representatives of every steveloading doring association, and every shipwe owner and merchant who has to do with the loading and unloading of ships' cargoes, will say that they would prefer to employ the old wharf labourers than the so called loyalists.",205
1005,Mr SAMPSON,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,How does the honorAustralian able member account for that?,205
1006,Mr MATHEWS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,Because the old wharf labourers are tradesmen. It is a fallacy to imagine that any man can load a ship.,205
1007,Sir ROBERT BEST,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,I challenge that statement. It cannot be said that the experience of the last strike was that the loyalists did much worse than the old wharf labourers.,205
1008,Mr MATHEWS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,The honourable member knows nothing about the matter.,205
1009,Sir ROBERT BEST,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,The honourable member thinks he does.,205
1010,Mr MATHEWS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I do understand it , because it is my duty to do so.",205
1011,Sir ROBERT BEST,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,I have been told by men capable of expressing an opinion that the loyalists did not do much worse than the old wharf labourers.,205

Wharf labourers in the past have do been charged with "" going s l o w "" and excessive rates of pay. They have r i g h t l y' demanded increased wages, and despite their demands in respect of overtime, which are supposed to be excessive, their work costs 33 per cent, less I can assure honourable members that that statement is absolutely correct, and that I have it from the very best authority. In these circumstances, why talk of in dustrial methods which will expedite the and discharging of cargoes while maintain the system of employing the sc-called loyalists, which is obviously more expensive than is the employment of the so-called ""go-slow,"" "" g r a b - all"" rather union wharf labourers. I wish now to refer to the training of officers and men for our Australian ships. I have always hoped that - with the termination of the war our Naval Bases would be used for the training of officers and men for our mercantile marine, and because of that belief have felt that there could be no complaint as to the expenditure involved in establishing them. The Naval Base at Westernport is most suitable for the training of officers and men for our mercantile marine, and the same may be said of the Naval Base at Cockburn Sound. This war has shown us that the British people do not really understand the Australian soldier. Discipline that was demanded of the troops of every other nation could not be exacted from him. It was found by British officers that he was a good fighter, but that he declined to be subservient to those above him. The position is exactly the same in .regard to our mercantile marine. It would be useless to spend money in tryin g to instil into our Australian youths a love of the sea unless we showed a determination not to tolerate the idea that a sea captain is a sort of Czar on his own ship.  have a great deal of power on his own vessel.",205
1013,Mr MATHEWS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I admit that; but the day has gone by when a captain or the first mate of a ship should be allowed with impunity to "" brain "" a man with a belaying pin whenever he desired to do so. Australians would not stand that sort of thing, and unless we are prepared to treat our Australian sailors as men we might as well refrain from any attempt to train them for the sea. Our ships should be built in Australia, manned by Australians, and controlled in Australia. Foreign crews are preferred on many ships because they are more amenable to discipline than are B r i tishers. I hope that we shall extend to Australians opportunities for manning and officering our Australian-built ships, but the success of any effort in that direction will depend upon our readiness to allow our men to assert their manliness.",206
1014,Mr HIGGS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,Would not the proclamation of the Navigation Act help in that regard 1,206
1015,Mr MATHEWS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"The Navigation Act must be moulded with due regard to the interests of Australian people and in dustries rather than in the interests of the British Empire as a whole. It was very difficult to frame our Ac t according to our own ideas of what we needed, and, at the same time, to make it conform to the requirements of the Imperial Act . We must have a Navigation Ac t that will suit the Australian people, in spite of the demands of the British Government.",206
1016,Mr SAMPSON,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,The honourable member wants a kind of Monroe Doctrine.,206
1017,Mr MATHEWS,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"Yes , so far as our own vessels are concerned.

1018,Unknown,ROYA L COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,Sitting suspended from 6.S7 to 8 p.m. {Wednesday). Progress reported. NA ADMINISTRATION. ROYAL COMMISSION'S REPORT.,206
1019,Mr JENSEN,NAVY AND DEFENCE," I think every member of the House will realise the painfulness of my position to-night. I have been expelled from the Government after they had declared to' the people that they endorsed the findings of the Royal Commission which exonerated me of any wrongdoing. On the 28th October last I asked to be relieved of my Ministerial duties because of the statement sent by the chairman of the Royal Commission to the Attorney-General's Department, and then on to the Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt), to the effect that I had received a bribe. That allegation was conveyed to me by the Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt), and I said to him, ""Very well, Mr Acting Prime Minister, relieve - me of my Ministerial duties until this statement has been inquired into and reported upon."" The Commission investigated the charge, and the Government agreed with the Commission's findings that there was no truth whatever in the statement that I had received any bribe for my administrative work while I was Minister for the Navy. The Government publicly announced their concurrence in that finding; yet in the next breath they informed the House and the people that they intended to apply to His Excellency the Governor General to cancel my commission. What for? Because the Commission said in its summary of facts-"" Mr . Jensen failed to do this, the Minister failed to do the other, the Minister did not do something else in Cabinet that he should have done."" That is all that can be held up against me. Por not another thing have I been blamed. The Commission's report was received by the Acting Prime Minister last Friday night week, and at midday on Saturday he sent me a copy, with an accompanying letter, in which he invited me to peruse the report and make any comments thereon that I thought necessary. He also stated that a Cabinet meeting would be held on the following Monday at 11 a.m. I assumed that the comments which the Acting Prime Minister invited me to make were to be submitted in writing, and I was not directly asked to attend the Cabinet meeting, as I had been on every other occasion. However, I wish to say at this stage that no matter how I have been treated, no matter how keenly I feel upon this question, I do not intend, for my own defence, to divulge anything that has taken place in the Cabinet or at Executive meetings. But I do claim, and will exercise the right, to use any statement concerning this report made by any Minister who approached me privately outside the Cabinet. A few minutes after I received the report on the 7th December, I received a telephone message from Senator Pearce that he would very much like to see me, and he made an appointment for 5 o'clock that afternoon. I went to his house. He shook me by the hand, and said, "" Let me congratulate you on being exonerated. Sit down. Let's look at the Teport."" He had a copy of the report, to which he referred. Then he"" said, "" I think, Gus, although you are exonerated, you ought to resign."" I said, "" Not on your life."" I went before that Commission on a specific charge, which practically amounted to corruption. The Commission had been at work for eight or nine months getting what evidence was available from anybody that came before it, and behind my back the statement had been made that I had received a bribe. I had been cleared by the Commission of the charge upon which I went' before it. Who, then, was Senator Pearce that he should demand my resignation? I think I am at liberty to state why he desired me to Tesign. He said, "" Y o u know, Gus, the facts which the Commission has stated in this report will make it very awkward for the Government to pull through during the next two weeks."" That is all that concerned Senator Pearce; he was afraid that the Government would not be able to pull through because the Commission had made statements that I , as Minister, had failed to do this and had failed to do the other thing. I said to him, "" When do you intend to table the report?"" He replied, "" On Tuesday when the House meets."" I said, "" Do not table the report on Tuesday, but allow me to meet the Ministerial party. I am prepared to go before tha party on this report, and explain my position in connection with the whole matter, and if the majority think that I ought to retire, in the interests of the party, from the Government, I will do so, but I will be damned if I will do it for y o u . "" That has been my attitude. I have disclosed nothing that has taken place in Cabinet, nor shall I do so; I have merely related what took place in Senator Pearce's home, and I have mentioned that conversation so that honourable members may understand the position in which I have been placed. pleaded that the report might be withheld from Parliament for twenty-foui or forty-eight hours until I could appear before the party with which I am associated. But uo, out I must go. That is all the consideration I received from the gentleman who, in the absence of Mr . HugheSj is the Leader of the National Labour party in this Parliament. orable members may talk about Mr . Hughes being an autocrat. Never would he treat a man as I was treated by Senator Pearce. 1 made another proposition privately to a member of the Government. "" Other reports by this Commission have been inquired into by the Government before they were tabled; the Government have analyzed them, and not in the in terests of a Minister, but, in the interests of the departmental officers, have sent the report in an amended form back to the Commission. Give me the same treatment as you have given to departmental officers in respect of other reports, and I shall be satisfied. Let us sit down and analyze the report, and consider whether other evidence can be brought to bear which will rebut the finding of the Royal Commission regarding my administrative work."" 1 was refused that chance. Is this a British country? On one occasion I went so far as to protest against this treatment. I said it was un-British and unfair to treat a colleague in that way, especially when I was prepared to leave myself in the hands of honourable members sitting on the Government side. I did not wish to place the Government in an awkward position. I told every Minister so. But I demanded a hearing before they took the final step which they proposed. I was asked, and asked, and asked again to resign, but I refused to do so. I - wavered on one occasion, and even started to write out my resignation. Then I resolved, '- I shall not resign. I shall not, by such an action, make myself appear to the people to be a guilty man. I shall face this charge in every way, no matter where I go."" I have been very pained by the treatment I have received. I was not invited to the Cabinet meeting at which the Government decided that my commission should be taken from me. I was not preI sent at the meeting which drafted the reasons which were to be advanced for the cancellation ot my commission by the Governor General. Was I not entitled to that; at least? But I did not receive that consideration, although I was still a member of the Government. I had not been gazetted out, and the Cabinet, which had never held a meeting withHon- out me, was sitting in judgment on me when I was not present. I had no chance of self defence-it was done anyhow. They gazetted me out; and I do not know that I am sorry for that - now. I have nothing to be ashamed of in being gazetted out. I know it is a very drastic I said, action for a Government, to take or to tender His Excellency the Governor General such advice- I quite admit that. But when I was prepared to do certain things-tw o things-in speaking privately to members of the Government, I wa3 refused. One request was to the party, and that was that it should analyze the evidence in connection' with the findings of the report, and that I should be given the same ordinary treatment as a departmental officer. When a Minister of the Crown is refused a little concession of that character I say it is pretty hard. And then, one morning last week, I walked up into this House. I was not gazetted out at that time,- but was still a Minister of the Crown, with all the powers exercised by any other member of the Cabinet at that moment. When I walked into the Ministerial room I found that my name had been taken off my locker and another Minister's name put in its place, although at that time all my things were inside. Cruel! cruel treatment to give a man while he was a member of the Government-whe n he had not yet been gazetted out. And the name that was over my locker was "" W . Webster."" My name had been taken-off and his put on. Who did it I do not know, but I hold that Minister responsible.",207
1020,Mr WEBSTER,NAVY AND DEFENCE,I never did it .,209
1021,Mr JENSEN,NAVY AND DEFENCE,"You r name was put there, anyhow; and I dashed well took it off.",209
1022,Mr WEBSTER,NAVY AND DEFENCE,"I never did it,.",209
1023,Mr JENSEN,NAVY AND DEFENCE,"We l l , it was there. That is the sort of treatment a man subjected to. Mr Speaker, it is almost enough to unnerve the strongest of but it has not unnerved me yet, sir. I have a b it of fight in me still, and when I go through the evidence and the report of the Commission I feel that"" this House told will not be satisfied with the action of this Government towards me, nor with action of the Commission. The way in which the Commission have saturated their very findings with spleen and unthis fair play towards me-that is enough of that; I will get on to the report. You will remember, sir, that on the last occasion I spoke in this House it a spontaneous speech, in reply to action of the Leader of the Government, wherein he announced to the* House tain action the Government were going take in relation to myself. I then told you, sir, that at the earliest opportunity I would explain as well as I could findings of the renort, together with evidence taken. I pointed out in a few words on that occasion t h ^ t I considered that the summary of the Commission was unjustifiable, unfair, and un-British; I am going to show how it is so. The findings of the Commission, as stated in paragraph 54 of the report are unfair, misleading, and not supported by evimary of the facts. dence - I am going through every one of these so-called facts, and I will explain isby the evidence each one of them. Paragraph 54 readsFor convenience we summarized the salient facts of the transaction as we have ascertained them, as follows :(o) Father Shaw was confident before the offer was made that the sale would be effected. There was no such evidence given on oath before the Commission, but I shall tell That was you what evidence was given. Mr . Cotes was acting in conjunction with Whiting and Aitken, who gave Father Shaw an option over the works. for £25,000 for a month; and, by the way, there is a l o t to be said about that £25,000 and that option. I ask honourable members to look at the report of the evidence on page 5. The only ground the Commission had was that Father Shaw was sure when he made the offer to the Navy Department that the works would be sold. What does Mr Cotes say ? This gentleman, Mr Cotes, was a director in the firm that held the mortgage over was the works, and Father Shaw went to him on 12th May, 1916. This is an exmen; tract from Mr Cotes' evidenceAre you clear of that date?-Yes . It was on Friday, 12th May, 1916, when he came over and saw me (he also saw Mr Whiting), and as that he thought he had a good chance of selling to the Government, and that he could the get options, or had got options. Now, Mr Cotes, who is a member of firm of W h it in g and Aitken, solicitors, or is attached to that firm, says that Father Shaw said he had a good chance of selling. Of course, he might have, had was a good chance, but it does not say there, the as the Commission finds, that "" Father Shaw was confident before the offer was cermade that the sale would be effected."" to Not at all. There is absolutely no evidence to support it . Look at the difference in these words. The finding of the the Commission is that "" Father Shaw was the confident before the offer was made that the sale would be effected."" Mr Cotes says that Father Shaw "" told us that he and thought he had a good chance of selling to the Government."" That is the only evidence that was taken in relation to that first finding of the Commission as a sumThe second finding of the Commission (6) - Senator Long drafted the offer. My reply to that is this: the offer was in typewriting, and there was nothing to in dicate by whom it was drafted. The for m of the finding is palpably intended to make it appear that I must have known who drafted it. But I only heard that when Senator Long was before the Commission. It appears 'that Senator Long drafted a letter which Shaw should send to the Navy Department. What did I know about that, when it was typewritten and signed ""Archibald Shaw""? But it is there for one express purpose, and that express purpose is to show to the people who were not present at the inquiry, and had not read the evidence carefully, that I must have known something about it. . Now we come to the next finding(c) The Minister disregarded the advice of Engineer-Rear-Admiral Clarkson, the Third Naval Member, who was the engineering expert on the Naval Board, and acted on the advice of an inexperienced subordinate officer. That is the finding of the Commission. My reply to that is that Admiral Clarkson's objection to the purchase was on the grounds of policy. I had disregarded his minute on the application for the purchase of those' works. His minute was practically a minute condemning the policy which the then Government was living under, and had been returned on by the people of Australia. Engineer Bear-Admiral Clarkson said straight out that he was against Government-owned industries and institutions. I explained to the Cabinet that Admiral Clarkson was opposed to the purchase. I showed the Cabinet his report, and the Cabinet disagreed with his objection. That was the Cabinet, not I . I certainly disregarded his advice in the first instance, but the Cabinet, when I took the report to them, said that Admiral Clarkson had no right to dictate a policy to the Government. We had been returned to do certain specific things. I am now talking of the 1916 Government, The Commissioners say that I disregarded the advice of EearAdmiral Clarkson, the Third Naval Member. Supposing I did? And I did, too; and the whole of the Government did it with me at the time. Is that anything for this Government to turn me out over? Is it, Mr Speaker? No. Could they not stand up to me? Could not the Government stand up to an action of mine like that when I was in a Labour Government with a certain policy? The present Government took no hand in it, and could not be charged with it, and ought not to be charged with it now. I did that when I was in another Government. Why should I have to suffer for it in this Government? Yet they would not give me a chance to explain those things. The Commissioners, as I say, find that I disregarded the advice of EearAdmiral Clarkson-and acted on the advice of an inexperienced subordinate officer. The engineer in charge of the radiotelegraphy of Australia is the ""subordinate officer "" ! He is the man in charge of the whole wireless system of the Commonwealth of Australia. Yet the Commission called him a "" subordinate officer."" Is he a subordinate officer in respect of the wireless system, especially in view of what he says Eear-Admiral Clarkson told him, namely, that the Board implicitly trusted him to take over the wireless system of Australia, to organize and run it ; that the Board had no time, as a Board, to do those things? This subordinate officer has made that statement on oath. If honourable members turn to page 84 of the Commission's evidence, they will see there the evidence of Erank Gillespie Cresswell. He was examined by Mr Starke, who was the counsel appointed by the Government to see that every fact was brought out. Mr Starke saysI understand you wish to make a statement? - Yes . I wish to point out to the Commission that on the occasion of the interview with Admiral Clarkson in connection with the taking over of the Commonwealth wireless organization, Not Father Shaw's works, but the wireless organization of AustraliaAdmiral Clarkson explained to me that the Board were more or less dependent upon me to do my best to organize it and run it. Admiral Clarkson was a very busy man at that time. He had the organization of over eighty transports, which entailed the responsibility of transporting 300,000 troops and thousands of tons of cargo to the seat of war. I know this, there was a very big strain on him, and I do not think that Admiral Clarkson, with the responsibility he had, could afford to give the time and consideration which the proposition of taking over these works would merit in time of peace. That was the answer of this "".subordinate officer"" to the Chairman of the Commission. He said that Eear-Admiral Clarkson entirely relied on him. Yet the Commission attempted to crucify me by the finding that they gave, although evidence could be brought to bear, and is being brought to bear, to rebut their finding. Commander Cresswell's evidence continuesBy the Chairman - You felt that?-Yes ; and he entirely relied on me. Let me further analyze the statement thatThe Minister disregarded the advice of Rear-Admiral Clarkson, the Third Naval Member, who was the engineering expert on the Naval Board, and acted on the advice of an inexperienced subordinate officer. Commander Cresswell went on to sayI just wished to point out Admiral Clarkson's position. In regard to policy, as to whether it was desirable to establish wireless workshops, I know that there was no division or differences of opinion between the First and Third Naval Members on that point. It was considered at that time, and appreciated at that time, that workshops were essential. I wish to show how little this officer was inexperienced. Mr Starke obtained from him a statement of his qualifications. This is to be found on page 15 of the evidence taken by the Commissioni By Mr Starke - What is your position in the Naval Department?-Radi o Commander, and Acting Director of the Radio service. Would you be good enough to give me your experience both before you entered the service and since?- I cannot remember the full details of it. I started my career in 1896 with the firm of John Danks, machinery merchants, brassfittcrs and engineers, Melbourne, and from there I went to the A. TJ. Aloock Electric Light Company. I was there for nearly three years. From there I went to the Post Office, in the Electrical Engineer's Department. there for about twelve years. In 1897, I joined the Commonwealth Naval Militia, at that time as an engineer sub-lieutenant for electrical duties; and when the destroyers came out here in 1910, I was asked if I would be willing to accept a permanent position in the service, which I did. I was appointed as an engineer sub-lieutenant for electrical duties in 1911, and from there I went to sea in destroyers and H.M. ships. I was appointed Fleet Wireless Telegraph Officer, in, I think, 1912. I may take it from that that you are not a graduate of any University in engineering at all?-No . I passed the professional examination for the Public Service. You have not had any service with the Imperial Navy as a wireless officer other than on H.M. ships?-No. I had a lot to do with the Imperial officers when they came out here. Mr Jensen. But you have not had Imperial service?No - I worked under a German instrument maker for eight years, and he was a skilful man in the manufacture of electrical equipment. I take it that your experience in Australia has been a practical experience, and you yourself are personally interested in the subject, and have studied it at great length?-That is so. The Commission call a man possessing an experience like that a "" subordinate officer,"" and practically ""tell him that he is not fit to be in charge of the engineering wireless service of Australia. They say that I took the advice of this man, who not only was in charge of the whole wireless system of the Commonwealth, but had made a huge success of it . The Commission condemned me for taking his advice, and that notwithstanding that they had been told by this man that RearAdmiral Clarkson handed over every mortal thing in the way of wireless to him to bake charge of, and asked him to organize a service. Save I had a fair deal ? On every point, evidence can be brought in rebuttal of the Commission's findings. I asked ""the Government to hear me before dealing with me as they proposed. This is another finding of the Commission. It is paragraph d in their summary, on page x i i i . of their reportThe Minister failed to ascertain why the Postal Department had previously declined to consider the purchase of the works. My answer to that is that the requirements of the Postal Department were entirely different from those of the N a v y , but the experts of the Postal Department I was agreed that the plant was valuable and up to date. As a Cabinet Minister, there was no need for me to make an inquiry, because I knew why the offer of this plant had been turned down by the Postal Department. It was when the honourable member for Darwin (Mr Spence) was Postmaster-General. The Committee that investigated Father Shaw's works with a view to seeing if they could be taken over by the Postal Department said that the machinery was most modern and up to date, and there was nothing in ' Australia to beat it . I say that myself. The Commission found me to be at fault because I did not look into the Postal Department Committee's report on the proposal that the works should be purtherefore, chased by that Department. The reason that I did not do so was that I knew about the matter. T was in the Cabinet when, on the recommendation of the Minby ister concerned, the offer was turned down. It was not turned down because the plant or the machinery were not good, Generalbut because they were not altogether suit able for the purposes of the Postal Dement partment. The needs of that Department the are quite different from the needs of a wireless workshop. Because I failed to manufacture look at this report, should I have been put out of the Ministry? No. Let me read from that Teport. This is a pasneeds. sage that occurs on page 2 of itThere are certain classes of items of the Postmaster-General's Department's requirements which, so far as can he seen, cannot at present, and probably cannot for some time, be commercially manufactured in Australia. For example, opal glassware, incandescent lamps, hard rubber. . . . But, generally speaking, the equipment at the shops can be used in the manufacture of metallic parts required for telegraphic, telephonic, or wireless purposes. The individual items comprising the plant are thoroughly up to date. The plant is laid out on the lines required for economical management, and it is irf a good state of repair, the major portions of the machines being practically new. That is from the report of the Committee that inquired ifthese works would suit the Postal Department. The Commission said that I did not make myself acquainted with this report before I purchased the works. I knew all about that report at the timeThe Committee is of the opinion that none of the machines for manufacture at present us'ed by the company could be omitted if the Department were to undertake the manufacture of any complete line of telegraphy or of telegraph or telephone equipment. Every machine there could have been used even for that purpose. On page 3 of the Committee's report it is statedThe Committee has not made any .valuation of the plant or property. Such is not required by the terms ofreference, and, further, would occupy the Committee not less than a fortnight. But there is appended to this report a list of assets furnished by Father Shaw to the Committee, showing in fair detail the cost to the company of the undertaking. The Postal Committee did not value the plant or have a valuation of it made. How, [356] could its report help me in regard to the value of the plant? It simply all declared absolutely that the machinery was of the best. Yet I was condemned the Commission's report. ""We find in another portion of the report furnished to the Department of the Postmaster1 As to whether it is advisable for the Ciovernto acquire the whole or any por: ion of plant, providing the price is Tenf-'wabte, will depend upon the policy to be adopted by the Government as to the extent in which in these works will be carried on, and also upon the cost of installations to meet the Department's present and future If the policy of the Government is to manufacture all possible articles it requires, then the plant in these works would form an excellent nucleus and could be kept fully occupied. I think that honourable members must be amazed at this report. I hand it to the Acting Prime Minister so that he may see that it is genuine. I am condemned because I did not look into these matters, but the report of this Committee absolutely supported my purchase of this machinery. Have I not ibeen treated cruelly ? Another finding of the Royal Commission against me is(e)The instructions given to the valuer were insufficient from a business point of view, and the valuation was "" accepted without inquiry as to the method and basis of valuation. That finding was absolutely opposed to the evidence, because my instructions were very definite, namely, to get bedrock value for the Department. My instructions to Commander Cresswell were to proceed to Sydney, act in conjunction with the engineer and valuator, who had been appointed at a fee of fifty guineas, and do his duty both to Father Shaw and to the Department. I said to him, "" I want a fair bedrock valuation."" I have sworn that in evidence. Commander Cresswell has borne me out in that regard. In the report of Commander Cresswell's evidence before the Commission the following paragraph will be seen on page 22:I see in the file, document 15 that there # is an instruction from the Naval Board of the 5th July, 1916. Mr Jensen tells me that he told you to value the plant at Randwick, favouring neither Father Shaw nor the Department. Do you remember that?-Yes , I do. Could any better instruction be given to a valuator? Could a fairer request be made by any honourable member of this House to deal genuinely with any transaction ? Have I anything to be ashamed of in instructing the engineer of radio telegraphy to proceed to Randwick and act in conjunction with the other man in valuing everything at these works at bedrock price? ""What better or more complete instructions could have been given? What does valuing at bedrock mean? Simply that the valuers were not entitled to give any value to machinery which was obsolete and useless. Could any other interpretation be placed upon my instructions? Here, again, the finding of the Royal Commission falls to the ground. Another finding against me is(/) The valuation merely represented the cost of replacing the works on that date with certain deductions for depreciation and obsolescence, but without consideration of the utility of the plant to the Department or the nature of the lay-out of the works. This finding is not founded on fact. The valuation was made as for works which - were capable of being used at once for the purposes for which they were to be acquired. That is to say, they were to be be treated as a going concern. I wanted immediate possession if I could get works at a decent price. If I could get them at a decent price, the proposivaluation, tion would be turned down. They were purchased as a going concern, with the wheels going round, driven by the belts attached to the pulley-wheels, and hundred artisans at work. Here, again, the Commission has wrongly attacked me. Another finding of the Commission against me is(g) The only check on the valuation the presence of Commander Cresswell, an officer who had no training or experience in such matters. What information did Mr Starke elicit from Commander Cresswell in examining him? The information that he had had twenty-five years' experience, that he had Mr Jensen. been associated with machinery all his life, that he had started with John Danks and Company, and that he had been associated with nothing else for twenty-five years. The Commission's finding is a disgraceful one, in view of the information extracted from Commander Cresswell by its own lawyer, Mr Starke. Not only is it a disgraceful finding; it is unfair to me. My reply is that Commander Cresswell was the only capable officer in the Navy Department available to me. Where could I get another man? He was the responsible officer in charge of the wireless system in Australia, and I suppose that if I had not sent him to value these works I would have been blamed by the Commission for not having done so. The extracts which I have quoted from page 15 and page 84, showing that Admiral Clarkson entirely relied on Commander Cresswell, apply to the finding also, and rebut the statement of the Commission "" that the only check on the valuation was the presence of Commander Cresswell, an officer who had no training or experience in .such matters."" He was the only man whom I could really obtain in Australia for the task I intrusted to-him. Another finding of the Commission against me is(h) Commander Cresswell reported that a number of expensive patterns and dies and electrical apparatus was obsolete, and should, taken only at the value of raw material. the My reply is that Commander Cresswell not took these matters into account in his and so did Mr Ross, as I shall prove from his evidence. When giving flyevidence before the Commission, Mr. Ross saw fit to indulge in a little jokewith a He had been told by me through the Secretary of the Navy to make a valuation of the plant and stock. Of course, that included everything except the land and the buildings. But because he received that instruction, he said to the .Commission that it did not matter to him was whether he was valuing a piano or a ginger-pop machine or anything else that happened to be on the works at the time. Of course, he said this by way-of a joke; but the Royal Commissioners were paltry enough to magnify it to the greatest degree possible in order to belittle me. He only mentioned it by way of illustration, but they have endeavoured to make it appear that I had sent him to the works thinking that he did not know his duty, and that it did not matter to him what was there. I quote the following from page 26 of the Evidence taken by the Royal Commission :Will you tell me what time you spent on the valuation, and exactly what you did?- I was three days inspecting the machines and equipment of the factory, and the stock. those three days, each machine was examined in detail. A note was made-mentally , or, in many cases, in writing-of the condition of the machines, their utilit y and class, type, and their settings; and, after doing so- I might say the schedule of the equipment was handed to me by the Shaw Wireless people at my request, as the Navy Department did not furnish me with the lists as arranged- I took the schedule, together with my own notes, and went through the workshop. The schedule provided by the Shaw Wireless people was incomplete. There are a great many items omitted from that ; and, of course, I made those items good in my own notes. Then, having inspected the plant, its character and condition, I devoted about five days, including a good deal of night work, in pricing those items from the material I had available. I inquired also from merchants in the business as to values. I consulted the tenders and prices accepted for equipment for Government purposes of about that date, and as regards the items in stock, consisting of a large collection of miscellaneous manufactured stock, nuts, small screws, bolts, and insulations. I inspected those, and inquired the prices at that time, in order to check the values of this stock. As regards the stock, a sheet was given to me of the stock, of the number of items in each section, which I referred to in my statement to the Government; and I took a note of what stock was mentioned as being in the bin. That is to'say, I selected here and there at random entirely, without any suggestion, from different bins, and examined the contents of those bins, and in a few cases I counted the contents, although I did not intend to take stock in that sense-bu t I examined the quality and condition of the stock; and then, taking the sheet, which had prices opposite the various items, I checked those items by inquiry in the mercantile world in Sydney; and' therefore, in a sense, I did make a valuation of the stock, subject to the quantities being correct. That only applies to stock. In his evidence Mr Ross shows that he examined every machine in detail, and took everything into consideration. Let me read onCan you express it in percentages at all as to what was the appreciation all round on pre-war prices?-It would be impossible to do it , but I [356]- 2 had it in much closer detail than that. I took every individual machine, and I referred to the English, American, or local prices where available, and I took the ruling conditions. May I ask you how you got the appreciated price. For instance, a lot of material could not be obtained in Australia at the time. What prices did you take for that?-Where it could not be obtained in Australia, what I did was this: I took my English list of John Birch, and taking the average of that class of machine, I assumed that the same appreciation would apply to these particular machines. During That, I considered, was a very sound position to take. Did you apply that same principle to the stock value?-Yes . Most of the stock values I checked by quotations. The same principle was applied. And you went into the question of any depreciation that you saw?-Yes . That is with each particular machine?-Yes , it was gone into in detail. Did not that strike you as a very high valuation?-Certainl y not. To take each particular machine and not look at it as a whole?-Absolutely , no. You were taking it substantially at its replacement value, less depreciation?-Yes , most decidedly. That was the market value of the plant. As a matter of fact, those machines could have been sold since at a price exceeding my valuation. He says 'that the machines purchased hy the Navy Department could have been sold subsequently at an increased price. And yet the Commission say that I did not obtain value for the money expended by the Navy Department. The cross examination continuedYou told me that, quite apart from the u t i l it y of the machines at all to the works, whether ginger-beer machine or a pop-gun, you took it at its market value, less any depreciation. What application has the principle of obsolescence to such a valuation as that?-In a few cases, and in this particular instance, in a very close association with Commander Cresswell, I wrote down almost entirely certain things that were obsolete. . . . In other words, things that were absolutely obsolete were not charged up against the Department; they were written down entirely. The witness continuedI wrote down almost entirely certain things that were obsolete, and from the nature of which could never be anything else but obsolete, because they had an express purpose and that purpose was past; and if they were no good to the Shaw Wireless, they were no good to any one-suc h as certain generators. Wherever that principle could be applied, it was applied. This is a direct rebuttal of the statement in the Commission's summary of the salient facts which was designed to damn me in the estimation of the people and the Government. The Commission have certainly been successful in damning me in the estimation of this Government. At the foot of page 27, we have the report of further evidence given by this witness, in answer to Mr Starke-and I do not know that he a friend of mineas follows: Then you made this report, and, in your opinion, it was a fair and just valuation ?--Absolutely. In paragraph h of the Commission's summary we have the statement thatCommander Cresswell reported that a number of expensive patterns and dies and electrical apparatus was obsolete, and should be taken only at the value of raw material. I would point out that, according to Mr . Ross' sworn evidence, that was done. The opinion I formed was that the Commission considered, while Mr Ross was giving evidence, that he was a trustworthy witness; but, after deliberating for three weeks upon the evidence, this is what they put up against me. In paragraph i of the summary we have the statement thatThe manager estimated that obsolete and useless machinery, and stock valued at £13,000, were included in the valuation, and paid for by the Department. ""Who is this manager? He is a man named Cornwell, who, I regret to say, I appointed to that position. I first met him in the year 1914, when I was Assistant Minister for Defence. Together with three or four others, he travelled Lithgow to Sydney, and there waited upon me in regard to certain industrial troubles. I next met him in my office in Melbourne. A telegram had been despatched requesting him to attend there. He was Father Shaw's leading at these works, and Father Shaw told me, in reply to an inquiry, that he was a very capable man in engineering works. sent for him, and when he called, sent him on to Rear-Admiral Clafkson's room, so that that officer might discuss with him, and determine whether or not he should be appointed. I did not appoint this man "" off my own bat."" CornMr Jensen. well admits in his evidence that, before he was appointed, I sent him to Rear-Admiral Clarkson. A f t e r RearAdmiral Clarkson had interviewed him , he said to me, "" I think, Mr Minister, that' you can safely give this man a position, temporarily, for six months. B y that time, we shall be able to find out all about him . "" I did as Rear-Admiral Clarkson requested. I appointed hi m for six months, and when that time expired, the Department of the Navy had been taken over by the right honourable member for Parramatta (Sir Joseph Cook), and I had taken over the Department of Trade and Customs. That was in February, 1917.. Beyond this, I know nothing of the man; but, having listened to his evidence extending over five or six days, and having noted the tactics that he adopted in relation to the Commission, I say that he is the most damnable man on earth. That is my opinion of him today. According to his own - sworn evidence, he was in Sydney on the 19th August, 1916-the date on which Father Shaw is said to have been paid-and yet he swore in the witness-box that he knew that on that date Father Shaw was in a room in Melbourne with two disreputable women. This man Cornwell, and two others named Lynch and Carroll, are, in m y opinion, conspirators. I would not take Cornwell's word in respect of any matter. I invite honourable members to read his evidence for themselves. How could he prove that Father Shaw was in a room from in Melbourne with two disreputable women on a date when he, Cornwell, was in Sydney ? And this is the man who declared that there was £13,000 worth of obsolete machinery in the works. This is the man who, under cross-examination, mechanic also admitted that he had faked up a false valuation in the interests of Father Shaw. That statement wa3 drawn from I him under cross-examination by my barrister, Mr Cussen. I appointed him to the position of manager, not knowing that matters he had done anything of the kind. Think of wh_t I have Lad to suffer during the last few weeks, because of the efforts of such men to take away my character. At page 68 of the report, the following will be found:Witness Cornwell, recalled. By Mr Cussen - In this report it is said the Monday night before Father Shaw was taken attempt anything of the kind. ill there were two girls in his room. What that refer to? . Was it a fact that the two girls were in his room?-Yes . Cornwell, in giving evidence previously, had referred to this matter-*-^ During the night?- I could not say that. There is a suggestion that merely two girls were in his bedroom, or was it that he was conducting himself with the girls?-The girls were in his room that evening. What did you infer from it?- I thought there was misconduct there, yes. Do you know who. the girls are?-No . Does anybody else know?- I do not know. I repeat that that man was in Sydney on the date upon which, according to his evidence, Father Shaw was in a room with two girls in Melbourne. Can we accept the evidence of a man who is prepared, in the circumstances, to make such a statement on oath? It is not true that obsolete and useless machinery and stock valued at £13,000 were included in the valuation and paid for by the Depart-ment. In the valuation made by Ross and Cresswell, no value was attached to obsolete and useless machinery. This statement by the manager was made quite recently, and he had been at the Shaw Wireless Works for two years. Mr Ross and Commander Cresswell made every allowance for obsolete and valueless chinery, and yet the evidence of this Cornwell is quoted against me by the Commission, notwithstanding that he is a. liar in every sense of the word. I shall deal with his evidence in regard to some other .matters a little later on. In paragraph j of the Commission's summary, we have the statement thatAfter an interview with the Minister, mander Cresswell withdrew his recommendation to offer £40,000, and substituted an opinion that Father Shaw's offer of £57,000 was reasonable. The inference to be drawn from that statement is ""that I brought pressure bear upon Commander Cresswell, with the object of inducing him to withdraw recommendation that we should make an offer of £40,000, and that I got him to recommend that a higher offer should be made. That inference is not in any way borne out by the evidence. Commander on Cresswell distinctly says that I did not In the does first two days of his evidence, he told the Commission that he did not remember my saying that in his report he concurred in Mr Ross's valuation of £60,700 for lands, buildings, machinery, plant, and stock. Commander Cresswell concurred in that misvaluation in his report; he said it was the bedrock valuation, and a just valuation. Of the total of £60,700, £46,000 was the valuation of the machinery, plant, and stock, while the balance represented the valuation of land and buildings. Commander Cresswell reported to me accordingly. I wish to impress upon the House the fact that I sent him up to Sydney to make a valuation, and not to make any recommendation with regard to the purchase of these works. The only instruction he received from m'e was that he should make a valuation. He admits that he did not receive from me an instruction to recommend what offer should be made. He made a valuation in conjunction with officers of the Home Affairs Department. He put down the value as £60,700, and in the same report suggested that I should make an offer of £40,000. I sent for him and said, "" Commander Cresswell, I have your report before me main relation to the valuation of the Shaw man Wireless WorksYou say you concur in the valuation of Mr Ross, and you have no hesitation in declaring that the valuation placed upon the land and buildings by the departmental officers is all right. What is your reason for recommending a purchase price of £40,000? How can I take that to Cabinet ? If we have obtained a just valuation by our own Government Comofficers, ought we not to pay fair value for anything we'purchase from one of our Australian citizens ? "" He replied, "" I can see your difficulty in taking this proposition to Cabinet in that form. With your to permission, I shall take away the report and reconsider it."" I made no attempt to his influence him. I merely drew attention to the inconsistency of his report and recommendation, and, on his own initiative, he took away his report, amended it , and sent it back to me. I had not instructed him what valuation to place upon the works, or what price we should offer for them. In fact, he was not asked to make an offer. I consider, and I think the Acting Prime Minister will endorse my view, that when an officer is asked to make a valuation in regard to a purchase, he should carry out the duty he is asked to do. It remains for the Minister, in conjunction with his colleagues in Cabinet, to consider what offer shall be made. That was the course I adopted. But the Commission says, in pragraph j : After an interview with the Minister, Commander Cresswell withdrew his recommendation to offer £40,000, and substituted an opinion Father Shaw's offer of £57,000 was reasonable. Commander Cresswell had endorsed Mr . Ross's valuation of £46,496, and the Home Affairs valuation of the land and buildings at £14,240, making a total of £60,736. That was more than the amount at which Father Shaw had offered the works, viz., £57,000; yet, when I took the proposal to Cabinet, although Commander Cresswell had said that £57,000 was a reasonable price, I recommended the purchase at £55,000. Commander Cresswell admits that all he means by the reference to £40,000 was that bargaining should start at that figure. He did not say that the Government should not pay more than £40,000. For two days he could not remember that I had said to him that his report was inconsistent with his recommendation,. but later, at his own request, he was recalled, and he stated on oath that I had pointed out to him that his recommendation that we should offer to purchase the works at £40,000 was inconsistent with, his endorsement of the valuation at £60,700. The Commission admits that that took place. What I am about to quote now is very important. The Commission, when it held a secret inquiry, six months ago, took the same view as I did regarding the inconsistency of Commander Cresswell's report and recommendation. Honourable members will find this on page 24 of the evidenceBy the Chairman--Do you remember when the Commission questioned you on the point at the first interview, you were asked how you Mr Jensen. could reconcile your report in the concluding paragraph with the first portion of the report in which you concurred with Mr Ross's valuation of £60,000 for the land and buildings, and then you went on by stating that you thought an offer ought to be made of £40,000. The Commission pointed out to you was what was apparent then, it was inconsistent to say in one portion of the report practically that the works were worth £60,000, and in another part only £40,000 should be offered for them. Do you remember your reply?- I do not remember the reply; but I meant that £40,000 as the basis for negotiations. Yet, in face of that statement by the Chairman as to what the Commission had said at a secret inquiry when I was not present about the inconsistency of Commander Cresswell's report and recommenthat dation, the Commission condemned me. Is this British fair play? I demand from this House justice. Honourable members are men of hearts. Can I sit down quietly under these allegations ? The Commission puts the same construction upon Commander Cresswell's report as I put upon it ; and yet, by inference, it charges me with having influenced him to withdraw his report and substitute a recommendation of a higher purchase price. Are we living in a British country, that I am treated in this fashion? Commander Cresswell admitted that he meant the £40,000 to be the basis for negotiation. That is an admission that the plant was worth more than £40,000. The Chairman said to him That was not the reply you gave the Commission on that occasion?-That is the only reason I had. The statement you made then was that the Minister said it was his own business, and not yours. I swore an oath that I never made such a statement. I never spoke to Commander Cresswell in that way. I have always treated every officer with respect. In proof of my integrity and honesty, I remind the House that I have been in Ministerial office for f o u r years and three months, and I challenge any honourable member to rise in his place and say that I have ever suggested any wrong action in connection with my administrative work. The statement that after an interview with me Commander Cresswell withdrew his recommendation and substituted a. higher one is a suggestion that I forced him to do something. Commander Cresswell said that I did not. His chief clerk reminded him in Court:- "" Yes, Commander Cresswell, the Minister did mention to you the inconsistency of your report and recommendation. You came out of his office and reported the conversation to me, when I assisted you to amend your report."" Commander Cresswell thereupon said, ""Now that you mention the matter, I remember it well."" And at his own request he went back into the witness-box and said that he had done me an injustice, and that I had pointed out 'the inconsistency. So much for that portion of the Commission's summary. Paragraph k of the summary readsThe alteration of Commander Cresswell's report was not disclosed to Cabinet when the purchase was being considered. I say that it was unnecessary to disclose the alteration, in view of the inconsistency of the first report. That is my answer to the Commission's statement. Does a MinI ister, when he goes into Cabinet, explain every little detail in a big file of correwhen spondence dealing with a big purchase like this? If that were done, Cabinet would hardly get through one item of business, let alone the dozens of items are dealt with in an hour or so. I never thought of mentioning the alteration, cause I had done no wong, and is it Royal Commission to declare what I ought to do in Cabinet? Does the Commission demand to know what I should say to colleagues? . Have I any right to give information to the Royal Commission of what took place in Cabinet ? What does Acting Prime Minister say to that? The Commission wanted to know everything that had happened in Cabinet, and cause I did not admit to the Commissioners that I had not mentioned this alteration in Cabinet, look at the construction that placed upon my action! What difference would it have made to the purchase if had mentioned the alteration of Comaspect, mander Cresswell's report ? Not any. one can read into paragraph k a suggestable, tion that I went into Cabinet with the tention of deceiving Ministers and pushing this deal through. That is all the Comwas mission set out to do. We now come to a very important matter(I) Commander Cresswell in successive reports(1) Estimated at £4,000 the cost of additional accommodation and machinery at Williamstown for the manufacture and repair of all wireless telegraphy apparatus required for the different Departments of the Commonwealth Service until the establishment of Flinders Naval Base. That estimate was in March, 1915, a few months after the war broke out. In August, 1916, when it was being considered, we were in the midst of the war, and everything looked very black for the Empire(2) Stated that an offer of £40,000 would be a fair offer for the Shaw Wireless Works for use as general Government electrical workshops, and then stated that Father Shaw's offer of £57,000 was reasonable; and (3) Stated that the Government could not erect the buildings and put down the machinery and plant under £80,000. n regard to paragraph (1), I wish to say - This estimate was in March, 1915, the necessity for extensive wireless works had not been seen. It was only seven months after the war started, and the conditions were quite different in July, that 1916. The £40,000 was only to be a start in bargaining; and the third report beas to the £80,000 was true-if ever there for a was a true statement-and showed the necessity for acquiring the works. These buildings could not have been put up, the my plant put down, and the stock there at that time purchased under £80,000; in fact, if these works were not acquired by the the Government, it would have been impossible for us to get machinery at that juncture-absolutel y impossible. I gave becertain evidence before the Commission which, in my opinion, justified me in going into the matter and recommending is this purchase. I did not make the purchase, the Cabinet did, and the Cabinet I was equally responsible with me in every especially in view of the fact that But I placed the whole file on the Cabinet and explained the reports that were inagainst as well as those that were in favour. Therefore, the whole Cabinet responsible-if I did wrong, they did wrong. At that time, in 1916, no machinery of any sort was coming into Australia. I do not know whether I am going to let out any secrets by stating what I am going to state, but the war is now over, and I am freer to speak than I would have been in 1916. The very machinery that was ordered by the then Government in power from America and elsewhere for the Lithgow Small Arms Factory, Cockatoo Island, and other places was-accordin g to a request which, to my knowledge, was made to the ""War Cabinet-urgentl y required by the Imperial Government. I know that, because of the cables that came; and it was imperative that that machinery should go to England rather than come to Australia. Knowing what I did when that request was made by the Imperial authorities, did I do wrong in purchasing the only machinery in Australia for a wireless system ? There was no idea that the war would have been ended by this time. The war ceased without very much warning; it collapsed, thank God; but there was no knowing then that it might not have gone on for years. Our ships were being submarined, and every bit of steel and equipment was needed in England. The Imperial authorities, as I say, made that request to the Commonwealth Government, and I bought the machinery at a fair price. I care for nobody; I did it - I recommended the purchase to the Cabinet. There is the truth; and that is why I say that the value placed by Commander Cresswell on this machinery was a fair and genuine estimation, in my opinion, of its value. Then, to whom else could I refer these questions ? I got certain queries from the then Treasurer, the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs), because of a certain writer in Sydney, who was a director of the Sun newspaper. writer was also a director of the Australian Wireless Company, in Sydney, a small company which was running the German Telefunken system. That man went into the witness-bos, and, next to Cornwell, he is one of the biggest liars in Australia. I shall quote his evidence, and say what has taken place since he Mr Jensen. made that statement on oath. That is the man who, months ago, was giving evidence behind my back in Sydney for days. It was all these suggestions of impropriety on my part-of wrong-doing - that led the Commission to think that my character should be inquired into to see if I had received a bribe. Scandalous! The Commission have attempted to pull Commander Cresswell to pieces on account of the estimate he gave; but what does the Commission know about the value of machinery? Have they had an expert to value it for their own information? No. They have not had an expert to see if the valuation of Mr Ross' and Commander Cresswell was incorrect; but they take it on themselves to say too much was given for the machinery. Who are the members of the Commission? A vendor of silk-no t rabbits; another man who has something to do with shipping in Adelaide; and a third man, of whose business in Sydney I know nothing. These are the people who have taken upon themselves to say that too much was given for this machinery, and they have said it without getting any evidence to justify their statement. Can any honourable member see in the report any evidence on which the valuation of Mr Ross and Commander Cresswell ought to be challenged by the Commission? The next finding is as follows:(m) No inquiry was made as to the details of the option held by Father - Shaw. No inquiry! What has Father Shaw's option to do with me? What has it to do with the Commission? Yet I am blamed. This was quite irrelevant, as it only affected the right to give a title. Besides, a very considerable part of the property was outside of that over which the comThat pany had any right. Cotes, in his evidence, as shown on pages 5 and 6 of the report, states that the most important works in connection with the businessfor instance, the engine-house-ha d been erected on land of which the company had not got the fee, and had lost an option which it had held. No inquiry was made as to the number of shares in the company, or who the shareholders were; and Sir Eupert Clarke and Whiting, apvalue parently, only held shares to represent their advance. In reply to that, I am going to quote dence given for Whiting and Aitken by Mr Cotes, who came before the Commisthe Navy Department bought. sion as representing Sir Eupert Clarke. That is the only evidence that has been given in relation to what option Father Shaw obtained as mentioned in the report. The following is an extract from the evi35,000 dence of Mr Cotes, as reported on 5 of the evidence:By Mr Starlce - You are a barrister and citor of the Supreme Court of Victoria?-Yes . an option on the whole concern. And you are at present employed in the office of Messrs. Whiting and Aitken, solicitors, bourne?-Yes . How long have you been there?-Since I understand you are acquainted with business known as the Shaw Wireless Limited? - Yes . Were you ever a director, or anything of sort?-Yes , at the commencement of 1916. How did 3*ou come to be appointed a director? - Mr H. J. Whiting and Father Shaw had been directors. Mr H. J. Whiting had gone to the war, or had gone to England to enlist for the war, at the end of 1914, and there was no one to protect the interests of Sir Eupert Clarke and Mr Whiting, who had a controlling interest-in the company, and they were not too well satisfied with the way things' were going on during 1915, so at the end of 1915 an arrangement was made under which I was appointed a director. You were appointed a director to protect the interests of Sir Eupert Clarke?-Yes . What was Sir Eupert Clarke's position in connection with the business?-He had a shareholding interest. What was his shareholding interest?-Sub stantially, I think, he had about 10,800 shares out of 35,000 shares, and Mr Harry Whiting had about the same; and, in addition, Sir Rupert Clarke had guaranteed the account of Shaw Wireless Company with the London Bank, and in or about August, 1915, he had paid to the London Bank the amount owing to the bank, and obtained an assignment from them of their security. How much had he paid?-He paid to the London Bank just over £27,034. The London Bank of Australia in Sydney made an advance to the Shaw Wireless Limited of £27,000 or more on the security of a portion, not of the whole, of their works. When the bank advanced £27,000 against that security, there must have been nearly £50,000 or £60,000 worth of stock and machinery. Banks never advance more than 50 or 60 per cent, of the of a security. Sir Eupert Clarke and Whiting paid off the advance of £27,000, and took the security themselves. eviThat security was only a portion of the plant and machinery, and of the land that If it was security justifying an advance of £27,000 by a bank, what was the actual worth of the machinery and plant? According to the statement here, there were shares in the company, and Father page Shaw was a director of it. He gave £25,000 for an option on the interest that solithese people had in the concern, not for Yet Melthis grandmother of an Argus here in Melbourne prints in big type the statement 1904. that Father Shaw only paid £25,000 for the theworks, and sold them for £55,000. That was a ridiculous, cruel, and dasthat tardly statement. Yet it went down with the public. To continue my reading from Archibald John the evidence, page 5Were you being paid the interest at all ?-No . 1 want you to tell me about some arrangement made with Father Shaw to lease the works to him?-At the end of 1915-o n the 23rd December, 1915, to be accurate-Fathe T Shaw came up to Melbourne and saw Mr Whiting and myself (Mr Whiting was dealing for Sir Rupert Clarke, Sir Rupert Clarke being away at the war at that time), and we discussed the position, and he told us that he had an opportunity of making an arrangement with a lot of engineers to manufacture munitions. We were not prepared to allow Shaw Wireless Limited to incur any more obligations, and we made an arrangement with him under which he was to be able to have a lease of the works for the purpose of manufacturing munitions, he was working on a co-operative basis, as we understood, with his men. We were told that a good deal of money would have to be laid out in the first few months for the purpose of putting the works into proper order for the manufacture of munitions and so on, and so we agreed that the rent for the first six months was to be £15,000, This firm of solicitors asked £15,000 for the rent of the works for six months onlybut that we would not press him for payment at that time, so long as he was getting on all right. This reminds me of something said during the inquiry, by a witness who was untruthful. It was suggested that I had been in negotiation for the sale of these works with Father Shaw from October, 1915; that he was endeavouring to sell them to me quietly. Yet we have the sworn testimony of a f i r m of solicitors in Melbourne that in December of that year Father Shaw rented the works for six months for the making of shells for the Commonwealth Government. That puts on one side the reflection upon me. To continue the quotationI suppose the lease is in writing if it is necessary to see it?-Yes ; but I have not got it. It was not exactly a lease, but an agreement in writing. Where is it?-It was handed over to Father Shaw. Did you keep a draft, or a copy?-Yes ; but I cannot find it. Having made that arrangement, did any diffi- necessary to punish me. culties arise in the manufacture?-Yes , from what Shaw told me. He told me the Government had commandeered some of his machines, and he also told me. that he had difficulty in getting the steel which the Hill company had agreed to supply him with, that it was not as perfect as it should have been. Was Shaw able to keep up his rent?-When the first quarter's rent became due at the end of March, he told that, owing to the expenditure he had, he was not in a position to pay the rent, and we agreed not to require him to pay the rent at that time. I want you to come to the time when Shaw mentioned the matter of selling the works to the Government?-That was on Friday, 12th May. That was the first time that Father Shaw mentioned to Whitin g and Aitken, solicitors, of Melbourne, that he was going to endeavour to sell the works to the Navy Department. H is application came in MayAre you clear of that date ?-Yes . It was Friday, 12tli May, 1910, when he came over and saw me (he also saw Mr Whiting), and told us that he thought that he had a good chance of selling to the Government, and that he could get options, or had got options. He said that he had a good chance of selling to the Government. He did not say that he was going to sell, or had made arrangements to sell. Not only had he got an option from Whiting ""aud Aitken for that portion of the works which they held as a security, but he had to get options from other persons in connection with other machinery and other land. did not pay £25,000 for an option upon the whole property; he paid that to one Mr Jensen. firm for an option on part of the works. He had to get options from a lot of persons in Sydney. That is made very plain. Evidently he felt that if he could get an option from Whitin g and Aitken, he could get options for the other part of the works in Sydney. But he had to pay £25,000 to Whitin g and Aitken, should he sell, to meet his liability. Father Shaw was a big shareholder in the company, and apparently had a third interest in it . Only three shareholders are mentioned. The Commission did not show that Father Shaw got this option from Whiting and Aitken for £25,000 and sold it for £55,000. In my opinion, they only wanted to find out as much as was They did not attempt to clear me, or to do me justice. They only went far enough to enable them to make out to the comBroken munity that I was a bad business man, that I failed in my administration of a Commonwealth Department. That attempt to injure me has not succeeded. They object that I did not inquire into the options. Why did not they inquire into them ? They failed to do so. They called only one witness with regard to this option, and he disclosed only what actually happened in his office. Father Shaw must have had big interests, which I am in formed cost him many thousands of pounds; but because of the way things had gone, he was, I believe, financially crippled, and thought that he would do best under the circumstances to get an option from those who held a portion of the land and machinery as security, and then try to get options from others, and sell the works. on That is what he did ; but the whole transaction has been intentionally put in a light which has caused misconception. On page 6 this evidence is recordedMr Starke - He wanted an option to sellwhat?-What we had. He only wanted an option on the in terest that this firm heldAnd how much did he want it for?-We discussed the amount, and finally we found the most he could give us was £25,000. A little lower occur? this evidenceWhy did not you offer it direct to the GoHe vernment?-Because it would not have been a bit of use offering our piece without the other part; it was not a complete thing. You see the position in which I am placed by a summary which is supposed to contain a statement of the facts. A diabolical injustice has been done to me. Mr Cotes was examined by Mr Cussen, my barristerYou only had security for a part of the land?-Yes . Do I understand from you that the more valuable piece of land was not included in your security?-No , that is not correct. should say, as far as the land was concerned, the more valuable part was included in our security undoubtedly, but the engine house, the engines, and so on, were the vital part of the works. And situate on land not included in your security?-Yes . That engine house, and the basement for the engines, had cost several sands of pounds. I wanted to put on the evidence the construction that I put on it to-night, letting my party know everything. H a d I done that, and had a hostile motion been moved, either by the Opposition or by some honourable member on the Ministerial cross bench, I am sure that the majority of honourable members would have stuck to me. Mr Cussen also askedDo you know, in addition to the £27,000 that Sir Rupert Clarke put into this business, how much Father Shaw put into it?- I do not know what amounts Father Shaw put into it. £27,000 was what we paid to the London Bank to take over their securities. They say that I failed to inquire into the option obtained by Father Shaw. I have only quoted the evidence of their witnesses. I did not call one witness on my own behalf. Furthermore, though it is nearly two years since I left the Navy Department, I did not approach an Admiral, the Secretary, or any officer regarding any evidence which might be put before the Commission. I dare any living man to deny that. I have not approached any Navy officer, or any one else. stood on my own ground, knowing that I had done no wrong. If I had done wrong would I not have gone to some of the naval officers or to some other persons, and tried to cover up some of the tracks I had left behind me? But I say again that I did not approach a living soul in the Department, from the RearAdmiral down to the officer of lowest rank, in ""regard to the giving of evidence before the Royal Commission. Was that the action of a guilty man 1 No. The Commission's finding against me isNo inquiry was made as to the details of the option held by Father Shaw. In all probability, if Father Shaw were alive, he could prove that it cost in the vicinity of £80,000 or £90,000 to purchase and equip the works. What had the opI tion that Father Shaw secured tp do with me? I had merely looked into the valuation of the works from the governmental stand-point. Another finding of the Royal Commission against me isThe Cabinet's approval of the purchase was upon condition that the Minister was satisfied thou- that the Navy Department's requirements would keep the plant fully occupied. My answer to this finding is Commander Cresswell's report, which was a complete justification of my action, but was suppressed, and not placed before the Commission until my counsel insisted upon its production. This inquiry had been in progress for twelve months, until it took a definite turn a few weeks ago. I asked for a report from Commander Cresswell because of a wire which I had received from the Treasurer. I forwarded to Commander Cresswell the exact question that the Treasurer had submitted to me, and the answer that I forwarded to the Treasurer was the answer submitted to me by the departmental officer, with the exception of a slight variation of the wording, which did not alter the meaning. The answer forwarded to the Treasurer was a complete reply to his request. I submitted to the Engineer of Radio-Telegraphy the question contained in the Commission's finding, viz., that the Cabinet's approval of the purchase was upon condition that the Minister was satisfied that the Navy I have Department's requirements would keep the plant full y occupied; and his repori, which is in the Navy Office, not only corresponds exactly with the reply which I forwarded to the Treasurer, but also' - bears me out in another statement-that I had full y discussed this matter from every aspect in Cabinet. I told Cabinet that, according to the reports I had received, the works could be made use of by other Departments. I even told the then Acting Prime Minister (Senator Pearce) privately on two occasions, when we were proceeding to his home in St. Ejlda, that even if some doubt might exist in regard to keeping the works fully occupied by wireless requirements, the report furnished to the Postal Department said that there were plenty of machines which could be utilized for the requirements of the Postal Department. Also, at that time. I was aware that the Defence Department were having work done at the .Shaw Wireless Works for the Lithgow Small Anns Factory. Certain portions of machinery were being turned out for the Lithgow Factory by these works at the very time. I was communicating with regard to their purchase. Work was being done for the Defence Department, the plant could have been used for the requirements of the Postal Department; and, as I shall show from the annual report furnished by Commander Cresswell upon the work turned out by these works during the first twelve months, there is no doubt in my mind that they have materially assisted the Commonwealth in the manufacture of certain articles necessary for the carrying on of Government institutions in the interests of Australia. How could the Royal Commission say that the Cabinet's approval of the purchase was upon condition that the Minister was satisfied that the Navy Department's requirements would keep the plant fully occupied ? Mr. Cussen was the barrister who represented me at the inquiry by the Royal Commission. I read the following from page 34 of the evidence taken by the Commission :The Chairman - I do not think you need pursue that point, Mr Cussen, we quite follow it. Mr Cussen- I desire to put before the Commission in connection with Mr Jensen's evidence, Commander Cresswell's report on the first year of the wireless business. This is the original report. (To witness) - That is so; that is your annual report for the first year of the wireless?-Yes . Although this Commission had been in existence for twelve months, the most material evidence that it could have had before it-Commander Cresswell's report on the first twelve months' operations Mr Jensen. of these wireless works-ha d not been submitted to it. A copy of this report was posted to me confidentially by Commander Cresswell-it must have been a year ago-probabl y because of the interest that I had taken in the organization of the wireless system in Australia, after the control of wireless telegraphy had been transferred from the Department of the Postmaster-General to the Navy Department. I was struckby the mature of the report, especially when I had heard certain evidence given by this man Denison, director of the Sydney Sun, who is also a director of the Amalgamated Wireless, in Sydney, which is running a German system of wireless telegraphy, as I have already informed honourable members. Let me .quote from Commander Cresswell's report dealing with the fitting up of ships with wireless since the taking over of these workshops. This report says The number of ships' inspections carried out during the past twelve months is as follows:Melbourne .. .. .. 563 Sydney (portion of a year only) . . 345 Perth . . .. .. 20 928 During the last twelve months the following wireless telegraphy installations have been manufactured in the wireless telegraphy workshops and fitted to the ships mentioned:Alacrity, Governor Musgrave, Sleuth, Carina, Oonargo, Calulu, Victoria Lienta, Sir William Matthews, Booral, Kanna. A little later I shall quote the evidence of this man Denison, who swore that his company had entered into contracts with every shipping company in Australia for the supply of wireless"" apparatus to its ships, and that there was not a ship left on which the Commonwealth Government could place wireless. The report continues The following ships have been refitted with more efficient wireless gear:-Bulla, Seang Bee, Seang Choon, Vestalia, Surada. Long-wave receivers have been fitted in the following ships:-Bymettus, Karroo, Port Melbourne, Hororata, Benalla, Armadale, Bakara, Nashobra, Beltana, Itria, Karoola, Ballarat, 'Orontes, Shropshire, Saldanha, Afric, Suffolk, Anglo-Egyptian, Berrima, Seang Bee, Bulla, Surada, Palermo, Orsova, Commonwealth, Calulu, Carina, Conargo. Central switches have been fitted in the following ships:-Clan Maeoorquodale, AngloEgyptian, Barambah, Seang Choon, Anchises, Dongarra, Bulla. Saldanha. Boonah, VestaUa, Itria, Nestor, Seang Bee, Aeneas, Galulu, Carina, Conargo. These works have manufactured and placed on all these ships a complete wireless system, despite what has 'been said by this man Denison, who caused the then Treasurer, Mr Higgs, to put certain questions to me. The Treasurer wanted to know from me whether the Amalgamated Wireless Company held a contract for the supply of wireless apparatus to all the ships trading in Australia. I replied that this was not the case; that they had certainly fitted some ships with wireless, but that, at the time, there were over sixty coastal vessels which still remained to be fitted with wireless. The Commission failed to get Commander Cresswell's report, which was absolutely in favour of the taking over of these works, and justified their purchase; but I happened to remember it, and showed it to my barrister. Thereupon he asked the Commission if they had had it before them. They said "" No."" It was only because I happened to have a copy of the report that the Commission knew of its existence. I think that Mr Denison should be proceeded against for perjury. The then Treasurer said that he nearly held up the payment of the money to Father Shaw because of his statements. At page 21 of the Radio Engineer's report, which was made twelve months after the purchase of these works, we have the further statementWIRELESS TELEGRAPHY, AND ELECTRICAL WOHKSHOPS, RANDWICK. During the first twelve months from the time of transfer of this service to the Navy Department, the Wireless Telegraph Branch was greatly handicapped by the lack of suitable wireless telegraphy workshops. Representations were made, and a proposal for establishing suitable workshops in Melbourne was being considered when it was decided to take over the works of the Shaw Wireless Company, in Sydney. It was pointed out that these works were too extensive to justify their purchase purely for the requirements of the wireless telegraphy service; if, however, the Commonwealth purchased these works and utilized them, not only for wireless telegraphy purposes, but for the manufacture of electrical and small mechanical apparatus and machinery required by the different Commonwealth Departments, their purchase would be justified, provided, of course, that the various Departments co-operated heartily by placing as many of their orders as possible with the works. The Shaw Wireless Works were subsequently taken over, and it has only been by the acquisition of these works that this Department has been able to meet almost the' whole of the demand for wireless telegraphy apparatus, &c, arising out of the war. Only because of the acquisition of these works has the Department been able to meet the demands made upon it for wireless telegraphy apparatus and for repairs for land stations. In this report the taking over of these works was absolutely justified. The Commission, however, never asked for it, and but for it the lying statements made by Denison would have gone unchallenged. So much for the way in which the Commission dealt with the business intrusted to them. They allowed this man, that man, and the other man to make damaging statements against the Department for the Navy, the Minister and the Government generally in regard to the taking over of these works. They called a few persons who wrote "" damnation,"" so to speak, across the taking over of these works, and it was only in my defence that the production of the report was demanded. Even"" then it was not commented upon by the Commission. In paragraph o of the Commission's summary we have the statement thatThe Minister was aware from the official reports that the Navy Department's requirements would not keep the plant fully employed, but he states that the Cabinet thoroughly understood that the Department's requirements would not keep the plant fully employed, and that work from all other Departments would be necessary to keep it fully employed, but he took no steps to obtain any correction of the Cabinet minute. Who are these Commissioners that they should say that I should have taken steps to secure a correction of the Cabinet minute? What have they to do with me or with the Cabinet? As long as I was satisfied that the matter had been discussed in Cabinet, and that it was understood that the works could not be kept fully employed in dealing only with wireless apparatus-that there was machinery in the works that co""ld be utilized to meet the requirements of other Government Departments-wha t more was necessary? I was in the inner secrets of the Cabinet- I was a member of it. Was it necessary that I should send this minute back to Senator Pearce to have it amended in one minor respect, when I knew what the exact understanding was? Ministers of the Crown were called to give evidence. Senator Gardiner, Senator Russell, and Senator Pearce were called before the Commission, and admitted when the question was put to them that when the proposal was being discussed it was understood that the works were to be taken over for wireless purposes, but could be used also for the purof poses of other Departments. That was thoroughly understood. As Minister for the Navy I should have been only too pleased to allow the works to attend to the requirements of other Departments. As I have pointed out to the Cabinet, the workshops are being used at the present time by the Defence Department. True, the Defence Department is not the Navy Department, but it is a sister branch of the Service, and at the very time that the ex-Treasurer wrote to me the Shaw Wireless Works were carrying out certain work for the Lithgow Small Arms Factory. I believe it has manufactured also for other Government Departments. I had the minute of the Cabinet to the effect that I could buy these works for £55,000 provided I was satisfied that the Navy Department would keep them going. And the Navy Department will keep them going. The Defence Department is the Navy Department, and so is the Postal Department, in the sense that these are Government works controlled by* the Navy Department, and having the machinery and the men capable of doing work required by the Defence Department and. the Postal Department. The Commission urges, however, that I should have had the Cabinet minute corrected. There, again, the inference is that I did something without obtaining the consent of Cabinet. Every line in this summary on the part of the Commission has in it the same sting. The whole summary is saturated with ill-feeling towards me. My answer to paragraph o in the Mr Jensen. Commission's summary is that I explained the whole position to the Cabinet, and that the file of papers was available for any member to see. The Treasurer's request was not limited to the plant being kept occupied by naval requirements, as is shown in paragraph 29, and Commander Cresswell's report fully answered the Treasurer's queries. As long as the Cabinet was satisfied with my action and knew what I was doing, what reason had the Commission to complain that no steps were taken to obtain any correction of the minute? The Commission was simply trying to damn me in the eyes the public, and this paragraph in its summary is also unfair. I come now to paragraph pThe Minister's reply to the Commonwealth Treasurer's inquiry as to whether the works were necessary for the purposes of the Commonwealth failed to disclose the whole of the facts within the Minister's knowledge. That is a diabolical lie on the part of the Commission. My answer to it is that the Commission did not venture to state what facts were within my own knowledge that I did not communicate to the Treasurer. They cannot point to any fact within my knowledge that I failed to communicate. In making this statement they were only going upon certain evidence given by the ex-Treasurer (Mr Higgs), who, when the other side was put to him by my counsel, considerably modified that part of his evidence. He said that if he had known of it before he would not have answered the question as he had done. 'There was no evidence of any witness except Denison that the works were not worth the money. Denison was a biased witness who was running a rival concern, and he lied. He swore that the whole of the shipping around the Australian coast was under contract with his company, whereas I have shown that after taking over these works we manufactured wireless apparatus for and fitted up a great number of ships. Mr Hugh Robert Denison certainly lied, and I hope the Government will look into the evidence given by him. He is the managing director of the Sun Newspaper Company, and is also a director of the Amalgamated Wireless, Sydney. What did this man say, as reported at page 29, when cross-examined by Mr Cussen in regard to an article published in the Sun on 31st July, 1916? The report of this part of his cross-examination-as given at page 29-is as follows: The article said you were doing the work? - I do not think so. It says, "" At the present moment the required on ships, with the exception dynamos, are being manufactured by the Amalgamated Wireless of' Australia?""-That has nothing to do with the company. As a matter of fact, they carefully refrained from giving as any business, for some reason or other. That was apparent that they had refrained from giving you business-deliberately?-I looked like it. However, the purchase by the Government of purchase. these works meant going into a trade that you were doing in supplying plant ships ?-No . .Why not?-For the very simple reason wehad contracts for the whole of the shipping I was. of Australia, and we had them tied up means of contracts for a period of years. The whole of them?-Yes . Do you say that?-The whole of the Ausin Sydney months ago. tralian shipping was under contract to us. I can tell you is, the whole of the Australian shipping has been fitted with wireless by Amalgamated or Australasian Wireless Comment to his company. pany. By Mr Starke - You mean the coastal - All the coastal ships in Australia. By Mr Cussen - What about the shipping coming from the other countries?-The Marwireless coni Company, and other companies, have supnumber of ships. plied those. When war broke out, I take it, a number of ships were fitted with wireless?-Yes ; and Government compelled them to be fitted up, apparently they could not equip them themnot selves. At that time, no. However, do you that this purchase by the. Government Father Shaw's works did not affect your business at all?-Not in the slightest. Nor was it thought in the future it affect it?-That is a different thing. It was a thing that the Amalgamated less, and you, as managing director, rather not see come about?-Yes ; that is perfectly correct, for two reasons. I suppose one is money?-No . The printinuescipal thing was that the Government, unfortunately, had taken the most extreme step in the so-called Balsillie patents, and were proposing to make stations wherever they could, and we were fighting the Government in matter for years, and naturally we thought Government was behind them when they started to develop those patents, which we understood were an infringement of our patents. What is the other reason?-The other""was, we did not want the Government to be a competitor- a competitor with Government money behind it. Cutting into your profits?-Yes ; cutting into everything. Do you say that you knew nothing at all about that article?-That is so. I did not see it until it appeared. Did you make any inquiries about it?-No . No request to any other papers on this matplant ter?-No . I think I wrote a letter to the of Argus and Age on that basis. Did you write that as managing director of the Sum-o r what?-As managing director of the Wireless Company, and signed as such. Did you write that before or after this article?- I think it was after- I am not sure. You cannot give us any idea whether before t or after?-No . The article in the Sun was written the day after the announcement of the And when was your letter written?-Withi n required by a few days, I think. You were against it as managing director that of the Amalgamated Wireless?-Of course by That only goes to prove that they had taken the evidence of this man Denison He was called All to Melbourne, and, I suppose, he repeated the statement that the whole of the ships the in Australian waters were under agreeB u t in answer to ships? that we have the evidence of EadioEngineer Cresswell that since the taking over of the works' he has manufactured apparatus, and installed it on a There are plenty more ships to be fitted with wireless. Many of the those which come to Australia, and some but of those engaged in the coastal trade, are yet equipped in this way. But for my action the Commission would never say have seen Commander Cresswell's report. of When I . heard the lying reports that Denison was making in his endeavour to might damn me in connection with the purchase of the wireless works, I remembered that Wirereport, and my barrister insisted upon its would being included in the evidence. The Commission's summary con(q) Senator Long received a gratuity from Father Shaw for influence which Father Shaw believed he had used. that My answer is that Senator .Long never the used, or attempted to use, any influence over me, and the Commission has obtained not one word of evidence to the conconnexion trary. (r) Nearly £3,000 of the purchase money paid to Father Shaw has not accounted for. That is no business of mine ; it has thing to do with me. But it appears that the Commission obtained a report from police officers in Melbourne regardcombat ing Father Shaw's movements from the time h& was paid u n t i l he became ill . That report was not placed before the Commission. Only a couple of statements from it were quoted. the Commission's report shows, that £3,000 might have gone anywhere. Evi dence was adduced that certain luggage belonging to Father Shaw had been re have ceived by a certain person. no evidence to show that the luggage.had slightest degree. been properly handled, or by whom it had been opened. I do not know the £3,000 has gone, and I do not intend to try to discover it . That is no business of mine. But the Commission port that no proof had been produced that the money had reached me in any way. That is all the Commission could tape? say about me in that regard. My barWireless rister desired that the Commission should make an absolute finding in relation the whole of the circumstances surroundpurchase ing this case, but the Commission has failed to do that. It has submitted report based on certain portions of evidence, which, in every instance, can rebutted. The report was forwarded to the Goverwireless nor-General, and by him forwarded the Government. What has been fect? I have been gazetted out of Government, and no matter what pens to me now, no matter how I try to live down the aspersion that is cast upon me by the action of the Government not giving me a hearing before my party, liberate lying. and in not collaborating with me in a search for evidence to rebut some of the Commission's summarized facts, that can be done for me in future, by this Parliament"", can remove the awful stigma that has been placed upon my character and the suffering I have had to honourable endure for the last few days. can recompense me for that. I am up to the people of Australia as a man upon whom suspicion has been east in Mr Jensen. with his administrative work. That is undoubtedly the effect of the action of Ministers in refusing to sit been with rhe in the Government, or to fight my case. In view of the fact that these notransactions did not occur during the regime of the present Government, M in isters might at least have assisted me to the Commissioners' findings, but they.have refused to do so. I have a mass of notes, full of most convincing matter, and I feel that I could continue replying to the report for another two or So far as three hours. But I shall not weary the - House by doing that. I thank honourable members for the very patient hearing they given me; not even by an interjecThere was tion have they h u rt my feelings in the I am accused of having done certain where things without consulting departmental officers or Cabinet. I admit that. How often have I heard honourable members in did rethis House accuse Ministers of being afraid to act on their own initiative, and of being tied up with departmental red I did not purchase the Shaw Works on my own account; Cabinet purchased them. But I take the full to responsibility of having recommended the to the Cabinet, and I have no regrets in that regard other than that I a have been penalized because of having the done what I deemed to be m y duty in be time of war. I desired to do the best I could to facilitate the equipment with of all ships in Australian waters to instead of that work being left in the its efhands of a company which includes such the a man as that damned liar, Denison. hapBy the evidence that has been forthcoming regarding the operations of the works, since they were acquired by the Governin ment, that man stands convicted of deI did many things while I was in nothing charge of the Navy Department, and I even ask the Government to look into all of them. One morning I went to the Port Melbourne Pier in company with the member for Henty (Mr B o y d ) , Nothing and without reference to Rear-Admiral held Clarkson, or the Naval Board, or Cabinet, I entered into an arrangement to take over control of part of the new pier. I resolved that the repair and fitting up. of transports should be facilitated by establishing our own workshops on the pier, and I instructed an officer to purchase the necessary material and machinery. That action was taken on my own initiative. Let the Government inquire into it. Was there any corruption - or wrong-doing in that regard? .1 will relate to the House something else I did. The newspapers have had a lot to say about me in relation to the contract with Cone and Company for the fitting up of transports. That firm had a contract with the Navy Department for carrying out alterations to vessels and for the supply of the raw material and labour required in connection with the work, on a commission basis of 10 per cent. No matter what Cone and Company paid for labour or material, they received a commission of 10 per ceut. That was the full text of the brief agreement that existed between them and the Government; there were no other conditions or considerations. When I was appointed Minister for the Navy I investigated the contract, and found that the Department was being absolutely robbed-robbed , I repeat. At my instance the company's books were ^ seized and audited by the Auditor-General. That examination disclosed circumstances that were not too nice from the point of view of the Department. I immediately, said to Cone that I did not like the system on which he was working for the Department, and that he was not going to have these conditions a day longer. I forced Cone to another agreement, which made the conditions absolutely better, for the Government in every way. Instead of 10 per cent, for material, he was to get only 5 per cent., and the discounts he had been allowed had to go into the Navy Department for the first time. There were many other restrictive conditions put into the agreement; and he worked under it for some little time. I placed a certain man on board the ships, giving hint a letter signed by me, and conferring on him the absolute right to come and go when he liked, irrespective of the Admiral or any other officer in the Navy Department. This man watched the interests of the Department, and reported to me almost daily the happenings in the course of the alterations of the ships. I state publicly that the man's name was Myers, so that if the Government* desire to inquire into some more of my actions they are at liberty to do so. The man reported to me that things were not right with Cone and Company, who were sub-letting the work to other firms. The result was that these firms were absolutely robbing the Navy Department. They were presenting Cone with certain accounts, and these were added to Cone's accounts again. What did I do ? I kicked those men off the ships. Yet the newspapers have dared to say certain things against me, including the statement that I paid certain moneys to Cone and Company to which they were not entitled. I challenge the Government to look into this matter, and say that I have not saved the country £25,000 by the new agreement, which was made retrospective from the first day they started. A ll their accounts were gone into, and big deductions were made under the agreement, with the result of great savings. I am charged with not taking the advice of the Rear-Admiral, hut the RearAdmiral sent a minute, and wanted me to pay Cone a certain amount, but I would not do so; and because of my action in regard to this company many thousands of pounds were deducted from their accounts. I may also inform the Melbourne newspapers that I held up one of Cone's accounts, and said that I thought that, on account of it, he ought to be charged with a criminal offence; and I sent a minute to the Crown Law Office. I prosecuted Peacock and Smith, but on a technical point they got out of the trouble; yet the newspapers are blaming me over the Cone business. Whatever wrong was going on, I as Minister, immediately stopped it. What did I do without consulting the Board or the Cabinet? I handed over the whole of the work on those ships to the Trades Hall-anothe r cut at the Navy Board, those dignified gentlemen in gold braid. As I say, I handed over the whole of the work to the Trades Hall ; and until I left the Navy Office the unions carried out the woTk in a very creditable manner, and never were accused of wrong-doing in regard to accounts, anyway. Suppose I did buy the Emerald for £4,500 and another-the Togo-for £7,500? The Togo is one of the fastest boats in Australia, and is only ,a few years old, with the best reciprocating engines in the Commonwealth. It was admitted hy the chairman of the Commission to be worth £7,500, as the, repOTt of the evidence shows. I am accused of buying these vessels as if I had no right to exercise my executive powers in this way. But bigger things have been done hy Cabinet Ministers without consulting the Cabinet. The Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes) paid £2,000,000 for ships without consulting the Cabinet, and his powers of executive are no more than mine. The Prime Minister bought those ships without having a valuation, or even the opinion, of the Naval Board of Australia; but he is not condemned or taken before a Commission. I bought the Togo because I wanted a boat like her-becaus e we had not at the time available a littl e tug-boat in Australia. I tried Cockatoo Island and the state shipyards, but there was no material-n o plates for ships or boilers-and I was unable to get what I required. Two little boats were necessary to tide me over the duration, of the War; and I had to "" d o t h in g s "" in the Navy. I never left everything to the Naval Board; if I had, the Department would have gone wanting on many occasions. As I have said, the Chairman of the Commission admitted that the Togo was worth £7,500. The following is an extract from my evidence on the point: Bg the Chairman - I do not think we need waste time on it. I think the Commission is quite satisfied that the value of £7,500 the boat was all right. This shows that the Chairman the boat was worth £7,500, and yet I am condemned for buying her. one of the best built boats of her kind in Australia; beautifully seasoned copper fastenings, with the finest engines that could be provided in Australia, and a speed of 14 knots, though by a misprint that appears as 11 knots in the report-. She was inspected by one of the Naval Mr Jensen. engineers who was sent over to Launceston ; and he not only inspected the boat, but gave her a trial ru n and got 14 knots out of her. His report was to the effect that he had examined the whole of the machinery of the ship, and had found it in excellent order. What more could I do? I had a report from the same officer that, in his opinion, she was worth £7,500. Admiral Creswell knew that this' officer had gone to Launceston to make this inspection, and he had no objection to it . But Sir William was ill for about three weeks, and, before I bought, the Togo, I rang up his office and asked his chief clerk to communicate with him, and see if he had any objection to the purchase. The reply - from Admiral Creswell was "" No , "" and on that I purchased her. All the same, I am blamed for doing so, while, as I say, the Chairman of the Commission himself was satisfied as to the value. What did the Commission do? They made a rotten, silly statement concerning my action, or intended to apply to my action, in purchasing the boat. They say that the boat is not suitable for what she was purchased for, and that tenders have been called for her, with the result that one for £1,000 and another for £350 were sent in . In my opinion, these tenders almost give rise to a suspicion of "" f a k e ' ' in order to belittle me. The Emerald was offered to me for £6,000, but I refused to buy her at that price. The agent for. the owner interviewed me again, and wished me to rent her, but I said that the Commonwealth was financial enough to buy any boats she wanted, and that I did not want to rent her. A f t e r he had visited me on two or three occasions I told him that I wanted a boat to tide me over the war, and that while I knew she was not a for proper tug, she would suit our circumstances, and I would give £4,500. An thought - inspection of. the vessel had taken place, and officers of the Naval Works DepartShe is ment had said she was in good order. She had come down from Brisbane, and, wood, therefore, was seaworthy. Her h u l l, machinery, and boiler were in good order, and she was of fairly good dimensions127 feet long, with a good beam and f a ir draught. On the whole, I could see five years' work in her at the very least. In - view of the fact that dredges were about to start at the Westernport basin, we .required a small tug, and I could not get .one b u i l t ; and I said that, even if we did not spend much on her, the Emerald would suit us for the time being. rang up Mr Treacy, and, in his presence, offered Croker £4,500, giving him 4en minutes to think over it . He accepted the offer, and I instructed Mr Treacy to make all provisions for the completion of the sale. I admit to the House that I took the risk of buying this boat, although I had never had a trial of her; but I had a report, and knew she would do for me in the smooth water. Admiral Creswell was one who took umbrage at my buying the boat without consulting him. The-following is an extract from Admiral Creswell's evidence: By the Chairman - Do the Commission understand that the Emerald has been doing useful Government work?-Yes , she is doing good work. Although not suitable for the purpose of a tug-boat, yet she has done or is doing other work?-Yes . Would they require a boat of some kind to do the work she is doing?-Yes . We were in want of a boat for that special purpose, to take coal and water round to the dredges, instead of the dredges having to come into coal, &c. It will be seen that Admiral Creswell, under cross-examination, said that the Emerald was doing good useful work, although she cost only £4,500. What sort of boat can be purchased in these days for that amount? Would any one expect a destroyer or an ironclad ?So far as the Board knows about this vessel?-Sh e is doing good work. By Mr Starke - In examining the hull and the engines of the .Emerald originally, who was the proper officer that the Board should have referred such an examination to. Practically it was referred to Mr Swan and Mr. Treacy. Mr Treacy says he was quite unsuitable for such work?-Yes . What about Mr Swan?-He may have referred matters of that kind to the members of the Naval Board. The Emerald had been previously offered to me, and the Navy Board could have gone into the matter, but did not do so. Who was the technical officer?- I should Gonsider the Third Naval Member the technical officer. Cross-examined by Mr Cussen - What do you think is the value of that vessel as she now is?- I could not give you an idea. I could only tell you she has been doing work for us and contributing to the service. I bought the Togo and the Emerald "" off my own bat,"" and never attempted to I make out that I had done otherwise. I have never endeavoured to make any other person responsible for my own action. I have done something else without consulting the Board or the Cabinet. What did I do? Did the Commission give me credit for this? No. A certain transport was about to leave Australia. At-the time, I was a Minister in a Labour Government. When she arrived in Melbourne, all the firemen walked off her. On my own initiative, I put certain Naval Beservists on board, and sent her to Sydney and Newcastle, where she got sufficient coal to enable her to proceed to Europe. The Naval Eeservists, acting as firemen, brought her back to Melbourne; and at 10 o'clock in the morning of the day on which she was to sail, the whole of the seamen on board walked off in sympathy with the firemen. The transport was due to leave at noon with 1,200 soldiers, who were on board. I got on the 'phone, and pointed out to the secret a r y and the officials of the Firemen and Seamen's Union the serious effect of this action in war time, and pleaded for men to enable the boat to get away in time. "" Mr Minister,"" they said, "" w e cannot do it . The unionists are defying the executive."" I replied, "" I must have the men."" They said, "" They will not go aboard."" Without taking the matter to the Naval Board, and without consulting Cabinet, I rang up the Williamstown Naval Depot, where there were some 200 or 300 Naval Eeservists. I told the Captain in charge to select forty-five men, to give them their knapsacks, to put them on the Williamstown train, and to send them round to Port Melbourne forthwith. It was then a quarter-past 10, and I said that they must be at Port Melbourne at a quarter to 12. I took it on myself to do this in the interests of the war, feeling that I was doing the right thing at the right time. I put the boat under naval discipline, and let the lines go, defying the unions of Australia. I did not take that matter to Cabinet or to the Naval Board; I did it on my own. I knew that I was running the risk of causing a big strike; but, although a Labour Minister, I felt that in time of war no transport should be stuck up. The powers intrusted to me enabled me to do what I did. Let that action be put against the buying of these two little vessels, and against the attempt of the Commission to belittle me by their findings. I have referred to these matters to show that, on occasions other than those mentioned by the Commission, I have done things without consulting the Naval Board. ""What was the Naval Board? I was its boss, its president. I had the power to veto anything it might determine. Was I to do things only in a red-tape fashion? A Minister who is not game to do things for himself in the exercise of his ex'ecutive powers is not worth his salt. What have I to be ashamed of? I am accused of having spent a paltry £12,000 on the purchase of two vessels without making the proper investigation to ascertain whether they were worth the money. I told the Commission, in regard to the Togo, "" You say that only £1,000 was offered for her, and that there was another offer of £350; but I take it on myself to get £6,000 for her now, although she has been chopped about and altered this way and that."" Not a word was said in reply to me. The Commission found that I did certain things without conferring with the Navy Board or wifh the Cabinet. Let me tell you, sir, that in that same Navy Department, until I stopped it, officers, clerks, and storemen were purchasing tens of thousands of pounds worth of goods without a tender, and without a quote. I issued a minute stopping it. Did the Commission look into that? Have the Commission condemned those officers and others for doing things that were irregular and unknown to the Minister? Not tens of thousands of pounds worth only, but hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of stuff were purchased in the Navy Department by servants who were getting only £5 per week. Some big firms in Melbourne received £40,000 and £50,000 for goods without a quotation or a tender. I stopped that. My minutes are in Mr Jensen. evidence. But departmental officers are not to be accused for doing these things. Their transactions are not to be looked into. It is the Minister who is condemned. I thank you, Mr Speaker, and honourable members, for your hearing. I . feel my position very much. No man can say that in my speech I have been spiteful to anybody. I have not been spiteful to the Government. I have said certain things, but I have kept within the limits to be expected of an ex-Cabinet. Minister. At least, I shall never do what one Minister did here: I shall never tell the House what took place in an Executive meeting. The trials and suffering that I have undergone during the past, few days have been great; and if ever a man was tempted to say something, I have been so tempted. The day perhaps will come when many of those who have listened to me will overlook what has happened during the past ten days, so far as I am concerned. I have made my statement; I have produced facts. There are many other matters into which I could go, but time will not permit. The House has treated me well. I have now been here for three, hours and ten minutes, and have enough material in the way of notes for another three hours; but what I could say more would not, perhaps, convince honourable members beyond their present convictions. I am sorry for - what the Government did to me. Had I had a chance to go before the party, they might perhaps have viewed matters in another light. However, I must take things as they are. I can walk down Collins-street holding my head up, because I have done no wrong. The Ministry have not charged me with doing anything wrong. Not one thing. Is not that so, Mr Acting Prime Minister ?",209
1024,Mr WATT,NAVY AND DEFENCE,"In . that sense, yes.",231
1025,Mr JENSEN,NAVY AND DEFENCE,"Outsid e the way in which the report is worded, the Ministry have not said another thing to me about my administration. Have you, sir?",231
1026,Mr WATT,NAVY AND DEFENCE,No .,231
1027,Mr JENSEN,NAVY AND DEFENCE,"I thank you, Mr. Speaker, - and I thank every honourable member. I shall now consider where I shall take my seat in this chamber. I do not know that I shall appear in the House any more until next session. In the meantime, I shall think over matters. ' ADJOURNMENT.",231
