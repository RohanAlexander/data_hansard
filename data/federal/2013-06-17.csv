Other cost to secure reliable labour have resulted in and looking for a more secure, less volatile need is a federal bureaucracy that is intent on sadly, this is what seems to be occurring. I argue against the Australian Pesticides and its continued push to ban fenthion, the last remaining effective cover spray for the control known as medfly.

I am continuing to press the new agriculture understand the implications of the APVMA's proposal on the local fruit growing industry.

30,Dr STONE,BILLS," I am pleased remarks on this matter. The anti-dumping legislation on what we had before. I recommend, though, policy, which goes even further towards giving system of anti-dumping and countervailing measures. The fact is that Australia has been lagging steadfastly refusing to consider what imports products. There were 189 anti-dumping and countervailing 2005-06. The highest number of initiated cases EU with 26 cases, followed by China with 16 and New Zealand were not far behind. They were The three countries with the most measures Measures usually last five years but can countervailing cases initiated by Australia compared with the early 1990s. We turned producers when it came to their pleas for anti-dumping give them a fair go-some sort of evening-up employ, create value, generate income The petroleum, coal, chemical and associated initiator of anti-dumping and countervailing actions the largest number of anti-dumping initiated of all cases involve China. China also As far as food is concerned, most countries food safety standards through the sanitary Australia we have done neither. So there is own food manufacturers go to the wall. We the combination of high costs in Australia and impossible to bring an anti-dumping action. There is only one investigation reported that China or South Africa with respect to food mushrooms imported from China.

Quite simply, our competitors, our neighbours very active in defending and supporting their imports. It is about time Australia got with the our country. Too many people scream: 'Subsidies!'. talks about lawful, WTO consistent, legal, imposed. It is time we grew up-before I commend this bill and the various elements policy. We obviously support these amendments following the next election. We say: may fresh-food producers-take heart. Mrs MIRABELLA (Indi) (16:07): In rising dumping Measures) Bill 2013 and the Customs I point out that these bills represent a fifth government in reasonably quick succession. return to a number of points I made in previous intention to exhaustively retrace a lot of old these bills. I also will not use this debate to dumping that preceded any significant government actively been pushing for a series of revisions 2010 election-in other words, long before Labor make changes. We have also consistently said that we support wherever those changes are sensible and practical. assurances that the changes embodied in these about supporting the changes that free up the connection with the lesser-duty rule. On the principle of amending the operation within Australia particularly if that means-as is implied by the in the explanatory memorandum-the main intent more like those in other countries. We also do not object to the stated reasons to anti-circumvention, given that it has essentially to extend the range of options available to including addressing the practice of sales payment of duties. In other words, we are usually an unwise approach when dealing with changes will provide the minister with enhanced of the application of duties to those companies Australia as well as allow for a greater uniformity countries. All of that said, it is worth restating the dumping bills over the course of the past two peaches from China were introduced by New and other signatories of the WTO have been own country's manufacturing or fresh-food strength. It is a case of maturity on the part of They scream: 'Protection!' when someone anti-dumping or countervailing duties being we lose all of our manufacturing sector. of the bill, and I commend our coalition and look forward to a stronger regime our manufacturers and primary producers-our to speak on the Customs Amendment (AntiTariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill 2013 set of anti-dumping changes introduced by the I will therefore happily use the opportunity to debates; however, it is certainly not my ground or to speak for a particularly long time on extensively restate the coalition's policy on antiaction in this area. In short, we have to the anti-dumping regime since before the finally started to signal its own intentions to changes to the current anti-dumping regime, We are happy to accept the government's two bills meet those tests. We are comfortable minister's powers and decision-making scope in surface, there is also nothing wrong with the of the retrospective duties provisions, changes in the legislation and the description is to make sure that those provisions work for the introduction of new provisions relating been said the logic behind these changes is the government to deal with anti-circumvention, at a loss and other attempts to evade the full taking the government at its word-albeit it is the current government-and accepting that its discretion in considering the level and timing that are found to have dumped goods in of approach between Australia and other point that I have made many times on several antiyears-namely, that effective administration of the national anti-dumping system relies far does purely on legislative change, in and of We have just heard from the member for agriculture and food processing and the issue impact, particularly in our home state of Victoria.

But, to go one step further, let us remember dumping represents only one part of a much problems and crises that are besetting Australian statistics that say more than 140,000 manufacturing last five years. That is an unprecedented record. say, 'But we have been losing manufacturing jobs under the whole term of the Howard government employed in manufacturing and we had a net loss more on political will and common sense than it itself.

The total cuts are now in welcome funding for the screening process, of prevention and research.

I think this is the search is always to find constructive ways acknowledge and thank the member for her work who have had family experience, electorate this space. Having said that, let me put this in a broader the issue, the steps forward and then a little standard. The magnitude of the issue, as Australians are diagnosed with bowel cancer each a week, on average. I think most of us in this people who have been lost to the condition, that background, recognising that there is something question is: are there avoidable things that improve patient care? The answer is: of course. The progressive extension last half-century is testimony to that. In this particular space there is a series view. Firstly, and most importantly, there funding and it comes from people who are willing be regular screening every two years for people life to bowel cancer by up to 33 per cent. Each through our newsletters, through our community that males are more likely to ignore. In a classic acknowledging their own health challenges. message is that you do not have to wait until encouragement for regular screenings and there every two years for those who are over 50. But media, in sport or in parliamentary per 100. If you then looked at the deaths from these three municipalities, the average annual was 7.7 per 100,000 and in the City of is that Whittlesea, the municipality that has the of deaths and the highest risk as shown by of reasons, that that is perhaps not a surprising are pockets of the people we represent, pockets of systems like this one, who need to be properly the opportunity of Red Apple Day, to say, importance of undergoing the proper screening the record show that the member for Scullin red apple in recognition of the day! to be able to give bipartisan support to bowel cancer. This parliament is at its best an important recognition of a critical issue, and forward across the parliament. So, I want to and note that there are people on both sides experience and medical experience in working in context. I want to talk about the magnitude of bit about what we can perhaps do beyond the the motion notes, is that more than 14,000 year. Of those, we lose, tragically, about 77 House will have known directly or indirectly and I can certainly speak to that myself. Against that will take each of us inevitably, the can be done to improve the quality of life and of life over the last century and over the of initiatives which can and should be taken, in my is the educative work. That education comes from to speak out. And that means there should aged 50 and over. This can reduce the loss of of us needs to have a role in our communities, fora-particularly the males. It is something Australian family the men are not great at Often these things are diagnosed too late. The you are 50. Starting at 40, there should be should be clear incentives for screenings the voice has to go out through people in the life. I think we need to do that. In the same way that it has become standard done for breast cancer, early intervention establish. What it can do is prolong life, give the extraordinary human suffering which physical sense and in a familial sense. Looking to the long-term, I would like to great friends in life is Dr Michael Burnet.

My electorate shares a demographics are similar. It is very important in the process of raising awareness because One of the things I and the members for Scullin, fact that there are many barriers to prevention avail themselves of the preventative and screening have to do with language. My electorate has and culturally diverse and there is a very large electorate. Health issues generally are going constituency. Indeed, the so-called Mediterranean diet, familiar with, has often been lauded as a question is: why is it that bowel cancer is Southern Europeans? I think there are two reasons a period of time that the southern Mediterranean against bowel cancer, but people who came periods of time change their dietary habits. and therefore lose the preventative qualities of should be the case, because we are now at a these diverse cuisines and diets. What do we practice for women to have searches and tests is exactly the same sort of culture we need to people a real shot and can also lead to avoiding comes when people are taken early, both in a talk briefly about medical research.

We must raise awareness and encourage a life-saving screening kit that they not only three years. I commend the member for Shortland about bowel cancer prevention.

June is Bowel Cancer Awareness place this Wednesday, 19 June, which is Red Australia on their work and on this particular clever use of the humble apple. The apple pin is symbolic of the bowel cancer message. Australia's website as they have a very succinct of the promotion of bowel cancer awareness. Its Australia. Bowel Cancer Australia says: as an abstract of a human colon. If detected early and removed, the worm is unable to early through screening it can be removed and if bowel cancer is detected early it can be with many other people who had their cancer rates of bowel cancer in the world. It is the and around 14½ thousand Australians will be is far too many. There will be almost 4,000 Australians who will die from bowel cancer every cancer when detected early, but sadly less early. One of the issues that faces us with without early warning symptoms or symptoms individual. The question is: what are the include a recent, persistent change in bowel bloating, fullness or cramps; stools that tummy; weight loss for no known reason; persistent feeling very tired. In the case of my mum, the only symptom about 10 am she needed to go and have a lie out. For a woman in her early 60s, as she was it was very unusual for her. Fortunately, she found out that she was anaemic. She then went that she had a tumour and she was operated removed. Fortunately, mum has been clear of so important and sometimes the symptoms are is certainly essential and it is essential even includes those who are aged 50 years and disease; those who have previously had polyps had a significant family history of bowel cancer where there is a family history of bowel cancer, before the age of 55, or if more than one relative cancer. I certainly encourage everyone to participate their symptoms-do not just ignore them. Mrs PRENTICE (Ryan) (20:43): I rise today and I thank the member for Shortland for advance of Red Aussie Apple Day. As previous mentioned, this Wednesday is Red Aussie campaign to raise awareness of bowel cancer. cancer death in Australia after lung cancer. Australians every week, yet bowel cancer is detected early. If bowel cancer is detected before per cent chance of surviving for more than five years. The Cancer Council has called for the Program to be accelerated after research showed published in the Medical Journal of Australia screening program were twice as likely as earliest stage when it is easiest to treat. People diagnosed at the disease's later stage, The coalition is committed to improving screening measures for the early detection previous coalition government initiated the year. It is one of the most curable forms of than 40 per cent of bowel cancers are detected early detection is that bowel cancer can develop can be overlooked or dismissed by the symptoms that we should be looking for? They habit; blood in the stool; frequent gas pains; are narrower than usual; a lump or mass in the severe abdominal pain; vomiting; and that she had was tiredness. She found that by down because she was just exhausted and worn at the time, that would certainly be unusual, and went to her local GP, who did a blood test and on to have a colonoscopy, where they found on shortly afterwards, and the tumour was cancer ever since. Given that early detection is vague or non-existent, I believe that screening more so for those who are at particular risk. That over; those who have had an inflammatory bowel or adenomas in the bowel; and those who have polyps. The risk is significantly increased if a close relative developed bowel cancer on the same side of the family has had bowel in the screening program and to follow-up to speak on the motion before the House raising the important issue of bowel cancer in speakers on this motion have already Apple Day, part of the month-long national Bowel cancer is the second highest cause of Sadly, the disease claims the lives of 77 one of the most curable forms of cancer when it has spread beyond the bowel, there is a 90 rollout of the National Bowel Cancer Screening it could save hundreds of lives.
