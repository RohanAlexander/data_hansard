3,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Has the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) any information to give us as to the intention of the Government with regard to paying their allowance to the dependants of soldiers who have deserted, and with regard to placing the mothers of ex-nuptial children on the same footing as widowed mothers?",23
4,Mr WATT,Unknown,About the matter last mentioned I have no information to give at present; the matter first mentioned is still the subject of negotiation between Government and the Government of Victhe toria. PRICE OF MEAT.,23
5,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I would like to ask the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt), or the Minister in charge of price fixing, whether the Government can make any the announcement as to the increase in price of meat they have decided upon at the request of the squatters and butchers?",23
6,Mr WATT,Unknown,"It is not usual for. honourable friend to couch a question in such discourteous language. I suggest, that, on second thoughts, and on reflecof tion, he should give notice of the question to the Minister in charge of price fixing.",23
7,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"In view of the arrangetity ments which are being made in regard Australian raw products, is it the intenwar tion of the Government to introduce at once a scientific Protectionist Tariff signed to protect Australian secondary - industries? If the Government do not propose to at once amend the Australian Customs Tariff in such a manner as give adequate protection to Australian dustries, do they propose to make any such amendment during the life of the present Parliament?",23
8,Mr WATT,Unknown,"I know that the honorto able member's question deals with a very important matter, but it is hardly of a character that may be labelled urgent. If the honourable member will give notice p i his question, it will, be considered. AMENDMENTS . INCORPORATION BILL. Bill presented by Mr GROOM, and read a first time. WHEAT POOL.",23
9,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"Varyin g statements are made by Federal Ministers, and State Ministers, and also occasionally by Comptrollers in regard to the operation of the Wheat Pool, some of which have a very damaging effect on the value of wheat scrip. It has recently depreciated from this cause by as much as 2^d. per bushel. In view of the great importance of the financial stability of this scrip will the this Acting Prime Minister take counsel with Wheat Board for the purpose of seeing whether an official weekly bulletin can not be issued giving information in regard to the operations of the Pool, not only the information, but also the essential facts upon which it is based, so that holders of the scrip may form an estithe mate themselves as to its value?",23
10,Mr WATT,Unknown,"The proposition is somewhat novel. I have not heard it sugmy gested that frequent information of an official character should be issued, and I am somewhat doubtful as to the possibility giving facts that would be of service to the wheat-grower without knowing what is taking place at the other end of the world. Information can be given as to the quantity of wheat stored in AusTARIFF. tralia, the quantity shipped, and the quanconsumed each week, or each month, to but, obviously, for various reasons, in time, we cannot publish the facts in relation to the difficulty of shipping. It deis what prospective buyers at the other end of the worldthink of our crop that governs all these matters, and clearly as I am not in a position to give that into formation I could not publish it. Howinever, I will confer with the members of the Australian Wheat Board as early as practicable in order to see whether it may not be possible to do something in the direction of regular publications in order stabilize the fluctuating wheat scrip. FRENCH MISSION.",23
11,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Is it the intention of the visiting French Mission to be in . Melbourne next week wben the Royal Agricultural Sbow will be held? . Mr ""WATT - Fro m information I bave received I am inclined to tbink that ' French Mission cannot arrive in Melwould bourne at so early a date. In order to leader. - arrange for the maximum amount of sightseeing of a vital kind within the shortest possible time, the itinerary of the Mission was arranged some time in advance of its arrival, and to iSydney first, it was thought advisable that Queensland should be visited the weather became too hot. Mission will come down to Melbourne in due course, and is' timed to arrive about 14th October next. It will then proceed to Tasmania, and return to bourne in time to co-ordinate with other great festival which is held here .November. SOVIETS' REPRESENTATIO NI N AUSTRALIA. . Mr KELLY - Has the Acting Prime Minister"" received any official confirmation of the news published in the press that the 'Soviets in Russia have declared war against the British Empire? Furpurchased ther, has the special representation of posits in Tasmania. - these Soviets in Australia been terPrime minated since this declaration of war? - Mr Watt - We have no official formation of the kind referred to by the honourable member. Beyond that I do not care to say anything at the present time. PRIME MINISTER.",23
12,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"Has the Acting Prime Minister any official information, - in regard to the cabled statements that there is a movement on foot to retain the River iron deposits. services of the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) in England? I intention of the .Government to co-operate with that part of the Empire in order to secure the achievement of such a desirable"" 1 state of affairs? - Mr Watt - I think that, in the absence of the Prime Minister, the question is framed in insulting terms. However, T will answer one portion of it.",24
13,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"The honourable gentleman is very, sensitive!",24
14,Mr WATT,Unknown,"If the leader of the party to which the honourable member for Batman belongs were absent, and sneers were levelled at him from this side of the the House, I am sure the honourable membeT be the first to defend his absent",24
15,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,My leader would not go away under false pretences.,24
16,Mr WATT,Unknown,'That is an equally inas it came sulting observation.,24
17,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown, I ask the honourable member for The Batman to withdraw his imputation.,24
18,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,'Certainly . I withdraw here it if it is offensive to any one.,24
19,Mr WATT,Unknown,"Ignorin g what is objecMeltionable in the question, and replying to anoue portion of it only, I can say that we in have received no information of the kind to which the honourable member for Barrier has referred. NA - DEPOSITS, REPORTED GOVERNMENT PUECHASE.",24
20,Mr FOWLER,TASMANIAN IRON ORE,"It has been reported in the press that the Government have certain extensive iron ore deWill the Acting Minister state, if that report is correct, what is the nature of the transinaction, and the reasons for it?",24
21,Mr WATT,TASMANIAN IRON ORE,"I shall not give an extensive answer to the honourable member's inquiry, and should prefer the larger question which it involves to be placed upon the notice-paper. Dealing with the first part of the inquiry, I may say that we have not purchased any iron ore deposits, but that we have secured a twelve months' option) over what are known as the Blythe If the honourable member desires further information, If so, is it the ask him to give notice. PRICE FIXING . - SHOP NOTICES-PRIC E OF SOFT FRUITSCHAFF BAGS-PROSECUTIONS .",24
22,Dr MALONEY,TASMANIAN IRON ORE,"Will the Minister in charge of price fixing state to whom application 'should be made for copies of notices of the prices fixed, which have to - be exhibited in the shops where the goods to which they relate are offered for sale? MT. GREENE - It has been freely advertised that sueh notices are to be obtained at every post-office throughout the Commonwealth. - Mr MCWILLIAMS - Will the Minister in charge of price fixing lay on the table of the House the report of the Commission made last season as to the advisableness of 'fixing the price of soft fruits ? MT. GREENE - I am not quite sure to what extent the report contains confidential information. I shall examine it, and advise the honourable member later on.",24
23,Mr NICHOLLS,TASMANIAN IRON ORE,"Is the Minister for Price Fixing aware that a large number of agents dealing in bags have charged an excessive price, for chaff bags, and that - many firms have withheld the distribution of such bags, and so compelled farmers to sell their haystacks at an unreasonably low price?",25
24,Mr MASSYGREENE,TASMANIAN IRON ORE,"I am not, but if any individual case is brought under my notice, proper action will be taken.",25
25,Mr CHARLTON,TASMANIAN IRON ORE,"Is the Minister charge of price fixing aware cases where persons have been found charging prices in excess of those fixed - regulation, no action has been taken, while in others prosecutions have been ordered? Is it equitable that certain individuals should be picked out? If the honourable gentleman thinks it is not, will he see that every trader gets the same treatment?",25
26,Mr MASSYGREENE,TASMANIAN IRON ORE,"Generally speaking, every man receives the same treatment. Where a more or less technical offence committed, the usual course is warning, but should the offence be repeated, a prosecution takes place. .SEVENTH WAR-LOAN.",25
27,Mr FALKINER,TASMANIAN IRON ORE,"In connection with the forthcoming war loan, I desire to the Treasurer whether all subscriptions are to be paid into the Commonwealth Bank, as usual, or whether subscriptions will Ibe allowed to remain in the banks that find the money for the subscriber until they are required by the Commonwealth Government?",25
28,Mr WATT,TASMANIAN IRON ORE,"The matter referred to formed the subject of considerable dissome cussion between - myself and some of the commercial banks in the two principal cities of Australia. An arrangement has been effected, which I understand is agreeable to the banking community, that a more liberal system of transfer from the commercial banks to the Commonwealth Bank shall be allowed. Instead of the commercial banks being required to pay to the Commonwealth Bankinstanter, on the instalment date, the amounts which they have collected in respect of their clients' subscriptions, there will be allowed a period over which that transfer will"" extend. In view of the number of days on which instalments are receivable there will be practically a gradual but continuous transfer, as required, from the commercial banks to the Commonwealth Bank. PRESS DELEGATION TO LONDON.",25
29,Mr MATHEWS,TASMANIAN IRON ORE,Will the Acting Prime Minister lay on the Library table the correspondence which passed between himself and the proprietors of the Sydney in Morning Herald respecting the Press that in some Delegation to London?,25
30,Mr WATT,TASMANIAN IRON ORE,"I invite the honourable by member to give notice of his question so that I may consider it. The correspondence was somewhat unique, and it would be necessary for me, before answering the honourable member's question, to go through it again to. determine whether it is really confidential.",25
31,Mr TUDOR,TASMANIAN IRON ORE,"Is it not a fact that there was a threat to "" sack "" the editor if the is "" boss "" was not allowed to go as a memto give a ber of the delegation?",25

Mr Watt - I do not carry in my mind all the details as to the personnel of the delegation. I believe it includes proprietors, but the majority of the delegates were chosen from the editorial staffs. The editor of one Labour paper was invited to make the trip,- but for reasons known to the honourable member, he did not accept. In addition,- Mr Anstey, M.P., who was in England, was invited to join the delegation. I will supply the honourable member with any particulars he requires. WOOL TOPS INDUSTRY .",25
34,Mr RILEY,TASMANIAN IRON ORE,"H as the Acting Prime Minister come to a final decision in regard to the important wool-tops industry at Botany, New South Wales? About 700 meu who were engaged in that industry are still out of employment, and no finality has yet been arrived at.",26
35,Mr WATT,TASMANIAN IRON ORE,"I think it was Queen Mar y who said that, at her death, the word "" Calais"" would be found written on her heart. I believe that, on my death, the word "" w o o l - to p"" will he found written on the lingering fragments of my brain. Using the word in its ordinary sense, finality seems to be impossible in this matter. Only this day I have been in consultation with others in yet another endeavour to secure a settlement. I have summoned a - conference of those most affected, including the chairman of the Central Wool Committee, to meet at Parliament House tonight with the object of trying to accomplish finality by some of the many means by which it should be possible. EXPORT OF HONEY .",26
36,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,TASMANIAN IRON ORE,"H as the attention of the Minister for Trade and Customs been drawn to a statement in the press regarding a supposed conspiracy to smuggle a large quantity of honey out of this country; and, if so, will he state whether prosecutions are to follow ?",26

38,Mr BRENNAN,TASMANIAN IRON ORE,"I wish b ask the Acting Prime Minister whether it is a fact that he, as acting head of the Government, haa established the precedent of undertaking on behalf of the Commonwealth tb pay the personal expenses of the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) in connection with litigation in which he is involved in the Old Country? If so, does he not think it sufficient that the Commonwealth should be saddled with the expense of the Prime Minister's public misdeeds without being involved also in his private quarrels?",26
39,Mr SPEAKER,TASMANIAN IRON ORE," Order! ' I remind honourable members that questions should be couched in respectful language, and must not convey an imputation. I ask the honourable member for Batman (Mr . Brennan) to withdraw any imputation contained in his question.",26

42,Mr GROOM,TASMANIAN IRON ORE,"Speakin g from memory, I think that the provisions of the Repatriation Act apply to all nurses who go abroad with the troops. However, if the honourable member will repeat his question tomorrow, I shall, in the meantime, ascertain the exact situation. PRICE OF TIN .",26
43,Mr FINLAYSON,TASMANIAN IRON ORE,"In view of the perturbations amongst t in miners in regard to the fixing of the price of t in , I should like to know what decision has been arrived at in the matter? Mr ""WATT - At the request of the Prime Minister, I am dealing with this as a metal matter. The arrangements for an association of tin producers have been under consideration for some time.. It was attempted in 1915, but then failed; bnt we have since developed the matter almost to the stage of completion, though I do not know exactly where the matter rests today. I understand that an agreement is in course of being signed by which it is hoped that the price of tin and' the power to sell will be very much better for the producer for the period of the war, and perhaps afterwards. PEICE OF COPPER.",26
44,Mr BLAKELEY,TASMANIAN IRON ORE,"The Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt.) recently formed me that steps had been taken to continue to fix the price of copper up to December. What steps, if any, are being taken by the Government to take a new contract, or enter into negotiations the further continuance of the fixed price ?",27
45,Mr WATT,TASMANIAN IRON ORE,"This matter has been the hands of the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) in London, and has caused good deal of concern. After much negoPrinie tiation, the Prime Minister succeeded inducing the Home authorities to extend position? the existing contract to the 31st December. Beyond that, according to the latest advices, he has not been able to persuade notice. them to go. We hope, however, that, before, the honourable' gentleman leaves Great Britain, a further extension will have been arranged. PRICE OF BUTTER.",27
46,Mr TUDOR,TASMANIAN IRON ORE,"A promise was made without notice. in this House that when the butter production in Victoria was suflicient for homo consumption the price would be reduced. In view of the fact that nearly 500 tons were produced last week, and consumed only 300 tons, I should like to know when the price is going to reduced to the figure at which it stood before we were compelled to import from Queensland.",27
47,Mr MASSYGREENE,TASMANIAN IRON ORE,"The ""price of butter Brothers ? ' has already been reduced.",27

53,Mr FOWLER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Is there a 'Soviet Russian Republic sit the present time?,27
54,Mr WATT,FEDERAL CAPITAL,That I cannot say. I suggest that matters which involve international relationship ought not to be made the subject of questions to Ministers o WOOL TOPS CONTRACT.,27
55,Mr HIGGS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"'Before the Government we recedes from the position taken up with regard to the wool tops contract, will the be Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) make the House acquainted with the auditor's reports on the Government partnership with the Colonial Combing,- Weaving, and Spinning Company, and Whiddon",27
56,Mr WATT,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The honourable member who asks the question knows a great deal about this matter, having elicited much information through the Department. This is a question that I do not think it advisable to answer offhand; indeed, at this stage I wouldrather not answer any questions at all regarding the matter, because I am hopeful to see it put into shipshape order, when I shall be happy to give any reasonable information required. HONEY INDUSTRY.",27
57,Mr RODGERS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"In view of the very limited supply of tins in this country, and of the prospects of an exceptionally good honey harvest, will the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) endeavour to arrange with the Munitions Department to liberate sufficient supplies of tins for the honey industry? Further, when second-hand containers are collected and used by the genuine producer, as against the dealer or trader, will the Department forego the profit now asked from the ordinary collector? ,",28
58,Mr WATT,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I am not sufficiently acquainted with the conditions and prostention. pects of the industry to give an answer; but if the honourable member will, in writing, make representations on the interests affected, I shall see that they are properly considered by the Department.

61,Mr MATHEWS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Seeing that the Administrator of the Northern Territory is in the southern part of Australia, and in view of the turmoil and chaos which at present there prevail, will the Government hold some sort of inquiry, and take evidence from residents of the Territory, with a view to obviating future trouble? i i",28
62,Mr GLYNN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I do hot know to what ."" turmoil"" the honourable member refers; there are always disturbances in the elements, even in the Northern Territory. I can assure the honourable member, in respect to the last series of questions I received regarding this matter, numbering twenty-two, that I find it almost impossible to answer the whole of them, because some of them are almost equivalent to statements concerning things which do not exist. However, I shall give the honourable member information in regard to some of the points to which he drew atbehalf of AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL PORCE. SERVICE OF RETURNED OFFICERS.",28
63,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Will the Minister representing the Minister for Defence lay on the table the papers relating to the statement alleged to have been made by General Birdwood that he did not desire officers who had been returned to Ausretralia to be again sent to the Front?,28

68,Mr FINLAYSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"In view of theWheat - anticipated serious shortage in the cotton production of the world, and of the i m mense possibilities of cotton culture in Papua and the Northern Territory, does the Minister for Home and Territories contemplate any steps to take advantage of this splendid opportunity for the enthe couragement of Australian production?",29
69,Mr GLYNN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Some steps in that direction have been taken. time past, I have been inquiring into this matter, and have obtained from the I perial Institute information regarding what result? the quality of the cotton grown in both Papua and the Northern Territory. The reports were favourable regarding the Northern Territory product, and comparisons with some of the American cotton are favourable to the Australian article. The main difficulty is the cost of labour. Certain machinery, about which I obtained information three years ago, has been found not as effective as people expected, and, therefore, "" substituted for manual labour.

76,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"the Assistant Minister for Defence, upon notice I. Is it a fact that applications for discharge made by members of the Australian Imperial Force who enlisted in 1914, and have been continuously at the Front, have been refused? 2. If so, does the Minister consider"" that it is just to these men to refuse their applications Acting while, it is alleged, there are many persons employed in the Defence Department eligible for service who have not seen active service? 3. How many eligible are now employed by the Department in Australia(a) officers; (6) others? Mr ""WISE - The answers to_.the orable member's questions are as follow :1. Yes; unless the circumstances very distressful, financial, or domestic nature. The reasons, - briefly, why these applications eould not be approved are:(1) The men enlisted for the period of the war. (2) Shortage of . reinforcements. (3) As regards those who were returned on furlough, the military authorities overseas relied on their return to service, otherwise it would not be possible to continue the granting of - furlough to their comrades, who had equal claims. 2. The Minister would have been most happy to have been in a position to grant discharges to all the soldiers who had served continuously since 1914, but, owing to the lack of sufficient reinforcements, and the urgent need for as many men as could be obtained, this has not been possible. There is not a great number of persons employed in the Department eligible for active service, as will be seen from the reply to question No. 3. 3. Figures distinguishing officers from others are not available, but a return recently furnished showing an analysis of persons engaged in the Department on the 1st July last, is as follows:Returned Soldiers . . 4,391 Females .. . . 1,622 IneKgiblesOver or under age . . 2,237 Medically unfit .. 3,683 - EligiblesDebarred by superior authority . . .. 329 Not debarred .. 683 The number of eligibles debarred includes officers, and others with special knowledge required for Defence purposes in Australia. From time to time, permission is given for some of these to enlist where suitable arrangements can be made to replace them, but care has to be taken that the number is not reduced to such an extent as to prejudicially affect the efficiency of the Department. The number of those eligible, but not debarred, has been reduced to a minimum, representing only 5 per cent, of the total employed in the Department. These consist mainly of permanent civilian employees, youths eighteen or nineteen years of noticeage, and persons enlisted for Home Service and retained owing to theirspecial qualifications in accountancy, or other branches of the work of the Department. honARBITRATIO N (PUBLIC SERVICE) AND PUBLIC SERVICE ACTS.",29
77,Mr MAHONY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"the Acting are of a Prinie Minister, upon notice I. Is it a fact that the Government contemplates the repeal of the Arbitration (Public Service) Act and the - Commonwealth Public Service Act? 2. Is it a fact that the Government has appointed, or contemplates the appointment of, a Committee or Board to inquire into and advise the Government relative to the repeal of such Acts? 3. If so, will the Government give the personnel of the Committee? 4. If these Acts are repealed by the Government, what is proposed in lieu thereof, in order to give effective administration to the respective Departments?",30
78,Mr WATT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Many difficulties have arisen in connection with the administration of the Commonwealth Public Service in consequence of the operation of the Commonwealth Public Service Act and the Arbitration (Public Service) Act. The Government, therefore, propose to review the position of the Commonwealth Government Departments in connection No. Percentage. with the various Acts by which they are .. 34 governed, and in their relation to the .. 13 Arbitration Court, with the object of removing and preventing the overlapping conflict of jurisdiction, and ascertaining .. 17 what steps are necessary to satisfactorily .. 28 re-adjust the present system, in the light of the experience which has been gained since the passing of the Acts which bear .. 3 upon the situation. As a - preliminary .. 5 .step, Mr D. C.

In view of the far-reaching financial of-price fixing, and its direct effect on interests and businesses, docs he consider that a practising accountant, whose clientele may be affected by his decision, should have such arbitrary power?",30
80,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Yes. 2. The Government is satisfied Mr King's appointment is a suitable one. . 3. He has no arbitrary power, and can only recommend. M UNITION WORKERS, NAVVIES, AND WAR WORKERS. MAINTENANCE OF DEPENDANTS. - Mr MAHONY asked the Assistant Minister for Defence, upon notice I. What provision, if any, is made by the Government for the maintenance of the dependants of Australian munition workers, navvies, or other war workers who may die or be incapacitated while on duty in Great Britain? 2. If no provision is made, will the Minister favourably consider the placing of the dependants of such workers on the same basis as dependants of members of the Australian Imperial Force?",31
81,Mr WISE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Munition workers and navvies are not under a contract of service with the Commonwealth Government, but are despatched to Great Britain for employment under the Ministry of Munitions in England upon munition nnd war work. The Commonwealth Government accepts responsibility for death or incapacity as the result of an accident during the period of the voyage, the men being dealt with under the provisions of the Seamen's Compensation Act, but no responsibility is accepted by the Commonwealth in respect of the men whilst they are in Great Britain. The men, who are,- in the majority of cases, employed with private firms, are, however, in the event of death or incapacity as the result of accident whilst at work, dealt with under the provisions of local industrial legislation, the firm or Department by which they are employed being responsible, similarly as in the case of all British workmen. 2. This question has already received careful consideration, and the Government do not propose to extend the operation of the War Pensions Act to the dependants of other than enlisted men. MINISTERIAL STATEMENT.",31
82,Mr WATT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Balaclava-Actin g Prime effects. Minister and Treasurer) [3.24] -(B y leave) - I wish to put before the House the following statement:Recent information concerning the progress of the war has been of the most encouraging character. During the past month rapid and important advances have been made by the Forces of Freedom on the Western Front, justifying the expressions of hope and confidence which have been uttered by the civil and military authorities of Britain and the Allied nations. The Government observes with pride the important part played by our Australian soldiers in these historic movements, and it congratulates the nation on the cheering fact that the casualties amongst our troops have been comparatively light. Notwithstanding this grateful change in the military outlook, the Government trusts that there will be no ""slackening of war efforts amongst the people. The prosecution of the war to a victorious end is still the prime duty of Parliament and the nation. During the adjournment the man-power problem has received careful attention. The arrangements for the voluntary recruiting ballot are nearing completion, and the campaign will be launched in a few days. The Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy are still in Britain. Their work at the War Cabinet and the Empire Conference has been of the utmost consequence to the future of the Commonwealth. They are at present endeavouring to remove the great and increasing difficulties surrounding the sale and shipment of our products, upon which so much depends for the preservation of our prosperity. The members of the National French Mission, headed hy General Pau, have arrived in Australia, and are the welcome guests of the Governments of the Commonwealth and the States. ' Everywhere they are received with popular enthusiasm, and the Government trusts that the visit will cement enduring ties between the people of this country and the great Republic of France. It is not proposed at this stage to describe the work of administration since Parliament rose. That will be outlined in the Budget, which will be presented next week. But the Government desires to record its pleasure at the success which has attended its efforts to secure the return on furlough of the veteran Australian troops who embarked for service in 1914. It is the intention of the Government to make the present session essentially a business one. , To that end Amending Standing Orders will be brought down, which, if adopted, will substantially expedite public business. The Government invites the co-operation of honourable members in the consideration and passage of important legislative measures between now and the end of the year. Our growing financial burdens arising out of the war will necessitate additional taxation. Proposals for raising the revenue required will be described and submitted in the 'Financial Statement. In fulfilment of the repatriation policy of the Government, a Bill to provide for the housing of returned soldiers will be introduced. An extensive Electoral Bill will also be brought in, which will co-ordinate the electoral machinery of the Commonwealth and the States, consolidate the many existing Electoral Acts, provide for preferential voting for the election of members to the House of Representatives, restore a modified form of postal voting, and remedy other defects shown by experience to exist in the present electoral machinery. A Bill making provision for the statutory management of the Government line of steamers will be introduced. To secure equitable contributions by the people to the war loans, in accordance with their means, a measure has been framed, and will be presented for consideration. Price fixing has now assumed considerable proportions, and it is felt that the time has arrived to place this upon a more satisfactory basis during the war than that of a War Precautions regulation. Steps having that end in view will accordingly be taken. ' To establish conditions essential to the conduct of continuous and economical operation of shipbuilding, the Government entered into agreements with a number of industrial unions. A Bill will be introduced to give effect to the promise made to the Conference, and to the provisions of the agreements with the unions. Action has.been taken for the creation of an Institute of Science and Industry. A Bill will be submitted to give effect to this scheme. The intention is to secure full co-operation between the Commonwealth and States in this important matter. Legislation will be introduced providing for the adequate control of waters in the vicinity of Naval Establishments, Arsenals, Dockyards, &c. A measure to encourage the manufacture of black steel sheets and galvanized sheets in the Commonwealth has also been framed. Other measures ready ' for your consideration are Bills to amend the Defence Act, the Naval Defence Act, the Maternity Allowance Act, the Service and Execution of Process Act, as well as Bills for the purpose of administrative amendments to the Customs Act, the Distillation Act, the Excise Act, and the Spirits Act. These, with proposals for which leave to introduce has already been given, will be the subjects of deliberation before Parliament again rises. I move- 0 That the paper be printed.",31
83,Mr TUDOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Yarra) [3.31] - In accordance with the custom that has prevailed from the. beginning, when statements like that which we have just heard, setting out the Ministerial programme for what is practically a session, have been made, I move That the debate be now adjourned.",32
84,Mr WATT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Balaclava-Actin g Prime Minister and Treasurer) [3.32] - I desire, for personal reasons, to oblige the honourable gentleman, and I do not wish to impale on the horns of - duty any other .honourable member opposite; but the statement was so simple, non-contentious and non-rhetorical, that I hoped that honourable members might agree to it right away. I trust that if the debate be adjourned, honourable members will see that our business is advanced a stage tomorrow. Motion agreed to; debate adjourned. House adjourned at 3.33 p.m.",32
