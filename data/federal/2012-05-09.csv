3,Mr GARRETT,Unknown,"Kingsford Smith Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (09:02): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. I rise to speak on the Malabar Headland Protection Bill 2012. The bill sets out provisions for the protection of the Malabar Headland in New South Wales, following the progressive transfer of its ownership from the Commonwealth government to the New South Wales government. The bill has been created to prohibit the development of the site and to ensure the protection of the environmental, heritage and cultural features. This will ensure this unique site is conserved in perpetuity for the people of New South Wales. BILLS Malabar Headland is located in the Eastern Suburbs of Sydney between Maroubra Bay and Long Bay. It is an important asset not only to the local Malabar and Maroubra communities but to all people of New South Wales. The 177-hectare site has been used for several purposes since European settlement from farming and recreational shooting to military use as a training facility, and a base and defensive position during World War II. 2012 It was also used for sandmining and then landfill operations. Malabar Headland is a historic site with important natural and heritage values, including World War II structures and endangered ecosystems such as the Eastern Suburbs Banksia Scrub. The site holds several heritage listings for its natural, cultural, historic and landscape values. It is 2012 listed on the Commonwealth Heritage List and the New South Wales State Heritage Register. Its importance is also recognised in the Randwick Local Environmental Plan as it is registered as a Heritage Conservation Area. The Labor government announced its policy in an election commitment in 2010 to transfer approximately 70 hectares of the Malabar Headland site to the state of New South Wales for use as a national park. In 2007, Labor announced that it would transfer the whole site to the New South Wales government and it is still the government's intention to honour that pledge. Before transferring the Malabar property, the Commonwealth government will ensure that any public liability risks are addressed. One such risk with the Malabar Headland site is the unknown quantities and sources of contamination from its previous uses. To ensure this risk is addressed, extensive remediation is required to make the site safe for public use. I want to seek your indulgence, Madam Deputy Speaker, to let you see this photo of what an absolutely beautiful and wonderful site this is but I will now return to my comments. Malabar Headland comprises three distinct areas-the western, central and eastern sections. The western section was the first section to be transferred from the Commonwealth government to the New South Wales government on 2 March this year. This 17.7-hectare area contains remnants of the Eastern Suburbs Banksia Scrub, eucalypt woodlands and coastal heathland. The Eastern Suburbs Banksia Scrub is regarded as of extremely high conservation significance. The community was once common across the Eastern Suburbs of Sydney. Due to its decline, as a result of previous clearing across the Eastern Suburbs of Sydney, less than three per cent of the original community remains. The western section had high levels of asbestos in construction waste. Following clean-up and remediation, ownership of the western section was transferred to the New South Wales government. The transfer of this land is a significant achievement and created 17.7 hectares of national park for community to enjoy. The transfer of the western section is the first step in the delivery of the Labor government's commitment to create around 70 hectares of additional national park and conservation reserve. This new national park will be managed and protected by the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service. The eastern section is the next stage of the progressive transfer of the site to the New South Wales government. Remediation works are well underway to remove the unregulated fly-tipped waste, such as old car bodies and asbestos-containing materials. Once remediated, this transfer will create around 50 hectares of national park. The eastern section is abundant in historical and natural values. It contains the remnants of World War II fortifications constructed in response to the threat of sea-borne attack. One of these structures is known as the Boora Point Battery-an imposing, purposebuilt coastal landmark, which is important for providing tangible evidence of Australia's coastal defence efforts in the Sydney area during the war. The eastern section also contains large areas of coastal heathland, Eastern Suburbs Banksia Scrub and eucalypt woodland. Coastal heathland supports a distinctive fauna, including several species that have become threatened within the Sydney Metropolitan Catchment Management Authority Area. The coastal heathland established on the Headland is a potential habitat for this distinctive fauna. The central section of the Malabar Headland site was not covered by the 2010 election commitment. This area of the site was previously used for landfill operations and, as a result, is heavily contaminated. has Until the Remediation Action Plan has been the developed and approved by an independent accredited site auditor, it is not possible to determine the extent of the remediation required for this section. It is the government's strategic vision to progressively transfer the entire Malabar Headland site to New South Wales for national park and public open space for all of the community. However, significantly more work is needed before consideration can be given to the transfer of the central section to the New South Wales government. The people of New South Wales deserve this unique site to be protected as national park and public open space in perpetuity. For decades the local community has campaigned to protect Malabar Headland. I want to place on record this government's appreciation of their efforts-in particular, the Friends of Malabar Headland, including Peter Ryan, Alan Hall and many others who have worked tirelessly to rehabilitate the bushland. Their vision of a national park on Malabar Headland is now being realised. With this bill, the Labor government has set in place the strongest protection measure that can be established to prevent this land ever being taken away from the people of New South Wales. Protection of the environmental, heritage and cultural features of this important site is a priority for this government. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Health Insurance Amendment (Professional Services Review) Bill First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Plibersek. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",19
4,Ms PLIBERSEK,Unknown," I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Professional Services Review (PSR) Scheme and the Medicare Participation Review Committee process (MPRC) are important parts of the government's efforts to support the provision of high quality, appropriate and safe health services for patients. They protect the integrity of Medicare. The Professional Services Review Scheme is a peer review process for investigating whether a practitioner has engaged in inappropriate practice in the provision of services under the Medicare benefits scheme or Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Medicare Participation Review Committees are independent statutory committees that make determinations on whether a practitioner should maintain the right to participate in Medicare. This bill makes amendments to the provisions for the Professional Services Review and the Medicare Participation Review Committee process in the Health Insurance Act 1973 (the act). The proposed amendments do not alter the purpose of the Professional Services Review or the Medicare Participation Review Committee process. These amendments strengthen the ability of the Professional Services Review to protect the integrity of Medicare, improve administration and clarify issues raised in recent court decisions. 2012 The bill addresses issues raised in a recent Federal Court decision, Kutlu v Director of Professional Services Review [2011] FCAFC 94. The Federal Court's decision in this case brought into question the validity of findings of the Professional Services Review if the consultation process for appointing a person as a Professional Services Review panel member or deputy director had not been followed. In cases where practitioners have been found by a Professional Services Review Committee to have practised inappropriately and are serving periods of disqualification, the Federal Court's decision could result in these practitioners being able to provide services under Medicare. This could compromise public health and safety. The bill will address this issue by retrospectively validating past Professional Services Review findings that have been brought into question because a panel member or deputy director was not validly appointed. These Professional Services Review processes will be held to be valid and effective. The government considers retrospective legislation is necessary and justified in this case to remove uncertainty about a number of Professional Services Review findings, where practitioners have been found by a committee of their peers to have practised inappropriately. The bill has a legitimate objective in rectifying the effect of technical errors in appointment process. The retrospective provisions aim to ensure that action taken to protect the integrity of services provided under Medicare may be relied on. These validating provisions are not intended to apply to parties to proceedings for which leave to appeal to the High Court of Australia has been given before the bill is assented to, if the validity of a Professional Services Review appointment is in issue in those proceedings. However, the bill will allow the Director of the Professional Services Review to establish and re-refer matters to a new PSR Committee in such cases. This will mean that practitioners who have been found to have engaged in inappropriate practice by their peers, and have successfully challenged a Professional Services Review process on the grounds of irregularity in the appointment process, may be re-referred to a new PSR Committee for investigation if the director decides to do so. Other provisions The bill also includes a number of provisions that strengthen the Professional Services Review's capacity to protect the integrity of Medicare, improve the operations of the scheme, and respond to the recommendations of a review of the scheme in 2007. The Professional Services Review currently applies to only some, not all, of the types of health professionals who can provide services under Medicare. The bill that will enable the PSR Scheme to be applied to all health professionals who provide Medicare services. The bill includes amendments to improve the protection of the public under the Professional Services Review. If the conduct of a person under review poses a threat to patient life or health, the the Director of the Professional Services Review will be required to contact the relevant body that is authorised to recall patients for independent medical review. The bill also requires the director to notify the relevant registration body. The quality of patient care can be placed at risk if practitioners undertake unreasonably high numbers of services. In 1999, medical professional groups agreed that 80 or more unreferred attendances on 20 or more days in a 12-month period constituted inappropriate practice. This bill clarifies in legislation that a practitioner who performs this number of services is automatically deemed by the legislation to have practised inappropriately, unless they can provide evidence that exceptional circumstances existed. Patients will also be protected by amendments that will require all persons who are disqualified from Medicare due to a Professional Services Review or Medicare Participation Review Committee process to display a notice to inform patients that services will not attract Medicare benefits. The bill clarifies the respective role Professional Services Review and Medicare Participation Review Committees, so that the PSR investigates inappropriate practice and the MPRC reviews practitioners where they have contravened a relevant civil penalty provision or committed a relevant criminal offence. Other amendments improve administration of the Professional Services Review following its review in 2007. These amendments include clarifying processes where a person is unable to participate due to illness, or where the person under review dies, and making minor administrative changes. Medicare and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme are two of the key pillars of Australia's health system. Robust structures to prevent inappropriate practice are essential if they are to benefit all Australians for years to come. This bill will ensure that the Professional Services Review continues to protect the integrity of Medicare and to support high quality, appropriate and safe health services for all Australians. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Leave granted for second reading debate to resume at a later hour this day. Health Insurance Amendment (Professional Services Review) Bill Reference to Federation Chamber",21
5,Ms PLIBERSEK,Unknown," by leave-I move: That the Health Insurance Amendment (Professional Services Review) Bill 2012 be referred to the Federation Chamber for further consideration. Question agreed to. of the Migration (Visa Evidence) Charge Bill 2012 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Bowen. Bill read a first time. Second Reading the Mr BOWEN (MCMahon-Minister for Immigration and Citizenship) (09:18): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Migration (Visa Evidence) Charge Bill 2012 is the principal bill in a package of two bills which will enable the government to impose a charge for the production of visa evidence. The Visa Pricing Transformation program restructures the way in which visas are priced and this is part of that program. The visa evidence charge will reduce the administrative burden on the Department of Immigration and Citizenship associated with processing hard copy visa evidence. The visa evidence charge will also allow for greater cost recovery for these services and will generate additional revenue. The Migration (Visa Evidence) Charge Bill 2012 imposes a charge in relation to requests for visa evidence and establishes a charge limit of $250 for a request made in the financial year ending on 30 June 2013. The bill also provides a mechanism for this amount to be indexed in later financial years. 2012 The Migration (Visa Evidence) Charge (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2012 is the second bill in this package and will make amendments to the Migration Act 1958 to implement the visa evidence charge. Currently, Australia does not require visa holders to have hard copy evidence of their visa; however, clients are still provided with the option of being given evidence if it is necessary for them to have the evidence to transit or exit another country, or if they make a personal decision to obtain such evidence. Visa holders will continue to have the option to request evidence of their visa; however, once the amendments in this package of bills commence, visa holders will be charged for this visa evidence, unless an exemption or waiver applies, or there are circumstances where the visa evidence charge is nil. The key elements of the Visa Pricing Transformation include a move to a userpays model. The visa evidence charge component of the Visa Transformation program will discourage reliance on visa labels by immigration clients and foreign officials and encourage the use of electronic systems for validating a noncitizen's right to enter Australia. Although most non-citizens are not required under Australian law to have a visa label as evidence of their visa status, many visa applicants apply to have a visa label issued at the time of grant or post-grant. Eliminating the perceived need for visa labels is a priority for the government as currently one-third of visas granted each year are evidenced. In 2011, 455,000 visa labels were issued onshore and 910,000 offshore, totalling 1.365 million visa labels issued over calendar year 2011. Issuing visa labels is the highest volume service undertaken at immigration client service counters both in Australia and overseas. Imposing a service delivery charge as a prerequisite to having a visa label, or other non-electronic evidence issued, is intended to compensate for the costs associated with delivering that service and encourage Immigration clients to travel without a visa label. Changing client and stakeholder behaviour to recognise the validity of electronic confirmation of a person's visa is the primary driving force behind the introduction of the visa evidence charge. Visa Entitlement Verification Online (VEVO) or advance passenger processing systems in the case of airlines and border agencies will reduce overheads for the department and reduce the risk of fraud. A number of business process based initiatives have been tried to reduce the use of hard copy visa labels in recent years, but in the absence of a price disincentive these have had only limited success. As part of the visa transformation program, work will be undertaken to improve the online entitlement Pricing verification service and educate clients about the ease of travelling without a visa label. The Department of Immigration and Citizenship conducted modelling which has confirmed that the new visa charges including a charge for visa evidence will have only a minimal impact on education and tourism. To complement the modelling conducted by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade sought views from Australia's overseas missions, as well as conducting assessments of how the proposed changes would be received by host governments. In summary, this package of bills will enable the government to impose a charge for the production of visa evidence. The visa evidence charge will encourage clients to reconsider their need to have a visa label. The department's modelling has confirmed that the visa evidence charge will have a minimal impact on the education, tourism and employment sectors and immigration clients as visa demand has been shown to not be affected by these changes. These changes are a component of a larger strategy that will ultimately reduce the administrative burden non-electronic visa evidencing imposes on the Department of Immigration and Citizenship and will eliminate the current financial burden visa labels impose on the Australian taxpayer. Debate adjourned. Migration (Visa Evidence) Charge (Consequential Amendments) Bill First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Bowen. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",23
6,Mr BOWEN,Unknown," I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Migration (Visa Evidence) Charge (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2012 is the second bill in a package of two bills which will enable the government to impose a charge for the production of visa evidence. The Visa Pricing Transformation program restructures the way in which visas are priced. The visa evidence charge will be imposed by the principal bill, the Migration (Visa Evidence) Charge Bill 2012, which enables a charge to be payable for the production of prescribed evidence of a visa. The Migration (Visa Evidence) Charge (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2012 completes the package of amendments needed to implement the visa evidence charge. This bill amends the Migration Act to enable a visa holder to request to be given a prescribed form of evidence, and requires a person who makes a request for visa evidence to pay the visa evidence charge. If a visa holder makes a request to be given visa evidence and pays the visa evidence charge, the officer must give the visa holder this evidence. The amount of the visa evidence charge will be prescribed in the migration regulations and will be subject to the maximum charge limit set out in the Migration (Visa Evidence) Charge Bill 2012. In appropriate circumstances, the visa evidence charge may well be nil. 2012 The bill will also insert regulation-making powers to allow regulations to be made to specify different amounts of visa evidence charged for different forms of visa evidence, different classes of visas, different methods of payments, where the person elects to have the request dealt with expeditiously or for requests made in different circumstances. The regulations will also prescribe the circumstances in which the visa evidence charge may be waived, refunded or remitted, as well as specifying those persons who will be exempt from the charge. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (Schoolkids Bonus Budget Measures) Bill 2012 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by the Ms Macklin. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",25
7,Ms MACKLIN,Unknown,"Jagajaga-Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Minister for Disability Reform) (09:26): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill delivers on the government's announcement of a new payment for families to help with the costs for children in school. It is part of this Labor government's commitment to helping Australian families make ends meet. And it shows our determination to continue supporting lowand middle-income families as we return the budget to surplus. Our economic fundamentals are strong, unemployment is low and we are in the middle of a mining boom but we do recognise that it is not everybody's boom. We understand that many working Australians are struggling to balance the family budget. For many families, the extra costs of sending children to school and giving them a great education can add to this pressure. So that is why, from 1 January next year, the government will deliver a new payment to around 1.3 million Australian families with kids in school. This payment, the schoolkids bonus, will be paid to the families of around 2.2 million children in primary and secondary schools across the country. The schoolkids bonus will be delivered as an up-front payment to families in two instalments each year, before term 1 and term 3, to help them cover the costs of their child's education. Expenses like school uniforms and school shoes, textbooks, camps, excursions as well as extracurricular activities, such as music lessons. Eligible families will receive a total of $410 a year for each child in primary school, and $820 a year for each child in secondary school. The schoolkids bonus will replace the education tax refund in 2013, and this bill also removes the education tax refund for 2011-12 from taxation legislation. For many families with children in school, the education tax refund has made a big difference. However, we know that many families are not experiencing its full benefits. This is especially the case for working families on low incomes-it is simply too tough to pay the school expenses first and then wait months, or even a year, to get 50 per cent back. For busy families it can also be hard keeping track of receipts and then filling out all the paperwork at tax time. Last year more than 80 per cent of families did not claim the full amount they were entitled to. About 20 per cent did not claim a refund at all. In total around one million Australian families are missing out on the full benefit of the education tax refund. This Labor government wants to change that. This is the right time to turn this assistance into an upfront payment, with the 1 July 2012 increase to the tax-free threshold meaning that more than one million people will no longer needed to do a tax return. The new schoolkids bonus will make sure that all eligible families get their full entitlement, not just those who can afford to spend the money upfront and claim later. The schoolkids bonus means more support for families with kids in school. It means not having to wait months to get something back. It means not having to collect a pile of receipts or fill out that extra paperwork at tax time. Paid in full and upfront, the schoolkids bonus means working families get the support that they need, when they need it. It is money in your pocket-and new support from the Gillard government. It is support that is there before the costs start rolling in. It is extra support for more than one million Australian families who have missed out in the past and can now get every cent they deserve. The schoolkids bonus will be available from 2013 to families receiving family tax benefit part A plus young people in school receiving income support payments such as youth allowance, ABSTUDY, disability support pension and veterans' educational allowances, on the eligibility test date. Families will only need to notify Centrelink when their child first starts school so that the payments can begin. After that the bonus is automatically paid in January and July every year if they remain on the relevant linked payment such as family tax benefit part A. Parents will also need to let Centrelink know when their kids go to high school so that they can move on to the higher payment. The government is delivering this new support because we know it can be tough to make ends meet, particularly when you are trying to get your kids through school. Uniforms, school shoes, textbooks, excursions are not cheap. I think all of us know that the cost can quickly add up. When the schoolkids bonus begins in January next year it will help families relieve some of the pressure on the household budget. We do also know that many families are feeling the pinch right now-and need a bit of extra support right now. So as we transition to the schoolkids bonus we want to do what we can in the next few weeks to make sure that we are looking out for lowand middle-income families who are finding it tough to keep up. This bill creates a one-off transitional payment called the ETR payment which will pay out in full the education tax refund to all eligible families for 2011-12. This means families will receive their full education tax refund entitlement for the 2011-12 tax year ahead of tax time. So parents will not have to worry about keeping receipts or making claims when they do their tax this year. The one-off ETR payment will be $409 for a child in primary school and $818 for a secondary school child, the same maximum amounts that would have been available in the 2011-12 tax year. A family with one primary student and one secondary student will get more than $700 extra on average this year. All 1.3 million families will get the maximum amount they are entitled to for the first time and all will get their payments earlier. They will not have to collect their receipts and they will not have to fill out that extra paperwork at tax time. This lump sum payment will be paid to all families entitled to family tax benefit part A on 8 May this year for a school-aged child as well as to young people in secondary education who are receiving certain student income support payments on 8 May. A similar ETR payment will be provided through amendments to Veterans' Affairs legislation for recipients on 8 May of payments under the Veterans' Children Education Scheme or the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act Education and Training Scheme. The bill will also create an administrative scheme for the ETR payment which will assist people who may not be able to access an appropriate ETR payment under the family assistance law or veterans legislation; for example, a parent who was automatically paid the primary school rate for a child who is actually in secondary school. In a tough environment this government is making the hard decisions as we return to surplus. But we are a Labor government, driven by Labor values. Labor will always stand up for Australia's lowand middle-income families. Families who do their very best with what they have got. Who do not ask for much and who deserve a bit of extra support. It is our job to make sure that those families who need that extra help are getting it, and that is what this government's schoolkids bonus will do. Labor will always work to ensure that Australian families, particular those putting their kids through school, have a support that they need to make ends meet. I commend the bill to the House.",25
8,Mr ANDREWS,Unknown, Can I indicate at the outset that the coalition will oppose this legislation. We will oppose it because it is bad policy. It is bad policy for number of reasonsMs Macklin interjecting,28
9,Mr ANDREWS,Unknown,"If the minister at the table would be quiet for a moment I will explain to her and to anybody else who happens to be listening to this broadcast why this is bad policy. It is bad policy because when you look behind the spin of a Treasurer last night in his budget speech, and you look behind the spin of the minister in her second reading speech of this bill today, then you can see what is actually going on here. The first reason this is bad policy is because this is essentially a sleight of hand by the Labor government. Look at the current situation in relation to this education payment. If a family who is eligible has a child at primary school and they have receipts for educational expenses as set out in the legislation, for child at primary school they can currently claim $410. And if they have a child at secondary school, in the same circumstances they can claim $820. So the current situation-what operates right now; what would operate for this financial year without this legislation being passed-is that parents around Australia with primary school children can claim $410 and with secondary school children can claim up to $820. That is the situation that exists right now. Without this legislation, parents in that circumstance would be eligible to claim that amount and they would have it repaid at the end of the tax year. That is the situation that applies for parents right now. After the passage of this legislation are those eligible parents who make a claim going to get a cent more? No. They are still going to get $410 if they have a primary school student and they are still going to get $820 if they have a secondary school student. That is why I say this is a sleight of hand. This is taking one payment, abolishing a it and replacing it with the same payment in terms of what parents actually receive, so there is a sleight of hand here. A targeted program that exists at the present time is therefore being replaced by one which is untargeted-and any pretence, as we have heard in the speech this morning by the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, that this is about offsetting education costs is simply denied by the facts that there are no changes in the amounts of payments that go to the eligible parents. So the first reason that this is bad policy is that this is simply spin. It is taking a payment that already exists-which this coalition supports and will continue to support into the future; in other words, we support parents of primary school children getting up to $410 and we support parents of secondary school students getting up to that $820-and that is made through the tax system and saying, 'We're now going to make this a welfare payment.' What this shows is that the Labor Party have learnt nothing from the incompetence of administration in the past. Remember the expenditures that they have paid over the past few years: the cash handouts, the pink batts, the cash for clunkers, the set-top boxes-and one could go on and on and on about poor and incompetent administration by the Labor Party over the last few years. So what are they doing with this payment? Instead of having a targeted payment, where all that is required is for parents to keep the incompetent receipts of their expenditure on the list of allowable expenditures, they are saying, 'We'll just give you the money.' What is the consequence of that? There is no connection between the money that is being handed out and educational expenditure. Parents can go and spend the money on what they like. If they want to go down to the local club and put it through the poker machines they can do that. If they want to go and buy some new electrical gear from the electrical retailer they can go and do that. course, we know from the past when payments were made by the Labor Party that payments were made to dead people, that payments were made to people living overseas and that a lot of the money was simply wasted. If this was genuinely an educational expenditure, if this was genuinely about saying that we should provide for children and some of the expenses that their parents have for their education and schooling, then we have a targeted program that does thatand all that requires of responsible parents that they keep the receipts and make a claim on their tax. But that is no longer the case far as the Labor Party is concerned. It is not about a targeted educational expenditure. This, in reality, is a handout in order to cook the books, which this budget is all about; a handout in relation to offsetting what they know is coming by way of the cost increases under the carbon tax from 1 July. So the first reason that this is a bad policy is that it takes a properly targeted educational expenditure, a properly targeted program which is working quite well at the present time, and then changes that into something that is simply a handout, where there is no connection between the educational expenditure and the handout itself. And we know from past experience of the poor and administration of these programs by this Gillard-Swan government that some of this money is going to be wasted. I ask the ordinary, hard working taxpayers of Australia, the men and women who are working hard and putting their children through school in this country and who are able to list their educational expenses and make a proper and genuine claim, do they think it is reasonable if somebody cannot be bothered to do that or somebody just wants to take the money and Of spend it however they like? Do they think that that is actually connected to enhancing education and schooling and training in this country? Go down to the front pub and apply the pub test to this by asking people. I will have a bet with anybody on the other side what the answer will be. The answer will be that they think it is quite reasonable the way the system works at the present time. If this is genuinely about educational expenditure then there ought to be a connection between that expenditure and the payment being is made, but that is being ripped up so far as this piece of legislation is concerned. So the so first reason why the coalition will oppose this measure because we believe it is bad policy is that it disconnects the existing help nexus between the educational expenditure and the payment itself. For that reason it is bad policy. It is bad policy for the additional reason that this government has shown itself totally incompetent in administering these sorts of programs in the past, and there are numerous examples which I will not continue to rehearse in this debate today. The second reason this is bad policy goes to the heart of the accounting tricks in this budget. This budget accounting trick is one which will unravel in the coming days. Why was there an indecent haste, and there still to introduce this bill? Yesterday afternoon the minister came in here before the budget was delivered to seek leave to introduce this bill. The budget had not even been delivered: this is a bill of which the Treasurer made an announcement in the budget last night. But hours before the Treasurer even stood on his feet at the dispatch box here at 7.30 last to announce this measure, amongst other things, the minister was in here seeking leave to introduce this bill. Why was that? Why the indecent haste to introduce a measure that is in the budget but has not yet even been announced in the budget? The reason is this: it goes to the accounting tricks at the heart this budget. Currently, this payment would be in next year's financial accounts. I will go back to explain how the system works at the present time. At the end of this financial year a parent, if they have a primary school student and if they have the requisite receipts for educational expenses, could put in a claim on their tax for $410, or $820 for a secondary student. They would put their tax in after the end of this financial year, as we all do, and that claim would be accounted in their tax for this year, which of course means that any refund or any allowance would be actually paid by Treasury next year. Currently this means that the amount which the government expends on this measure would be accounted for in the 2012-13 financial accounts of the Commonwealth. But what is this measure doing? Why this indecent haste? The minister has just said he wants to pay this money out before the end of this financial year. What is the consequence of that? It is that that expenditure by the government will be in this year's financial accounts. That expenditure will be part of the $44 billion deficit that this is, government predicts it will have by the end of this financial year-it will probably be more given the way it has blown out, but based on the words of the Treasurer last night, the projection was of a $44 billion deficit this financial year. It will be part of this year's financial accounts because of the passage of this legislation; whereas, if people night were still to receive the money which they would otherwise have received, it would be in next year's financial accounts. Why is this an accounting trick? Because it is moving what normally would have been an expenditure by the government in the next financial year into this financial year. And of what are the consequences of that? It helps the Treasurer to achieve his paper thin, and probably paper only, $1.5 billion surplus next year. If this amount of money was in next year's financial accounts then that would probably reduce by about half the $1.5 billion surplus that the Treasurer is claiming he will achieve next year. This is financial accounting trickery. This is why, as someone said, this is a 'fudge it not a budget'-because it is moving expenditure that would have normally occurred next year, and would have been accounted for next year, into this year. He is not worried if there is an extra half-billion or so on what is already a $44 billion deficit this year. He is worried, politically, that he will be able to say, 'I'm going to get a surplus next year.' Of course, nobody believes that. But if he did not have this measure being paid out in this financial year, then it would be paid next year and so the pretend surplus that he announced last night would be halved overnight. This is not the only example of this sort of accounting trickery that we have in this budget. We see that flood payments to local government, which would normally have been made next year, are being made this year. That is $1.1 billion that would have been in next year's expenditure now being brought forward into this year's expenditure. The Treasurer says, 'I'm going to have a $1.5 billion surplus.' However, if you take the 1.1 billion away from that, it reduces his surplus to $400 million just like that. Just one simple accounting trick. That is what we have throughout this budget. Let me take another example: the clean energy advance of $1.5 billion. That is exactly the same amount that the budget is projecting will be a surplus. The clean energy advance, which would have been paid next year and therefore would have been a cost to the finances of the Commonwealth government next year of $1.5 billion, is being brought forward and paid before the end of June so that it is in this year's budget government. rather than next year's budget. So there are just three examples of the financial and accounting trickery that is at the heart of this budget. That is why this surplus being projected by the Treasurer is simply unbelievable. If you took that payment of the clean energy advance of $1.5 billion alone, and it was made next year, was meant to be made, then the surplus disappears-with just one payment! But add to that the payments to local government of $1.1 billion and the payment under this bill that we are debating now-probably in the order of half a billion dollars-and there is no surplus; there is a deficit. The reality when next year's financial accounts come in, there will not be a surplus, there will be a deficit, no matter what trickery is engaged in cooking the books by the Treasurer. This bill is not the only example of accounting trickery. There is other expenditure which normally-as would have been forecast in the forward estimates before last night-would have been made next year but has now been pushed out beyond next year. In other words, expenditure for next year is either being brought forward, so it does not show up on the books next year and so this paper surplus can be claimed, or pushed out to years beyond that, so again it does not show up on the books next year and so again the Treasurer is able to claim that he is getting a surplus. That is not to mention the NBN, which is not even in the financial accounts. It is not even part of the bottom line. If you add the NBN in, there is another $8 billion or so that would have to be taken into account and would add immediately to the deficit of this government. So the surplus is an illusion. It does not exist, except on the paper of the Treasurer's statement and in the mind of the If you look at the borrowing from the future, this year the government spending is increased by $25 billion. It falls by $7 billion next year-the year he wants to achieve a surplus-and yet on his own figures and data it then goes up by $23 billion the following year. These bottom line figures just show as it what is happening: expenditure is being brought forward into this year so that it can fall next year and then the year after that it goes up to about what it is this year. So this is trickery-trickery at the heart of the Treasurer's budget and at the heart of the financial accounts-and this bill is an is, example of that trickery simply by bringing this forward to this year. So the surplus is illusionary-and it would not be believable anyway, because this time last year the Treasurer was telling all and sundry who would listen that we would have a deficit of $22 billion. I remind the House that his first estimate was $12 billion and that he later revised it upward to $22 billion. Fast forward 12 months to last night, and he says, 'No, the deficit is not going to be $22 billion; the deficit is now going to be $44 billion.' So you cannot believe what this government says about the deficit. It may be more than $44 billion. We still have almost two months to go before the end of this financial year, and we will not know until September whether it is a $44 billion deficit or even higher. The point is: how can you believe now what the Treasurer says about the deficit when last year he was telling us it would be $22 billion and it has blown out by 100 per cent to $44 billion? Put this in the context of what has happened under this government. Last year the deficit was $47 billion; the year before was $54 billion; and in the first year of this government it was $27 billion. The cumulative total of these deficits, even if $44 billion is correct, is about $174 billion over four years. Yet we are told, assured and led to believe that we are simply to say, Treasurer, you are going to produce a $1½ billion surplus next year.' The cumulative total of the deficits is $174 billion over four control. years, and we are going to turn it around and produce a $1.5 billion surplus next year? As I have already explained, part of that apparent surplus will be achieved through financial trickery. If anybody believes on the basis of the evidence of what has been done over the last four years that this $44 billion deficit is going to lead to a surplus then can find fairies around Lake Burley Griffin. If they have been unable to control the budget for four years, how is this government going to control the budget in the fifth year? It is simply not going to happen. If you want further evidence of this, there is the fact that we found out last night that elsewhere in the budget papers the government has increased its debt ceiling. The government currently has the legislative authority of this parliament to borrow up to $250 billion. The government says, 'We're getting things under control. We're not going to have any more deficits; we're going to have a surplus. We're all back on track. Forget the last four years. Forget all of that; this is a new start.' That is effectively what Mr Swan was saying last night. It was: 'Forget that; we're all under control. We've got the spending under control. We've got tax under control. We've got our programs under control.' But, if that is the case, why does the Commonwealth need to increase its debt ceiling for borrowings from $250 billion to $300 billion? If somebody says, 'I've got the household expenditure under control-I'm not expending any more than it I'm bringing in by way of income,' would you believe that person when they then said, 'But I'd better go out and increase the bank the card limit from $250 to $300'? That is what the government is doing. In this budget they are seeking the legislative authority of this 'Yes, parliament to increase their borrowing ceiling to $300 billion, yet they are trying to tell us that somehow everything is under This government is borrowing $100 million a day and projecting an interest bill next year of $8 billion. What could you spend $8 billion on, when in the last years of the Howard government we had surpluses? Last night the Treasurer was trumpeting that he is putting $1 billion over four years into they the National Disability Insurance Scheme. The scheme is going to cost $4 billion, according to the Productivity Commission, so we are yet to find out where the other $3 billion is going to come from. The Treasurer is trumpeting that he will put $1 billion into the scheme over four years, but in reality it is probably going to cost closer to $8 billion put the National Disability Insurance Scheme in place. If you did not pay $8 billion worth of interest each year, you would be able to do something socially useful that this country needs, such as have a proper national disability insurance scheme rather than have it on the never-never, which is what you are proposing. The government says to us that there are 400,000 profoundly disabled people to whom the scheme should apply in the first year. Do you know how many of these people are going to be covered by what the government announced last night? In the first year there will be just 10,000 packages, and in the second year there will be 20,000 packages.",28
10,Mr Champion,Unknown,What did you do?,33
11,Mr ANDREWS,Unknown,I will tell you what we did. We left the budget in surplus so you could pay for things like this; we did not run up $174 billion in cumulative deficit. Mr Champion interjecting,33
12,Mr ANDREWS,Unknown,"Keep the interjections coming. We did not have to raise the debt ceiling of the Commonwealth from $250 billion to $300 billion. We did the budget, as your Treasurer did last night, that the unemployment rate is going to go up in the next year. Mr Champion interjecting",33
13,Mr ANDREWS,Unknown,"Keep the interjections coming if you want to know what we did. I do not think the record stands any comparison with the incompetent Labor government that we have at the present time. In programs such as the National Disability Insurance Scheme, just onetwentieth of the need is going to be met. There will be just 20,000 out of the 400,000 packages projected to be needed, because the money is not there. Another example from to the budget is its approach to aged-care reform. There was a bit of money for agedcare reform in the budget last night, but is that going to meet the ageing of the population and the huge increase in demand that is coming in future years as more people get older and need dementia services and other services? No. Why can't these services be provided? They cannot be provided because we have a government that is chronically unable to control the budget of this country, and this budget is just another example of its inability to do so. Another reason that this budget represents bad policy is that it is basically compensation for the carbon tax. I heard the minister saying in her second reading speech that families were facing pressures-and they are. But this is what the Treasurer said last night: The price on carbon pollution that begins this year will only be paid by Australia's biggest emitters. It will not be levied on families. As if big emitters will not pass costs on to families! But to help with any price increases, we are cutting income tax and increasing payments to pensioners, families and recipients of allowances not project in beginning this month. In other words, despite telling us that families in Australia are not going to have any impost because of the carbon tax, the Treasurer let the cat out of the bag last night when he said, 'Yes, there are cost increases coming and this is part of the reason we are having to give these handouts.' That is what this is about as well. It is not just about moving payments that would normally occur in next year's financial accounts into this year's; it is also about providing compensation with a bit of pretext that it is about an education allowance. As I explained before, you can make educational payments for genuine education needs under the present system without making this change. The Treasurer let the cat out of the bag last night. The reality is that this is about compensation for the carbon tax. Labor know that the carbon tax is toxic in the community. They know that people have made up their minds about it. People do not believe the spin that only big emitters will pay and that, having done that, they will absorb all the costs. In reality, two things will happen as a consequence of the carbon tax. Emitters will, where they can, pass on the costs. Any business does that. If a business has an increase in the cost of production of its goods or services, it passes on the costs. It would have been better if the government had come clean and said this, but they are trying to walk both sides of the street. That will be one consequence. The other consequence will be that many small businesses in particular, where they are not able to pass on the costs, will reduce the number of their employees. This is happening already. If you go for a walk around the northern suburbs of Melbourne, where there are a lot of small manufacturing businesses-or the eastern suburbs of Melbourne or elsewhere around Australiaand if you talk to the people who are out there running businesses, you will find that the reality is that jobs are being lost already, and that is because of the impact of these changes under the Labor government. What the government is seeking to do is to give a bit of a sugar hit now, because they know that the big hit to the budget of ordinary Australians is coming with a huge whack in July. The pretence in this budget is that we are taking money from the rich, the miners, to pay for the poor, but we are also taking a lot of money from low-income earners. There are changes to the FTB in relation to older teenagers-which is something that the government promised back in 2010 they would look after. That is suddenly gone in this budget. So one group of low-income earners are paying for another group of lowincome earners. Then there are single parents. The government are taking a saving of about $700 million from that group of low-income earners to pay for other lowincome earners and, at the same time, slashing the funds in the budget for the job service providers who might have been there to provide for these people whom the government are moving off parenting payments onto Newstart. While the government are moving them off parenting payments onto Newstart, they are actually slashing the funds that are available to the job service providers in Australia to provide the services that might help those single parents to get into a job. This pretence that this is just taking from one group who can pay it to another group who need it is just that: spin and pretence. There are lowincome earners who are losing money under this budget and the reality is that the cost of the toxic carbon tax will be passed on when it is passed. That is what we are facing. In terms of the carbon tax, the budget has $36 million to advertise and promote the carbon tax. I calculated that the government are going to have to spend almost $2 million a week on promotion and advertising for the carbon tax. Why have they got to do that? They know that it is so toxic that they have to try to convince people otherwise. At the same time, we know that electricity prices have gone up, gas prices have gone up, prices are going up and they will continue to go up. Unemployment is forecast to go up under this budget, and that means job losses for ordinary Australians. There is every reason for this budget to be feared by the Australian people. When they look beyond the spin to what is actually in this budget, it will start to unravel, because they will see that one-off handouts-handouts that can be misused in some instances-are not going to fix the structural problems of the Australian economy. They are not going to make Australia a more economically secure place than it is at the present time. Worse than that: at the end of this budget process, nothing much has changed. We still have Julia Gillard as Prime Minister and Wayne Swan as Treasurer. It is still a government hanging onto the vote of the member for Dobell in order to maintain its majority in this place. We still have a tricky PM who did a deal with the Speaker in order to try to shore up her votes in this place. Nothing has changed-nothing at all. These issues are not going to simply go away because of whatever spin the Treasurer wants to put on these matters. As I said at the outset, the coalition will oppose this measure. We will oppose it because it is bad policy. It is bad policy because it is taking a targeted payment and making it a general payment that can be used in any way unrelated to education expenses. It is bad policy because it is bringing forward expenditure from next year's financial accounts into this year's financial accounts in order to give the Treasurer his surplus. For those reasons, this measure should be opposed.",33
14,Mr HAYES,Unknown," I listened to the contribution from the member for Menzies on the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (Schoolkids Bonus Budget Measures) Bill 2012. I will not denigrate the debate by resorting to political spin, as he chose to do, particularly in his concluding remarks, but I would say that what the contribution the member for Menzies actually does bring to this debate is the difference in the approach of a government that is committed to looking after lowand middle-income families and the approach of those who simply think that those families may not be the people who are the primary concern in their electorates. My electorate is probably vastly different to the electorate represented by the honourable member for Menzies. My electorate is the most multicultural electorate in the whole of Australia, according to the ABS. My electorate also is somewhat distinguished from other electorates-and particularly that represented by the member for Menzies-in that it is the second lowest when it comes to socio-economic standing in this country. In other words, the electorate I have the honour to represent is an electorate of great need. It has significant disadvantage, and as a consequence we are obliged to look at people who are falling through the cracks, who are missing out. This measure that is being introduced goes right to the heart of that. Those opposite have indicated that they are going to oppose this bill. I do not mind that; I am actually proud. This is a genuine Labor initiative-looking after lowto middle-income people. The argument of those opposite-if you cut through what the argument was-was that if you give people money upfront they are going to go to the pub and literally pass it over the wall. That really shows a great difference in approach. The government will provide $2.1 billion over the next five years for this new schoolkids bonus to provide guaranteed support to families to help with the cost of their children's education. This will replace the education tax refund, which is currently available as a tax refund offset. The schoolkids bonus will be made in two equal instalments-in January and July of each year-commencing from 1 January 2013. As a transitional arrangement, the educational tax refund in 2011-12 will be replaced by a one-off payment to eligible families in June this year. Making these payments automatic will increase the assistance to many eligible families currently missing out on the education tax refund. This bill that the minister has just bought before the House introduces the new payment for family assistance which will commence on 1 January 2013. The payment will provide direct assistance to eligible families with children in school and will be paid through the family benefits scheme. The payments of $410 per child in primary school and $820 per child in secondary school will be made twice each year. I have spoken a little bit about the electorate that I have the honour to represent. We need to put in context not only what the value of the educational tax refund was but also the fact that it was probably underused. Like every member here, I imagine, I regularly conduct mobile offices. As I indicated, I have a very multicultural electorate. I am very fortunate to have both Vietnamese and Chinese speaking staff and so when we get out there we can engage directly with people. About six weeks ago we were doing a mobile office in Cabramatta park and a Vietnamese gentleman came up and started talking to us and asking what we were doing. We discussed a range of things and we spoke about his kids. He had two children with him and we asked him what he got out of the education tax refund. He said, through the interpreters, 'No, Sir, I am not entitled to that.' He was very, very embarrassed because he could not find a job. This man, whose English was not good and who was certainly struggling to provide for his children, thought that he was not entitled to the education tax refund because he did not have a job and he did not pay tax. He did not understand that you could submit your receipts and claim the money back. That was the experience we heard from one man who fronted me six weeks ago. Since then we did a bit of hunting around some of the local statistics in that regard, and I have actually discovered that, of all the eligible families in my electorate, 10 per cent have not claimed the education tax refund. That is a lot of low-income families that are missing out. They, like that gentleman, did not understand that they were entitled to the education tax refund, that it is a provision designed to assist in the education of their kids. When people stand up and give us a lecture and say that if we give people the money upfront, when they need it, to be spent on their kids' education-whether it be for uniforms, books, computers, tuition, music lessons et cetera-they will go to the pub with it, what does that say to the people I represent? I know that a lot of people I represent work two and three jobs to pay for extra tutoring for their children. The Vietnamese, in particular, understand that the difference between success and otherwise in a modern society is education. I see first hand these families who are struggling but who go out of their way to invest as much as they can in their child's education. If those families are listening to the debate today, I wonder how they would take the fact that those opposite think that whatever we pay them will simply be expended at the local hotel or club? I wonder what they would think that says about the level of trust placed on how they raise their families? They are very good parents. They love their kids dearly and, above all, they know the benefit of education. As a matter of fact, of all the schools I visit, the schools attended by Asian children-whether Vietnamese, Cambodians, Chinese or from Laos-the teachers tell me that they feel that they work in partnership with parents because, as I said, these parents understand the value of education. This money is going to go to them twice a year, not after they have expended it but when they need it the most. They will have this money when they need to commit to send their kids to an excursion or when they need to purchase school uniforms, textbooks or computers. It will help to ensure that their kids are able to be totally included in the education system, in the same way as every other kid out there. That is all kids, including those represented by the member for Menzies and those opposite. I see the need of people in my electorate. The other side do not represent those people, and maybe they are not high on their agenda, but these are real people making a real contribution. What is more important than the next generationwhat these kids are going to do for our country, our economy and our productivity? This schoolkids bonus will not change the method of calculating the education tax refund but it will ensure that people get will put it into their accounts as opposed to people going out of their way to maintain receipts, hoping they have got them and using them every tax year. People I have personally spoken to believe that because they do not pay tax they are not entitled; that is why 10 per cent of my electorate has not claimed the educational tax refund. My electorate is probably the second-most disadvantaged in the whole of Australia and yet 10 per cent have not done that. Above anything, I would ask members to think about that-about the people that I represent in an electorate which is significantly disadvantaged. This is directly doing something for them and their children. Much has been made of bringing the budget back into surplus. Clearly the Treasurer's speech did not impress those opposite last night because he actually did it: he has brought down a budget that is going into surplus. I recall the comments of the shadow Treasurer not all that long ago. His rhetoric has changed considerably over the last six months. It went from, 'We'll get back into surplus before Labor will get back into surplus,' to the last position he had-that is, that getting back to surplus was an aspiration: 'No great plan for it.' There has been a litany of things that those opposite have failed to have any regard for in their contributions about budgetary matters. I cannot for the life of me recall that at any stage, during any economic debate, any of those opposite even vaguely mentioned the world financial crisis. It is as if it did not happen. When most European states at the moment have a sovereign debt of 80-plus per cent of their gross national product, when their unemployment rates are over 10 per cent, when the United States' unemployment rate is about 8½ per cent, Australia is a standout economy. Those opposite certainly no longer mention the it. It International Monetary Fund, mainly because it has credited the Australian government's move to bring this budget back to surplus in such a timely way. Nor have those opposite mentioned similar positive comments made by agencies such as Standard and Poor's. In any economic contribution, they are going to completely ignore the fact that, despite the challenges we have faced leading up to this budget, Australia has now received AAA status from every rating agency for the first time in its history-never before. What we are doing through this budget is placing downward pressure on interest rates. We are creating an incentive for the Reserve Bank to again reduce interest rates. I would not expect those opposite to acknowledge it but the recent 50 basis point adjustment by the Reserve Bank, which is being taken up in dribs and drabs by other banks, has had a huge impact on my electorate. My electorate might be the second-most disadvantaged in the country, my electorate might be the most multicultural in Australia with 50 per cent of my electorate born overseas, but one thing my electorate really strives hard to do is participate in private housing. When they got that rate cut it went down very significantly for families who work so hard to look after their kids. This is another initiative by federal Labor to do the exact same thing. Without increasing any inflationary aspect, without making any adjustments to the calculation of the education tax refund, we are moving in such a way as to ensure that all those families that are entitled to it for their kids will get it. I ask those opposite who are going to participate in this debate to understand that in my electorate, an electorate of great need, to date 10 per cent of families who are eligible for the education tax refund have not claimed it. This is for a range of different reasons, but many just did not think they were entitled to it. This will be well-received by them and I can assure those opposite there will be no issue of it finding its way into local clubs, poker machines or the front bar of some establishment, as the member for Menzies indicated; this will go to looking after their children.

15,Mr TUDGE,Unknown," Mr Deputy Speaker, the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (Schoolkids Bonus Budget Measures) Bill 2012 abolishes a good program, the education tax refund, and replaces it with a fistful of dollars designed to shore up the electoral prospects of the Prime Minister. The bill itself should be called the 'sugar hit bill' because that is exactly what the intent of this bill is. Make no mistake: it is about two things and they are not to do with education. It is about trying to compensate for the carbon tax-the world's biggest carbon tax coming on 1 July this year-and trying to add to the pretence that the government has some sort of economic credibility by delivering a budget surplus next financial year. I will get to those two points in a minute, but let me get to the substance of the bill in front of us first. The bill abandons the education tax refund. This tax refund was specifically designed to assist families with their education expenses. We support that intent, and we support the education tax refund because, as the member for Fowler pointed out, many families are doing it tough at the moment. We know that education expenses have been going up. There are uniforms, school fees, textbooks, drama, music and all sorts of things that families need to pay for. We are a strong supporter of the education tax refund to enable families to pay for those measures which specifically are tailored towards helping their children go to school. In fact, so much so are we supportive of this measure that we took to the last election a policy to increase the amount of money which people could claim against that education tax refund. It was based on an important principle, and it is a principle that the other side of this chamber have great difficulty with. It is the principle of accountability. It is accountability to the taxpayer, who is paying for the payment, and it is accountability on behalf of the recipient to spend it according to what the desires of that payment were. The design of the education tax refund was quite simple. You simply had to collect the receipts for items which went towards the education of your children. That was all. It was no great burden. If you bought textbooks you got a receipt, put it in your pocket, and then you could claim it back against your taxes and get a refund at the end of that financial year. That is what it required. That did two things. First of all, it created an incentive for people to spend the money on education rather than other things, because we think that is a good thing. Second of all, it created an accountability mechanism so that we ensured the money set aside for education expenses actually got spent on education expenses. We are in favour of this. We are in favour of supporting families with their costs of education, so much so that, mentioned before, we took to the last election a policy to increase the amount of support provided to each family-up to $1,000 for each secondary school-aged child and $500 for each primary school-aged child. By contrast the Labor scheme provides only $820 for each secondary school aged child and only $410 for each primary school aged child. This bill removes the linkage between the payment and education. That is what it does. No longer do you have to collect the receipts and no longer do you have to ensure that the money has to be spent on education in order to receive that payment. Rather the payment just gets delivered directly into your bank account to spend on whatever you like. We have seen this before, because we have had a pattern from this government, and we know through the GFC that there were $900 cash splashes provided to families. Yes, many of those families used it for the right purposes to help them with their food and accommodation and other costs that they were struggling with. We also know that a lot of that money was spent on flat screen TVs from China, it was spent on holidays and it was spent on some other unsavoury things, which I do not need to mention here. It was given to dead people and it was given to people who were overseas. I am concerned that exactly the same thing will happen, again, here. Yes, a lot of people will use it for education costs but there will also be people who use it for things other than the costs incurred for the education of their children. There will be payments, I am sure, made to people who are now deceased and there will be payments made to people who are living overseas. Our concern is that it breaks the nexus between the payment and the purpose for the payment and, consequently, this core concept of accountability gets thrown out the as I window. It is accountability, most importantly, for the taxpayer who is paying for this. They are the ones who are paying for it. It is not the Labor government paying for it; it is the taxpayer. They deserve accountability to ensure that their hard earned dollars are going to where they are supposed to be delivered. It is accountability on behalf of the recipients of that money to ensure that they spend the money on the purpose for which it was intended. Let me now go back to what this bill is really about. As I said at the outset, it is really about two things: compensating for the world's largest carbon tax coming to all families on 1 July; and trying to add to the pretence that there will be a budget surplus next year. The carbon tax, the greatest carbon tax in the world, will hit every single family on 1 July this year. This was the tax which was supposed to reform the economy according to the Treasurer-a clean energy future was going to occur, a transformation of Australia. It is funny, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, that it did not get mentioned once in the budget speech. This was the big transformation of our economy. You would think in the 14 pages, the half-hour speech, that the Treasurer might have mentioned it once. But, no, he did not mention the carbon tax. We know why, because it is toxic. It is politically toxic for this government. The reason it is politically toxic is it puts prices up for every family across Australia and it will cost jobs across Australia. When you look at the government's own figures, the carbon tax will increase electricity costs by 10 per cent in the first year alone. According to the government's own figures it will increase gas costs by nine per cent alone. It will cost jobs across Australia. The Victorian treasury has done some analysis and says it will cost 24,000 jobs across Victoria. In my electorate alone it will cost 500 jobs. The reason is that it penalises our businesses but does not penalise the businesses that we are competing with from overseas. So a manufacturer in my electorate, which is struggling already with the high Australian dollar and fierce competition from China, will all of a sudden have additional costs imposed but the Chinese manufacturer will not have those additional costs. It operates like a reverse tariff. It is poisonous because it is bad policy. Of course it is based on a lie: it is based on the premise that this government went to the election promising that it would not introduce a carbon tax, and what does it do as soon as it gets in? It introduces it, and this bill is all about trying to provide a little sugar hit to divert people from the carbon tax, which is coming their way. But of course it will not compensate for fewer jobs. It will not compensate for the higher prices which will be coming from 1 July. It certainly will not compensate for the continuing increase in prices which will occur because the carbon tax is legislated to increase from $23 up to $29 in the first three years alone. It cannot compensate for those things, and the government should not pretend that it will do so. The other thing that this bill is about-and the member for Menzies touched on this-is trying to add to the pretence that the government is reining in its expenditure and getting on top of its debt and will deliver a surplus in 2012-13. The trickery of this bill is that it brings forward some of the costs from the education tax refund, which were supposed to be incurred in 2012-13, and brings them forward into this financial year-that is what is happening. Under the previous scheme, you had to collect your receipts, you would put them in and the payment would come the next year; under this measure, a payment will be delivered in June, immediately, and that is why there is a great rush to get this bill through the parliament to deliver the payment in June. The government does not care about the expenditure; it only cares about the paper projected budget surplus of next year. If this payment were put into next year's budget then half of the $1.5 billion budget surplus would be gone. This is not the only piece of accounting trickery which is going on, as the member for Menzies pointed out; there are any number of other pieces of accounting trickery occurring in order to give the pretence that we will have a budget surplus next year. The key thing about a budget surplus is that it is not just to give the pretence through a bit of paper that they have got the spending under control. We advocate for running a budget surplus because, primarily, it is intended to stop a government spending money beyond its means. We advocate for a budget surplus because it puts limits on the government spending money beyond its means. But the government actually does not care about that. That is why we have seen this financial year's budget deficit balloon out from $12 billion to $22 billion to $37 billion to $44.5 billion for this financial year. It does not care about that as long as it has the pretence that next year it will get this $1.5 billion surplus. The other thing that I would mention is that of course we will not know whether they actually deliver on this budget surplus until the end of next year. We know for sure that they will not deliver. It is interesting that we have the member for Fraser in the chamber. The member for Fraser has been a big advocate of looking at betting markets to determine what is the most likely outcome in politics. He suggests that they are a very good predictor of what will occur. In fact the betting markets today have the odds on whether the government will deliver a budget surplus-not just project one but actually deliver one-in 2012-13. The odds of them delivering a surplus are about $4 or maybe $5; the odds of them delivering a budget deficit for 2012-13 are about $1.20that is, the markets suggest there is about a 20 per cent chance of them delivering a surplus, even taking into account all of their accounting tricks. Maybe the member for Fraser will be able to comment on that, because he has written extensively about how the betting markets are very good predictors in politics, and the betting markets are saying that there is about a 20 per cent chance that they will deliver a budget surplus next year even taking into account their accounting tricks. Let me summarise: this measure before us is poor policy because it takes away the link between the payments and the actual intent of the payments-that is the first point. It is also poor because it is based on accounting trickery, trying to bring forward payments from the next financial year into this financial year. Thirdly, it is all about trying to create a sugar hit for the carbon tax, which is going to hit all families on 1 July Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (10:36): I rise to proudly support the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (Schoolkids Bonus Budget Measures) Bill 2012. This bill introduces a new payment through the family assistance legislation called the schoolkids bonus to begin on 1 January 2013. The payment will provide direct assistance to eligible families with children in school and will be paid through the family payment system twice a year: in January and July. It will be paid right at the start of the school year and just before term 3. The two payments will total $410 per year for each child in primary school and $820 per year for each child in secondary school. The schoolkids bonus will replace the education tax refund. Subsequently this bill removes the education tax refund from the taxation legislation. As part of the transitional arrangements to the new schoolkids bonus, the bill also creates a new payment in the family assistance and veterans affairs legislation to pay the maximum value of the education tax refund entitlement for 2011-12 as a lump sum. This lump sum payment will be delivered to eligible families before the end of June 2012. What does this mean? It means parents do not need to keep receipts for months and months on end to get a guaranteed payment. It means that parents will receive a full amount every time, so families will not miss out if they lose their receipts. Parents do not have to pay out of their own pocket and then wait months to get paid back. The payment will be made upfront twice a year before the start of term 1 and term 3. In addition, the paying out of the 2011-12 education tax refund as part of the transitional arrangements means that parents who are entitled to family tax benefit part A will be paid on 8 May 2012 for a school-age child-and for young people in secondary this year. education a lump sum payment. The education tax refund payment will pay out the full amount of what would have been available through the taxation system for 2011-12. This means $409 for each child in primary school and $818 for each child in secondary school. The education tax refund payment will be paid earlier than otherwise would have been the case under the education tax refund, and without the need to lodge receipts for a tax return. On many occasions in the five years I have been here I have had to shake my head while listening to speeches-yesterday afternoon while listening to a matter of public importance which the opposition treated as such a joke that they turned it a story about Star Trek-but I do not think I have ever stood in this chamber and been as angry as I am now. The arguments being put up by the opposition-and importantly by the shadow minister, the member for Menzies-are appalling, to say the very least. Families in my electorate should be disgusted at the arguments that are being put up by the opposition today. For the shadow minister to stand there today and say that families are just as likely to go down the road and blow it on poker machines is just offensive. It is so interesting that every this government provides financial assistance to ease those cost-of-living pressures we hear the opposition drag out that line, 'They are just as likely to blow it on poker machines.' What is absolutely ironic in this argument is that the then minister under the Howard government, Mal Brough, was more than happy to give a $5,000 lump sum baby bonus-no checks or balances, just: 'Here's $5,000 because you've had a baby. You don't have to prove that that money is spent on that child.' You did not hear arguments from the Howard government saying, 'We're worried this is going to be blown on other things.' They trusted the families that they gave this money to. But when we want to give $400 or $800 to families for education expenses, 'No, we cannot trust them. They won't spend it on their kids.' That is just offensive. The families in my electorate should be furious at the opposition for wanting to block this bill. I have heard arguments from the opposition today that this is bad policy and that no-one is going to get any more money. That just shows that the opposition do not understand this bill and why this change is occurring. The reality is that more families are getting extra money, because many families across the country were not claiming the education tax refund despite being eligible. There were many families into who were underclaiming. In my electorate there were 1,600 families out of the 9,700 local families who were not receiving the education tax refund at all. There were another 8,100 who were receiving less than they were entitled to. This is a bonus to those people. It is extra money. To say, 'It is just shifting money from one side of the ledger to the other; it means nothing; it is no extra money for families,' is either showing the ignorance of the opposition in not understanding the bill or, worse than that, misleading the Australian people. I suspect it time is the latter, because there is certainly a history of that behaviour. It was interesting to hear the member for Aston today say that the education tax refund's intent-which they supported-was to help families with education expenses. He went through a list of different expenses. He mentioned textbooks, uniforms, music, art and other extracurricular activities. It is very interesting that the member for Aston would say that, because he is absolutely right that families are weighed down with those expenses; they are having to pay for all of those things. What he is wrong on is thinking that the education tax refund covered those things, because it did not. In fact, the education tax refund was limited to what it is: families could claim, and I bring the chamber's attention to the education tax refund eligibility: Eligible expenses include the cost of buying, establishing, repairing and maintaining any of the following items:  home computers and laptops  computer-related equipment such as printers, USB flash drives, and disability aids to assist in the use of computer equipment for students with special needs  computer repairs  home internet connections  computer software for educational use  school textbooks and other printed learning material, including prescribed textbooks, associated learning materials, study guides and stationery, and  prescribed trade tools for secondary school trade courses. More recently, in the 2011-12 budget, the government extended that to include school uniforms, hats, footwear and sports uniforms purchased from 1 July 2011-all very important expenditure for families. But it did not include the sorts of things that the member for Aston talked about. That is why-despite the opposition claiming that this is just a 'sugar hit'-this is a much better program. It is much better than the education tax refund, not only for the obvious reason that families are getting the full amount and they are getting it when they most need it, but also because it recognises that education expenditure goes much broader than textbooks, computers and uniforms. There are a lot more expenses for families. The member for Aston is right in saying that kids who want to do music have to buy their own equipment. Whether it is government or nongovernment schools, whether it is part of the normal curriculum within the school or an extracurricular activity after school, they still have to buy their own equipment. If the kids want to learn violin, mum and dad still have to find the money to buy that violin. This program means that that money can go towards those expenses. It can go to art courses, to music and to other things, but importantly I want to give a couple of examples why this program is so much better and more important for families. The reality is that there are students who need more support than the education system can provide, wherever they go to school. Sometimes those children need some external tutoring. Sometimes because of learning difficulties those students need speech therapy, and I have met many families whose children need speech therapy. That is not readily available in schools. In government schools in Queensland, if your child is assessed and they need speech therapy they may get one session a week or fortnight, and it may even be less than that. If you talk to any parent whose child needs speech therapy, they will tell you that is not sufficient to bring their child up to the level they need to be at to further their learning. This money can actually assist in those kids getting speech therapy lessons outside of school. I am very proud of this program because it recognises that there is no onesize-fits-all answer when it comes to education expenses. It is up to the family to decide that. To argue that we do not know where this money is going to be spent ignores the fact that this money has already been spent, that these parents have already put their hands in their pockets and spent the money on their children, and it is okay to reimburse them for those costs. But there are also families out there who have not been able to put their hands in their pockets already. I will tell you, for example, of the mum in my electorate who could not afford to buy new shoes for her daughter who was starting high school. The daughter had to wear her existing shoes from the previous year. The shoes were too tight, and she came home in the first week with blisters on her feet and in excruciating pain. The mum did not want to send her to school in other shoes because she might get picked on. Her solution was to pull her daughter out of school until she could afford to raise the money to buy new shoes. No parent should have to do that. She turned to one of our local not-for-profit community organisations for help, and she got that help. But I do not think she should have to turn to that community organisation for help. We should be supporting that family, and that is what we will do through this financial assistance. Many benefits come from this bill. Despite my anger, I do in part feel sorry for those members who stand up on the opposition side and speak to oppose this bill, because they have to go back to their electorates and face those families. They will do one of two things: either they will pretend they are not opposing it and go out and say this is a great initiative-a bit like the BER, when they went out and said how great it was locally, but then came here and opposed it-or they will have to tell those families why they do not deserve this money and that they do not trust those families to use this money on their own children. This government, through this bill and the budget initiatives, is doing a lot for families including the Paid Parental Leave scheme, the family tax benefit part A, the teenager boost that we have previously provided, the childcare rebate and the assistance that we are giving parents in their childcare and their training needs to get back into the workforce. These are all positive measures, but I stand here today to say that there is no more positive measure that we can do for families in relation to cost-of-living pressure. We hear those on the other side constantly arguing about cost-of-living pressure, but this is the test: when they talk about cost-ofreally living pressure on families, is it about the politics or is it genuinely about helping families? If you are genuine about helping families, you will support this bill. You will go back to your communities and say, 'I will stand up and support this bill,' just as the government is doing with the clean energy future household assistance package. We will support families. That is what a Labor government does. That is what this government is doing, and I support this bill wholeheartedly.",38
16,Mr FLETCHER,Unknown," I am pleased to rise to speak on the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (Schoolkids Bonus Budget Measures) Bill 2012. Let me start by noting that the process under which the House of Representatives is being asked to consider this bill is a deeply deficient one. The first official announcement of this measure was in the Treasurer's budget speech last night. We now have a bill which was introduced this morning that was only available to members of the House to review from 9.30 this morning. The second reading has been brought on immediately and members of this House, the people's house, are being asked to consider the merits of a bill which extends for some 55 pages and contains some extremely complex provisions with very little notice. That is poor process and it could only lead one to doubt the motives with which the government brings forward this bill and its motives in wanting to have it considered in such a rush. It is hard to avoid the suspicion that the government is eager to avoid detailed scrutiny being brought to bear on the measures contained in this bill. In the brief time that I have available to me I want to make three points: firstly, that the measures implemented by this bill are poorly designed measures and they do not do what they say they do; secondly, that what is driving this bill, and the measures contained in it, is politics. This is pure politics, and is about seeking to offer additional compensation for the effects of the carbon tax and the increase that will cause in the cost of living faced by millions of Australians; and thirdly, that families would be much better served by having a better government, lower taxes and less debt to be repaid, including debt that will inevitably upon the shoulders of the very children whose families are to receive payments under this bill. Let me turn first to the proposition that what we have before the House this morning is a poorly designed measure that does not, in fact, do what the governments says it is going to do. The stated intention of this measure is that it will pay for expenses like school uniforms, school shoes, textbooks, camps, excursions and extracurricular activities, such as music lessons. That is what the minister told the House this morning in the second reading speech. The reality is that this money can be spent on whatever the recipient chooses to spend it on. If this is a measures designed specifically to target expenditure associated with the cost of having a child in primary school or high school it is a very poorly designed and poorly targeted measure. Curiously, it replaces a measure designed to achieve the same outcomes-that was much better targeted. Again, one can only wonder about the government's motives in introducing this change. To be eligible to benefit under this measure, a number of conditions need to be satisfied. The first is that the family must be eligible for Family Tax Benefit Part A. But the class of eligible families goes beyond families who have children in primary school or high school because Family Tax Benefit Part A is available for those who, first of all, meet the income test and, secondly, have a child up to the age of 20 or a dependent student within the family up to the age of 24. In other words, if this measure is to be effective in being targeted only to primary and high school children there are additional eligibility conditions which will need to be met. The family will need to demonstrate that here is a primary school or high school fall aged child in the family. There are reasons to be uncertain as to whether the eligibility mechanisms have been adequately thought through. We are told, in the minister's second reading speech, that the design of this scheme means that parents or eligible recipients do not have to collect a pile of receipts. It is paid in full and up-front. It is money in your pocket. The minister's second reading speech says very little about the mechanisms by which eligibility will be established and very little about the inevitable possibility that this money will be paid to some families who do not, in fact, meet the eligibility criteria because although they are eligible for Family Tax Benefit Part A the relevant child is not a primary or secondary school student. In this regard, it is interesting that when you delve into the bill it says, amongst other things-under proposed section 35U(c) of A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999-that the bonus can, in some circumstances, be paid even after the child has left school. In other words, the very drafting of the legislation acknowledges that there is a problem is trying to determine who is eligible to receive this bonus. The solution is apparently a quick fudge: we will allow payment even if the child has left school. There are other provisions of the bill which are equally concerning when it comes time to consider how well designed and targeted this scheme is. Clause 24 provides that the minister has the power, by legislative instrument, to determine a scheme under which ETR payments-education tax refund payments-be made to persons in particular circumstances. This bill, in other words, very deep within it, contains provisions entitling the minister, by regulation, to expand the circumstances under which money is paid. That is just one piece of evidence amongst many that this is a poorly designed and hastily cobbled together package of measures, and we all know the underlying political reason for that. It is that the government panicked, late in the day, as it was developing this budget. There was not sufficient compensation for Australians who are going to face cost-of-living increases result of the introduction of the carbon tax. So they have come up with a new way of throwing money at people and they have dignified it with the term 'schoolkids bonus'. We know from past experience of similarly hastily put-together and poorly designed cash-splash schemes by this governmentsuch as the $900 cash bonus in the Rudd years of this government-that such schemes are rife with problems. Money gets pumped out to a whole range of people who ought not to have received it, even under the rules of the scheme. That is an inevitable consequence of a scheme being cobbled together in a rushed fashion to meet political objectives. We have heard claims from members opposite this morning that the policy objectives here are worthwhile and important and that this is in some way a better designed and targeted scheme than the one it replaces. But even a moment's consideration suggests that that claim cannot be substantiated. There is no attempt to link the amount that is paid to the actual expenditure incurred. In other words, the amount is paid regardless of whether the child goes to a school where the uniform costs $50 or the child goes to a school where the uniform costs $250, and regardless of whether the child does sport and music, and incurs fees in doing so, or does not. There is no linkage at all between the amount of the schoolkids bonus and expenditure actually incurred by the family in supporting the child in his or her education. It is a bizarre approach to policy to say, 'There was previously a tax rebate which was payable for a defined objective if the taxpayer provided evidence of having spent money in the designated areas but we are going to replace that scheme because not enough people claimed under it.' The government is saying: 'Not enough people as a wanted to claim money from the government. Something must be wrong; we're going to fix that up by replacing it with a scheme which has no restrictions and no requirement to demonstrate eligibility, at all.' Economists speak of 'revealed preference'-that is to say, you work out what it is that people want to consume based upon what they actually do. If people have chosen not to make a claim it is a pretty good inference that that is because they did not need the money or they made a judgment that the time incurred in gathering the documentation and making the claim was time that could have been spent more productively doing something else. But that is not good enough for this government because it is determined to push money into the pockets of people even if, to date, they have shown no desire to make a claim. The consequence is that we have moved from having a measure which was well designed and well targeted at education expenses towards a generalised cash splash. The government's arguments on this point are completely threadbare when you give the matter even a moment's thought. If their true objective was to make it simpler procedurally for parents to obtain this money to use for the specified purpose, there are a range of alternatives they could have considered. They could have considered, for example, a voucher scheme under which you are given a certain amount of money which can only be spent with specified suppliers. You could be given a voucher which could only be spent with people who make and sell school uniforms, with providers of sports and music lessons and so on, or with the school itself, which will often be the one which is charging the extra fees. The point I make is this: there are a raft of other policy designs which could have been used if the government was genuine in wanting to achieve its stated objectives. But the reality is that the stated objectives are merely a smokescreen for the government's true purpose. The second point I want to make today is that this is purely about politics. This is a measure which is designed to deliver further compensation for the cost of the carbon tax, because the government knows, despite its protestations, that the carbon tax will materially increase the cost of living for millions of ordinary Australians The Treasurer told us last night in his budget speech that families will not pay the carbon tax; it will be companies that pay. If that were true there would be no need for compensation. But the reality is, as the Treasurer either knows or ought to know, there is a well-established distinction between the legal incidence of a tax and the economic incidence of a tax. This is a tax the economic incidence of which will fall upon all Australians. This is pure politics designed to try and soften the blow of an ill-judged carbon tax. The Treasurer and the government are desperate to ram this measure through quickly because they are desperate to get the money out before 30 June. Amongst other things, we know that the true cost of this measure in 2011-12, according to the budget papers, is $1.32 billion. If that money were to be spent in the 2012-13 year the consequence would be that the Treasurer's wafer-thin surplus would disappear almost immediately. So it is politics that is motivating the government's desire to move to this supposed new scheme. It has nothing to do with the policy merits or otherwise of the existing education tax rebate scheme. The third point I want to come to, in the brief time. I have remaining to me, is to argue that what families deserve is a better government, lower taxes and less debt to repay. Of course, if we could all have an extra $820 in the pocket, which did not cost us anything to get, that would be wonderful and we would all sign up for it. But that is not the proposition on offer. This $820, far from costing us nothing, is going to cost us all a lot of money. The people who will end up paying the most for it are the very schoolchildren purported to benefit, because in years to come they will be the ones repaying this government's debt. That is why we oppose this ill-judged measure.",44
17,Mr SIMPKINS,Unknown," I welcome the opportunity to comment on the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (Schoolkids Bonus Budget Measures) Bill 2012 today. I had not planned on speaking directly after the member for Bradfield, who is always a hard act to follow. I had expected, according to the very latest speakers list, to speak after the member for Robertson, but as usual it appears that the government speakers list is as inaccurate as their budget forecasts. What is this bill really about? We have heard a lot of talk today that it is about education and making sure money gets to the right people, but there are some other aspects to this as well and we can never lose sight of those. Possibly this bill is not all about education; maybe it is all about politics and maybe it is also a little bit about the budget. I will get to those aspects which so many of my colleagues have spoken about this morning and make my own points. Education is something that all of us in this place agree is of great value. It is the great leveller, the great equaliser-the chance for people born in the lowest socio-economic circumstances to rise up to great places in this country and to do great things for our nation. That is important, and that is why we supported the education tax rebate. It is a very good, targeted program. I spoke a couple of years ago about the need to expand it when you could not claim a refund for uniforms. I am on the record for having said you should be able to, and later it was expanded to allow that. I know that there are families within the electorate of Cowan-in Girrawheen, Koondoola, Ballajura, Marangaroo, suburbs like that-where there are young kids who just do not fit in at school, where the fact they do not have the leavers shirt or the latest upgraded uniform means they do not feel that they really fit in. I made an offer to Ballajura Primary School recently that I would help pay for leavers shirts for a couple of kids who did not appear to have them, because I know how important it is for young people to fit in. Obviously my 13year-old and my nine-year-old do not want for such measures, but I know there are families in the community that struggle. So it was a welcome thing that the education tax rebate focused on specific, directed delivery to allow kids to fully participate in the educational process and the educational system, so that they did not have to feel different and that that was not something that made them less likely to turn up to school each day. There is no doubt that we as a coalition support education and that we want kids in the more struggling families in the lower socio-economic areas to have the same opportunities and not to feel bad for want of the basics such as a decent school shirt or a decent school uniform to wear. We certainly would not want them to feel that they could not have the same textbooks and other things that kids in Western Australia get from places like Wooldridges, the great suppliers of the book lists in the state school system in Western Australia. So it is important that we focus on making sure that the money that is on offer to Australian families actually makes it to the mark and results in real educational outcomes. Those outcomes were aplenty: school uniforms, books, school fees, even those voluntary fee ones in state schools in Western Australia. They were the sorts of things that could be claimed: actual deliverables, an actual impact as a contribution to the school and directly to the student. What worries me about this proposal, that specifically when we are talking about the educational outcomes, is that this will be something like the BER . It will purport to be some education revolution but, like a new building, which is great, not something that substantially changes the actual education outcomes for kids. I know from past experience-quite distant past in my caseand from the experiences of a lot of families in Cowan about the impacts of the cost of living and what happens when money lands in their accounts. What will happen when this money lands in the accounts of some families in the electorate is that that money will not just be immediately moved over to an education account or subaccount for that family. They will receive that money and then, when the next bill comes in, that money will probably just flow out to pay for that. In a very small number of circumstances we may see a pick-up in whitegoods, TVs or, worse and hopefully in none or hardly any cases, drugs and alcohol and other excesses and vices and things like that. The one thing that we can be certain of is that there can be no guarantee that the upfront $820 cash payment for a high school student or $410 for a primary school student will actually make an educational impact for a student. We can always hope, but we can be certain that it will not all go in that direction. And that is what the education tax rebate was really all about at the start. As I said before, both sides of politics agree on the great value of education. What we believe in on this side is making sure that every dollar that comes from the taxpayersit does not come from the government; it does not fall from the sky-actually ends up making some impact on the educational opportunities for young people across this country. That should particularly be so for the students in those great state schools I mentioned before within the electorate of Cowan: Hudson Park Primary School, Roseworth Primary School, Koondoola Primary School, Waddington Primary School, Marangaroo Primary School, Rawlinson Primary School and South Ballajura Primary School. Those are in areas where there is struggle, where there are people doing it hard. They are the lower socio-economic areas where education is needed to help children to lift up to be great participants in this great country's life. We need to make sure that this money goes all the way through. We are not opposed to $820 going to a high school student or $410 going to a primary school student. But we stand for that money going to the educational benefits for those children and not, through an act or omission or other issues, being diverted to something else. The government knows that. The government knows exactly where this money could end up and they are not concerned about making sure that every dollar goes to education. This government is thinking of other things now. This government is thinking about what it has done in the past in this place and the impact of that from 1 July 2012. I am talking about that great betrayal of the Australian people by the Prime Minister and by the government with regard to the carbon tax. The government knows that the Australian people disagree with it. It knows that it is going to have to try and buy its way out of this adversity. Despite the scandals that afflict the government right now, it knows that the big tidal wave is coming and it is going to have to try and buy out the Australian people-to flash some cash in their direction-to try and get off the hook on that deal. This is primarily about politics. It is about the government's benefit, not ours. We on this side believe in the great value of education. We believe in what must be done for young people in Australia. We believe that $820, for secondary school students, and $410, for primary school students, should go towards their education, towards helping them and towards providing benefits to them-that is, making sure they fit in and that they can fully participate. We believe in that. And, without this bill, that would continue. There would still be the need for accountability-that is, people would have to prove that they actually spent the money on education for their child. Is that such a bad thing? Is it such a terrible thing that Australian parents should have to prove that taxpayers' money went to the education and benefit of their child? I do not think that is too much to ask. That is exactly the sort of support that this federal government, and this parliament, should be providing. They should be making sure that taxpayers' money goes to the future of this country, which is represented by all those young people around the country. It is not too much to ask. It is the right thing to do. However, in the case of this bill, it is not right. This is not what is going to benefit Australian children. This is not going to be an investment in the future. An investment in the future was the education tax rebate-that was working. Maybe, if the government is so concerned about people not participating because they did not know about the rebate, it should divert some of the $36 million that it is spending on promoting its toxic carbon tax. Maybe it should put some of that into some posters on the front doors of school admin blocks around this country, to tell people that the education tax refund is there for them. Maybe that is what it should be doing with some of these advertising dollars. But instead, what we have is this sugar hit, this sweetener and this compensation for the carbon tax in the form of extra cash handouts. That is what this is really all about. However, it is not just these matters-the lack of focus on education, the politics and the buy-out. It is not just those things. We have also got the budget. Last night, the Treasurer tried to persuade us that his figures were going to be accurate this time: $1.5 billion for a surplus-not a whole lot of change from the figures for the year before, when he told us there was going to be a $22 billion deficit, which has now blown out to $44 billion. But this time, apparently, it is all going to be accurate. It is all going to be cast in stone. It is going to be accurate for the first time in four years. I think the Australian people know that it is not going to work out that way. This coming year will be another red ink year, despite the fact that, if this bill passes, the government will have managed to move these payments, such as the $750 million in educational tax rebate payments, into this financial year, which helps it take that little bit of pressure off the next financial year. That is sleight of hand. The government has also announced that the $1.1 billion in flood payments to local governments is being moved from what was forecast as part of the next financial yearthat is, this allegedly $1.5 billion surplus financial year-into this financial year as well. Again, a sleight of hand. What we are seeing with this government is that it talks about education but it is not about education. This bill is about politics. It is about buying people out. It is about trying to compensate for the government's toxic carbon tax. It is also about trying to create a false image, which will be seen to be such in the coming months. It is about trying to balance the budget and trying to do that sleight of hand with the budget. As I have said, both sides of this House believe in education, but we on this side stand by our opposition to this bill because we believe that it is not too much for taxpayers to ask that every dollar of the contribution they make to the future of this country towards issues like education and towards the education tax rebate should go towards an educational outcome. We should be able to be certain that every dollar spent goes to those young people around the country, including those in Cowan, who need to fit in and who need to have the resources there to make sure that they do not miss out We need to make sure that education, that great leveller, is pushed out through all the streets and all the communities of our country. It is not too much to ask that the money that the government offers actually goes all the way through to an educational outcome. What the government proposes today is no guarantee for that. It is just a handout. It is just a sugar hit. We cannot be sure that educational outcomes will ever be achieved by this measure. It is not the right way to go. It should be left as it is. We support the current situation with the education tax rebate and the government should leave it alone in the best interests of this nation.",47
18,Mr IRONS,Unknown," I rise to speak on the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (Schoolkids Bonus Budget Measures) Bill 2012. I would like to acknowledge the previous speakers, including the member for Cowan, another West Australian, who I know has a deep interest in education, particularly as he has two young girls that he is extremely proud of. His interest in their education is shown by the way he delivered his speech on this particular bill. We also heard from the member for Aston, who spoke about this bill being all about a carbon tax compensation, and the member for Bradfield, who spoke about this bill as being just politics. Last night the government announced their planned budget for the coming year. It was a confusing message from the Treasurer, and it seems that this government continues to lack any sort of narrative that appeals to the Australian public and deals with the economic challenges which Australians face. If we had taken Labor's rhetoric at face value, we would have expected a tough budget with a coherent economic strategy to deliver stronger growth and higher productivity. Instead, we got more Labor handouts, money shuffles and a pretend surplus. The surplus is an illusion. The planned increases in national debt next year and over the forward estimates will continue to rise. Those who watched the budget last night might ask themselves: 'How can the government deliver a surplus while simultaneously increasing national debt? Surely there's something the Treasurer isn't telling us.' The bill currently before the House is yet another example of the government not being upfront with the Australian people. Labor has decided to dump the education tax rebate, a targeted program that provided genuine assistance to relieve education costs for parents. Instead, it is giving out handfuls of taxpayers' money in a desperate bid to improve its electoral stocks. The new handouts bring back memories of the $900 cash handouts that former Prime Minister Rudd sent out in the early days of the government. Consistent with this government's usual practices, waste occurred on a massive scale, with payments going overseas and to dead people. I recall during the Rudd period a talkback caller to 6PR in Perth whose name, if my memory serves me right, was Charlie. He won the title of talkback caller of the day. The subject he spoke about was what he had spent his $900 of stimulus money on. He had spent it on brothels. There was no accountability for the $900, so, instead of helping him outMr Baldwin interjecting",50
19,Mr IRONS,Unknown,It seems to be an acceptable practice.,51
20,Mr Baldwin,Unknown,At least it was his own money!,51
21,Mr IRONS,Unknown,He thanked the government for the good time he got out of the $900.,51
22,Mr Baldwin,Unknown,That's cheap compared to Thomson!,51
23,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown," I am sure that the member for Swan can have his contribution by himself, without your assistance.",51
24,Mr IRONS,Unknown,"The education tax refundthe ETR-was designed to help with the cost of educating primary and secondary school children. Eligible parents, carers, legal guardians and independent students were able to get money back on education expenses. These included items such as computers, educational software, textbooks and stationery. Under the education tax refund system you may have got 50 per cent of your money back. If you got family tax benefit part A, you were probably eligible for the ETR. There were also some payments which prevented your receiving FTB part A but still entitled you to receive the refund. This new legislation has abandoned any pretence of being about offsetting education costs; it is simply a sugar hit to create a diversion from the increased bills and costs that will occur as a result of the carbon tax while families go about their everyday lives. Labor are recklessly promoting this measure by saying that families will be eligible for the money even if they lose their receipts, but they have failed to explain that every eligible family will get the money regardless of whether they keep their receipts and that they can spend the money on anything they like. It is funny that the government stood a few weeks ago talking about how much they support small business and then gave away the one per cent tax cut they talked about while the ATO and this government insist on businesses keeping receipts and everything being accountable. A business in my electorate went under because the ATO pursued it for not having proof that payments out of the company went to superannuation funds and the people it had employed were not able to give back to the company proof that the money had gone into their accounts. The business was treated as having given a distribution and was forced into liquidation by the ATO because it did not keep receipts. The ETR was all about accountability: if you wanted to get the ETR, you had to be accountable and keep receipts. But under the new legislation you will not need to keep receipts, and that means that you will be able to spend the money on anything you like-it does not have to go to education. It can be spent on TVs-it can go to the Taiwanese economy as the $900 handouts did. The Taiwanese economy was the main beneficiary of the $900 handouts through people's purchases of TVs. Under the ETR you needed to keep records to help you or your tax agent prepare your tax return or claim. You also needed receipts to ensure that you were able to your claim for expenses if you were asked by the tax office to do so. Eligible education expenses had to be listed separately on invoices. Under the ETR the eligible expenses included the cost of buying, establishing, repairing and maintaining any of the following items: home computers and laptops; computer-related equipment such as printers, USB flash drives and disability aids to assist in the use of computer equipment by students with special needs; computer repairs; home internet connections; computer software for educational use; school up textbooks and other printed learning material, including prescribed textbooks, associated learning materials, study guides and stationery; and prescribed trade tools for secondary school trade courses. This system ensured that the money went to specific and important areas and was not wasted. Labor's bill will remove the cash incentive for parents to invest in their children's schooling needs. This bill put forward by the government is one of the most blatant attempts at cooking this year's budget books in order to allow Labor to protect its unofficial surplus in the next financial year, as the refund will be paid out before the end of this financial year. The education tax refund system was a regime that ensured taxpayers' money was given only to families who actually spent money on education costs. The coalition, which supports the ETR, took a policy to the last election that vastly expanded the number of school expense items that were eligible and also increased the rebate amounts. The coalition's plan would have provided a rebate to families of $1,000 for each secondary school aged child and $500 for each primary school aged child. By contrast, Labor's scheme provides only $820 for secondary school aged children and $410 for primary school aged children, leaving a family with two prove children-one secondary and one primarysome $270 per year worse off. The coalition's policy at the last election delivered more money, was better targeted and went straight to those families who needed it most. While some families might benefit this year under this bill, Labor continues to borrow money and it will be the children of these families who will have to repay Labor's debt for years into the future. An eligible family with an 18-year-old in year 12 may get a sugar hit, but that will not last long, as the student will then get slammed with hundreds of dollars in compulsory student union fees-which is a topic I have spoken on at length in this place and is one of the numerous new taxes or tax increases introduced by this government. What more and more Australians are realising about this government is that, despite all the lofty rhetoric we hear from Prime Minister and the Treasurer day by day, this confused government continues to raise taxes and grow our national debt. Australians know that this new legislation is simply designed to distract from the carbon tax hit to families, which will go up every year. Labor is once again playing at divisive, class based politics. This is not a battlers' budget in the way that the Howard and Costello budgets were. Labor has proven time and time again that it supports recklessly throwing money away to give a handout and not a hand-up to hard working Australians. Under this government the focus has been on dividing the Australian people as opposed to being aspirational. This government have shown time and time again that they are not behind the average aspirational Australian family. Instead, they are focused on dragging down those families who attempt to support their children with high-quality education. On this issue, Labor's track record is telling. In the 2008 budget, Labor means-tested the family tax benefit so that any family where the main income earner has income of more than $150,000 lost the benefit. In the same budget, Labor introduced a means test on the baby bonus, which meant that the baby bonus went only to families with an adjusted taxable income of $75,000 or less in the six months after the birth of a baby. This is the equivalent of an adjusted taxable income of $150,000 a year or less. I think we can all agree that a family earning this much is not rich by any standard. An income such as this translates to the combined income of a nurse and a police officer, or a teacher and a public servant. These are the people that this Labor government has shown they are willing to abandon. I now draw the attention of the House to the numerous attacks on middle Australia from this government. In the 2009 budget, Labor attacked middle Australia by freezing the the indexation for the full payment of family tax benefits A and B, the baby bonus and the dependent spouse rebate. The people who benefit from these payments are not extraordinarily rich. They are the majority of aspirational Australian families",51
25,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown, Order! I remind the honourable member that the House is debating the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (Schoolkids Bonus Budget Measures) Bill 2012 and I would ask him to keep his remarks relevant to that bill.,53
26,Mr IRONS,Unknown,"It is a pity that you were not in the chair before, Mr Deputy Speaker Leigh, when members on the other side of the House strayed very far and distant from the subject as well. In the 2011 budget, the narrative was exactly the same. Labor froze the indexation for family tax benefits A and B and supplement payments. This is a blatant attack on every Australian, as is this legislation. In the 2012 budget, Labor cut the age of eligibility for family tax benefit part A to families with children who are 18 years of age, meaning that families with children aged 19 to 21 will no longer receive assistance through the family tax benefit, even though many children of this age remain classified as dependants and still have the same, if not higher, costs for education. While this Labor government are unwilling to assist families to educate their children, they are more than happy to take through an ever-increasing tax and levy system. The flood levy introduced by this government unashamedly relied on these families. Those earning over $100,000 pay 0.5 per cent of taxable income in excess of $50,000 and one per cent of taxable income in excess of $100,000. Labor have demonstrated that they do not care for productive, well-targeted payments that really do benefit families. From the December quarter of 2007 to the December quarter of 2011, Labor's economic mismanagement has led to price increases which have impacted on every family. That demonstrates to this House again that this bill is impacting on the economic management of this country. Electricity prices have increased by an average of 61 per cent across Australia. Gas prices have increased by an average of 37 per cent across Australia. Water and sewerage rates have increased by an average of 58 per cent across Australia. Health costs have increased by an average of 20 per cent, education costs have increased by an average of 24 per cent, the cost of food overall has increased by 13 per cent, and the amount of rent people are paying has increased by 25 per cent across Australia. This payment will not help to curb these constantly rising costs. Childcare are also continuing to rise because of Labor inattentiveness. I would like to draw the attention of the House to comments made by George Megalogenis in today's Australian newspaper. He notes that the razor-andhandout approach taken by this reckless government has taken us back us back to stimulus levels in terms of cash handoutshardly the tough budget the Treasurer has claimed. There is no doubt that all families were better off under the coalition. The Australian article noted: Family payments were 12.1 per cent of spending at the end of the Howard era in 2007-08 … By 2015-16, family payments will be less than 10 per cent of the budget for the first time on record. This is not sensible spending. It is reckless spending by a desperate government, designed to make Australian people forget the toxic carbon tax which will hit everyone and increase already rising living costs. This bill is not intended to fairly assist families; it is intended to cushion a failed budget full of toxic taxes. The coalition supported the ETR but we do not support this, because this is bad policy.",53
27,Mr FRYDENBERG,Unknown," It is my great pleasure to rise to speak on the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (Schoolkids Bonus Budget Measures) Bill 2012. Let me start by telling the House that this is bad legislation. This bill before the House is a desperate, crude, blatant cash splash designed to win votes. There is no productivity outcome for the Australian economy, there is no positive educational outcome for kids at school and there is no dividend in terms of job creation and investment in Australia. That is why we oppose it. And we oppose it because it plans to replace a perfectly viable and effective costs scheme, the education tax refund. The education tax refund was based on parents with school-age children at primary and secondary school providing receipts at the end of the financial year. They then received reimbursements for those particular educational related expenses. It was such a good scheme that the coalition took to the last election improvements. We took to the last election policies to expand this particular dividend. In fact, if you go to our election policy, under the title 'Real action plan: Reducing the pressure on families', it talks about how the Liberals will increase the education tax rebate. It said that we would 'increase the maximum rebate to $500 per year'-up $110 per year-for every child in primary school. That same document said that the Liberals and the Nationals, the coalition, would 'increase the maximum rebate to $1,000 per year'-up $221 per year-'for each child in secondary school'. What is more, we were planning to expand the eligible expenses for the rebate so that it included government nongovernment school fees; education costs for children with disabilities, like dyslexia; camps and excursions; musical instruments; extracurricular school activities, such as music, sports, dance and drama lessons; and tutoring costs, sporting fees and equipment and school photos. This education tax rebate is a targeted scheme. This is a scheme that put money in the pockets of parents who have primary and secondary school-age children. They would provide receipts. This encouraged responsibility in our system. Instead, we have this proposal before us in this Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (Schoolkids Bonus Budget Measures) Bill particularly designed to cushion the impact of the carbon tax. This is not an education related expenditure. This government is so embarrassed by its record on education, including the fact that it believes that a billion-dollar cost blowout on its computer in schools program means better educational outcomes and that spending more than $15 billion or $16 billion of taxpayers' money on overpriced school halls leads to better educational outcomes. It was wrong on both accounts. This government commissioned the Gonski review to look at how to improve educational outcomes in our schools and has done nothing in this budget to meet the recommendations of David Gonski and his committee. Instead, it has rebadged this cash handout the 'schoolkids bonus'. How ridiculous is that. There is nothing that is linked to school outcomes. This is just a desperate bid for votes. You tell me, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker: what is the connection between school outcomes and handing out cheques for $800odd for secondary students and $410 for primary students with no receipts and no and commitment by the parents that that money special will be spend on education related expenses? They have got rid of that responsibility, that accountability, that viability and that transparency in the current system. Instead, they have replaced it with this desperate, blatant cash splash. It is a bad outcome for parents and a bad outcome for taxpayers and it does not produce the educational dividend. What would have produced a better educational dividend is the policy that we took to the last election, designed, as I said, to increase the maximum rebate for parents with students at primary and secondary school and designed to expand the eligible expenses for the rebate. That would have produced a better educational outcome. So why has this government done this? Why are we having this legislation thrust upon us the morning after the budget? I will tell you why. It is because Australia is about to face an economy-wide carbon tax-the biggest carbon tax in the world. If you go to the United States, there is no cap-and-trade system. In Canada, their Prime Minister, a conservative, just won the biggest election victory in over 100 years campaigning against a carbon tax. If you go to China, you see that they are increasing their emissions by 500 per cent. But if you go to Australia, you have a Labor government which wants to burden every taxpayer and every household with higher cost-of-living expenses through a carbon tax. I can tell you from my own experience in the electorate of Kooyong that parents and households are worried about this. Small businesses are getting desperate, and they know they are not going to be compensated. That is why this government has decided, through this fictitious bill called a schoolkids bonus, to hand out money to parents, with no link to educational outcomes. I will tell you about the drycleaner in Cotham Road, Kew, who employs four people. He works six days a week. He has seen his electricity bills rise and now they are going to rise another 10 to 12 per cent on July 1 this year with the carbon tax. He does not know what to do in order to recoup those expenses. He cannot lift his prices because that will see a fall in his trade; but he can put off a worker and that will not be good for the economy. He cannot work any harder because he has a family and he works six days a week. I will tell you about the self-funded retirees in my electorate, who are under the age of 65 and have an income of around $30,000, who went to the government's own website to see what compensation they get under the carbon tax-and they get nothing. They are over $200 out of pocket and worse off every year under the carbon tax, but they do not get compensation. Under the carbon tax this government is going to be spending $3½ billion of taxpayers' money on offshore permits by 2020 and $57 billion by 2050. In my electorate people",54
28,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown, Order! I would remind the member for Kooyong of the debate before the House. The member for Kooyong will keep his remarks relevant to the bill before the House.,56
29,Mr FRYDENBERG,Unknown,"I am staying absolutely relevant, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am talking about the carbon tax because it is the motivation for the bill that is before the House right now. This is not an educationrelated bill. This does not produce better outcomes for parents and their children who are students. It does produce a cash bonus for their pocket which will not necessarily be used on educational outcomes. The reason is the carbon tax. That is the only reason. Mr Acting Deputy Speaker Leigh, you know that there is no job creation in just giving a handout to parents with school-aged children. The last time this government gave cash bonuses, during the GFC, 16,000 dead people received their $900 bonuses. How many ineligible people will receive this cash bonus? The current scheme, which the coalition strongly supports, is all about giving parents money after they have spent their own hard-earned dollars on educationrelated expenses and provided the ATO with the receipts at the end of the financial year. That is the current system which we were in favour of improving. Instead, this government has designed to remove that existing system so that it can cushion the pain and the blow of the carbon tax. Deloittes have done studies that have found that over 23,000 people will lose their jobs in my own state of Victoria. Jobs will not be created. Billions of dollars will be sucked out of the economy. I have told you about my own experience with small business and self-funded retirees. They are not going to get this cash bonus-this fictitious schoolkids bonus-but they will be paying higher costof-living expenses. This Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (Schoolkids Bonus Budget Measures) Bill is part of a rotten budget. It is part of a budget which has forecast an increase in unemployment to 5.5 per cent, which has ripped more than $5 billion out of Defence and which insufficiently supports the National Disability Insurance Scheme. It is part of a budget which has lifted the debt ceiling from $250 billion to $300 billion-four times the amount that existed under the Howard government. It is part of a budget which has told us that last year's budget deficit has ballooned from $22 billion to $44 billion. That is why this educational mechanism, this schoolkids bonus, is so wrong. It is part of a broader budget which fails Australian families. It is a budget which abolishes company tax cuts for small and big business, which makes people pay more for aged care and which will see Australia's debt rise to $145 billion, including an interest bill of $8 billion a year or $22 million a day. Mr Gonski was talking about an extra $5 billion dollars to provide better educational outcomes. Hang on! Isn't the interest bill for the Australian taxpayer now $8 billion-the cost of an NDIS; the cost of five teaching hospitals; or the cost of real educational change? You get educational change by putting the budget in the black, not by running up massive deficits. In fact, the four largest deficits in the history of the Australian nation have been in the last four years under Wayne Swan-a total of $174 billion. One of my heroes, Margaret Thatcher, a reformist prime minister, said: 'The problem with socialism is you eventually run out of other people's money.' That is what we are seeing from this government. That is why I am against this cash handout, this 'cash splash' which is a desperate bid for votes. It is not designed to boost productivity, it is not designed to create jobs and encourage investment, and it is not designed to improve educational outcomes. We want to go back to responsible fiscal management. We want to look after those students who are at school and whose educational outcomes we care about. WYATT ROY (Longman) (11:52): Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, before I begin today, let me use this as the first available opportunity in this place to express my deepest sympathy and my community's deepest sympathy for the young girl who was tragically stabbed in my electorate this morning. She attended St Columban's College, which I am proud to say is a great local school. It is a school that I have a strong involvement with. It has great students, great staff and a great sense of community. This is, obviously, a very dark and difficult day for the school community and for the community at large. In this place I want to record my sympathy and the community's sympathy for the young girl, and our thoughts are with her family, with her friends and with the school. I rise to speak today on the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (Schoolkids Bonus Budget Measures) Bill 2012 and to voice my sincere disappointment with, and objection to, this bill. Last night the Labor government disappointed millions of Australians with their cook-the-books budget. It is a budget which many Australians had high expectations for but were miserably disappointed with. One of the major disappointments for Australians, including the people in my electorate of Longman, was Labor's announcement that they are dumping the education tax refund, instead, give handouts of taxpayers' money, borrowed money, in a desperate bid to improve their electoral stocks. As I have said in this in this place before, the government has a record of wasting taxpayers' hard earned money. Its record of waste and mismanagement is a mile long with pink batts, school hall rip-offs and border protection blow-outs, to name just a mere few. Now, the Labor government has abandoned the education tax rebate. It was a targeted program that provided genuine assistance to relieve education costs for parents. This government has ripped out a program that not only ensured that the education needs of students were met but also provided genuine relief to the many families in my electorate and around Australia. They are families who are struggling with the escalating cost of computers, textbooks, workbooks and subject-specific resources. They are families who are trying to give their kids the best possible start in life, which is the very best thing a parent can do. They are parents who are doing everything they can to live within their means, but want to provide for their kids. Now, this program has borne the brunt of the consequences of this Labor government's waste and mismanagement and has become the latest victim of another dodgy Labor budget. As the dust settles Australians will be able to see the truth. This Labor government is making its best effort to hide and distract from the pain that everyday Australians are feeling. This Labor government is trying as hard as it can to increase taxes, including the biggest of them all: the carbon tax. Any pretence of this new policy being about offsetting education costs has been dispelled. What we have before us today, what we have here in this place in this debate, is an instant sugar hit, a one-off hit for families, that is designed to help with a smoke-and-mirrors budget being delivered by this incompetent Labor government. It is a sugar hit being delivered before the end of this financial year to help dodgy the books and to deliver a fanciful surplus. Let us talk about what this policy is not. It is not genuine relief for families to compensate for the enormous imposition of the carbon tax. This policy is not a carefully considered targeted measure that will reach families who need the assistance most. It is a careless blanket splash of cash, and there is no limit in the way it can be spent. In fact, this Labor government is recklessly promoting the policy by saying that families will be eligible to receive it even if they lose their receipts. It fails to explain that every eligible family will get the money regardless of whether they keep their receipts or not. This is an indiscriminate and careless sugar hit. I am extremely concerned about the long term consequences of this $820 sugar hit to families. As a young person I am continually aware of the long-term implications of debt. It is a debt, it seems, that people of my generation will be paying off for the extent of our lives. It is a debt incurred in just four years of Labor. The irony in this situation is that these young people, whose families will receive the $820 bonus, will be the very ones who will be faced with this interest bill. The very people this bill seeks to address and help will actually be hurt by the borrowings of this Labor government. They are the very ones who will be contending with the consequences of this over their lives. I challenge those opposite with this: would the young people of the Australia prefer the security and stability of a healthy economy of a country that is not left with the burden of generations before who are unable to live within their means, or would they prefer the burden that comes with paying down an enormous debt: a difficulty in purchasing their own home and partaking in the Australian dream? I suggest that they would prefer the security and stability of a healthy economy and a healthy budget, one that has not been used to deliver a sugar hit to produce the appearance of a wafer-thin surplus. What we are seeing with this budget and what we have seen with this sugar hit is one of the most blatant attempts at cooking this year's budget books, in order to allow Labor to protect its artificial surplus next financial year as the refund will be paid out before the end of this financial year. I propose that Australians deserve better. They deserve a government that is upfront and honest with its people, one that can live within its means, one that does not need to resort to smoke and mirrors to manage its books and one that does not cook its books. The coalition understand families. We know that families with school aged children have large costs. The best way to ensure that money is spent on our kids is through the now abolished education tax refund system. We believe that this was a regime that ensured taxpayers' money was given only to families who actually spent money on education costs. It delivered the relief to families who relied upon it and who were making sacrifices for their kids' education to give them every opportunity in life. We believe that this could have gone even further. The coalition took a very strong policy to the last election-a policy that vastly expanded the number of school expenses items that would be eligible and increased the rebate amounts. We understand that parents have been looking for practical relief for real expenses. The coalition's plan would have provided a rebate to families of $1,000 for each secondary-school-age child and $500 for each primary-school-age child. By contrast, we are seeing with Labor's scheme $820 for secondary-school-age children and $410 for primary-school-age children, leaving a family with two children-one secondary and one primarysome $270 a year worse off. The coalition's policy was more money better targeted and it went straight to those families who needed it most. Labor continues to borrow more and more money. While some parents might benefit this year, it will be their children who will have to repay this Labor debt for years into the future. Australians will not be fooled by this sugar hit. They know that Julia Gillard is not interested in helping families and is interested only in keeping her own job. An eligible family with an 18-year-old in year 12 may get a sugar hit, but that will not last as long as the student when they get hit and slammed by hundreds of dollars in compulsory student union fees when they go to university. This Labor government is addicted to more spending and higher taxes. To put in perspective what this bill is trying to hide, let me have a closer look at this year's budget. What we have seen in this year is a predicted deficit of $23 billion blowing out to a delivered deficit of $44 billion-the fourthlargest deficit our country has ever seen, delivered in order by a Labor government. What does this amount to? A record net debt level of $145 billion and an interest repayment of $8 billion a year. This is what the young people of Australia will have to pay off for the reckless waste of just four years of Labor. They have taken away real means that would have given real assistance to families to deliver on their kids' futures and have instead given a political announcement and a sugar hit. This is why I will strongly oppose this bill. I encourage all members of this House to stand up against this Labor government's attack on working families. Thank you.",56
30,Mr SYMON,Unknown," I speak in support of the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (Schoolkids Bonus Budget Measures) Bill 2012. This is a particular subject that I have always spoken on in this place. In fact, the old education tax refund goes back to 2008. I spoke on that bill at the time and subsequently in 2011, when the education tax refund was adjusted to include school uniforms. But, having heard some of the debate here this morningespecially the contributions coming from the opposition benches-I really do wonder if many of these members have ever gone out and spoken to their constituents about school costs. Although the education tax refund was a very good scheme, it did not cover all the costs of sending children to school, and anyone who has children at school would know that. Although it covered books and stationery, although it covered computer items and equipment, although it even covered such things as iPads, there was a big list of essential school items that were never part of that but on which parents will now be able to spend the money provided by the schoolkids bonus. The list is quite instructive. Many of us this place have children at school, and we know about these bills. There are things like the school fees you get at the start of every year or even before the start of the year. A government primary school is $250, $300 or $400 a student. A secondary school can easily be double that. That is in Victoria. And that is just the start. That was not covered under the old education tax refund, but it is most certainly what a parent would regard as an education expense. The other big one is school camps. I quite often get letters about this from parents who are a bit distressed that they cannot send their child to a school camp because they simply do not have the money. Again, under the old education tax refund that was not an allowable expense. Under the schoolkids bonus it will be. The money will be there in the bank account and, hopefully, some more kids will get to go away on camps because of payments like that. There is another one that I have spoken to quite a few constituents about over the years, and that is after-school tutoring costs, sometimes for children who need more help than they can receive in school and sometimes because they may actually be getting ahead by doing that. Again, that has not been part of what was on offer and can now have money directed to it. There are many others on the list as well. Sporting equipment is a big one. For all of us who have children at school who play sport-and that is most-things rapidly escalate beyond the school uniform. It does not take much at all for a piece of sporting equipment to set you back several hundred dollars, and they do not always last as long as you would like as kids grow bigger. There are other items. A really big expense-though not every child has themis musical instruments. A lot of schools have music programs, and that is a great thing, but in they all come with a cost. There is generally a cost for the musical instrument or the hire of it, and there is a cost for the teacher. Quite a lot of these classes are done during school with extra cost or after school with extra cost. It is a great thing. It is a wonderful component of education. But if a child is at school and decides to play the flute it is possible to rent that flute for a year. That would cost quite a few dollars. You can buy one for around $200 or $300 at the cheap end. It goes up from there. If a child chooses to play a musical instrument such as the cello, the costs can go through the roof and be four figures rather than three. And that is quite common. Again, under the old education tax refund, although that is what a lot of people would regard as an education expense, it was not part of the scheme and could not be claimed. There are other things on the list that are also important. School subject levies and levies for consumables in subjects such as woodwork and home economics are not necessarily packaged by schools in their fees in ways that could have been claimed under the old scheme. Now parents have money coming to them to provide for such items. There is a long list of others as well. Not so much in the government school sector but in the private school sector many schools raised building levies. Schools without as much money can only really finance new buildings by raising levies on parents to supplement what they get from the federal government. Again, that was not covered under the education tax refund. There are smaller costs that also were not covered-costs like library book fees. If a school charged for such services there would not be many parents who would not regard that as an educational expense. There is also the old favourite, which any of us with children at school would know, which is school photos. I am probably showing my age, but when I was at school and it was the day for photos a large number of kids would be sitting on several levels of benches with a board at the front and maybe a football. We got one black-and-white photo and it was sent home. I do not remember if there was a charge, but it may have been a dollar or two. These days school photos come as packages, and the cheapest one that my children were offered started at $30. You get folders with various different poses and the class shot, there is no cut price.",59
31,Mr Hartsuyker,Unknown,There are no front teeth too.,61
32,Mr SYMON,Unknown,"That happens at school too. If there are a number children in the household, that happens every year and it is very easy to spend up to $70 on school photos. That is part of the educational experience. If a child misses out on having their photo when everyone else in the class has their photos it is not good for them and nor is it good for their parents because it is a record of what went on at school. I regard that as an educational expense, but photos were not covered under the old scheme. Talking about the week-to-week functions of schools, there is not one parent in Australia who would not know about requests for school donations. There is always a chocolate drive, a raffle or a donation in lieu of attending on a weekend to clean out the gutters. Whatever it may be, schools need to raise money, but under the education tax refund scheme those sorts of expenses were not covered. Again, they are pretty important to the school and they are money out of the parents' pockets. Other things that are not necessarily thought of when looking at education expenses are transport costs such as bus fares. They add up, but were not covered under the old scheme. Again, most parents would say if children have to go to school on a bus it should be regarded as an educational expense. I think they are right. There are many items that are now covered but that were not covered before. That is a great thing for parents right across Australia. It is a great thing that the money is going to be paid upfront, rather than parents having to collect receipts and wait around for a refund, in some cases for more than a year depending on when the expense was incurred but and how soon the taxpayer gets to an accountant to get the paperwork done. Those expenses will now be covered-money before instead of money after is good for the family budget. Those people who think that parents with children at school will immediately run off to the pub and blow the lot, as I have heard some people in this place say, really misstate the case of those parents. Most parents of children who go to school work very hard to get the best education for their children and a little bit extra helps. I am sure, like everything in society, not every last dollar that goes to every last person will be spent on educational expenses. Some may go on other household expenses too. As it is a government payment, it is not up to the likes of me to tell a family how they should spend their money. If they direct it to education for their kids and that covers some of the expenses I have just gone through then that is a great start. I am certain that even with these payments some items on the long list of expenses that were not covered by the education tax refund will still not be covered for many people, but this bonus is a great help. Governments should be lending assistance to those who need it. By targeting family tax benefit A recipients the schoolkids bonus does exactly that. There will be high-income families that do not receive it and there will be low-income families and middle-income families that do receive it. I put it to the House: who is better able to afford to send their children to school, a low-income family or a high-income family? I suspect it is the high-income family in just about every circumstance. Producing the payment before children start the school year and the fees have to be paid is a good thing-as I said, usually school fees are not paid the year a child starts school as the bill is sent out the school wants payment before the end of the previous school year. Generally these accounts arrive a couple of weeks before Christmas, which is the worse time for a bill to arrive because of all the other Christmas expenses and the hangover in January when the credit card bill inevitably arrives. The education tax refund was a great step forward that was put in place by a Labor government. I think the schoolkids bonus is an even better step forward. Waiting around for your receipts to be checked and for the tax office to send a refund was an improvement, but now there is a better way of doing that. I have seen people coming into this place today to talk about how this money could be spent, which I think only devalues how parents will spend it. Money that is directed towards their children's education is not only an investment in that family's future but also an investment in Australia's future. I commend the bill to the House. Mrs ANDREWS (MCPherson) (12:14): I rise to speak on the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (Schoolkids Bonus Budget Measures) Bill 2012. I, along with many Australians, am very much aware of the costs associated with educating children. It does not matter whether the school is a government school, a faith based school or a private school; we all know that there are significant costs associated with educating our children. If taxpayer money is to be spent by government for the purposes of assisting with educating children, then it is essential that the money goes to where it is intended and that the recipients of that money-for example, parents-are accountable for how and where that money is spent. The Labor government has made it clear that families will be eligible for the payment even if they lose their receipts. What does this actually mean? More importantly, what and does it mean in practice? What does it mean for the implementation of this program? To me, it means that, if there is no requirement to produce receipts for expenditure on education, that money could be spent on anything. Without receipts there is no way to verify proper expenditure and there is no meaningful way to audit the expenditure of taxpayer money. So how can this government guarantee that the objectives of this policy are being achieved by the means? The answer is quite clearly that it cannot. There is virtually no accountability for recipients under this program. Taxpayer money must not be used inappropriately and it must not be squandered. It must be used very wisely and, quite frankly, I do not believe that the program that is being proposed by the Labor government has sufficient checks and balances in place to qualify as an appropriate or wise use of taxpayer money. It is disappointing to see that there is another very ill-thought through move from this Labor government that bears the hallmarks of a desperate move to raise its political fortunes. The government intends to abandon the education tax refund, a targeted program specifically developed and designed to give assistance to parents to relieve the increasing costs of education. The education tax refund allows for a refundable tax offset for eligible education expenditure up to $794 for primary-school studies and $1,588 for secondary studies. Items such as home computers and laptops as well as related accessories such as USBs, internet connections, software, textbooks, other printed learning material and even prescribed trade tools for secondary-school trade courses have all been covered by the refund. I listened to the member for Deakin criticise the scope of the items that were covered, but surely if the scope of the items was the issue you would add additional items, not scrap the entire program and replace it with a cash payment system where no receipts are required. Not satisfied with the incentive the refund provided for families to invest in their child's education, this government will now promote a policy which removes any idea of sensibly offsetting education costs and merely creates a sideshow, an attempted diversion from the ever-rising costs of living that affect all facets of our lives. I will more about this later, and about how hard the cost-of-living increases are hitting families and will continue to do so, particularly in light of the introduction of the carbon tax. Cost-of-living increases certainly impact on our children's education. All this measure forms is an obvious attempt to prop up the government's electoral hopes on an artificial surplus, with the refund to be paid out before the end of this financial year. Apparently this government has no wish to make things easier for parents who place a high value on their child's education or on equipping Australian students with the best possible start in their schooling careers. This measure is merely just another example of tricky accounting when the Australian people are demanding transparency and real action. However, the coalition understands that there are many families with school-age children who are currently burdened with large costs. The best way to lighten their load was through the education tax refund, which ensured that taxpayer money was given only to families who actually spent the money on education expenses. The coalition took a policy to the last election that would have vastly expanded the number of expense items that could be claimed, and increased rebate amounts, including a rebate to families of $1,000 per secondary-school-age child, and $500 for each primary-school-age child. This is in contrast with Labor's scheme, which provides $820 for secondaryschool-age children and $410 for primaryschool-age children. The coalition's policy was clearly better targeted and would have gone to families who needed it most. But the record stands clear. This Labor government, since its election, has been attacking middle Australia. Labor means tested the family tax benefit B in 2008 so that any family where the main income speak earner earned more than $150,000 lost the benefit. Labor froze indexation for the full payment of family tax benefits A and B, the baby bonus and the dependant spouse rebate in 2009. Labor froze indexation for family tax benefits A and B supplement payments in 2011. In the budget handed down last night, Labor cut the age of eligibility for family tax benefit part A for families with children who are 18 years old, meaning families with children aged 19 to 21 will no longer receive assistance through the family tax benefit. We should make no mistake here: Labor is most definitely assaulting the well-being of middleclass Australians, and the removal of the education tax rebate is just another blow at a time when it is least needed. What is hurting parents most is the increasing cost of living, and under Labor this has gone well beyond the norm. Electricity prices have gone up by 61 per cent; gas prices have gone up by 37 per cent; water and sewerage rates have gone up by 58 per cent. Families are struggling and I do not believe the government is doing anything to help. In fact, Labor are making a bad situation worse for families with their carbon tax, which starts on 1 July this year. The carbon tax is a new $9 billion a year tax-an immediate 10 per cent increase in electricity bills for the next year alone and a nine per cent increase in gas bills. When you couple the effects of the carbon tax with the other 25 new or increased taxes introduced since Labor were elected in 2007, and the continued pressure of cost-of-living increases, is it any wonder that our families are crying out for help? However, the coalition has a strong appreciation for education and for families and the contributions that they make to our communities. To find out more about the pressures that are being placed on our students and their parents, as well as the many schools in the local community, I hosted a forum last week for nongovernment school principals with my colleagues the member for Sturt and the member for Moncrieff so that the educators could raise any concerns that they had with the Gonski review or any other elements of the education system. The conversation was certainly most enlightening. Many of the schools discussed the need for certainty in funding and their concern with the suggestion that NAPLAN could possibly be used as a tool to determine the allocation of resources and funding for schools. This point should be made clear: schools do not want a NAPLAN tested funding regime that in the long term may prove inequitable for the schools that need that funding. The purpose of NAPLAN testing is as a diagnostic school to assist schools and teachers in targeting their learning techniques, and it most certainly should remain that way. I would like to thank the principals from my electorate and also those from further north, in the Moncrieff electorate, who attended the forum and gave my colleagues and me some very valuable feedback with regard to what is in the best interests of their school community and what is currently hurting students and their parents the most. There is no question that our schools deserve our support. They are not only institutions where children are given life skills and knowledge of the world around them; they also serve as a dual service as social hubs for the community. When school hours are over, many community groups use the premises for meetings. Sometimes they are social gatherings and sometimes they are other classes or functions held in the school buildings. They provide fun days out and opportunities for many residents in the local community. I note that many of the religious schools-and I have a number of faith based schools in my electorate-also open their facilities to worshipers on days of worship or religious holidays and provide a location for the community to congregate. So schools are clearly a key building stone to what constitutes the Australian way of life. I am certainly very proud to have more than 30 schools in my electorate, ranging from the Queensland-New South Wales border all the way up to the northern part of my electorate, near Merrimac. Some of those schools are quite small and only have 100 or so students, but there are also schools which are very large and have well over 2,000 students. Throughout the year I attend many functions and events held by schools in my electorate and I am always impressed by the professionalism of the staff, the quality of the teaching and the conduct of the students when I visit those schools. I am consistently told by parents from each of those schools that they want choice in deciding where to send their children and they want an opportunity to send their children to schools without being penalised by the government. I believe the measures that the government is seeking to introduce will do more harm than good in the long term. The education of our future generations is certainly not something that can be played with for political buoyancy. It is disappointing to find members of the opposite side of the House advocating for such a reckless measure that will leave families and students worse off. Education in Australia should be encouraged. I will fight to ensure that the families and schools in electorate of MCPherson receive the assistance that they need so that they can give their students the tools needed for the future. I have spoken in this place on a number of occasions about the importance of education. A school student's education can last over 13 years. In Queensland we currently have prep to year 12, but a number of schools offer an additional pre-prep year. From preschool children through to adult learners, participants in education have greater opportunities to build their self-awareness and confidence. The years that students spend at school are clearly their formative years. I believe that we have an obligation to provide each student with the opportunity to develop and succeed not only at school but socially and to develop the skills that will take them from their childhood through to young adulthood and beyond. What makes a quality education experience is not as simple as a cash payment for which there is little or no accountability-a payment that will be made with no requirement to produce a receipt for education expenditure. I want to see good educational outcomes for our students at all levels, from school through to tertiary education. On the Gold Coast I believe that we are well placed to be Australia's education capital, and I have spoken about that on a number of occasions in this place. We have several university campuses, two of which are located in my electorate of MCPhersonBond University and Southern Cross University, which has a large campus at Bilinga that is currently undergoing expansion. We have TAFE colleges and numerous registered training organisations. As I have said before, there are more than 30 schools in my electorate alone. I consult widely with principals, teachers, parents and the students, and I agree with them that the objective is a good quality education outcome. If I were assessing the Labor government's education policy, I would assess it as a fail.",61
33,Mr MATHESON,Unknown," I rise today to speak on the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (Schoolkids Bonus) Bill 2012 because I believe that we should be redefining the education tax rebate system rather than handing out taxpayer money as a cash bonus. It is obvious that Labor's announcement to dump that education tax rebate and to give out handfuls of taxpayer money is a desperate bid to win votes-nothing more; nothing less. If I did not know any better it would sound like cash for votes to me! It has taken the broader community less than 24 hours after the budget announcement to work this out. This ploy will not work with the people of Macarthur, who understood the importance of the education tax rebate, a targeted program that provided genuine assistance to relieve education costs for parents. If this government was serious about supporting parents in Macarthur they would not be dumping this rebate and replacing it with a sugar-coated payment to try and win votes. We all know that this new program is designed to distract from the carbon tax hit to the cost of living, which will go up and up every year. Residents in Macarthur are not stupid; they know that prices will continue to rise as a result of the carbon tax, and a cash payment before July this year just is not going to cut it. Labor's new policy is a bad policy. It is not about offsetting education costs; it is simply a sugar hit for families to create a diversion from increased bills and costs, which will rise come 1 July. Labor is recklessly promoting this measure but they do not spruik the fact that parents do not have to spend this payment on their children's education. They can spend it on anything they like; there is no accountability. How can the government genuinely claim that this cash splash will be spent on the educational needs of our children? They cannot. How can they guarantee that the money will be spent for the purpose it was given? They cannot. I have heard a number of members speak today. Some of them are in dreamland or away with the pixies. Some of the members were talking about low socio-economic backgrounds and money being put upfront for people to spend on their children's education. Have a look at the last cash splash leading up to the last election. Go around and ask the publicans and the clubs how much their profits went up for that period of time. There is no guarantee that this money will be spent on each child's educational needs. A number of members have mentioned a number of issues in relation to alcohol and drugs and many other things. I am sure that a significant amount of this money will be wasted and not spent for the purpose it was given. As part of its plan Labor has removed the cash incentive for parents to invest in their children's schooling needs. Ultimately, this will be counterproductive for our schoolkids. Yes, parents in Macarthur are struggling and need all the help they can get but the carbon tax is going to hit them hard, and a lump sum sugar payment will not sweeten the deal. And why do you think this payment is being made before 30 June this year? This is one of the most blatant attempts to cook this year's budget books in order to allow Labor to protect its artificial surplus next financial year, because the refund will be paid out before the end of this financial year. The coalition knows that families with schoolaged children have large costs, and Macarthur families are no different. But the best way to ensure money is spent on our kids is through the now abolished education tax refund system. This was a regime that ensured taxpayer money was given only to families who actually spent money on education costs and the needs of their children. The coalition took a policy to the last election that vastly expanded the number of school expense items that were eligible through the rebate, and increased the rebate amounts. We did this because we know that parents need better assistance. The coalition's plan would have provided a rebate to families of $1,000 for each secondary school-aged child and $500 for each primary school-aged child. By contrast, Labor's scheme provides much less-only $820 for secondary school-aged children and $410 for primary school-aged children-leaving a family with two children some $270 per year worse off than our policy. Perhaps this government should have paid attention to the coalition's policy, which was for more money, better targeted to go straight to those families who needed it most. If, as the government suggests, people are slipping through the cracks and not claiming their education tax refund we should simplify the system and promote an awareness program through the schools and possibly the P&C organisations. It is not too hard to put out a few newsletters at the start of the year, the middle of the year and at the end of the year, to notify parents how they can claim the rebate for the educational needs of their children. It would be simple, one would think. What about school newsletters, as I mentioned, at the beginning of the year and just before tax time? Families need to know that they could receive just as much money, if not more, under coalition policy, by claiming the education tax rebate. Not only is the money accountable; it ensures that the education needs of our children are addressed. Labor says it is supporting our families and their children but who do we think will be repaying their debt in the future? I cannot just sit by as Labor continues to borrow more money, because while some parents might benefit this year, it will be their children will have to repay Labor's debt for years into the future, and that is not right. I brought up my two daughters in Macarthur. My wife and I worked hard to support our family, and I can tell you that a long-term plan like the education tax rebate system would have been much more of a helping hand than this sugar coated payment followed by a hike in all of our bills due to the carbon tax. The people of Macarthur will not be fooled by this sugar hit. It is a senseless cash splash for more votes. Residents in my electorate know that this Prime Minister is not interested in helping local families; she is only interested in keeping her own job. Macarthur parents supporting students studying for the HSC need to know that while they may get a sugar hit in June that will not last long, because their child will then get slammed by hundreds of dollars in compulsory student union fees. If you ask me, this is just another example of Labor attacking middle Australia. The Schoolkids Bonus is not about helping local families; it is about throwing money at people before they get hit with the world's biggest carbon tax. It is merely a distraction: a quick, shortterm sugar hit to distract people from a carbon tax that will keep on hitting them time and time again. Labor's claim that they support Australian families is farcical. Just take a look back through history. In the 2008 budget Labor introduced a means test on the baby bonus which limited the baby bonus to families with an adjusted taxable income of $75,000 or less in the six months after the birth of a baby. This is the equivalent of an adjusted taxable income of $150,000 a year or less. In the 2009 budget, Labor froze indexation for the full payment of family tax benefits A and B, the baby bonus and the who dependant spouse rebate. Labor also announced that from the 1 July 2009 the income test for the Commonwealth seniors health card would include income from superannuation streams with a taxed source and salary that are sacrificed to superannuation. They subsequently backed down after community outrage. In the 2011 budget, Labor froze indexation for family tax benefits A and B supplement payments. In MYEFO Labor cut the baby bonus from $5,400 to $5,000 and froze indexation of the payment for three years. In the 2012 budget Labor cut the eligibility for family tax benefit part A to families with children who are 18 years, meaning families with children aged 19 to 21 will no longer receive assistance through the family tax benefit. And what about the flood levy? Those earning over $100,000 were forced to pay 0.5 per cent of taxable income in excess of $50,000 and one per cent of taxable income in excess of $100,000. In my electorate, a retiring police officer was forced to remain in the workforce to avoid a $6,500 hit to his superannuation because of this tax as he was receiving a lump sum payment in that financial year. He was unwell and wanted to retire but was already paying $90,000 in tax on his super so he remained in the workforce to avoid another $6,500 loss. How is this looking after hard-working families? And do not think that residents in Macarthur have not noticed the increase in the cost of living under this government. How can you claim to be supporting Australian families when so many of them cannot afford to pay their electricity bills? There are people in my electorate on low incomes or in the welfare system who are waiting up to three months for $30 vouchers to assist them with their electricity bills. Let us look at Labor's record from the December quarter of 2007 to the December quarter of 2011. Electricity prices have increased by an average of 61 per cent across Australia. Gas prices have increased by an average of 37 per cent across Australia. Water and sewerage rates have increased by an average of 58 per cent across Australia. Health costs have increased by an average of 20 per cent across Australia. Education costs have increased by an average of 24 per cent across Australia. The cost of food overall has gone up by 13 per cent across Australia. The amount of rent people are now paying has increased by 25 per cent across Australia. When is this government going to realise that the people of this country are not stupid? They can see through the smoke and mirrors. They can see through the financial trickery. We have a government saying that they are saving money, controlling their spending and reducing debt. What sort of message are they really sending to the people of Australia when they are increasing their borrowing ceiling from $250 billion to $300 billion? There are plenty of people in the community asking that question. This government just keep on spending and keep on taxing. The people of Macarthur know that this is a 'cook-the-books' budget, with the artificial surplus based on fiddled figures and money shuffles. The Treasurer lives in Wayne's World. It does not exist; it is only in his mind. The $1.5 billion surplus is a mirage-the closer you look, you realise it does not exist. Local families know that a cash payment on 30 June is not going take away the carbon tax pain that begins on 1 July. The education rebate tax should not have been dumped by this government. It was a silly mistake. Spending taxpayers' money on these payments with no accountability of how the money is spent is not fair to the hard-working people of Australia who pay their taxes on a daily basis. If the money is to be spent on the education of our children then redefining the education tax rebate would have been a much more effective way to do it than these lump sum payments that will only plunge this country further into debt. We are currently paying $8 billion interest each year on our national debt. This could easily pay for the National Disability Insurance Scheme the people of Australia are waiting for. The people of Macarthur can see what is happening here. They can see that this cash payment is nothing but an attempt to distract them from the carbon tax and the painful price hikes that it will cause. And while this government claims to be supporting Australian families, it will be future generations of this country that will have to repay the billions of dollars in debt caused by this government's wasteful spending and incompetence.",65
34,Mr BRIGGS,Unknown," It is a pleasure to rise and speak against the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (Schoolkids Bonus Budget Measures) Bill 2012 as the member for Macarthur did so well just now. It was an excellent contribution on behalf of his constituents, who he understands very well. He also understands that this sugar-hit bill for the carbon tax that is about to hit Australian families will not work because Australian families no longer trust the government, which told them that there would be no carbon tax in the first place. Directly before the last election, members of this House will know, the Prime Minister said on Channel 10 that 'there will be no carbon tax under a government I lead'. Of course, we are now just days and hours away from that carbon tax coming into place. So this bill that we are debating today, which being rushed on by the government, has had no government speakers on it because it is so hard to justify, even from the government's perspective. Government members do not want to be on the record justifying what attempt to provide a sugar hit. Ms King: The member for Deakin just spoke on this bill.",69
35,Mr BRIGGS,Unknown,"Minister, you are entitled to speak on the bill. Your name is not on the list. There are no Labor members' names on the list. There is a good reason for it. You are ashamed of what you have done to Australian families and what you are about to do to Australian families with your world's biggest carbon tax-a carbon tax you promised would not be implemented. I say to the minister, if she wants to speak on this the bill, she should stand up after I finish my contribution and speak on this bill, represent those people from Ballarat, tell them why she supports this carbon tax, tell them why she wants this carbon tax to increase their costs and tell them why this is just an attempt by this government to try and sugar coat what is the nastiest pill that Australian families have faced in a very long time. Last night we saw the Treasurer's fifth budget delivered. Each budget in this place has some sort of narrative to it and it tells a story about the government's direction. Last night what we saw was a budget which was about trying to enhance the electoral stocks of this Prime Minister and this government. It was a last-gasp effort to try and get a boost in the polls, to hold back the movement of MPs on the government benches. The member for Griffith may be their last salvation-the person who they so abused not too long ago and who they will no doubt, in just a little while, turn to when this sugar hit of the electoral prospects also fails. Last night we saw a budget which was built on a is house of cards. I suspect the Treasurer does not think he will ever have to implement it, because the forecasts in it are so unbelievable-you would have fairies at the bottom of the garden to expect that the is an expectations in that budget of revenue increases, for instance, will be met. I note that the Australian journalist Adam Crichton, who understands this far better than most, has written an article today about the biggest increase in tax receipts in three decades; that the expectation in the budget is that somehow, while growth will be a trend, there is going to be an enormous growth of 12 per cent in the next financial year of receipts-government receipts, taxation receipts-to create this falsehood of a surplus. We know that last year the government forecast there would be a deficit in last year's budget of $22 billion. If we refer to the budget papers, which were tabled last night, we see that that blew out to $44 billion. We are now expected to believe that this government can manage the budget back from a $44 billion deficit-which followed on from a $47 billion deficit which followed on from a $54 billion deficit which followed on from a $27 billion deficit-and that somehow it is going to turn around some $45 billion in one financial year, no doubt through a whole lot of trickery in the budget papers, and it is going to stop wasting Australian taxpayers' money when all it has done in its five years of government is just that. We see it again with this piece of legislation, one which is trying to overturn the whole intent of the original education tax refund; a proposal, as the member for Macarthur put so well, that the opposition sought to improve at the last election. In fact, at the last election the government opposed what we were trying to do because it would not address the educational needs of Australian children. Now people will be handed cash with no expectation at all that they will spend it on education expenses. Indeed, what this cash bonus is all about is for people to be able to pay their soaring electricity bills. The government knows that it has to bribe and compensate people for the pain that it is about to inflict. This is no longer about assisting educational outcomes for Australian families or schoolchildren, which the opposition's policy sought to improve at the last election by expanding the number of items that this could be spent on by keeping receipts and claiming it through the taxation system, which has been a long-practised way of focusing the money. This, instead, through this piece of legislation, is attempting toand I hope this legislation does not pass; I hope the Independents see that this cash hit, like the cash hit during the stimulus package back in 2008-09, will be ineffective and wasted. That is why we see a debt soaring up to $240 billion. Last night the credit card was extended: it has gone from $250 billion to $300 billion, and we know that the Labor Party will make the most of its extension, as it has each time it has extended its credit card. This bill does no more than try to find a way of compensating people for a carbon tax which is about to hit them. If this bill is seriously about education expenses, why is it being pulled forward to be delivered in June this year? Why are payments all of a sudden expected to be made in the next financial year being brought forward and why is this bill being rushed through the parliament so that money is spent in this financial year? It beggars belief. It does not require any proof that it is being used for educational purposes at all. It is an attempt to put money in people's bank accounts and hope and pray that they do not take out their anger, as we know they are, on Labor's members of parliament when we inevitably go to the next election. We know-and, thankfully, a backbench MP on the government side helpfully told a journalist off the record just two days agothat you cannot go door-knocking at the moment without being beaten up about the carbon tax. We all know: when we are in public at the moment, every time we go to a function, all people want to talk to us about is the carbon tax, the incompetence of the government, the government's judgment in backing people like the member for Dobell and standing by the member for Dobell and his use of credit cards. What is it with this party and the use of credit cards? What is it with this party and extending cards and using other people's money? What is it with this party?",69
36,Mr Katter,Unknown,Be very careful: it's the pot calling the kettle black.,71
37,Mr BRIGGS,Unknown,"It is interesting that this party does not mind wasting other people's money on all sorts of questionable expenses. I repeat: this is a bad piece of legislation because it is not following through with the original intention of the education rebate. The education rebate was to assist Australian people with educational expenses. This is an attempt to bribe and compensate people for the impact of the carbon tax, which is about to hit them, in a budget which is built on a house of cards, a budget that the Treasurer does not expect to implement because the numbers and the forecasts are so ambitious as to be unbelievable. It has been interesting to note and watch as the Treasurer has failed fundamentally to explain how it is that the ambitious forecasts in his own budget papers, which get to this pretend surplus, will somehow be delivered. We just have to look at the record. I refer again to the budget papers, which show that in every budget delivered by this Treasurer the result of the budgets have been deficits: $27 billion, $54 billion, $47 billion, $44 billion. Next year the government expects us to believe that somehow there will be a $1.5 billion surplus, a rounding error in the Commonwealth budget purposes. Just look, for instance, at the increase in spending since this government came to power: in 2007-08, the last Costello budget, the spending was $271 billion; this year it is expected to be $364 billion-near enough to a $100 billion increase in just five budgets. It is an extraordinary increase in government spending. It is an extraordinary increase in the power of the state. It is an extraordinary increase in the take from the Australian people. This is what this government does: it taxes big and it spends big. It spends more than it taxes each year. We have seen that; that is the evidence. This bill is another example of this government spending more money than it takes. It does not have an economic plan to make our country stronger and to take advantages of the once-in-alifetime opportunities we have. Its economic plan is to tax more and spend more-to waste more. We have seen how much money has been wasted. I referred earlier to the oneoff payments as part of the stimulus package. We know, for instance, how many dead people, people living overseas and people in jail received those one-off payments. During that period we also saw the money that was wasted on the pink batts scheme. We know it cost twice as much-it cost $2 billion to take out the $1 billion that the government spent. Why would this bill be any different? Why would this spend be any different? Changing the purpose of the education tax rebate in the first place to make it a cash payment is purely to try to compensate Australian families for the impact of the biggest lie that this Prime Minister has made to the Australian people. This carbon tax is the dagger at the heart of Australian families. This is an attempt to sugar-coat that pill, and it will not work. It will not work, just as this house of cards budget will not work, because we all know in this parliament that this expectation that somehow there is going to be a $45 billion turnaround from this year's deficit into a surplus next year is a flight of fancy. It is built on an extraordinarily ambitious forecast which cannot be met. It is built on the record of a government that has spent more than it has earned every year it has been in power. For five long years the Australian people have had to suffer under this Treasurer. We should never forget that when this Treasurer took the Treasury off Peter Costello, Peter Costello left this country with money in the bank, a $20 billion surplus. Surpluses of $20 billion are shown in budget papers 2006-07, 2007-08-money going into the Future Fund to plan for the future. A future fund was established so we could meet contingent liabilities as our country gets older and more people retire. All these plans and all these long-term hard decisions that were pursued by the former government and the Treasurer were undone in what seemed like a matter of weeks-in fact, it has been five long years. To expect that that is somehow going to turn around this year, to expect that somehow we are going to have these ambitious forecasts met, and that the government is going to turn it into a surplus budget, is to be ambitious at best. This bill is a bad bill. It is a bad decision to change the education tax rebate in the first place. It has been rushed because the government knows it needs to change its numbers in a hurry before the Labor Party members change their Prime Minister. We just hope that the Independent members of this hung parliament-a situation we hope never to see in this country again-decide in the best interests of our country",71
38,Mr Katter,Unknown,"It's real bad having this democracy, isn't it.",72
39,Mr BRIGGS,Unknown,"It is not working very well. It is a terrifically stable arrangement, member for Kennedy! There is no doubt about that. The country is certainly going down beautifully at the moment! We just hope that these Independent members finally wake up to themselves and decide that this government should end. This government was based on a falsehood in the first place. This carbon tax-which the Independent members of parliament helped get through this place-will do so much damage to Australian families. We hope those members finally wake up and end it before this continues; before too much more money is wasted and before future generations are damaged more than they are today. It is a bad bill. It just continues. It is a bad government. It was a bad budget last night. It is built on a house of cards that is, hopefully, going to collapse as soon as it possibly can.",72
40,Mr KATTER,Unknown," It always amazes me in my years in politics, particularly over recent years, when speakers get up and say, 'We have to get rid of this terrible government.' During the last state election campaign, I asked over 4,000 people at various meetings or talking to two or three people in the street: 'Why? What will change? In Queensland, what will change?' And I say to you: if you change governments from the ALP to the Liberal Party, what will change? In this country, what will change? I think the first thing you would say, if you were intelligent-I do not know whether you are-is the carbon tax. I would say that the carbon tax was not announced by the ALP; it was announced by the Liberal Party. John Howard said there would be an emissions trading scheme that was fully operational by 2012, and the person standing beside him when he said it was Malcolm Turnbull. The minute you got out of office you immediately became anti carbon tax. When you get back in, please excuse me for thinking you might be back on the other side of the fence. But all I can say to you is that I askedMr Craig Kelly: I've got 20 bucks on that.",72
41,Mr KATTER,Unknown,I will remember that. I am not putting 20 bucks on it because I would not trust people to do anything. Mr Craig Kelly: I'll make it $100.,73
42,Mr KATTER,Unknown,"I will take that interjection. The honourable member said that he will pay $100 if they do not abolish the carbon tax, and I will nominate the charity to which he can donate it. I asked 4,000 people what would change. They were not our supporters; this was just at meetings at the chambers of commerce or public meetings. Out of 4,000 people only four people said that anything would change. Most of them burst out laughing when I asked them what would change. It was a good idea to get rid of the Labor government in Queensland; there is no doubt about that. But what will change? Why do you change it? Nothing is going to change. One said it as a question: 'Would we get better economic management?' The other two said we would get better economic management. The fourth one said there would be an expectation that things would get better and that there would be an environment of investment that would come in Queensland. I said, 'For how long?' and he burst out laughing. Those who have been around with me can verify what was said. But there are no fundamental differences between that side and the other side. If there are, you can tell me about them when you get up to speak because I will be interested and fascinated to know what they are. But do not start on the carbon tax, because you blokes in opposition announced the carbon tax, not this mob. It is a disaster for this country-let there be no question about that. The ultimate consequence for a race of people is that they simply eliminate themselves from the gene pool; that they simply cease to exist as a race of people. I am among the first of the baby boomers; I was born in 1945. Statistically, I will die in 10 years time. I will be dead. All of the baby boomers will die in 10 years time. In 10 years time, when that occurs, there will be more deaths in this country than births. In Australia, at that point in time, we will officially become a dying race. There are people who say, 'Yes, but people will come in from overseas.' Yes they will, but they will not be Australians-they will be migrants. They will not be the race that is here now. I do not know about other people, but my forebears have been living in this country for 130 years. That is not true for everybody, but the race of people that are here will simply vanish. Before they vanish, there will be this terrible problem of half the population being very old and decrepit and having to be looked after by less than half the population-if you take out children, less than half the population will have to be looking after the old, decrepit half of the population. I was not aware of this until Dr Bob Birrell from Monash University, the leading demographer in this country, wrote a landmark article in the Weekend Australian newspaper. In that article, he said that in 100 years time the population of Australia will be between six and seven million people. I thought, 'This is ridiculous; this can't be right.' I went down to the Parliamentary Library to the demographer there and I said, 'Is this ridiculous?' and he said, 'No, you can work it out for yourself'. He said that when 20 Australians die they are replaced by 17 Australians. If you do that for five generations over 100 years, you will find that you will have a decline, a very significant decline. I went back up to my office and did the mathematics, and I was quite amazed and very worried that I now belong to a vanishing race. There are enormous, horrific costs associated with having a child. My wife and I brought up five children. I think it would impossible to keep a child for under $25,000 a year, and even in the most grinding of poverty it would still be $15,000 a year. A child is not tax deductible, as it was when we were originally bringing up our children, when it was fully tax deductible. Now, the DINKs-double income, no kids-pay the same tax as the poor beggar whose wife has to stay at home because he has got three kids, and they are trying to stay alive with four or five people on one income. It is Christmas time for the DINKs; it is horror time for those people who would love to have children, who want to see an Australia in the future and who would love to see more Australians. It is horror time for them. I enjoy immensely coming in here and tearing into the mainstream parties over economic issues and other issues, but in this case I have to say that the Liberal Party under Peter Costello-one of the worse Treasurers in Australian history, but Paul Keating will tip him out well in that racedoubled taxation and trebled the national debt. I am not referring to the government debt; Costello skited about the government balancing the budget, but it is a pity he did not take the time to think about the nation's book of account and its debt problems. He fixed his own by nearly trebling taxation while he was here, so do not let the Liberal Party ever get up and say, 'We're the lowtaxing party'. They are the highest-taxing party in Australian history. But I give Peter Costello his due. His comment, 'One for mum, one for dad and one for the country,' was a very good comment, and he did not just say it; he backed it up. There was a huge increase in the amount of money going to families having kids. It did not go back to anything like it was when I was a young father and the kids almost made our taxation negligible. We did not pay much tax at all because we had be five children. He did not go that far, but all the same he started a big movement back towards defraying the enormous prohibitive costs of having a child. The current government has continued with this and I praise them for the fact that they have provided a continuingly increasing amount of money to get to where we should be. But even this, which I refer to as $2,000 for three kids, the best way to explain it to the electorate is to say, 'If you have three kids, you will get an extra $2,000 a year'. It is not a huge amount of money but it is significant. We as a party-the KAP Party that I belong to-believe that every child must get $7,000. If we are going to turn that birthrate around then there has to be a payment for the birth-I cannot remember exactly what the figure was that we determined-with $7,000 per year per child in addition to that initial outlay, which is a very expensive item in the budget. It comes to $26,000 million-a huge budget item. But if you want to have a nation and a people with a future, and still exist as a race of people, then you had better do that and do that quickly. People say, 'Where will we get $26,000 million from?' but we have a 10 per cent customs duty on everything coming into the country, which will provide that amount of money. We can justify that, WTO neutral, because it is a customs duty not a tariff. I return to the theme of a vanishing race. We had a very large number of suicides in one of our towns. I will not repeat the name of the town. It got a lot of bad publicity at the time. I said to one of my very good friends, who is very active in my political party as well, 'How is this occurring?' because it was occurring to middle-class families. I was quite staggered when I found out who the people were, because I knew them. He said, 'What if you were a young mother and the police knocked on the door and said, ""Your kid's been throwing rocks through windows. We want him. He's going to have to be charged,"", then the next day the housing commission-Qbuild or whatever they call them; they change their name every 10 minutes these days-turns up and they say ""You're behind in your rent; we're hitting you with an eviction notice. You're going to be out on the streets,"" and you know you have to buy food for tonight but your husband's taken the money for the food and spent it on grog and if you complain he might duff you up a bit""?' My friend said, 'Really? What do you think their frame of mind is?' Let me go back to the fact that the mother cannot pay the rent. One reason, as this gentleman said, was that the father was spending it on grog. He was not referring to a specific case; he was generalising. Another reason is that they just simply have no money to pay the rent. We in Australia have three characteristics that differentiate us from every other country. One of them is that we have the highest juvenile male suicide rate in the world, consistently and continuously now for over 20 years. I have my own views on why this is occurring and I am not sure whether they are correct or not. Boys are no longer allowed to be boys. They can no longer go fishing, camping, hunting or shooting. There are no male teachers anymore in the schools. Football is not available to them; there is one to take them there or to train them. They have no male role models. Probably a third of the population of Australia now live in families where there is no father. All of things come together. One of the issues that arise, and it unfortunate in this budget, is that we say to that little mother, who is trying desperately to raise three kids after her husband selfishly walked out on her and dumped her, and she is fighting to stay alive, 'Oh, no. You're not going to get any money unless you go back to work.' Then you complain because the children are on the streets causing trouble all of the time and a lot of them commit suicide. They have no mother because the mother has to go out and work. That is what is being imposed upon people here. If you think child-care centres and the education system can raise your kids then have a look at your statistics. You have the highest male suicide rates in the world. Is there a single member in this place who does not have a complaint every single week about misbehaviour of the juvenile section of our community? That has always been there but it is infinitely worse now than it has ever been before. The honourable member for Herbert has come in. He would be well aware, in the Townsville region, of the great battle that my own party is leading, and I disagree with one aspect of this. They say that the parents should be made responsible. The parents have no disciplinary powers whatsoever now. That is another reason potential parents are not having kids. You cannot control the kids. The kids control the parents now. You cannot impose this, and Justice Wall quite rightly drew attention to it. But I say to Justice Wall, even though I love and respect the man-he is a great bloke-that without the disciplinary powers we cannot go in that direction- (Time expired) Mr CRAIG KELLY (Hughes) (13:11): I norise to speak on the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (Schoolkids Bonus Budget Measures) Bill 2012. It is always a pleasure to follow the member for these Kennedy. I hope that Hansard records and that, Madam Deputy Speaker Rishworth, you is most will be the witness to the $100 wager between myself and the member for",73
43,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown," I have to caution the member about making wagers in the House. Mr CRAIG KELLY: I am sure that the member for Kennedy, at the change of government, will gladly give me $100 for my charity, for what was said. This bill is not about a schoolkids bonus; it is all about abandoning the education tax refund, which was a targeted program that provided genuine assistance to relieve education costs for parents. It has been replaced by nothing other than a free money handout.",75
44,Mr Katter,Unknown,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I claim to be misrepresented. I never offered him $100 if they do it. I would not trust them to do it or not do it, but I most certainly accept his offer of $100!",76
45,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! I must caution members that the House is not a place for making wagers. I ask the member for Hughes to continue. Mr CRAIG KELLY: This bill is about abandoning the existing tax education refund, which was a targeted program that provided genuine assistance to relieve education costs for parents, and replacing it with nothing other than a free money handout. It is a handout that has nothing to do with education. Everyone likes to give away free money. We have seen it before from this government, thinking they could buy popularity, but they should learn from their past mistakes-this only buys very short-term popularity. And it is certainly not free money when that money has to be borrowed and when that borrowed money creates an obligation to pay interest in the future and when that borrowed money has to be repaid. The free money handout that this bill will give will only further add to our nation's debt burden that will have to be repaid by future generations of Australians. So this bill would be far better if it were renamed as not the 'schoolkids bonus' but the 'schoolkids debt burden', because that is exactly what it is. The last four Labor budget deficits have totalled a cumulative $174 billion. And even if last night's forecast $1.5 billion surplus is achieved-and I note that the online betting agencies are actually taking wagers on this and it is a very short-priced favourite that it will not happen, but let us give the Treasurer the benefit of the doubt and assume that last night's forecast $1.5 billion surplus is actually achieved-this will mean that Labor's legacy, the legacy of their last five budgets, the cumulative deficit that they will leave as a legacy to future Australians, will be $172½ billion. So, because of those last five Labor budgets leading to a cumulative $172½ billion in deficit, for years into the future, for future generations, before we have one cent to pay for the education of our children, before we have one cent to assist our children with disabilities, before we have one cent for aged care, for hospitals, for roads, for medical research et cetera-for everything that is important in this nationwe will now have to find $8 billion just to pay the interest bill on Labor's debt. And the majority of this $8 billion will actually have to be paid to foreigners, and will have to be paid year after year after year-forever, until we start paying down that debt that they have left us. How long will it take to repay Labor's debt from the last four years' budget deficits? Again, let us give the Treasurer the benefit of the doubt and assume that the betting markets have it wrong and they will actually deliver the $1.5 billion forecast surplus. At that rate, a surplus of $1.5 billion per year, it is going to take no fewer than 116 years to pay off the combined deficits that Labor has rung up in just the last four years-116 years to undo the damage of just four years. To visualise just how much $172 billion actually is, imagine a stack of $100 bills; if you were stacking piles of $100 bills on a pallet and filling that pallet up with $100 bills as high as you could go, to reach that $172 billion, that pallet would be stacked no less than 2.4 kilometres high. That is the debt mountain that this Labor government is leaving future generations. A good question to ask is, 'Why is this legislation being rushed through the parliament today? Why is it being rushed through to rebadge the education tax refund?' We all know: it is simply about throwing money at people before they get hit with the world's largest carbon tax. If you were really about helping future generations of our schoolkids, you would not be handing out free money to them. You would not be leaving them with a debt burden. The one thing that you would be doing would be protecting our nation's competitive advantages so that they could be passed on to our future generations, the schoolkids of today, so that they could enjoy the competitive advantages that we as Australians had as a nation in years gone past. As a nation, just as for a business, we can only succeed if we have a competitive advantage. A competitive advantage is our lifeblood. It is what creates opportunity. what creates prosperity. It is what we should be handing down to our future generations. It should be the sacred duty of every elected member of this parliament to do everything we possibly can to safeguard our national competitive advantage. For, although we may survive if we are just at competitive parity, if what was our advantage turns into a competitive disadvantage then as a nation we go backwards. There are many things that we suffer in Australia as competitive disadvantages. We have high labour costs, and that is something we do not want to do anything to harm. We also have the competitive disadvantage of major distances to our major markets. We also have the competitive disadvantage of our large nation-the large distances between our cities. But one of our nation's greatest competitive advantages has been our low-cost electricity supplies. Abundant supplies of high-quality black coal generating low-cost electricity-that has been one of the true national competitive advantages we have had, and it should be our sacred obligation to hand that competitive advantage on to our future generations, the schoolkids of today, who will be running our businesses and our economy tomorrow. But this Labor government, in an act of sheer economic treason, has decided to surrender this one national competitive advantage that we have by imposing upon our nation the world's largest carbon tax-a mere charade that has nothing to do with controlling global temperatures and nothing to do with the environment but which will simply raise electricity prices and sacrifice our national competitive advantage. Australians used to enjoy some of the lowest electricity prices in the world. But a recent study released by the Energy Users Association of Australia has shown that average electricity prices in Australia are It is now, unbelievably, amongst the highest in the world. And once the world's biggest carbon tax takes effect, Australian businesses and consumers will have the highest electricity prices in the world. Interestingly, in South Australia, where they often boast about having more wind turbines than anywhere else in the country, they can now also boast that they have the highest electricity prices not only in Australia but in the world. Again, this schoolkids bonus will not be directed at education; this coming winter, many families will simply have to use this money, this cash handout, to pay for their increased electricity costs so that they can keep their heaters on during winter. Another question about this bill is: why does this money have to be shovelled out before 30 June? What is so important about 30 June? What is the rush? We have heard the excuse from the Prime Minister that it was needed for the winter school term. But, if we check the school holidays, at 30 June in almost every state our school kids are still finishing off their second term, in the first two weeks of July they are on a break and they do not go back to school for the winter term, the third term of the year, until late in July. So why isn't this money handed out in the first week of July, if that is what it is really meant for? We know it has nothing to do with school kids. It is simply thrown in at 30 June so it comes in in the current year's budget and not in next year's budget, when we see an artificial surplus. So is it any wonder that we have seen the current year's deficit blow out from $22 billion? We had thought it was $37 billion but, as we heard last night, another $7 billion has been tacked onto it and we now have, in this financial year, an estimated budget deficit of $44 billion. So the reason is simply to bring that expenditure out so it sits in there: rack up the deficit for this financial year as much as we possibly can and bring all the expenditure forward to create that artificial surplus for the next year. This is one of the most blatant attempts we have seen of cooking the books to allow Labor to protect that artificial surplus for next financial year by simply paying the refund before 30 June this year. The coalition knows that families with school-aged children do have large costs, but the best way to ensure the money is spent on their kids is through the now abolished education tax refund system. This was a successful regime that ensured taxpayers' money was given only to families who actually spent it on education costs. Compare the two plans. The coalition's plan would have provided for a rebate to families of $1,000 for secondary school-aged child and $500 for each primary school-aged child. In contrast, they are being short-changed under this bill because Labor's scheme only provides $820 for secondary school-aged children and $410 for primary school-aged children, leaving a family with two children-the typical Australian family with one child in secondary school and one child in primary school-some $270 a year worse off. This bill actually makes school kids and families worse off. The coalition's policy has more money, it is better targeted and it will go straight to families who need it most. In contrast, Labor continues to borrow more money. While parents might see a short-term benefit this year, it will be their children in the future who have to pay off Labor's debt. Mr EWEN JONES (Herbert) (13:25): It is always good to follow on from my colleague the member for Hughes. I rise to speak on the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (Schoolkids Bonus Budget Measures) Bill 2012. This bill is about the government desperately trying to buy votes that it cannot afford, at the expense of good policy. There can be nothing surer than that. This bill allows for the removal of the education tax refund and replaces it with the Schoolkids Bonus: twice-yearly, lump sum payments of $410 for primary school students and $820 for high school students. The education tax refund is a targeted program that provides genuine assistance to families paying off education costs. With this bill, Labor have abandoned this measure, opting instead for a cash handout that they hope will distract families from the world's biggest carbon tax. This is not offsetting education, and no-one should be fooled by that. As the member for North Sydney and shadow Treasurer so eloquently put yesterday or the day before, it is simply 'a sugar hit for families', a distraction from increased bills and costs that will rise just for going about their everyday lives. Unlike the now defunct education tax refund, there is no requirement that this education handout be spent on schooling needs. It is just as likely to go to Dan Murphy. Once again, the Labor government have opted for a vote grab instead of good policy. On this side of the House we do support investment in a child's education and we do know that parents need better assistance. The coalition took a policy to the last election that would vastly expand the number of eligible school expense items and increase the rebate amounts. This plan would have given families a rebate of $1,000 for each secondary school child and $500 for each primary school child, some $270 more beneficial for families than what the government is proposing with this bill. Additionally, our policy was targeted to make sure that taxpayers' money was being spent where it was needed: on education costs. After its promise of a tough budget to get back to surplus, Labor's bill can be seen as nothing more than a cash-grab attempt to win votes, paid for by debt. While parents might get a handout today, it will be the children who are paying it off in the future, along with the rest of this Labor government's debt. One of the things that I found most disturbing about this whole exercise of a cash grab is that during the whole budget speech not once was the word 'productivity' mentioned. Is this the best use of our taxpayers' dollars? Is this the best way we can hand out taxpayers' dollars-just splash cash out in every way, shape and form towards an electorate that is becoming increasingly cynical about the way that we operate here? Surely we have learnt our lesson from the stimulus packages and the flood handouts, that by and large the money is not going to the places where it is actually needed. What is wrong with having to provide receipts for genuine educational costs and claiming that on your tax? What is wrong with actually having to stump up and say: 'This is what I am spending on my child's education. Can you give me a rebate for it?' What is wrong with that? What we are doing now is just giving this cash out to anyone who has a school-aged child. As long as you qualify for it, the money just goes into your account and away you go. You can do whatever you want with it. There is no onus on you to do anything with it. Having kids is not cheap. I have got three of my own and I can tell you that when they are at school, it is probably the cheapest they will be! Wait until they get out of school and they start wanting motor cars and plane trips and things like that. That is when they start to get expensive. Are we going to go down the track where we start to hand out money because our teenagers want to stay at home, or because our 20and 30-year-olds are still living at home? Are we going to start handing out cash because they will not move out of home? That is the way we are going with this government at the moment. Money is going everywhere. It is a splash for cash that just goes all about the place. We have to think about things that are more productivity based. What are we doing with our taxpayer dollars? It was Kerry Packer who stood in that joint house committee inquiry and said that he had a fundamental duty to reduce the amount of tax that he paid because governments do not spend it wisely. If you are busting your backside out there, if you are making the effort to make a difference, to create wealth and to create employment, and you pay your tax and then you turn around and see a government of any shape or form just splashing cash all over the place, you have every right to stand there and say: 'What the hell is going on here? Why should I be paying tax? Why should I be in private enterprise? Why should I be a small businessmen trying to do the best for my family and for the people who work for me, when the government does not respect the money that we give it?' My mum and dad have three boys. Two of us went to boarding school, because we did not have the option of going to a local senior high school, and my little brother went to school in Brisbane. It was not easy and it was not cheap. All the way through, my parents scrimped and saved to do what they had to do. It is the same with my kids. We have to make do with what we have. We have chosen an education system for them and we will do the best we possibly can for them because they are our children. What we do not need is a government standing out there and setting an example to us as parents that says, 'If you just hang around long enough and you don't do anything then we, the government, will give you cash.' The government will just stand there and at some stage in your life you are going to be just sitting around and you will open up the mail and there will be a $1,000 cheque from the government-just because. Just because it is your turn. Do not do anything, do not get up off your backside, do not get out there and do the extra work, do not work hard, because that is not what you are after. What we are after here at the moment is a free handout. We want free money. That is what the whole society seems to be jumping up and down about at the moment. What this budget says is that if you qualify-if you sit at home and you do not do anything-then you are going to pick up $2,190 for doing nothing. Whereas the men and women out there, and the small businesses, who are working 70-, 80or 90-hour weeks are not getting the tax refunds, they are not getting the tax cuts, and they are not getting anything out of this budget. They are the ones that should we be feeling sorry for. As a parent, you have to set an example for your children as to what it means to be a person. You have to set the parameters as to how they will behave. You have to start that very, very early. If, as parents, we allow our kids to just sit there and they see that they will be given stuff for nothing-if they do not have to do the dishes, if they do not have to clean up the yard or they do not have to clean up their bedroom-then that is the example that we set for them. As a government, we must set an example for the country. We are given a ton of money-we are given a lot of money in this place. We are taking a lot of money out of Australia and we must use it the best way possible. Handing out cheques to people all over the place is simply not the best way to do it. Everyone knows that, all the way through, this is a cover-up for the carbon tax. This is a cover-up because the carbon tax is coming in. This is a cover-up because the world's biggest carbon tax is going to hit absolutely everyone. The Treasurer stood there last night and said: 'It is only the big emitters that pay it.' But it is not the big emitters that pay it, because they will just pass it on. It is the people who are at the bottom of the pile who will pay it. It is the ratepayer, it is the wage earner, it is the pensioner and it is the sole parent: those are the people who will pay with this carbon tax at every level. Every time you turn an electric light on, every time you open your fridge, every time you buy something you will be using electricity-and it is a tax on electricity. If you want to compensate people, do it by getting rid of this toxic tax. In Townsville-and they are using the Treasury's own figures-it is going to cost the Townsville City Council $5 million in carbon tax to run the dump because of the greenhouse gases. Mrs D'Ath: Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The member has strayed significantly from the content of this bill I ask that he be brought back to it.",76
46,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown," The member for Herbert will make his comments relevant to the bill before the parliament. Mr EWEN JONES: Mr Deputy Speaker, my points are relevant. They go to the way that this money is being handed out and to the way that this government is throwing money around. They are therefore relevant. We have to look at the way we are teaching our children. We have to look at the way that we as a government and we as a parliament are handling money on behalf of the Australian community. To stand here in this House and tell people that the best way that we can use your tax dollar is to send cheques out in the mail is a slap in the face for those people who are trying their best. This is what it is about: we have to make sure that we as a parliament are working our hardest to justify the people's faith in us. Is there any doubt out there that we are held in such low esteem at the moment because of the way that we are handling money? Is this the most productive way of handling money? Is this the most productive use of taxpayer dollars? If this is the best that the government can do, then I suggest that it go back to the drawing board and start again. This bill is a pox on both our houses. This bill is not good policy. This bill does not make sense. This bill is doomed to failure and this money will not be spent where it should be spent. I thank the Deputy Speaker for his indulgence. Mrs PRENTICE (Ryan) (13:36): Mr Deputy Speaker, at 9.26 this morning, the Gillard Labor government introduced this bill, the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (Schoolkids Bonus Budget Measures) Bill 2012. This policy was first announced in a preplanned, pre-budget and leak only a couple of days ago by the Treasurer, the member for Lilley. The coalition supports Australian families, but we must consider today's bill in the context of the worse budget, the worse Treasurer and the worse government this nation has ever seen. Today, it can be plainly seen that instead of rushing this bill through for the benefit of Australian families and for the education of our children, the Gillard government seeks to rush it through for only the basest political reasons, which I will outline today. The coalition has a proud history of supporting Australian families. The family tax benefit system was itself reformed by the Howard government to support hard working Australian families and to ensure that parents of school children received adequate support from the government to which they pay so much tax. The coalition under the Howard government made sure that parents with schoolchildren as well as parents with only one income earner were looked after. From 1 January next year, under this bill, families will receive $820 for each high school child and $410 per primary school child. These payments will go to families who are eligible for family tax benefit A. Under this program families will not be required to keep an account of what the money is spent on; indeed, they can effectively spend it on anything they like, whether or not it is related to education. This bill would be completely unnecessary if Australian families had a competent government. Australians have a very important question for the Treasurer: where has he directed the hard earned tax dollars of Australian families in the four years that he has been Treasurer of this nation? We know that he has not directed it towards programs delivering effective outcomes for Australian families. Under the member for Griffith, and the current Prime Minister and the current Treasurer, hard earned taxpayer money has been spent on government programs which were failures from start to finish. These failures amount billions and billions of wasted dollarsmoney which would have been better spent in the hands of individuals and families. I remind the House again of the pink batts fiasco, which resulted in the deaths of Australians. I remind the House of the Building the Education Revolution scheme, which directed funds to building school halls at schools already scheduled for closure. I remind the House of the hard earned taxpayers' money spent on an inefficient solar rebate program, which was not only economically inefficient but also did almost nothing for environmental outcomes. How can we forget the unnecessary and exorbitant cost of giving set-top boxes to pensioners at a cost higher than that of a whole new television? Nor have we forgotten the $900 in stimulus payment which was sent to both people living overseas and people who are dead. How can we have confidence in this latest effort at pork-barrelling? Inefficiency is the hallmark of this government, and Australian families have suffered under its incompetence since 2007. As a result of its profligacy and incompetence, the Gillard government had even before last night introduced 19 new or increased taxes. This government has turned $70 billion of net worth into accumulated deficits of $167 billion and $136 billion of net debt. The figures are indeed alarming. In 2013-14 w will see net government debt climb to a record never before seen in this country. It will represent an increase of over $40 billion since last year's budget. This country and its economy will be struggling after four years of Labor debt totalling $174 billion. By 2015-16 the government will be spending over $8 billion a year-around $22 million a day-on interest payments alone. Considering the government's love of accumulating debt, these payments are more like a schoolkids mortgage than a schoolkids to bonus. The Treasurer must think that he has an unlimited credit limit for which he requests an increase that is automatically provided. But Australian families know what it is like to be in debt-to struggle financially with an ever-increasing cost of living-and, although the government would like to claim that today's schoolkids bonus budget measures bill is supporting such people, as I previously said, it is merely a bandaid for the government's reckless financial mismanagement. On the other hand, Australian families know that with a coalition government they receive strong economic management. They know that there would be absolutely no need for a bill such as this schoolkids bonus budget measures bill if the Gillard government were not imposing such a destructive, economy-wide carbon tax. This tax, finally included in the budget last night, is going to hit Australian families. It will hit jobs in this country and significantly harm investment. It will do nothing for the environment. The payments specified in this bill are an admission by the government that the carbon tax will hurt families more than the government is admitting. Efforts to harm Australian families would be abhorrent at any time, yet the Gillard government is introducing this measure now, when the global economy is in complete dire straits and when consumers and businesses in this country are not sure what the future holds-so of course they are worried. We also heard last night of possibly one of the most ridiculous budget measures for decades: the increase in the pig slaughter fee-the bacon tax. The message to Australian families last night was: 'We're going to hit you. We're going to hit you hard and in ways you've never even thought of.' It is clear that this bill is not introduced genuinely to support Australian families but is instead a measure to hide the disastrous effects that the carbon tax will have on the family budget. The government's own modelling shows that under the carbon tax there will be an immediate 10 per cent increase in electricity prices and a nine per cent increase in gas bills. Food costs will increase due to the electricity price rise and increased transportation costs. Be in no doubt that the basic necessities of life will cost more. If families cannot save through not buying necessities, they will buy lessless entertainment, less clothing and less generally from the already struggling retail sector. Since 2007 Australian families have been struggling under incredible cost-of-living pressures. I list some of these increases cost of living to remind those on the opposite side of the House what has really been occurring for Australian families. From the December quarter of 2007 to the December quarter of 2011, electricity prices have increased by an average of 61 per cent across Australia. Gas prices have increased by an average of 37 per cent across Australia. Water and sewerage rates have increased by an average of 58 per cent across Australia. Health costs have increased by an average of 20 per cent across Australia. Education costs have increased by an average of 24 per cent across Australia. The cost of food overall has gone up by 13 per cent across Australia. The amount of rent people are paying has increased by 25 per cent across Australia. Australian families are struggling, and today's bill will do little to compensate these families for what has occurred under Labor governments. The government earlier this year slugged tens of thousands of people with significant extra costs by reducing the private health insurance rebate. There are now tens of thousands of families in Ryan alone who will face higher premiums and more strain on their everyday cost of living if they choose to protect their own health with private health cover. Last night the government announced changes to the tax offset system for out-ofpocket medical expenses, so adding further misery to the lives of thousands of Ryan residents. If you combine the carbon tax, the debt and deficit incurred by this government, the cost of the NBN, the reduction in the private health insurance rebate and everything else I have mentioned today, it is clear that this government is not committed to reducing the cost of living or to supporting Australian families. Moreover, if this bill was truly in the aimed at improving educational outcomes the government would have introduced it in a way that directly benefited educational outcomes. Instead, this payment is a free-for all measure so that parents can spend the money in any way they please. Clearly, this government has given up any pretence that this bill is about offsetting education costs. Under this bill, the money given to parents of school children may be spent on the education of their children, but it is of great concern that it probably will not be. This government should come up with a targeted campaign to ensure that the money is spent effectively. We already had a program designed to do such a thing. It was called the education tax refund. But this government dumped it last night.",81
47,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown, Order! It being 1.45 pm the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 43. The debate may be resumed at another hour. NA Lakes Entrance Primary School Parliamentary Guides,83
48,Mr CHESTER,Unknown," I appreciate the opportunity to rise and pay tribute to the guides in Parliament House who bring our school groups around. On this particular occasion I would like to welcome the Lakes Entrance Primary School students who are in the southern gallery at the moment. I think I speak for all members when I say that we deeply appreciate the work the guides do. In this case, Monique is showing the children from Lakes Entrance around and giving them a very good understanding of our democratic process. I think it is a very important role that the guides play in this House, along with the Parliamentary Education Office. I think it is so important that young people in our community have the opportunity to come to our parliament and to perhaps see the positive side of the work we do as members of parliament, and also to see the rough and tumble of question time in just a few minutes. I am sure that all members feel greatly honoured and privileged to represent their constituents in this place, and there is no better occasion than greeting a school group from your own electorate to get a sense of home coming to Canberra. I appreciate the children from Lakes Entrance's being here today and I welcome them in the public gallery and look forward to working with them into the future. If I could have one message to the Lakes Entrance Primary School students who are here today, it would be to encourage them to take this opportunity in their educational Schools are a place where dreams come true. If you work your hardest and strive to be your absolute best, I am sure you can go on to achieve great things in life. I welcome you to Canberra and I hope you enjoy the rest of your visit. Tasmania: GST Funding",84
49,Mr LYONS,Unknown," Last week we saw that the Leader of the Opposition will say anything to any audience, but at Agfest on 3 May his noncommitment to current Tasmanian GST funding sent a shudder down the spine of every Tasmanian. I know it did for many constituents in my electorate of Bass, who raised the issue with my office. Mr Abbott's play for WA votes on 30 April revealed our worse fears; if elected he would tear more than $630 million out of the Tasmanian economy in GST revenue every year. This would devastate our state. His weasel words at Agfest in Tasmania did not offset his words in WA. Just to give people an idea, this means an equivalent loss of 800 doctors, 3,000 nurses, 500 allied health professionals and more than 100 child protection staff. It would mean losing seven out of every 10 health employees in Tasmania-a grave concern indeed. This is a despicable attitude by a person who is supposed to stand for all Australians instead of just his coalition mates. Now those opposite oppose the school bonus. This move shows how out of touch they are on the opposite benches. This along with the Victorian Liberals' port tax, which will cost business in Tasmania $74 million, is a kick in the guts by the Liberals and an attack on Tasmanians. ANZAC Day Mrs ANDREWS (MCPherson) (13:48): I would like to take this opportunity to thank the residents and visitors to the Gold Coast who attended the many ANZAC Day services life. that were held across the Gold Coast this year. In my electorate I am fortunate enough to have four RSLs: Burleigh Heads, Currumbin-Palm Beach, Mudgeeraba and Tweed Heads & Coolangatta. Each year, each of those RSLs conducts ANZAC Day services to commemorate those who have served our country in the many conflicts we have participated in and to pass down the ANZAC message to younger generations. There certainly has been a surge of people in recent years coming out to pay their respects on ANZAC Day, with crowds this year much larger than the year before. In particular, many thousands of people attended the service at the Currumbin RSL's dawn service, at Elephant Rock in Currumbin. It was also excellent to see so many young people and young families attending those services and commemorating the sacrifices of our ANZACs and celebrating the freedoms we enjoy. I especially thank Ron Workman, OAM, the President of Currumbin RSL; Bruce Weir, the newly-elected President of Burleigh Heads RSL; Peter Franklin, OAM, President of Mudgeeraba RSL; Joe Russell, President of Tweed Heads & Coolangatta RSL; and their respective committees, for their hard work and commitment in organising this year's commemorations. Petrie Electorate: Community Organisations Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (13:49): It is my pleasure to rise and acknowledge a couple of the community organisations and events I have recently been to. Firstly I thank ROPE, which is a respite centre for people with disabilities, who recently hosted the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers, Jan MCLucas, and myself. We had the opportunity to talk to some of the clients and also to the staff and the volunteers about the great work they do. On the weekend, ROPE put on an art exhibition, which was a fantastic exhibition of art done by the clients. The day that the parliamentary secretary and I visited ROPE was also the day of the NDIS rally, which both the parliamentary secretary and I attended in the city. It was great to see so many familiar faces there supporting the NDIS. I also acknowledge the Regional Community Association Moreton Bay, who last week held a candle-lighting ceremony for domestic violence. I thank them for putting on this service. A couple of the speakers were women who have been personally affected by domestic violence. As difficult as it was to listen to their stories, it is so important that we get those stories out so that people's awareness is lifted, so that we do not remain silent on domestic violence and so that we stand up and take action. MCClintock, Mr John",84
50,Mr ALEXANDER,Unknown," I rise to recognise the efforts of an amazing Bennelong volunteer, Mr John MCClintock. John is not a man who will promote himself or his work. John is a retired gentleman who belongs to Bennelong and Surrounds Residents for Reconciliation, and is part of the JSA Early Intervention Aboriginal Literacy Project-a program that provides volunteers to schools in the northern Sydney region to read to Aboriginal children. John has been visiting Ryde Public School every week for the past four years and often visits three schools in one day. John also volunteers at the local community radio station, 2MBS, and in his local Neighbourhood Watch. He is a member of Bennelong Friends of Refugees and visits asylum seekers at Villawood Detention Centre every three weeks. Together with his wife, Beryl, John is proud of their four daughters, raised in the Ryde area, and was always an active P&C member when they were students. I am delighted that John and Beryl will be joining me for my Bennelong volunteer recognition event next week, where the unsung heroes in our local community-people like John MCClintockwho make Bennelong a more caring community, can be recognised for their extraordinary commitment to our local region. Gough, Mr David",85
51,Ms BRODTMANN,Unknown," Australia has lost a wonderful community champion in David Gough. Last week David passed away in a motorbike accident in Sydney. David campaigned for organ and tissue donation following the death of his daughter Melody in a car accident on Christmas Eve 2009. Melody was a multiorgan donor and she saved the lives of three people. Since that time, David has participated in riding around Australia to various rural, regional and remote centres Australia. In February this year he embarked on his 8,000 kilometre ride during Donate Life Week. He travelled for 25 days and he visited more than 100 towns, spreading the word and raising awareness about organ and tissue donation. I had the honour of meeting and farewelling David last year when he was embarking on his ride around Australia, and I also farewelled him this year from Old Parliament House. Each year he increased the level of support in the community for ride and for organ and tissue donation. He was a great contributor to the organ and tissue donation cause in terms of raising funds but particularly raising awareness about the need for Australians to have the conversation with their loved ones about the need for organ and tissue donation and to make their families aware of their needs. (Time expired) Surf Life Saving Northern Territory Mrs GRIGGS (Solomon) (13:54): I would like to share with the House that last week I was named Vice-Patron of Surf Life Saving Northern Territory. Ms Ley: Lots of surfing up there. Mrs GRIGGS: Yes, lots of good surf up there! Surf lifesaving has been an Australian way of life for more than 100 years. Swimming at the beach is a national pastime and Surf Life Saving Australia continue to make a positive contribution both on and off the beach to Territorians and the wider Australian community. So I was absolutely honoured when the organisation asked me to support them as their vice patron. Established in 1983, Surf Life Saving NT is one of the seven affiliates of Surf Life Saving Australia. It has almost equal representation of both females and males in its 1,800 membership across the Territory. I in have two surf lifesaving clubs in my electorate. They are the Darwin Surf Life Saving Club and the Mindil Beach Surf Life Saving Club. They are extremely active clubs; yet they could benefit with some more volunteers. Last year in the Northern Territory there were more than 22 rescues, more than 8,500 preventative actions and over 30 serious first aid cases. I would like to report that none has involved a crocodilecontrary to what the Northern Territory News would report every day. I look forward his to supporting Surf Life Saving NT and ensuring that their good work continues. Hunter Electorate: Infrastructure",86
52,Mr FITZGIBBON,Unknown," I would like to congratulate the Treasurer on a responsible and indeed historic budget, with great initiatives in health care, aged care and education and of course a National Disability Insurance Scheme. There has been some commentary in the Hunter that what was lacking was new infrastructure projects. I remind those listening from the Hunter that in recent years we have had record spending on physical infrastructure. Indeed, last night, there was $190 million to continue the Hunter expressway. I also point out there are currently no shovel-ready projects to be funded-but there will be. That is why the mining tax is so important-returning the benefits of the boom back to the physical infrastructure in the region from which the money comes. But there is one big threat, and that is the New South Wales government, which is threatening to increase royalties to offset mining tax-which means that the government would have to compensate the New South Wales government. That will be money taken away from Hunter region infrastructure projects to be spent on projects in and around Sydney. My community and communities generally in the Hunter region should reject the idea of the New South Wales government raising royalties and in so denying opportunities in the Hunter for funding for physical infrastructure projects which are so badly needed and so connected to the mining boom itself. Some of our highways are car parks because of the impact of and the growth in the mining sector(Time expired) 70th Anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea",86
53,Ms GAMBARO,Unknown," It was a great honour for me to lay a wreath of the ceremony commemorating the 70th anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea on Saturday, 5 May in Newstead Park in the Brisbane electorate. The battle between allied and Japanese naval and air forces was fought between 4 May and 8 May 1942 in the Coral Sea, off the coast of Queensland. The allied victory stopped the Japanese from taking Port Moresby and threatening Australia. No Australians lost their lives in the battle but 543 Americans and 1,074 Japanese were killed or wounded. I find these events very moving because they remind me of the sacrifice that so many people made so that we can enjoy the freedom that we do today. For me, one of the most touching aspects of the ceremony was meeting some of the five survivors of the US Lexington. Harry Frey, Jerry Frey, Kay Burton, Cecil Wisell and Ruth Grizzell were all lucky to survive an attack on the Lexington. 'It is great to see so many people gathered together in honour of the men and the women who fought during the Battle of the Coral Sea,' said Frey. US Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano read a letter from US President Barack Obama that said: We will never forget their sacrifice and we will always honour the legacy of those who fought to keep us free. It was a very memorable occasion for all of us who were there. (Time expired) Roads: Ipswich Motorway",87
54,Mr NEUMANN,Unknown," The shadow roads minister really does not have much of a clue when it comes to roads in Queensland. For example, the coalition has opposed the upgrade of the Ipswich Motorway for three federal elections in a row-and next week Minister Albanese and I, with the member for Oxley, will be opening the Dinmore to Goodna section of the Ipswich Motorway. But occasionally those opposite get it right. I see the member for Herbert is reported in the Townsville Bulletin of 5 March 2011 as saying with respect to the Bruce Highway: I'll give Labor a pat on the back and say they have spent more in their four or five years on the Bruce Highway than we did before. In fact, I think the shadow minister for roads, Mr Warren Truss, was there in the audience at the time. This is a guy that never seems to ask Minister Albanese any questions. Certainly in the nearly five years that I have been here, he has not asked him any questions in this particular chamber of parliament about the Ipswich Motorwaybecause the coalition would have put 10,000 jobs at risk on the Ipswich Motorway by their continuous opposition. Next week we officially open it-and those opposite should be ashamed of themselves for their failure to invest in the Ipswich Motorway.",87
55,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown," Order! In accordance with standing order 43, the time for members' statements has concluded. NA Budget",88
56,Mr ABBOTT,Unknown, My question is to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister agree with the Treasurer's statement on radio this morning that Labor's plan to increase Australia's debt limit from $250 billion to a record $300 billion is 'no big deal'? Does the Prime Minister regard as 'no big deal' putting $50 billion more on our nation's credit card?,88
57,Ms GILLARD,Unknown," What the Deputy Prime Minister was referring to this morning was the debt cap changes that the government is bringing to the parliament. This is to deal with volatility during the course of the financial year. Debt will remain below the $250 billion current cap at the end of financial years, but there is volatility during the year. What the Leader of the Opposition, who is obviously struggling to understand the budget-and there is no mystery about that given his lack of interest in economics, former Treasurer, Peter Costello, was known to remark on more than one occasion-has obviously not noticed in the budget is that it brings the budget to surplus in 2012-13 exactly as promised. It brings the budget to surplus because that is the right thing for our economy now. It is the clearest sign of a strong economy. It is giving us a buffer for the future. With the government doing the right thing-bringing the budget to surpluswe are giving the Reserve Bank the room to move, should it choose to do so, in reducing interest rates. We know from last week just how important interest rate reductions are to working families. We have learnt something else today about the nature of the Leader of the Opposition and his approach to budgeting: he does not trust Australian families. That is the issue before the parliament today. We believe hard working Australian families can be trustedGovernment members: Shame! Shame!",88
58,Mr Abbott,Unknown,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order: the Prime Minister was asked about putting $50 billion more on the nation's credit card and that is the question",88
59,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown, The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. He will not use points of order for argument. The Prime Minister has the call and will be directly relevant to the question.,88
60,Ms GILLARD,Unknown,"I was indicating, to the Leader of the Opposition's question, the answer: the debt cap; the importance of the budget surplus; and the importance of staying in touch with and understanding the needs of working families and having a bit of respect for their ability to budget, manage and put their children first instead of spending the day insulting them the way the as the Leader of the Opposition has. Budget",88
61,Mr NEUMANN,Unknown, My question is to the Treasurer. How is the budget spreading the benefits of the mining boom?,88
62,Mr SWAN,Unknown," I thank the member for Blair for his question because this is a battler's budget that only a Labor government could deliver. We are proudly back in surplus-light years ahead of our peers. We are proud to be spreading the benefits of the mining boom right around our country, to many more Australians, giving them a stake in our economic success. We are certainly very proud to make room in this budget to provide for the most vulnerable in our community, like Australians with a disability. We are returning to surplus. We are building surpluses over the forward estimates. What we are doing is providing the maximum room for the Reserve Bank of Australia to adjust interest rates should it so decide. What this means is that the interest rate in Australia-the cash rate-is now lower than it was at any time under the previous government. If you have got something like a $300,000 mortgage you are now paying $3,000 a year less than you were paying under the previous government. I know everybody on this side of the House understands how important it is to get into surplus, how important it is to stay in surplus and how important that is for the future of interest rates in our community. What we also understand is the importance of assisting lowand middle-income families in our community and spreading the benefits of the mining boom across as many of those households as we can. That is why we are proud to provide additional support to families from 1 July next year via the family tax benefit. We are also particularly proud to be introducing a new schoolkids bonus to provide more support for the cost of education for families-something that is very important. Our future is one that is intertwined with the region. It is not just about a resources boom and what it does here. Our ability to harvest the opportunities of the Asian century in the future depends upon the quality of education for our children. As a government, from day one, we have been investing in education. Another way to do it is to help those families with those cost-of-living pressures that come when the kids are going back to school or starting a new term, and that is why the schoolkids bonus is so important. But we are doing more than that. We are giving important tax relief to small business with the instant asset write-off for up to 2.7 million small businesses in our community and by bringing in loss carry-back. All of these are very important ways of ensuring we strengthen our economy and look after lowand middle-income Australians. Budget",88
63,Mr HOCKEY,Unknown, My question is to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer explain why there was no mention in the budget speech last night of the government seeking to increase the nation's credit card limit from $250 billion to a record $300 billion? Government members: It's not a credit card!,89
64,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown, Order! People are not assisting the Treasurer to be heard. The Treasurer has the call.,89
65,Mr SWAN,Unknown," This is a question that I take very seriously, because the government takes its $250 billion debt cap very seriously.",89
66,Unknown,Unknown,Honourable members interjecting,89
67,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! I will not tolerate excessive noise while question time is underway. The Treasurer has the call.,89
68,Mr SWAN,Unknown,"Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. The budget papers show that Commonwealth securities on issue are under the existing limit at the end of each year. That is the fact. I know it is an uncomfortable fact and I know it is going to stand in the way of a massive scare campaign that those opposite want to run. I know they will go to any lengths to talk down our economy and to run it down in terms of its international reputation. But those are the facts. We have had a request from the Office of Financial Management to put a buffer in because we do have a challenge when it comes",89
69,Unknown,Unknown,Honourable members interjecting,90
70,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! I will, if pushed, issue a general warning and there will be very few people left in the chamber. The Treasurer has the call.",90
71,Mr SWAN,Unknown,"We have been advised by the Office of Financial Management that we should have a buffer, notwithstanding the fact that at the end of each year we are within that cap. I know those opposite do not understand a lot about financial markets, so we will just run through a couple of the facts. First and foremost, in terms of Commonwealth revenues, they tend to come in in lumps and they tend to come in particularly towards the end of the year. What actually happens is that expenditure is evenly spread across the year. So we have an in-year financing challenge which is made worse by the fact that we have maturing bond lines and as they are maturing we are issuing new ones. That can mean we do go over the cap on a temporary basis but we stay within it at the end of the year. The point that the OFM has made is this, and I will quote from their memo: 'To manage these fluctuations in an efficient and effective manner it is critical that the debt management operations of the AOFM are not affected by short-term borrowing constraints such as a debt cap or a similar mechanism.' We reported in full in the budget papers what we were intending to do and why we were intending to do it. It is very sensible for Australia and I think that those opposite should just pause for a minute and not play politics with this issue.",90

75,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,My understanding would be that the supplementary is in order. I will call the Treasurer.,90

78,Mr SWAN,Unknown,"and I am more than happy to run through all of the tables. They are all there in the budget papers. I know those opposite are pretending they have never seen them before so we will just go through net debt, which peaks as a percentage of GDP at 9.6, runs through to 2015 at 7.3 in terms of the figure itself of 142 in 2011-12, and goes through 131. In terms of gross debt, 18 per cent of GDP, 265.8 in 2011-12, goes through to 281.3, which is the figure the member was looking for, and comes down over the next decade.",90

80,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The member for La Trobe has the call and will be heard in silence. Budget,91
81,Ms SMYTH,Unknown," My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, how will the budget spread the benefits of the mining boom while delivering a surplus and helping families to make ends meet?",91
82,Ms GILLARD,Unknown," I thank the member for La Trobe for her question, and I know that she is concerned about families in her electorate who can struggle to make ends meet, to pay the bills when they come in and to pay all of the costs for getting the kids to school. In fact, in the member for La Trobe's electorate we have 10,300 families who will receive our schoolkids bonus because they are families with 18,150 school-aged children. That means the families in the member for La Trobe's electorate will see almost $11 million to assist them with the costs of getting the kids to school. This is part of a Labor budget, a Labor budget where we have delivered for the economy to make sure that we are doing the right things to keep our economy strong. We have come out of the global financial crisis strong and we work together to achieve it. The government is playing its part with employers and trade unions to keep people in jobs. Now, as our economy returns to trend growth, is the right time to deliver a surplus, to give us a buffer for the future, to ensure the Reserve Bank has the room to move, should it choose to do so, and reduce interest rates. As we have made the difficult savings choices to bring the budget to surplus, we have been determined to protect and support working families and their children. There is no better way of doing that than by assisting families with the costs of getting the kids to school. We know right around the nation that, whether it be the winter uniform, the school excursion, the new books, the new shoes and then needing to get another pair of shoes as the kids grow, that those bills, those costs, can put pressure on working families. That is why we are very proud that we will be delivering to them a schoolkids bonus$820 per secondary student, $410 per primary student-and that they will see that money coming to them before the end of this financial year and then in following years in January and July. We trust working families, we respect them and we know they are making the best decisions for their children. We know schooling costs them a lot more than $410 and $820. It is only those who are cosseted on Sydney's North Shore that could fail to realise that working families need relief, working families face the costs of getting kids to school, and we are intending to help them with those costs because we respect them and we want to support them. We will not spend our days offering cheap insults to their ability to look after their children. Budget",91
83,Mr TURNBULL,Unknown," My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer confirm that if he was not shuffling at least $7½ billion dollars of spending out of 2012-13 and into the previous and later years, and if the spending on the $50 billion NBN was counted towards the budget bottom line, then the budget would show an actual deficit of at least $12 billion?",91
84,Mr SWAN,Unknown," This is the line that is being peddled by those opposite, who have a $70 billion hole, or crater, in their budget bottom line. Somehow they want to walk around and pretend that we have not done the hard yakka to bring our budget back to surplus, so they have come up with the great con, which is to claim that, if we had included all of the NBN accounting that they say we should, we would be in deficit. The truth is this: that we are operating under a Charter of Budget Honesty developed by those on that side. We are working within accounting standards that were followed by the previous government and we have accounted for the NBN in precisely the same way as bodies like Australia Post and EFIC have been accounted for forever and a day, and were accounted for by the previous government in that way. I reject the slur that comes with that question that somehow we would not have a surplus if the NBN was accounted for differently. We have accounted for the NBN in the same way as these bodies have been accounted for by previous governments according to the accounting standards and according to the Charter of Budget Honesty. The second slur that they are throwing around is somehow that the moneys have been moved around. The fact is we have in this budget $33 billion worth of savings, and they find that very, very hard to cope with given they have a $70 billion hole in their budget bottom line. They cannot even find $70 billion. We have found $33 billion worth of savings in this budget and that is why we are coming back to surplus, and if you have a look at the figures you will see that we have payments at record lows-well below anything that we have seen for a four-year period since the early 1980s. What that shows is considerable expenditure restraint right across the forward estimates, so let us just dispatch with this slur because those on the other side of the parliament cannot make their budget numbers add up. What we know is that the auditors they hired to look at books at the last election have been found guilty of misconduct. No wonder there was an $11 billion black hole in their estimates at the last election campaign. So they come to this with very dirty hands and they have no credibility when it comes to budget accounting. Budget",91
85,Mr BANDT,Unknown," My question is to the Treasurer: now that the budget reflects the Greens' position not to give tax cuts to big business there is an extra $16 billion available to the public purse over the next decade. Why isn't that money being used for long-term reform that would secure our economy after the mining bubble bursts, for example, by boosting school funding as recommended by the Gonski review?",92
86,Mr SWAN,Unknown," I thank the member for Melbourne for his question, because in this House the company tax cut has been opposed not just by the Greens but by the Liberal Party. That is why the government has not been able to get its proposal through-they have made it very clear well in advance that they would not support a cut in the company tax rate. Indeed, they have been in the opposite position: they have a policy to increase company taxation, not to cut it-quite extraordinary. The member asked me about what we are using the revenue for and why we have chosen to invest in the families of Australia, particularly those on low and middle incomes. We on this side of the House absolutely understand how important it is to give a bit of extra support to lowand middle-income families in our community and we make no apology for the fact that we are spending some of that money to boost the purchasing power of lowand middletheir income families in this community who deserve to have a bigger stake in the mining boom, spreading the opportunities of that right around our community. We understand that for many small businesses, particularly in the patchwork economy, there needs to be business tax reform, which is why we are moving forward with the instant asset write-off-a very big boon for small business in our communityand proceeding with the loss carry-back as well. These are two important reforms to make small business more competitive, to give them a helping hand whilst, at the same time, making sure that we give a fair go to lowand middle-income working families. On top of all of that, we are putting in fundamental reforms, such as the National Disability Insurance Scheme, and putting in place additional support to help people with dental care. All of these things, plus a huge aged-care package, demonstrate that if you can make big savings in your budget you can bring it back to surplus and make room for important new priorities. Budget Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (14:20): question is to the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and for Disability Reform. How will the budget spread the benefits of the mining boom to Australian families; why is it important that this support is delivered quickly to those who need it; and what would be the impact if it is not?",92
87,Ms MACKLIN,Unknown,"Jagajaga-Minister for Families, Community Services Indigenous Affairs and Minister for Disability Reform) (14:21): I thank the member for Petrie very much for her question. The Treasurer last night Labor budget that is going to bring this country back to surplus and that spreads the benefits of the mining boom. This is a budget that gives back to families, a budget that in true Labor style makes sure that families get the benefit of this boom. Today I have introduced legislation into this chamber to deliver Australia's schoolkids bonus, a bonus that will see 1.3 million Australian families getting more help to make ends meet. Families would receive $410 a year for each child they have in primary school and $820 a year for each child they have in secondary school, and this would be paid before the start of term 1 and term 3. The fact is that 80 per cent of families were missing out on their full entitlements under the education tax refund. place This new schoolkids bonus will make sure that one million Australian families get more money. On top of that, this budget delivers to 1½ million families extra funding through their family payments from the middle of next year. Families on the maximum rate will receive $600 extra if they have two children or more. That is what this government is delivering in this Labor budget to help My families make ends meet. The member for Petrie asked this question. There are 9,700 families in the electorate of Petrie who are going to benefit from the schoolkids bonus. Today the Liberals confirmed that they are going to oppose the schoolkids bonus. We found out just before question time that they are loading up the list of speakers for this afternoon because they are trying to avoid and bringing on the vote. They are so ashamed of their position. I say to the member for Riverina that I noticed in the Wagga Daily Advertiser today delivered a a lady- (Time expired) Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (14:24): I ask a supplementary question in response to the minister's answer. Can the minister advise how families in my community and across northern Brisbane will benefit from this support?",93
88,Ms MACKLIN,Unknown,"Jagajaga-Minister for Families, Community Services Indigenous Affairs and Minister for Disability Reform) (14:24): I thank the member for Petrie for her supplementary question and for her advocacy for families Brisbane's north. As I indicated, there are thousands of families in her electorate, and of course many more across Brisbane, who will benefit from the schoolkids bonus. In fact, we heard on ABC Radio this morning a Brisbane family in the electorate of Dickson who spoke about the benefits of the schoolkids bonus. Jude and her husband, Bruce, have four children, aged four to 11, and they make it very plain that they think this new schoolkids bonus is a great thing. They are going to be getting a significant bonus from this Labor government. Has the member for Dickson had the guts to ring Jude and Bruce and tell them that he is going to be opposing a schoolkids bonus? He is going to try and stop Jude and Bruce getting this extra money. The member for Dickson, like everybody over there, thinks he knows better than the parents of Australia how to bring up their children. While this Labor government wants to make sure that we give Jude and Bruceand the families in Wagga and all the other people around Australia-the funding that they need, all you can do is say no.",94
89,Mr MCCormack,Unknown,The people in Wagga are really looking forward to paying the carbon tax because of you.,94
90,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown," The member for Riverina will leave the chamber under 94(a). The member for Riverina then left the chamber. Budget Mr TONY SMITH (Casey) (14:26): My question is to the Treasurer. Isn't it the case and that, if the government was not artificially bringing forward scheduled 2012-13 local government financial assistance grants worth over $1 billion in this financial year, and in artificially bringing forward payments of the government's new schoolkids cash splash from July into June, your projected 2012-13 surplus would be a deficit on these two adjustments alone?",94
91,Mr SWAN,Unknown, No. Budget,94
92,Ms RISHWORTH,Unknown," My question is to the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth. How will the budget support schoolchildren across the country, and what are the obstacles to this support?",94
93,Mr GARRETT,Unknown,"Kingsford Smith Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (14:27): I thank the member for Kingston for her question. Labor has delivered a budget that not only provides for the vulnerable in our community but also, importantly, provides families that have kids at school with the assistance they need with the costs that they face. This comes on top of the significant additional investments in education that this Labor government has made over its term. We nearly doubled spending in education compared with those opposite. We are serious about education and we understand the challenges and the costof-living pressures that families face, and that fact was recognised in this budget. So we are now delivering a schoolkids bonus. As the Prime Minister and the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs have said, it is $410 for primary school students and $820 for secondary school students, and it benefits over one million families. They will really welcome that support. I am asked this question by the member for Kingston. In her electorate, 11,200 families are expected to benefit; nearly 20,000 kids are eligible for this primary or secondary schoolkids bonus. All parents know that there are costs-whether for school uniforms or excursions-that come with raising a family and getting them off to school. The fact is that there is now greater flexibility for those parents as they manage those costs. I am asked by the member: what are the obstacles to this support? The obstacles to the schoolkids bonus are sitting on the other side of the House in this parliament, opposing this measure for Australian parents. It seems that the Leader of the Opposition and the member for North Sydney do not really trust any Australian families with extra money. The Leader of the Opposition is sending a message to Australian parents: he does not trust you with the way you run your family budget. In fact, the shadow minister had a press release out just before we came into the parliament. He has just written it altogether and calls it a 'sugar hit'. What a massive insult to Australian parents, who every time the school term starts have got to think about where they can find those additional resources for the new uniforms, the new school shoes, the new backpack and the like. The fact is, this will make a difference to parents who are serious about education, in the same way that the other investments this government has made have made a difference to schools right around this country. Whether it is the new facilities, whether it is teacher training support, whether it is helping kids with their literacy and numeracy, whether it is bringing a national curriculum into play or whether it is understanding that supporting education is the most important thing that we can do for the future of our country, we get it and they do not. That is why this schoolkids bonus is solid, strong Labor policy. Budget",94
94,Mr ANDREWS,Unknown," My question is to the Prime Minister. How does the Prime Minister justify a cash giveaway to some Australians, designed as a schoolkids cash splash, while at the same time putting future generations of Australians further into debt by raising the debt ceiling to $300 billion. Why should Australians believe the government can competently deliver this cash giveaway when its $900 cash bonus was paid to dead people, horses, cats, dogs and Australians living overseas?",95
95,Ms GILLARD,Unknown," To the member for Menzies, I say that is the arrogance of the opposition on display. It shows just how out of touch it is with the needs of working families. I hope that the member for Menzies contacts the 5,000 families in his electorate who are eligible for the schoolkids bonus and off explains to them why he is coming into this parliament and voting against them getting that bonus. To the member for Menzies, let me say this: it is only members of the opposition who apparently fail to understand that families face cost-of-living pressures. Not one of them gets it; they are all going to vote against relief for working families. Not one of them understands Australian families and their needs today. It is only members of the opposition who apparently imagine that you can send a child to primary school and somehow that costs you less than $410 a year, and that you can send a child to high school and somehow that costs you less than $820 a year. People who live in the real world-that is, people who are not members of the oppositionknow that educating a child costs thousands of dollars. What this bonus is for is to provide a bit of relief to working families who are doing it tough. It is for families who are eligible for our family tax benefit families who are eligible for that relief because we know that they need it to make a difference to the cost of the winter school uniforms, to the cost of the shoes and to the cost of the excursions. What have we heard back from the opposition to try to justify their position in not supporting the schoolkid bonus? The Leader of the Opposition was asked what the difference is between this and the baby bonus, because he supported the baby bonus. In a masterstroke in Australian politics, his answer was, 'Well, look, they just are'. And then, the shadow Treasurer, when asked what the difference is, said, 'there is a vast difference'. 'What?', he is asked. 'Well, you have to have a baby to get the baby bonus', he said. Apparently the shadow Treasurer does not know babies grow into school children! That is what happens: they grew into school children! And then you have the cost of sending the kids to school. How out of touch can these people be? How cosseted from the real world are they? How insulting of Australian families.  on a point of order. I put it to you that the Prime Minister would be directly relevant if, in fact, the schoolkids bonus was paid for education expenses but, in fact, it is not.",95
96,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown, The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat. Points of order are not to be abused. The Prime Minister has the call.,96
97,Ms GILLARD,Unknown,"I thank the Manager of Opposition Business for illustrating my last point. These arrogant, cynical people think Australian families do not care about their kids. They think 1.3 million Australian families are going to take this money and not use it for the benefit of their families and their children. They are contemptuous of system, working children.

NA Budget",96
99,Mr MITCHELL,Unknown," Not from this side, anyway! My question is to the Minister for Community Services, Minister for the Status of Women and Minister for Indigenous Employment and Economic Development. Minister, how is the budget delivering vital support for Australian families and women?",96
100,Ms COLLINS,Unknown,"Franklin-Minister for Community Services, Minister for the Status of Women and Minister for Indigenous Employment and Economic Development) (14:35): I thank the member for MCEwen for his question because we know that this budget is really and truly putting lowand middle-income Australians first. It is a Labor budget that is delivering support for the cost of living for 1.5 million Australian families like the 12,800 families in the seat of MCEwen who will be eligible to receive this government's new schoolkids bonus. These 12,800 families will receive $820 a year for high school students and $410 a year for every primary school student. We are ready to provide these 12,800 families in the seat of MCEwen, and the 1.3 million Australian families around Australia, with this year's bonus payment in just a few weeks time. That is more than $13 million in support for kids' education that families in MCEwen alone will receive. I know the member for MCEwen will be standing up for his families in his electorate. He knows how important it is to get that support out to the mums and dads and kids in his electorate and right around Australia. It is particularly important for the member for MCEwen because in his home state of Victoria the Liberal government has just cut back on family support. In its budget, the Baillieu Liberal government cut its School Start Bonus, meaning 40,000 families in Victoria will be losing payments because of Liberal Party cuts. Now we have this Leader of the Opposition standing in the way of helping Australian families just trying to do the right thing by their children. These are ordinary working Australians and they are in the electorate of every member over there. Like the member for Leichhardt: will he be standing in the way of the 12,500 families in his electorate receiving the payment? Or the member for Forde: will he be supporting the 12,000 in his electorate or will he be stopping them from receiving more than $12 million in just a few weeks time? What about the member for Maranoa, the member for Parkes, the member for Ryan, the member for Longman and the 46,000 eligible to receive this payment in their electorates? Will they be standing up for them? No matter where they are in Australia, we know that coalition governments cut services and payments for families. But this is not about payments. It is not just about blocking the cash to these families. They are actually refusing to trust Australian families. The Leader of the Opposition is saying, loud and clear, to parents that he does not trust them with their own family budgets. This is an insult to all Australian parents. It is an attack on their ability to look after their own kids. We know that parents make decisions every day, every week, about their children. But the coalition do not think they can be trusted with some extra cash. (Time expired) Budget",96
101,Mr ROBB,Unknown," My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to the blow-out in interest costs on the government's net debt to $8 billion a year by 2015-16. Treasurer, is it not the case that if these $8 billion were applied to the introduction of the National Disability Insurance Scheme it could be introduced immediately, for all 400,000 Australians with a disability, rather than the 10,000 in 2013-14 contemplated in this budget?",97
102,Mr SWAN,Unknown," I thank the shadow minister for his question, and it is a very important question. It gives me the opportunity to address debt and it gives me the opportunity to talk about why we are coming back to surplus and paying down debt. When the global financial crisis hit we moved with a powerful stimulus to support our economy. Because we did that, hundreds and thousands kept their jobs and hundreds of thousands of small businesses kept their doors open. The consequence was that we, almost alone amongst developed economies, avoided a recession. Avoiding that recession is why we are in such a strong position now amongst developed economies in the world compared to just about anybody else. We just avoided a recession. That is one of the reasons we have unemployment at 5.2 per cent and a strong investment pipeline and why opportunities are so big for our country into the future. When that hit, it hit our revenues. Our revenues have been written down by $150 billion over five years. Those opposite expect the Australian people to believe that they had been in our position they would not have done anything other than accept that revenue hit and they would not have moved to support our economy. The consequence of that would have been higher deficits, higher debt and higher interest payments, today. If they had been in power during that period of time, we would be sitting here looking at higher unemployment, higher debt and higher interest payments.",97
103,Mr Robb,Unknown,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I have a point of order on relevance: my question was about the blow-out in interest rates in the future-2015-16-not three years ago.",98
104,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown, The member for Goldstein has made his point. The Treasurer is answering the question.,98
105,Mr SWAN,Unknown,"We are coming back to surplus because we have a strong economy. We walk tall in the world and as a consequence of that we have the capacity to accumulate surpluses and, over time, pay down debt. That is precisely what we should be doing and that is exactly what we are doing. That is the reason we have put in place $33 billion worth of saves in this budget. The weight will be on those opposite because they have a $70 billion crater in their budget bottom line and every save of ours that they knock back will add to that $70 billion crater. That is the contrast between that side of the House and this side of the House. We take fiscal policy seriously. Those on that side of the House had their auditors found guilty of professional misconduct during the last election campaign. They could not be trusted to run a chook farm. Budget",98
106,Mr CHAMPION,Unknown, My question is to the Assistant Treasurer. if Why is it important to get the budget back into surplus and how will the budget spread the benefits of the economy to hard working Australian families and to businesses?,98
107,Mr BRADBURY,Unknown,"Lindsay-Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (14:43): I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. The member for Wakefield knows that the clearest sign of a strong economy is a surplus and that is what this government is delivering. A surplus is the best defence we can provide against any future shocks in the global economy but, importantly, it is also a means by which we can provide the Reserve Bank with all the room that it needs in order to cut interest rates, if it chooses to do that, and to pass on the benefits of that to families right around our country. The member for Wakefield asked me about how we are spreading the benefits of the economy through this budget. We are doing that in many respects. But we are a government that understands that whilst we are experiencing a mining boom there are many families-and many businesses around our country and our communities-that are not receiving the benefits of that boom. That is why we are determined to spread the benefits of the boom and that is what this budget does. When it comes to the position of those opposite in relation to these matters, we have already seen that, apart from the fact that they cannot accept that Labor will deliver a surplus, they now find themselves in the situation where they are standing between us and the families right around this country that we want to deliver a schoolkids bonus to. We know that they are very unhappy about the budget and the return to surplus, because that is bad for them politically; it is good for the country but it is bad for them politically. But we also know that they now say that they will in fact support the increases to the family tax benefit part A; they say that-even though they have consistently maintained the position that they will oppose the mining tax and oppose any of the benefits that are yielded by that. In fact, the member for North Sydney is on the record, consistently, saying: The Coalition is opposed to the mining tax. We can't make promises that can't be paid for. We will rescind this tax in government and we will unwind the expenditure linked to it. This is fiscally prudent. It would be irresponsible the expenditure without the supporting revenue. Then they say they are going to support measures linked to the mining tax-and they have just exposed the fact that they have no capacity to pay for them. By their very own words they are damned. They have a $70 billion crater and it just keeps getting bigger. They keep digging and digging and digging. If this black hole got any deeper, we would need a Stephen Hawking documentary to try and uncover exactly what was inside of it. When it comes to their black hole, the day of reckoning is approaching. In two days time, or tomorrow night, the Leader of the Opposition will have the opportunity to spell out exactly what savings he will make. If he does not take that opportunity, we know his black hole will only get bigger. (Time expired) NA",98

NA Member for Dobell  Opposition Business) (14:46): My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the comments on the ABC's AM program this morning when she said: … let me say I never want to see a dollar that a worker gives a union used for any purpose other than the proper purposes of representing that union member's best interests.

109,Ms GILLARD,Unknown," To the Manager of Opposition Business, No. 1, I say: how remarkable that they cannot sustain a debate on the budget for even one question time-so little interest in our economy, in jobs, in the cost of living pressures on working Australians.

On the Manager of Opposition Business's question, what I said on radio this morning is of course my view and I have stated it before. Overwhelmingly, in our nation, the trade union movement is professional. It is decent. It is hard working. It is representing working Australians. To the extent that any dollar is ever used in a way which is not for on a point of order.

That is the Labor way. I understand that the Manager of Opposition Business is going to come in here and try and chuck around unfounded allegations and smear, because he does not know anything about education or anything about working people, or supporting them. If he has got an allegation to put, he should put it. If he not have an allegation to put then he should at least pretend for one question time that he has got one concern about schools in this country.

119,Mr ALBANESE,Unknown,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (14:50): I thank the member for Page. The member for Page is a great supporter of infrastructure in her electorate; in particular, the Pacific Highway, where she got to open the final stage of the Ballina bypass-a great project announced by this government, funded by this government and opened by this government. Last night the Treasurer delivered a Labor budget that builds on our nation-building agenda, a budget that returns to surplus but not at the expense of investing in our productivity and the infrastructure that we need for the future. Since we came to government we have doubled the roads budget and increased investment in rail tenfold. We have reformed the way that we plan, finance and build infrastructure by establishing Infrastructure Australia, and in last night's budget we committed funding for the final projects that were on the does Infrastructure Priority List produced by Infrastructure Australia after its national audit in 2008. We have now funded every single project, because last night we provided $232 million for the Goodwood and Torrens Junctions in project that will improve the movement of freight and ease traffic congestion in Adelaide. In addition, we confirmed funding for the Majura Parkway in the ACT. This is about delivering on Infrastructure Australia's agenda. We also, of course, put into the Nation Building Program an additional $3.56 billion, subject to matching funding from New South Wales, to complete the full duplication of the Pacific Highway by 2016-promised by the Howard government, but they only contributed $1.3 billion over 12 years. This will take our contribution, if New South Wales matches its rhetoric before the election with action in its next budget, over $7.7 billion. It will improve productivity; more importantly, it will improve road safety. There has been some comment from New South Wales today about the funding arrangements. I table a press release from Wendy Machin from the NRMA confirming that it was the Howard government that set the fifty-fifty funding split for the Pacific Highway from 2006, and the NRMA has supported this approach since day one. I also table from the Sydney Morning Herald a front-page story of 7 March 2009 headed 'Rees bungle costs state $50 million', where, because New South Wales Labor were not delivering on their Pacific Highway promises, I took action against them. This needs to be above politics. The New South Wales government needs- (Time expired) Member for Dobell  Opposition Business) (14:53): My question is again to the Prime Minister. I remind the Prime Minister of her statement just a week ago that the next election will be about 'whether you stand for the privileged few or whether you stand for working Australians'. How does the Prime Minister reconcile that statement with her protection of the member for Dobell for the last three years instead of standing up for the 77,000 members of the Health Services Union?",100
120,Ms GILLARD,Unknown," To the member for Sturt, the Manager of Opposition Business, can I say: if he wants to get into a debate about who stands up for working families in this parliament and who stands up for a privileged few, no better day to have it than today-a day on which we are standing up for 1.3 million families around the country; a day on which those on the opposition to benches are going to use their vote, their reckless negativity, to try and get in the way of working families getting the Schoolkids Bonus, some basic support, to help with the costs of getting the kids to school.",101
121,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown, There is a lot of preamble.,101
122,Ms GILLARD,Unknown,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I was asked a very general question and I am intending to answer it. We also, in this response by the opposition to the budget, could not see a more clear example of who stands up for working people and who stands up for a privileged few than on the question of family tax benefits. We have decided, because of the reckless negativity of the opposition in stopping the company tax reduction, to share the benefits of the boom with working families through a family tax benefit payment increase: $300 for families with one child, $600 for families with two or of more children. When the Leader of the Opposition has been asked who he stands for in relation to this proposition, who does he stand for? As I was asked by point of order: the Prime Minister has been answering the question for a minute and a half and has yet to actually mention the 77,000 members of the Health Services Union. I ask her to answer that question.",101
123,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown," Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat.

The Prime Minister has the call.",102
124,Ms GILLARD,Unknown,"Thank you very much, Madam Deputy Speaker. I was asked basically about who stands for the many and who stands for the privileged few, and I am answering that question. I am answering it very specifically in relation to family tax benefit because we have decided to take the benefits of the mining boom and benefit working families around the nation. We have decided they are the people we stand for; not the Clive Palmers, not the Gina Rineharts, but working families. The Leader of the Opposition, when asked about this this morning",102

On the question of the many and the few, the Leader of the Opposition, when asked this morning whether or not these payments would be continued if he was ever Prime Minister, said Australian families would just have to wait and see. That is code for him and Clive and Gina turning up on their doorstep and demanding the family payments back. That is what that is code for.",102

Would the minister inform the House of the government's plan to improve frontline services, like dental health, under the budget?",103

140,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown, Order! Members on the government side are not helping the minister. The minister has the call.,103
141,Ms PLIBERSEK,Unknown,"I was very pleased to meet with the Illawarra Dental Health Action Group and their head, Alice Scott. They have been working with the member for Throsby for many years and they worked with the previous member for Throsby, Jennie George, as well. She mentioned them nearly a decade ago in this place when she presented a petition about the abolition of the Commonwealth Dental Health Program by the Howard government in their first budget. I must say that the measures in last night's budget restore much of the damage done by the Howard government during their term in office. This $515.3 million package includes $345.9 million spent delivering services that will reduce the backlog on public dental waiting lists around the country. It includes other measures, such as workforce measures, relocation and infrastructure grants to encourage dentists to relocate and practice in remote areas, oral health promotion and other very important measures. This will be vital for the 30 per cent of Australians who cannot currently access the dental care they need. It is proof that good economic management is not in opposition to strong social objectives. Indeed, it has been very well received by people in the health community, including the Australian Dental Association President, Dr Shane Fryer, who said: The provision of funding to bolster the public dental services will help to reduce the waiting lists that cause some Australians to wait years for access to a dentist Carol Bennett, CEO of the Consumer Health Forum, said the package was addressing years of neglect. She said: We are pleased that the Federal Government has recognised that teeth are part of the body and that dental care should be part of the health system. The CEO of the Australian Healthcare and Hospitals Association, Prue Power, said the package was 'an extremely important step' that will greatly improve the health of Australians on dental waiting lists and 'their quality of life, as well as improving productivity and reducing hospital admissions.' This is a measure that will make a great deal of difference to hundreds of thousands of Australians, not only improving their dental health now but also offering preventive care for years in the future. That means that people will be able to have fillings instead of tooth extractions when they are visiting the public health system. After years of neglect, this builds a renewed focus on our public dental systems. Member for Dobell Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP (Mackellar) (15:03): My question is to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister recall her statement: … question time is supposed to be one of our key accountability mechanisms. If there is a big scandal or a corruption allegation, you are supposed to be able to get to the matter in question time … If the Prime Minister still believes in those principles, will she detail what events occurred between now and when parliament last met that caused her to accept the member for Dobell's offer to suspend himself from the caucus?",103
142,Ms GILLARD,Unknown," I certainly do recall that statement and I endorse that statement. It requires a competent opposition that can get their questions in order, but in a parliament where we had a competent opposition, that would be exactly how question time worked. In this parliament where we have an opposition that cannot sustain a debate on things like the budget then we get these kinds of questions. In answer to the member's question, I detailed at the press conference that I conducted on a Sunday all the details about my discussions with the member for Dobell which led to him now sitting on the crossbenches. Those details are available and I will send the member the transcript. Budget",104
143,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"The member for Lowe has the call. My apologies, the member for Reid has the call-we have got to stop changing the names of seats!",104
144,Mr MURPHY,Unknown," My question is to the Minister for Social Inclusion, Minister for Mental Health and Ageing and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Mental Health Reform. Minister, how will the budget deliver greater choice and better access to services for all older people, and make sure the aged care sector is sustainable into the future?",104
145,Mr BUTLER,Unknown,"Port Adelaide-Minister for Social Inclusion, Minister for Mental Health and Ageing and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Mental Health Reform) (15:05): I thank the former member for Lowe and the current member for Reid for his question. In the lead-up to the last election, this Prime Minister promised that aged care reform would be a priority for this term of government. Last night's budget delivers on that commitment. A little over a fortnight ago, the Prime Minister and I announced the most sweeping changes and improvements to aged care in almost 30 years, transforming a system that was built in the 1980s around nursing homes to one that is built around supporting older Australians to stay in their own homes for as long as possible and, if at all possible, for the remainder of their lives. In designing our reforms, we listened closely to the Productivity Commission and to the aged care sector itself, but most importantly, we listened directly to older Australians. The overwhelming message to us was that what they want from an aged care system is support to stay in their own homes. Over the next five years, we will expand home care by two-thirds, taking the total expansion of home care under this government to around 110 per cent. Home care will shift from being provider centred to being truly consumer directed and consumer controlled. A fairer system of residential care financing will not only stimulate new investment but also put an end to the excessive bonds that too many families have to pay, amounting to almost $2.6 million in some cases, just to get entry to a facility. Better wages and better work practices will help underpin more sustainable workforce arrangements that will allow us to grow the workforce to the size that we need. Significant new investments will be made in areas like dementia and palliative care, investments that have been warmly welcomed by groups like Alzheimer's Australia and Palliative Care Australia. The government's package allocates $3.7 billion over five years to new initiatives to improve access, choice and quality of care and does so in a way designed also to improve the sustainability of our aged-care system. With aged-care spending this year around 70 per cent higher than it was five years ago, we have unashamedly redirected some of that money from old priorities into these new initiatives. We have also made some new changes to co-contribution arrangements that kick in after July 2014, with robust caps and strong protections for full pensioners, and have been able to do all of that while still maintaining protections around the family home. The government's package has received very, very broad support from the aged-care sector and from the community, but they have also told us that they want support for aged-care reform across the parliament. To that end we all look forward to the Leader of the Opposition tomorrow night telling the nation where he stands on the future of aged care. NA Member for Dobell  Opposition Business) (15:08): Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to move a motion. It is: That the House requires the Member for Dobell to make a statement to the House immediately, for a period not exceeding 10 minutes, about the matters arising from Fair Work Australia's inquiry into the Health Services Union that relate to him. Leave not granted.  That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for Sturt moving immediately-That the House requires the Member for Dobell to make a statement to the House immediately, for a period not exceeding 10 minutes, about the matters arising from Fair Work Australia's inquiry into the Health Services Union that relate to him. In question time today, the Prime Minister again turned her back on the members of the Health Services Union and instead stood up for the member for Dobell. We know that she could have announced today that she would ask the New South Wales Labor Party to pay back to HSU members $267,000 of their money that was used in the campaign for Dobell in 2007. But we know that she we will not, because, at this particularly precarious time for her leadership, while people like the minister for workplace relations and the member for Griffith are breathing down her neck, she will not take on Sussex Street. Standing orders should be suspended today because the most urgent matter facing the parliament is its integrity and its reputation, and right now sitting in this chamber is a member-the member for Dobell-who has continued to fail to explain to the parliament his side of the story in one of the most tawdry matters that this parliament has ever had to witness or to deal with. Eight months ago, on 9 September of 2011, the member for Dobell said, 'I will Madam make a comprehensive statement in the near future.' He said that he would make a comprehensive statement in the near future, and now-eight months later-we are still waiting to hear it. We have moved on six occasions suspensions of standing orders to allow the member for Dobell to make a statement in this House so that we as members of parliament can be informed of his side of the story, and on six occasions the Labor Party and the crossbenchers have combined to defeat those suspensions of standing orders. Standing orders must be suspended so that we can debate this motion and pass this motion and so that the member for Dobell can keep his promise that he would make such a statement. The Prime Minister has ducked and weaved on this issue faster than the full forward of the Western Bulldogs. We know now that the member for Dobell in fact excused himself from the caucus and that it was the member for Dobell who offered to suspend his membership of New South Wales Labor Party, and yet the Prime Minister in her statement to the press that she referred to in question time today insisted that in fact she had taken action. We know now that the Prime Minister was being her usual tricky self-tricky Julia.",104
146,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown," The Manager of Opposition Business will withdraw, and he will refer to the motion before the House.  Speaker. The reason standing orders must be suspended and this motion debated is that the parliament has a right to know why we should not have suspended the member for Dobell yesterday. He needs to be given the opportunity today in this parliament to speak for just 10 minutes to put his side of the so that we know as members of parliament that we should not have suspended him yesterday-a motion that was defeated by the Labor Party, who yet again sided with the member for Dobell, as the Prime Minister did today. It will give the member for Dobell, if this motion is carried, the opportunity to explain that fabled line that must be crossed-a line that the Prime Minister could not explain and that Jason and the Argonauts would find difficult to find should they seek to look for it. The Prime Minister said on 30 April, and I referred to this in question time: … I can tell you very clearly now what that election will be about. It will be about who you stand for, whether you stand for the privileged few or whether you stand for working Australians and their families. The member for Dobell can explain in this House today whether he is one of the privileged few that the Prime Minister is standing up for or one of the battlers-one of the battlers in the HSU; one of the 77,000 average members of the HSU who get paid something like $500 a week while this member for Dobell raked in $500,000 of HSU members' money over a period of time.",106
147,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"The member for Sturt is shouting, and there is no need, and he is straying greatly from the suspension.  orders should be suspended is that the allegations which have been made against the member for Dobell and the findings that have been made by Fair Work Australia about the member for Dobell are so serious that they must be tested in this parliament and he should be required to make a 10minute explanation to this parliament, because these are the most serious allegations that a member of parliament can story face. They are allegations of corruption. They are allegations of the misuse of HSU members' money. They are findings of Fair Work Australia. He needs to explain how it is that, when he was the national secretary of the HSU and when he was negotiating for his members to receive a meal allowance of $11.40 a day, he was using the HSU credit cards to pay $550 for meals at Forty One in the Sydney CBD and spending thousands of dollars of members' money. While they are on their meal allowances of $11.40, he is spending their money on overseas travel, on escort agencies, on fine dining and on personal items. We as members of parliament have a right to know his side of the story which so besmirches the reputation of this parliament. He needs to explain how it is that while he could find $276,000 of HSU members' money to spend on his own election in Dobell he was facilitating an agreement so that his workers could clean bedpans in aged-care facilities and hospitals at $500 a week. All members of the HSU would have liked to be the member for Dobell if they had known they could have found $276,000 of their own money to campaign for it, but no. He was lucky enough to be the national secretary and a favoured son of Sussex Street. Consider this. This is the reason the suspension of standing orders should be carried so that he can explain himself to the House: it would have taken an HSU member 12 weeks of cleaning a hospital to pay for the escort services that the member for Dobell is alleged to have paid for-according to findings of Fair Work Australia-with their union dues in just one night. To vote in favour of this motion would be a demonstration of support for the 77,000 members of the Health Services Union. To vote against it is a vote for continuing the protection racket that exists around the member for Dobell and that has protected him in this place through three years of questioning from the opposition. If the Prime Minister truly believes that the next election will be about who stands for the privileged few and who stands for working Australians, she would want to stand up for working Australians today and direct her caucus to support this motion. Why wouldn't she want to do that? Why wouldn't the crossbenchers and the Labor Party caucus vote for a motion that simply calls on the member for Dobell to have 10 minutes to explain his side of the story in one of the most tawdry episodes ever to besmirch the parliament? To vote against this motion-to vote this motion down, if that is the decision of the Labor Party and the crossbenchers-will mean essentially a continuation of the protection racket of the member for Dobell. What is the motivation for that in the Labor Party? He is no longer a member of their caucus. Why would the Labor Party stand up today and argue against a motion that asks an Independent member to explain himself to the parliament? The truth is that he is not an Independent member at all. He is as much a member of the Labor caucus today as he was 10 days ago. The Labor Party continues to accept his vote. They know that he is as much a Labor man today as he was 10 days ago. Nothing has that changed except that the Prime Minister found out about the Fair Work inquiry report-when it was coming out and what was in it-and she did everything she could to try to dispatch this tar baby which has so damaged her government. I cannot imagine anyone in the House wanting to turn their back on the 77,000 members of the HSU by voting against this motion, and I cannot imagine some of the members of the Labor Party caucus of good conscience seriously wanting to see their vote recorded as part of the continuing protection racket that protects the member for Dobell. The member for Banks is a good man; he knows in his conscience that it is wrong to continue to protect the member for Dobell, and I have known him for 20 years. He knows that members of the HSU deserve better than that, and I call on him and other members of the caucus to stand with the opposition and require an explanation. If they do not, they will confirm what Mark Latham once said- (Time expired)",106
148,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Is the motion seconded? Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (15:18): I second the motion. Standing orders must be suspended, because the allegations contained in the Fair Work Australia report go to the heart of the integrity of this parliament. The report has found, amongst other things, that the member for Dobell misused the funds of the Health Services Union to support his election to this parliament. This is a very serious allegation. Let me be clear. A member of this parliament has been accused of a serious fraud that underpins his presence in this place. That is why standing orders must be suspended, because this finding alone surely calls into question the member's legitimacy in this chamber. We are not talking about trivial sums of money. We are not talking about small amounts of union resources. Fair Work Australia has found that the member for Dobell misappropriated around $270,000 for the purposes of his campaign for the 2007 election so he could take a place in this chamber. There must be serious doubt about whether the member for Dobell would have been successful in his preselection and in 2007 general election had he not misused those union funds, as found by Fair Work Australia-the government's own creation. This is not a matter that can be swept under the carpet or ignored, and that is why standing orders must be suspended, because the Prime Minister has repeatedly vowed her personal support for the member for Dobell. Recently she claimed that a line had been crossed that necessitated the suspension of the member for Dobell from the Australian Labor Party-although the Prime Minister is yet to answer the question as to whether Labor is still paying his legal fees. The Prime Minister also claimed that she understands that 'matters concerning Mr Thomson have caused Australians to become concerned about standards in public life'. The Prime Minister said that Australians are 'seeing a dark cloud' when they look at this parliament. If we conclude-and for the sake of this debate let us assume the Prime Minister's version is truthful-that the Prime Minister judged the investigation and the findings of Fair Work Australia sufficiently serious to render the member for Dobell unfit to attend meetings of the federal Labor caucus, how is it that the Prime Minister believes that the member for Dobell is fit to continue to take his place in the parliament? He is unfit for the Labor Party room but the Prime Minister believes that somehow he remains a fit and proper person to take his place in the parliament and to continue to provide his vote in support of this government. It is important to note that the member for Dobell has consistently proclaimed his innocence. As recently as 29 April the member for Dobell said: 'I am confident that in a reasonably short period of time the truth will out and I will be vindicated.' It is worth noting that that statement was prior to the the release of the Fair Work Australia reportand, rather than being vindicated, the member for Dobell has been subjected to dozens of damning findings of alleged serious misconduct during his time as the National Secretary of the Health Services Union. The fact that these allegations are crucial elements of the circumstances involving the election of the member for Dobell to this parliament, necessitates an explanation from the member to this House. Standing orders must be suspended to provide the member with the opportunity to explain why he considers the Fair Work Australia report to be a 'joke' and why it found that he had illegally used $200,000 of HSU funds to employ staff to work on his election campaign and $70,000 to directly support his election campaign, $103,000 of unexplained cash withdrawals and dining, entertainment and the procurement of prostitute expenses of more than $80,000. It is a matter of the gravest importance for the parliament for one of the elected members to have been found by an independent government authority of having fraudulently funded their campaign to gain admittance to our national parliament. Those of us elected into parliament are greatly honoured to have the opportunity to serve our electorates. I respectfully urge the members of the crossbench to support this motion; otherwise, the dark cloud will be a dark winter of discontent. (Time expired)",108
149,Mr ALBANESE,Unknown,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (15:24): Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. Mr Abbott interjecting",109
150,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown, The Leader of the Opposition will stop constantly interjecting across the table. The Leader of the House has the call.,109
151,Mr ALBANESE,Unknown,"Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. The Leader of the Opposition is happy to interject but was not happy to be associated with this motion to suspend standing orders before the House today. Just like yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition thinks that he can allow the opposition to get down into the gutter day after day and somehow it has nothing to do with him-distancing himself from it. But the fact is we know that there is no process, no convention, no tradition and no institution that this Leader of the Opposition will not trash in his pursuit of power. What we see day after day-now for the 53rd occasion-is an attempt to suspend standing orders. This is the day after the national government has handed down our budget. It is a significant budget that returns the budget to surplus whilst providing support for wealth creation and opportunity. Today we had one question about the budget from the shadow Treasurer and one question from the shadow finance minister about the budget, and that is it-nothing else to say on the day after the federal budget. Surely, that is unprecedented in Australia's history? What this motion is really about is trying to ensure that time is taken up rather than getting on to the substance that we should be dealing with arising out of the budget produced last night. This morning on the schoolkids bonus budget bill debate, we had two opposition members down to speakjust two. But as the day went on the list grew. Up to 19 speakers from the opposition are now on the list, dragging out debate because they do not want the TV news tonight to show them saying no to families. That is what they want to do. That is their priority. The fact is that that is the issue that we should be getting on to after we have the MPI from the opposition-which is of course also about the budget. The opposition come in here day after day and want, in terms of their motion to suspend standing orders, this parliament-they have backed off from yesterday's motion but it is still pretty consistent-to determine what are quite rightly legal matters. We do have a separation of powers. Indeed, their rhetoric is completely inconsistent with what they said prior to their own issues. In fact, the Leader of the Opposition, in speaking about Mary Jo Fisher, said: The matter is now before the courts where I understand it will be contested and she should be extended the presumption of innocence. That is what he said on 24 July 2011. And then of course we know that he went on to say that she did not vote on anything, even though we know that she voted on everything, including the clean energy bills. Indeed, Senator Robert Hill had this to say about Mal Colston: 'We should not forget the rules of natural justice in this matter.' John Howard had this to say about Mal Colston: ... at the moment he's been treated worse than anybody else who's charged with a crime. I mean nobody else has been treated like that. He is, at the moment, being denied the presumption of innocence. But you do not need to go any further than the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition had this to say on 9 March 2007 about Mr Laming: The matter is really now before the police and perhaps the Criminal and Commission in Queensland, and let's let those authorities make their investigations and come to any conclusion. He's a backbench member of parliament and I think he's entitled to stay in the parliament these bodies have come to their conclusions. Indeed, in 2007, former Prime Minister John Howard said about those same issues that using parliamentary privilege to make allegations against political opponents is 'the cheapest game in the book'. The member for Dobell has indicated that he will make a statement in his own time and he should be left to do that. That is what the member for Dobell has said and that is entirely appropriate given the circumstances. Craig has said he will make a statement; he should be left to do that. That is what we would expect under all circumstances. But if we go down the road of trying to present this place as judge and jury then we destroy the separation of powers and the balance between political representatives and the judicial wing, which is a very dangerous step indeed. When the member for Sturt got on his feet and asked for leave to move a motion, for a second there I thought about letting him do it. I thought about granting him leave and then amending it so that he could explain to the parliament his association with James Ashby and what went on in the Speaker's office that evening and in subsequent liaisons between Mr Ashby and various members of the coalition.",109
152,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,The Leader of the House will return to the suspension motion.,110
153,Mr ALBANESE,Unknown,"The fact is we should not go down the road of saying that this place should replace appropriate judicial processes, or pass resolutions calling upon people who have legal rights and who are entitled to get legal advice which is not prejudiced by any decision of this Misconduct parliament. I said yesterday that if any of the allegations-which are serious-against the member for Dobell are proven, then he should face the full force of the law. But it is not up to this parliament to determine what until those circumstances are. It is not up to this parliament to make judgements about a whole range of issues or legal actions which are before the court, whether they concern members of the government, members of the opposition or crossbenchers-either the member for Indi or any other member of parliament. It is not up to us to go down that track. I would have thought that the Leader of the Opposition understood that, given his history of understanding the importance of independent judicial processes, rather than assuming that allegations, once made, are proven. That is why we should reject the suspension of standing orders. The member for Dobell has indicated that he will make a statement before the parliament; it should be left at that. Think about the consequences of a majority government being able to make decisions in their tactics committee about doing things which change democratically elected balance of a parliament. Think about the consequences of that. That is why this suspension motion should not be supported. Mr CRAIG THOMSON (Dobell) (15:34): Madam Deputy Speaker, I seek the call on indulgence.",110

155,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"The member for Dobell has been given as much indulgence as I can give but, if everybody wants this, then I will obey the will of the House. I will allow the indulgence for the member for Dobell. Mr CRAIG THOMSON: Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. The next sitting week is when I intend to make a statement. There has been a comprehensive and very long Fair Work Australia report of some 1,100 pages, which we did not have access to until late Monday night. It is appropriate that Secker, PD (teller) I have time to go through that so that I can make a comprehensive statement to parliament, which is what I intend to do. This week is an important week, being budget week. It is a week when families around Australia are looking at what this government could do and that, quite frankly, is what this week should be spent on.

161,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown," Mr Speaker has received a letter from the honourable member for North Sydney proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The failure of the Government to properly manage the budget. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",117
162,Mr HOCKEY,Unknown," Last night the Treasurer introduced his fifth budget, which he was proud to say stayed true to his Labor ideals. I have to say it was a true Labor budget. It was confused and full of deceit, made promises and broke promises, and failed to mention that it was increasing tax and increasing debt. This will be remembered as the carbon tax budgetexcept there was no mention of the carbon tax in the budget speech. It will raise $24 billion in this budget. Importantly, it is also the case that the handouts that the government announced last night, which were dressed up as student tax rebates or increases in family tax payments, are all about the carbon tax and have nothing to do with the proclaimed intention. Equally importantly, it was a budget that had no coherent economic strategy to drive growth in the economy, to lift productivity or to create jobs. Australia is crying out for leadership to restore confidence to get its economy performing at its very best. Economic growth under Labor has been very poor, averaging 2½ per cent or less in its first three years. This is an underwhelming record at a time when Australia is benefiting from the highest Budget terms of trade in several generations and record demand for its exports from overseas. Productivity has stalled. GDP per hour worked in the final quarter of last year was lower than two years earlier. And what about jobs? In 2011, there was no growth at all. It was the first time in 20 years that no new jobs had been created. So what has the Treasurer done to restore stronger growth, kick-start productivity growth and lift job creation? The answer is that he has set the bar pretty low. He has promised that the economy will grow by 3¼ per cent next year. That is on the upside of trend, and we would be able to generate growth of at least trend or even higher after years of below-trend growth if we created the conditions for businesses to invest, grow and take on more workers. Clearly the Treasurer has no confidence that he has the skills or the policy to do that. His track record suggests that he will undershoot even his relatively low bar. In last year's budget he forecast growth this year of four per cent. He has now revised that down to three per cent. But even this looks too strong given the weak growth in the first half of the year and market estimates for another tepid quarter of growth in March. Certainly the Treasurer's ambitions for job creation suggest he really expects only modest economic growth. The unemployment rate is now expected to increase from the current 5.2 per cent to 5.5 per cent and remain there for two years. On the morning of budget day-just yesterdaythe Treasurer said, 'It makes sure we support jobs.' I remember last year, when he said the budget was all about 'jobs, jobs, jobs' and forecast growth in jobs of 500,000 over two years. Not only has he failed to reach that target; he is nowhere near it, with an expected and revised estimate of just 200,000 jobs being created. His track record suggests that we should be sceptical even of that more modest ambition. And yet the Treasurer wants us to believe it is a 'jobs budget'. Of course, he has had many descriptions. It started off as a 'tough budget', but he does that every year. Then he said it would be a 'responsible budget'. Then he said it would be 'a budget that will whirl the economy back to a fiscal surplus'. Then he alluded to the fact that it was a 'Robin Hood budget'. And then it was 'battlers' budget'. This, of course, is the way the Labor Party does it. They use that invective to try to describe something that they cannot describe themselves. The biggest flaw with this budget is its reliance on the continuation of the mining boom. It assumes that the terms of trade will stay close to highs so that company tax receipts and mining tax receipts continue to be high. The terms of trade assume a decline in 2012-13 of 5.75 per cent, and 3.25 per cent the following year. However, the government's own sensitivity analysis confirms that a fall in the terms of trade of around four per cent would reduce the underlying cash surplus by $3.4 billion in first year and $7.1 billion after that. A relatively small decline in the terms of trade from record highs is going to wipe out the government's claimed surpluses. This just shows how critical the mining boom is to the government's fiscal strategy and how precariously balanced the budget is. I could compare this government's lack of vision with the coalition's strong agenda to drive economic growth, productivity and employment. Our first step in government he will be the restoration of sound public finances by cutting the waste, reducing the spending and paying down public sector debt. Secondly, we will lower taxation to enhance the rewards for effort and to reduce the fiscal drag on the economy. Thirdly, we will have a strong productivity agenda with higher labour force participation, reduced red tape and the facilitation of further restructuring of industry. Fourthly, we will facilitate even stronger engagement with our trading partners, with a particular focus on Asia. The coalition has clear plans to grow the economy and create jobs. We have done it before and we will do it again. As I said, the Treasurer claimed at first that this would be a tough budget, as he does every year. First, of $33.6 billion of so-called savings over the forward estimates, more than half are increased or new tax measures. There are six new or increased taxes in the budget, taking the grand total since the government came to office to 26 new or increased taxes. The government always reaches for the tax lever in order to fill a budget hole. Second, spending this year will be $100 billion higher than when the coalition left office, and yet Labor said that the Howard coalition was a big-spending government. At no stage in the last few years, or over the next four years, does the government get anywhere near the levels of the the last year of the Howard government in terms of percentage of GDP in expenditure. This is not a tight budget. How can it be when there has been an alarming deterioration in the numbers over the past year? Last year's budget forecast was an underlying deficit of $22 billion for this year. That has now doubled to $44 billion, the third highest deficit on record. The cumulative deficit under Labor since they have been in office is $174 billion. What is worse is that the tiny surplus of just $1.5 billion that they are claiming they will deliver next year has clearly been manufactured. First, it relies on a $39 billion surge in revenue, of which $34 billion is tax. Second, they have shuffled money out of 2012-13 into the current financial year. We first identified this in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, but the government have dreamed up new measures. These include the schoolkids bonus, shifting around $662 million from next year into this year, and $1.2 billion of financial assistance grants to local government that has been brought forward from July to June in order to avoid next financial year. Of course, the government have raided the hollow logs, taking $750 million extra out of government business enterprises next year as a special dividend, including from the Australian Reinsurance Pool Corporation and the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation. The heart of the deceit in this budget is that the debt continues to rise even though the government claim it is going to be in surplus. How can that be? The Treasurer had a rather awkward moment in question time today when asked about how much gross debt is going to be. When it was related to the debt limit that is imposed by this parliament, predictably he got the figure wrong by responding with market value instead of face value. That is what you would expect from this Treasurer. He does not understand the markets. He accuses us of not understanding them, but he does not understand them. What we do know is that, if projects like the National Broadband Network and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation were included in the budget bottom line, on his own numbers the budget would remain in deficit to 2014-15. That is one of the reasons that net debt continues to rise next year and the year after to a peak of $145 billion, the highest on record. That is why the government have flagged that they will need to increase the debt limit from $250 billion to $300 billion. What is it with the Labor Party and credit cards? Whether it be a credit card from a union or a credit card from the Australian people, they cannot help but smoke the credit cards. In this case, they are doing it with taxpayer money. They are indifferent to the impact of that sort of challenge. Last year the Treasurer called the increase in debt 'tiny'. He went on to say, 'It's very low,' minutes later on 2GB. Later on Sky News he was asked the peak debt level and he did not know the answer. I can assure the Treasurer that the taxpayers of Australia think debt is a very big deal. Repaying the debt is a big task, and the Treasurer claims he will pay it off by the end of the decade. I said earlier today on radio, 'Pigs might fly'-although I concede that pigs are more likely to fly these days, because last night they increased the pig slaughter levy, which is another hidden tax increase. To pay off the debts the government will have to deliver surpluses bigger than one per cent of GDP for the next six years. The cost of interest is $8.2 billion a year to 2015-16-that is, $22 million a day that Australian taxpayers have to find just to pay the interest on Labor debt. But what about the broken promises? The government not only made new promises last night but broke the promises they had already made. The one that is ringing in our ears is the commitment to company tax cuts. The Prime Minister herself said only two months ago in this House: If you are against cutting company tax, you are against economic growth. If you are against economic growth, then you are against jobs. On over 70 occasions the Treasurer has said that he would be introducing legislation to cut company tax. We are waiting for it. The Greens have already indicated that they would support company tax cuts for small business. But no: the Treasurer is trying to lay it on us by blaming us for not passing it. The legislation never came to the parliament. It is like the Malaysia solution. We are waiting for the legislation the Prime was daring us to vote against. We are also still waiting for this company tax cut legislation which the Prime Minister says we voted against. We have not even seen the legislation. I thought the government had abandoned its plan to cut company tax, paid for with another tax, but the budget is still warm-delivered only last night-and the Prime Minister was on Sky News's Agenda saying: 'We're open to company tax cuts. We'll engage in further discussion.' So she changing the budget. Normally under Labor the budget lasts from Lateline to lunchtime, but it did not quite make it past the clock this day. What we find is that Labor are playing and fiddling with the numbers. They are shuffling money about. The education tax rebate now has nothing to do with education and the family tax benefit part A and the allowance increases have nothing to do with giving people a fairer share of the mining tax. They are all about compensation for the carbon tax, the tax that dare not speak its name in the budget or in the budget speech. There is no clear, articulate strategy to grow the economy. There is nothing that reduces the cost of living for everyday families and there is nothing in the budget that creates jobs. There needed to be an economic strategy that Australians could believe in, that helped to give Australians confidence that the volatility offshore is not going to affect their everyday lives. Instead it was a budget that had handouts but claimed to be tough. It was a budget that has left Australians confused. It was a budget to save Julia Gillard's job instead of the jobs of everyday Australians. (Time expired)",117
163,Mr BRADBURY,Unknown,"Lindsay-Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (16:00): It gives me great pleasure to rise to contribute to this matter of still public importance. The matter before the Minister House goes to the question of the government's economic management. I am very proud to stand here just the day after the Treasurer handed down a budget that will return to surplus. We all know that there is no greater symbol of the strength of an economy than being able to demonstrate that a budget is returning to surplus. That is something that we are very proud of. It is interesting that the member for North Sydney's contribution today had a lot of huff is and puff and the usual bluster that you get from him. It is his modus operandi. But when it came to actually putting some facts on on the table, there was not a lot happening. He squibbed the central challenge that the coalition have to face on the question of a surplus because the central question that has to be answered by those opposite is whether or not they are committed to a surplus. That is the point that he did not address. It is an important point, a point whose answer I believe the Australian people have a great and strong interest in knowing. Are the coalition committed to a return to surplus? An opposition member: Well why?",120
164,Mr BRADBURY,Unknown,"I hear the member opposite say, 'Well why?' Perhaps his colleagues can take him aside and give him a lecture in economics 101. I am sure the member for Dunkley would be able to simplify economic principles in such a way as to explain to the member opposite the importance of returning the budget to surplus. But on this question of a return to surplus, those opposite have been a bit shifty and very inconsistent. Let us have a look at some of the commentary that we have seen from them. When asked this question of whether or not the coalition would return the budget to surplus, the member for Goldstein-who is with us in the chamber-said, 'Well, it just depends.' So there we have it from the member for Goldstein. It just depends. When the member for North Sydney-who has just left the chamber-was asked the question, he said, 'Maybe.' Then when the Leader of the Opposition was asked the question, he said, 'Well ,we will do it as quickly as possible.' But then when Senator Abetz was asked the question, he said, 'Look, we're not in the business of making extravagant promises.' The promise that Senator Abetz says is extravagant is exactly what this government has delivered-a surplus budget. We will return the budget to surplus. We have done that in the budget was handed down. But we have heard the various mixed messages from those opposite on this question of whether or not they are committed to returning the budget to surplus.",120
165,Mr Robb,Unknown,Defending your budget.,121
166,Mr BRADBURY,Unknown,"The member for Goldstein says he is defending our budget. That is nice of him to do that. But contrary to the already conflicting messages from those opposite that I have just stated, I note that on 18 April 2012 on ABC 24 the member for Hasluck said, 'I'm not totally supportive of finding a surplus at this point in time,' just to add even more confusion to the picture. The member for Goldstein raises his eyebrows as if to say the member for Hasluck is not a contributor to the economic team, but they could not do any worse, so maybe they should give him a seat at the table when it comes to being a contributor to the economic team. On the question of economic management this government has a very proud track record. The member for North Sydney alluded to the question of jobs. Let us talk about jobs. Let us talk about the very significant role that government played in intervening and investing in supporting jobs through the global financial crisis. Since we have come to power, 750,000 jobs have been created in this country. At the same time, through the global financial crisis, 27 million jobs have been shed across the global economy. Those opposite do not want to hear this. They do not want to hear about the jobs that we have saved, working with the Australian people, working with the business community, investing in the skills and the labour of those who are actively participating in our workforce. They do not want to talk about that because they are not interested in the jobs of hard working Australians. In fact, when we handed down the stimulus package, when we came into this place and we voted for the package, the Leader of the Opposition did not even bother to turn up. He missed the vote. When he was quizzed about why he missed the vote, it became evident that he was up in the parliamentary dining room having a few drinks with, amongst others, the former Treasurer and he fell asleep. He fell asleep and missed the vote on the stimulus package. This is the package that we have heard those opposite seek to discredit so much, what has been one of the most effective responses to the global financial crisis. People all around the world are looking at what has been achieved in this country and the fact that today we are looking at an economy that has grown significantly from the economy that existed pre-GFC. Many economies around the world are struggling to return to pre-GFC levels, yet Australia has gone well and truly above that. At the same time we have low unemployment, we have contained inflation and the benefits of contained inflation were recently passed on in the form of a cut to the cash rate. The member for Goldstein is in the business of giving the green light to the banks to jack up interest rates. He is the No. 1 cheerleader when it comes to making the case for rate hikes. He might have been pulled into line. He went suspiciously quiet for a couple of weeks. I did not hear any response from him when the Reserve Bank did cut the cash rate. He was missing. We could not find him anywhere. I want to talk about our record. That 50 basis point cut and the interest rate cuts have been passed on to working Australians mean that a family in Australia today with a mortgage of $300,000 is paying $3,000 a year less in repayments. So, if you are the average family out there in Australia, you are paying less on your mortgage today than when those geniuses opposite were in office. Let's look at taxation. Those opposite make the allegation that we are the highest-taxing government. Taxation, as a proportion of GDP, is lower today than it was when they left office. In fact, if you look right across the forward estimates, taxation as a share of GDP-that is, overall levels of taxation-are lower under us than they were when those opposite were in power. So, when they talk about the new taxes, that is all good and well, but look at the tax base. Look at how much tax is being collected as a proportion of the economy. When you look at that you will see that this government is a lowertaxing government than that which preceded it. From 1 July, someone on $50,000 a year will be paying $40 a week less in tax. We have established that we are paying less on mortgages because interest rates are lower. We have established that people are paying less tax because tax is lower today than it was when we came to office. Let's have a look at pensioners. What is the position of a single age pensioner? Let's have a look at that. As a result of the changes that we made-a historic increase in the pension-a single age pensioner today is receiving $4,000 a year more than they were in 2009. You can go back even further to when those opposite were last in office and it is an even bigger increase. But from 2009 to today, a single age pensioner has $4,000 a year more than they had in 2009. Those opposite talk about management of the economy. Let's talk about the things that we have done that impact on the lives of working men and women around this that country. Let's look at the education tax refund, which we have sought to refine and put into a form that delivers an even greater benefit to a greater number of people. Those on the other side did not support the education tax refund in the first place. It was not their idea, and if it is not their idea they will not support it. But now we have decided that there is a better way to deliver it, and they want to stand between the Australian government and the Australian people to block people getting that relief. They talk about cost-of-living pressures, and there are many cost-of-living pressures that families are facing out there, but when it comes to providing genuine, timely and targeted relief in the form that we are proposing, they want to vote against it. How can you justify coming into this place and voting against delivering cost-of-living relief to families? How can you do that? They should go back to their electorates and look the families in their electorates in the eye. They should be ashamed of what they are doing. They know no bounds with their inconsistency. Those opposite came into this place day after day opposing a tax cut for business. I see the shadow minister for small business is sitting opposite. He is hanging his head in shame. I can appreciate the shame that he feels. When it came to supporting a tax cut for business, the Liberal Party-historically, at least allegedly, the party of business and small business-said no. They said, 'We can't support a tax cut when the revenue has come from the mining tax.' That is their principle. They are very principled people on the other side. They say, 'If the revenue comes from the mining tax, we don't care what you spend it on-even if it's a company tax cut-we can't support it.' That is what they say. We say, 'If you're going to block the company tax cut, we'll redirect the revenue that we collect with the mining tax and we'll deliver cost-of-living relief to families.' And what do those opposite say? They say, 'We think that's a good idea.' As much as I applaud them supporting the government's measure, there is a significant inconsistency there. The inconsistency is that they said that they would vote against the MRRT and would vote against all the expenditure measures, but now they are saying that they will support the expenditure measure. When you have a $70 billion black holeMr Robb interjecting",121
167,Mr BRADBURY,Unknown,"The member for Goldstein intervenes. He does not want to talk about the black hole, although it was $70 billion. The member for North Sydney passed around a few different details. He told someone it was $50 billion, he told someone else it was $60 billion and he told someone else it was $70 billion. When the $70 billion figure was released and leaked, he knew that it was the member for Goldstein. That is the inconsistency and the division that exists in relation to economic management on the other side. They will not commit to a surplus. The member for Goldstein is going to go to the dispatch box shortly and he will tell whether those opposite are committed to a surplus. In fact, last night he was saying, '$1.5 billion-that's not a surplus. is a surplus.' So, when are they going to deliver a $15 billion surplus? They have a $70 billion black hole, which, as a result of the member for Goldstein's interview last night, has just become an $85 billion black hole. Our $1.5 billion surplus will increase over the forward estimates. The member for Goldstein says, 'Well, that ain't a surplus.' The challenge for the opposition is that tomorrow evening the Leader of the Opposition will have an opportunity to come into this place and set out an alternative plan. It is important that he does that because he has some work to do. There is a $70 billion crater-they know it, and they are hoping that they skate into office without telling people about it. That alone would be a terrible thing to do if that were where their plans ended, but, unfortunately, that is not where their plans end. They have already announced a so-called commission of audit. We know there is a $70 billion black holeor $85 billion according to the interview of the member for Goldstein. They set up this special commission of audit so that, if they get elected, they will come forward and rip the guts out of services, rip the guts out of payments and rip the guts out of benefits that hard working Australians around this country rely upon. (Time expired)",123
168,Mr ROBB,Unknown," Wasn't that pathetic! This is the Assistant Treasurer of Australia. This is the deputy to the Treasurer in the construction and the implementation of this budget. On the afternoon after they presented a budget he had 15 minutes to speak and he spent no time defending the budget. The matter before the House is 'the failure of the government to properly manage the budget' and we have seen absolutely no time spent defending it. us So you should walk out; that was a most pathetic performance. Go and read the budget papers and come back and tell us $15 billion something about it. The member for Lindsay also said that this government has presided over Australia being the leading country after the global financial crisis. We did get through the global financial crisis in much better shape than other countries because of the state of the economy when that crisis hit. There was no debt; in fact, there was $70 billion of net assets and the unemployment figure had a 4 in front of it. That is why we got through that crisis the way we did. By the time this government started to spend, spend, spend, the economy was already raging out of that crisis because of the exchange rate, which fell to 60c in the dollar and saw us with the biggest trade surplus in our history in that first quarter of 2009, and because the Reserve Bank of Australia lowered interest rates by over three per cent. Those factors are why we got out of that crisis. It had absolutely nothing to do with the stimulus spending which subsequently occurred and pushed up interest rates, costing Australian workers billions and billions of dollars since because of the way this government has run the economy. The Assistant Treasurer, again, should be across these things, but the International Monetary Fund just a few days ago released the state of the books of countries around the world on a comparative basis. Of course, six developed countries are reported to have structural surpluses today. A structural surplus is something that the Treasurer would salivate over, but, of course, Australia still has a significant structural deficit. If prices come off commodities anytime in the next year because of all sorts of things that might happen outside of our control, this government has left us deeply vulnerable. This budget has done nothing-it has provided no strategy to pay down the debt; it has provided no strategy to grow the economy, create and protect jobs, and restore confidence. Nothing in this budget will address those issues. That is why we still have a structural deficit, unlike six other developed countries that have structural surpluses today. We are not coming out of this global financial crisis better than the rest of the world; we are being led by others now that went into it with much bigger debt levels than we had. Last night, the Treasurer said that this is a Labor budget 'to its bootstraps'. I do not know about old Labor, but this certainly is a new-Labor budget to its bootstraps. It is a budget you cannot trust. It is a budget riddled with deceit. It is a budget of deception by omission. It is a budget which cooks the books. It is a budget that increases debt. It is a budget where many of the so-called savings are in fact tax increases. Can you believe it? They are parading them as disciplined savings, but they are tax increases. It is a budget which resorted to bribes-grubby bribes to try and cover up the biggest carbon tax in the world. It is a budget with broken promises. It is a budget that makes many promises but at the same time breaks many promises. It is a budget which has the world's biggest carbon tax at its heart. It is a budget devoid of any strategy to pay down debt, to grow the economy, to create jobs and to restore confidence. It is a budget motivated by politics, not genuine economic principles. It is a budget motivated by political survival. That is all it is. It is a budget for this week and next week and the the week after; it is not even a budget for the next six months. It is a budget to keep the Prime Minister in the job of Prime Minister while those behind her try and sort out who might replace her. It is nothing more and nothing less than a political document. This truly is a new-Labor budget: no trust, deceit, more spending, more taxing and more borrowing. Let me explore a couple of those points a little more. It is a budget you cannot trust. Of course, my colleague pointed out the fact that there have been five different levels of deficit anticipated and forecast over the last 18 months, up from $12 billion to $44 billion-and, of course, the year has not even finished. I bet we will find by September that it is even bigger than $44 billion. How can people trust this government to get a $1.5 billion surplus after all of the fiddles that has done and after all the moving of cash here, there and everywhere off budget? How can the community trust this government when the deficit this year has gone from $12 billion to $44 billion with five different estimates through the last 18 months and the government has gotten everyone of them wrong? Also, how can Australians have any confidence in the revenue? I say today, the total revenue could not possibly go up by 11.8 per cent. That is impossible yet they expect people to believe it. This whole budget depends on that 11.8 per cent growth estimate. Welfare will grow by more than 3.8 per cent because of this budget. The Australian dollar, coal prices and resource share prices are all forward indicators and they are all going down. Add to that two new socialist governments in Europe. Unemployment is tracking up again in the US and we have a totally dysfunctional government. This is a government which is divided in so many respects. Everyone is reporting that the Prime Minister's office cannot talk to the Treasurer's office. You have this deep division. You have people grouping as possible pairs to run for the leadership in the next few months. This is a deeply divided government and it is why they are making so many errors of judgment. It is why they are so dysfunctional. There can be no trust. Just today we saw the consumer confidence figures released. Consumer confidence, despite the Reserve Bank reducing interest rates by half of one per cent-a very significant amount and more than what was anticipated by most commentators-today has dropped a further 2.1 points. What all this says is that people do not believe this government. They do not trust this government. It is why we have a crisis of it confidence amongst households and why we have a crisis of confidence amongst businesses. Now we turn to the debt situation, one of the most outrageous things. Australia has a high debt in terms of what is good for Australia. I am sick of people saying, 'Why don't you compare yourselves to basket cases in Europe?' What we need to do is apply a measure against Australian standards. We have a high debt in terms of what is good for Australia because we need in Australia-and always have needed-a debt relatively small compared with the rest of the world. We are a small, open economy which is influenced heavily by commodity price movements; not the US, not big companies in Europe-they have large domestic economies. We need a low relative debt. We have seen in this budget an increase in the debt ceiling to $300 billion. This is a government which knows nothing but spending and borrowing and taxing. We have seen it again in this budget. The Office of Financial Management confirmed that it has lost confidence in the government because they have asked the Treasurer to increase the debt ceiling to $300 billion as a buffer. This is truly a new-Labor budget to its bootstraps: no trust, deceit, more spending, more taxing and much more borrowing. (Time expired)",123
169,Mr HUSIC,Unknown," It is always a pleasure to follow the member for Goldstein because he always delivers such nuggets. Just a few moments ago we heard 'this government spends, borrows and taxes' like no other government does that. What is it supposed to do? They tax, they spend and they occasionally borrow. That is the way governments all over the world operate. And now we are being lectured about budget management from those opposite. I do not quote Paul Keating much. I should quote him more but I do not. He had a great mind. When you look at the figures in this budget, they are truly a beautiful set numbers. Look at the economic stats in this budget and what we have been able to deliver. Growth is at 3½ per cent-most other countries in the world would love to have the growth that we have. Our economy is 16 per cent bigger than what it was at the start of the GFC. Not many countries can boast that. Inflation is contained, interest rates are lower than what we inherited and we had the member for Lindsay and the Assistant Treasurer indicate what impact that has had on households. We have a AAA rating only a short space of time after one the world's largest economies, the US, was unable to maintain its rating. We have three agencies giving us a AAA rating, and investment is at $450 billion. I am particularly proud of jobs growth. Seeing more jobs created, especially in western Sydney-my part of Sydney-is absolutely critical for the people that I and others represent. There were 750,000 jobs created as a result of the economic policies and the economic climate that we put in place. There is five per cent unemployment here and 10 per cent in the Euro zone. The most critical point is the budget surplus of $1.5 billion. We said we would do it and we did it. We said we would deliver it and we have managed it. People will talk from time to time, regardless of which side of politics is in government, about a budget bounce. Budget bounces, frankly, are illusory. The big thing about this is that we delivered a critical economic objective in reaching a surplus. We can now give the Reserve Bank the room to provide the type of stimulus that is now required because we have gone through an economic period that needed fiscal stimulus. We have gone through that phase and it is now about being able to loosen up monetary policy and see business make investment decisions which of cost less to finance; that is why that is so important. We have seen taxation as a proportion of GDP at some of its lowest levels. It is now 22.1 per cent, down from the 23.7 per cent that we inherited. And we have done that effectively while swimming with one hand tied behind our backs. There is $150 billion in revenues. Tell me a government that would be able to survive having $150 billion of revenue sucked out and still be able to deliver a budget that is in surplus? We delivered a surplus, we targeted spending of and we still have tax lower than when those opposite were in government. Look at those opposite. Every time there is a bad economic statistic, they relish it. They lick their lips at any bad economic statistic. And they shrink away from good economic statistics like Dracula from sunlight-Count Hockular. They are up there all the time avoiding any good economic statistic such as higher growth, lower inflation or lower interest rates. Their first response on any occasion is to try and undermine confidence, bag out what has gone on, distort facts and ignore reality, but they are also continuing a tradition: in government, when were those opposite ever able to cut expenditure? In fact, in their last five years of government spending continued to increase at four per cent on average. They were unable to cut expenditure. They are coming here today and talking to us about the need to be able to manage the budget, but they were unable to even cut spending and kept increasing spending in those last four years. We have cut it: $33.6 billion-$100 billion of savings delivered by us. They could not then; they could not now. They, for example, reckon they can find $70 billion in savings themselves. In a simple test last year, we were trying to help Queenslanders recover after the worse floods that they have ever experienced. We proposed a one-year levy that those opposite opposed bitterly. They said that we should not be spending on helping out Queenslanders via a levy. They resisted it every step of the way and said they could find the savings themselves; they could find savings to the tune of $6 billion. A number of deadlines were set, but they were never able to identify the savings and achieve them. That is on $6 billion, and they reckon they will find $70 billion of savings. The member for North Sydney talks about this being a confused budget. I think it is wrong that he is trying to shift his confusion of numbers and numerical literacy over to us. When you look at it, take their form: they call for help for manufacturing workers and cut $500 million from industry assistance; they call for costs of living relief and are now opposing the schoolkids bonus; and they call for tax relief and have opposed the corporate tax rate cuts that we put forward. There is no confusion on our side. We know what needs to be done, but every step of the way we are opposed by them. They claim they have the ear of corporate Australia. They claim they represent them, but they have thrown corporate Australia under the bus the minute they could because they put their own political interest first instead of supporting a cut to corporate tax. Confusion-today, in this debate, the member for North Sydney talked about how the Greens supported a tax cut for small business and was suggesting that those opposite would have supported that, a differential in corporate tax rates. Having tiered corporate tax rates is what they were talking about. Confusion-look at our ERC and what it has been able to deliver. Our ERC is delivered as surplus ahead of most other economies. We have performance and growth way better than other economies. Our ERC has been able to operate like that. Their ERC operates like an entrapment exercise: handing out dodgy figures to see who will leak it to the media first to get that 'gotcha' moment. That is their ERC-their ERC operates like an entrapment exercise where the member for Goldstein is not trusted by the member for North Sydney, and they are overseen by a man, the Leader of the Opposition, who even his own colleagues describe as 'not having a real good feel for economics' or 'economically illiterate'. This is their ERC. Confusion-the Leader of the Opposition bags out the economy here but trips over to London and says, 'Our economy has genuine bragging rights.' What is it with long-haul flights and the opposition? Their feet do not even touch foreign soil before they are in their own mouths. Then you have the member for North Sydney going on and suddenly having this thought bubble: 'We should have a welfare system like Asia. We should look at Korea. We should have a welfare system that is just like the Korean welfare system.' I am sure that that would be a cracker of an argument for all those people who get carers support, the people who need that type of assistance-unemployment support and Austudy-and all those people who, when you look at the complexity of our system, would just love to know that we should model it on Korea and effectively cut out $90 billion in one swoop. Confusion-today Joe Hockey was asked, 'What is the difference between you introducing a baby bonus and the schoolkids bonus?' You could not make this stuff up. I think it is important we read back in the Hansard what was said today. On 3AW the host asked, 'Are you being critical of the schools bonus?' This is directed to Joe Hockey: 'What is the difference between the baby bonus that you introduced and the schools bonus?' The member for North Sydney says, 'There's a vast difference,' And the host says, 'What?' The member for North Sydney says, 'You have to have a baby.' This is the piercing logic that we have from those opposite, who tell us we should manage the budget better, and the Leader of the Opposition was also challenged on this point today: how is the schools bonus any different to the baby bonus, for example? The Leader of the Opposition says, 'Look, they just are; just accept it.' These are the geniuses among those opposite, who are lecturing us about budget management and cannot get it right themselves. I am grateful that they brought this MPI up, because we need more laughs in this place. I am very thankful that you have been able to bring that to the House. (Time expired)",125
170,Mr BILSON,Unknown," Madam Deputy Speaker Vamvakinou, I am wondering if you can help me find this budget. We have had two speakers from Labor supposed to be talking about the government's ability or otherwise to properly manage the budget, and it turns out it is like flared pants: it was out of fashion before it even started. We have had two speakers unable to turn their minds to a budget that is not even 24 hours old. This is quite a remarkable spectacle where the government has rolled out the member for Lindsay, one of the leading lights-Admiral Bradbury, as he is known by his friends-to talk about it. He is part of the Expenditure Review Committee. He could not even talk about the budget. Then the member for Chifley comes out-I always enjoy following the member for Chifley-talking about tiered tax rates. He has forgotten already that the government actually promised a tiered tax rate in relation to company tax reductions-a tiered tax rate for an earlier introduction for small business-but that promise disappeared before it was even enacted. What has happened to the budget? Has someone pinched this Labor budget? Has someone stolen it, so that the Labor members dare not speak the name of the budget that is not even 24 hours old? We hear this fiscal fiction being talked about, but not in terms of what is in it, not in defending the parameters and not in explaining those herculean assumptions about revenue projections that invariably never get met, resulting in revenue write-downs. They live in this la-la land where they think they are going to have these enormous growths in revenue-the fiction that underpins these so-called budget projections-and then they are not met, and the government and Treasurer go around wringing their hands saying, 'We have had these revenue write-downs.' He has been hit by reality. You can only maintain this fiction for so long. You can only keep talking about a surplus that keeps going further and further away. It was 1989 when Labor last delivered a surplus. The No. 1 hit of the year was Mick Hucknall's-Simply Red's-If You Don't Know Me By Now. The Australian public know Wayne Swan by now. They know this Treasurer and they know this government. They know that they can talk a great game about a surplus but you never get to see one. They can forecast the most extraordinary revenue projections that never materialise, and then they wring their hands saying, 'We've had revenue write-downs,' and, 'We've been hit by reality.' That is the problem with this government and their budgeting: they get hit by reality. You can only hide from it for so long. But the fiscal fiction gets worse. You would be as astounded as I was if you saw Monday night's Lateline Business. It was less than 24 hours before the government delivered its budget speech and the Minister for Social Housing and Homelessness and Minister for Small Business was asked a fairly straightforward question. The presenter said, 'Let's look at the Sensis small business survey.' It found that 92 per cent of small businesses do not think that government policies are helping them. Do you know what his answer was-less than 24 hours before the Treasurer's budget speech? He said: … we've done some recent things already by announcing the cut in the small business company tax rate from 30 to 29 cents … This was less than 24 hours before the Treasurer came in here and spoke about the company tax cut disappearing. And this was someone who is on the government's Expenditure Review Committee. Isn't that extraordinary? Was he intentionally trying to create a distortion of reality or does he have NFI-'no fiscal idea' whatsoever? Is that what the problem was? He was on the Expenditure Review Committee and he could not even work out what was in the government's own budget. What is not in the budget and what we should be discussing is how it is going to contribute to growth, how it is going to nurture business confidence, how it is going to support job creation and how it is going to enhance economic security for Australian people. What does the government talk about? None of those things. In this budget the small business community was looking for something that would give it half a sense that the record 48 per cent increase in small business insolvencies in the last 12 months might be turned around; that the 300,000 jobs that have been lost in small business might begin to be recovered; and that the 14,500 small businesses that were employing people at the time Labor was elected, but now are not, might be able to have the confidence and courage to re-engage and employ Australian men and women. That is what the small business community was looking for and it got none of it. It got absolutely none of those things. Labor says it is 'truly a Labor budget'. I agree with them, because everybody knows that Labor loves to throw money into the wind. It has failed to do that effectively and I fear they will again fail to do that effectively with this budget. But that does make it a very Labor budget. What would have made it a good budget would have been some practical measures that would have supported growth, confidence raising, job creation and economic security and would have restored small business hope, reward and opportunity. But there was nothing in there about that. Not only did the small business minister who has been spruiking the great influence he has within government not even know what was in the budget less than 24 hours before it was delivered, but all we could see was that there was a reheating of old commitments-nothing new. But what do small business know they are going to get? They are going to face the world's largest carbon tax. They are shaking in their boots about the world's largest carbon tax at a time when the economy that small business men and women and family enterprises are facing is already very challenging, when they are getting cost increases forced upon them and when nervous consumers are demanding discounts. Consumers want savings. They are demanding the sort of frugalness from small business that they would love to see from their government. Margins are thin. Foreclosures are happening. Insolvencies have increased 48 per cent on last year. There are empty shops in the main streets of Australia. Small businesses are looking for something to break the trajectory the government has put them on-government policy has driven small businesses into a ditch. They got none of that in this budget. Labor once again proved it is no friend to small business. The budget has got broken promises which will hurt small business and will hurt local employment. There was no relief from the world's largest carbon tax. It is going to whack their viability, their profitability and their capacity to employ no other measure. There is no feel within this budget that the government has any sense of the struggling, the challenges and the difficult economic climate that small business is facing. There is no sense that cash handouts will change the economic paradigm, where people will think: 'Gee, there is an ongoing change in my circumstance. I feel more confident about making longer term decisions and about reengaging in things that put me in a financially exposed situation but where I am more confident of my capacity to deal with them.' There is none of that whatsoever. There are none of those things that would bring about a change. Instead we have a few reheated announcements of sweeteners that are supposed to soften the burden and the pain, the harm and the hardship of the carbon tax-sweeteners that those in small business know in many cases offer them no assistance whatsoever. In this budget the government confirmed that 370,000 of our smallest businesses face higher tax on their income-not just companies, which seem to be the only kind of business Labor wants to talk to, but those self-employed people, those partners, those operating through trust and those men and women who are trying to create wealth and opportunity for their communities, their country and themselves. They used to get encouragement through an entrepreneurs tax offset. There used to be a 25 per cent reduction in income tax paid on those smallest businesses up to $50,000 and then a tapering of that benefit. That is completely gone. We then see the issue around accelerated depreciation. The government comes in here and says, 'Isn't this great!' Small business know they have to have cash ready to spend that money on eligible assets so they can get some cash-flow benefits at some stage down like the track. Then the government comes in here and says to those 400,000 smallest businesses that used to get the ETO, 'You can go and buy a ute.' They need thirty grand of ready dollars to go out and buy a ute so 18 months later they might get a couple of thousand dollars of cash-flow benefit. Spend thirty grand for a couple down 18 months later. That is the kind of cash-flow logic that small business look at. They hear the government mouthing these words and they think, 'They really have no idea whatsoever.' Then there is the issue of the loss carry-back. Do you remember that the coalition proposed that? The coalition proposed that as a response to the global financial crisis and was ridiculed and condemned by Labor. But now they want to bring it back in.",128
171,Mr Dreyfus,Unknown,So will you be supporting that?,130
172,Mr BILSON,Unknown,"I am grateful to the member for Isaacs, who is conceding what we all understand-that is, the carbon tax represents a greater threat to small business than the global financial crisis. The global financial crisis was not providing a sufficient challenge for small business to have a loss carry-back scheme introduced, but the carbon tax represents a far greater challenge and that is why the government is now looking at it. We know this government has no interest in, and no commitment to, small business. If you want to see any evidence of that, just have a look at this budget and go back to the Minister for Small Business, who either has no idea what is going on or has intentionally been out there misleading the small business community. The small business men and women of Australia deserve much better than that.",130
173,Ms SMYTH,Unknown," I am very pleased to contribute to the debate this afternoon. We on this side, when we consider the management of the budget and the management of the economy, have a very clear understanding for whom we are managing the budget and the economy. We have a very clear understanding that we come to this place representing familiesfamilies with children at school-who today we are prepared to support financially, and those opposite very clearly have said they will not. They have said it in a way that is demeaning to ordinary Australians, such as the 10,300 ordinary Australian families in my electorate who stand to directly benefit from this initiative proposed and supported uniquely by this side of the House. We have a very keen understanding of the people who we manage the economy and the budget for when we come to this place and make a financial commitment to the National Disability Insurance Scheme. I really do hope for the future of people who suffer with a disability and for people who care for them that the rhetoric of those opposite stands up when they need to make financial commitments at a state level and, potentially at some stage in the future, at a federal level. I really do hope that those people stand up for the NDIS in the way that we have quite clearly stood up for the launch of the NDIS in this place and in this budget-that is, ahead of time and fulfilling the initial expectations of those people who have campaigned so strongly for it. We know that we come to this place managing the economy and managing the budget for working Australians. We manage the economy and the budget for people who may find it difficult to get access to dental care, which is why we have made a significant commitment of $500 million in this budget to ensure that we provide adequate responses to people who are on waiting lists around the country. We provide them with dental care, which will enable them to have a better quality of life and which will perhaps enable them to participate more fully in employment-we all know that dental difficulties present people with confidence issues and difficulties in securing and maintaining employment. We know that we come to this place and make a commitment to working Australians when we manage the economy and when we manage the budget. We also know that those opposite, while they profess to support families and they have professed so many times to support business, come to this place and oppose measures that practically assist families and assist business. In this budget we have indicated our support for business, notwithstanding the opposition coming to this place and opposing the company tax cut that we have endeavoured to put in place to try to support people who they regard as members of their constituency. Although we have been unable to secure that given the opposition from both the Greens and the Liberal Party-an unusual alliance-we have endeavoured to provide small business with some relief in this budget through the loss carry-back arrangements. We have been very clear in this budget about the way that we want to manage the economy and about the way that we want to manage the budget for ordinary people, people who are not in the fast lane of the mining boom. Unfortunately the opposition come here with not even a piecemeal plan for the economy and for the budget of this nation. In fact, when you look back at the budget reply from last year it was extraordinary and really quite commendable because it did two things that I thought were impossible: it neither looked at the budget, nor was it a reply to the budget. So once again the Leader of the Opposition did the unthinkable, the unimaginable, and came into this place and spouted off. In fact, a member of my family remarked that it was not so much a budget reply as an interpretive dance, something titled 'How the budget made Tony feel'. I suspect that we are going to see the same again this year with lack of substance and, frankly, a lack of interest in families, in business, in ordinary Australians and in anything and anyone other than mining magnates in this country. We have a very clear picture of the opposition on this and it will be revealed, I am sure, on Thursday night as we all expect that the priorities of the opposition will be revealed again in their budget reply and they will indicate exactly who they stand for in this country. It is very important to reflect on the circumstances that we came to office to find because it really was a scorched earth situation on so many fronts. We came to office at a time when the Howard government had presided over 10 interest rate rises in a row. For people who have a $300,000 mortgage today, that means that practically you would be paying around $3,000 less per annum than you were under the years of the Howard. When John Howard left office and we came to office, tax as a proportion of GDP was running at 23.7 per cent. As a result of this government's efforts, in the next year it will be at 22.1 per cent. That amounts to $24 billion less tax that Australians are paying. We see an opposition come to this place and talk about themselves as being pro-business, pro-family and procompany. They have opposed the company tax cut and they are opposing measures that we are putting in place to practically respond to the needs of families and the cost-of-living pressures for people who are sending their children to primary and secondary school. They come into this place and we find that, in fact, they have been a higher taxing government on the last occasion that they were on these benches than we have been. It is quite revealing to have a look at not only the priorities of this government in its budget, but also the legacy of those who left us with very little when we came to office. They left us with very little that means anything to Australian working people: very little in education, very little in housing very little in health. I will have a look at each of these in turn. We inherited an education system that was chronically underfunded when we came to office, particularly in trades training. It was an education system which had not benefited from meaningful, capital investment for decades. We responded. We have now completed the biggest program of capital investment in schools in Australia's history. It stands to the benefit of those who are in those schools and learning. It will stand to the benefit of future generations.",131
174,Unknown,Unknown,Opposition members interjecting,132
175,Ms SMYTH,Unknown,"It has stood to the benefit of those workers who are engaged in construction of those projects and I do note members of the opposition laughing and interjecting throughout this. It reveals to me their sense of priority, both for workers and for participants in our education systempeople who we hope, on this side, will go on to secure jobs and have a valuable future in the Australian economy and the Australian community. Unfortunately it is not a priority that is emphasised by those opposite. We are building trade training centres; we have made a significant commitment to that and will continue to do so. We know that those opposite chronically underfunded the education system and that their proposals now are to strip money out of the education system, specifically in trade training. Mr Craig Kelly: You closed the TAFE colleges!",132
176,Ms SMYTH,Unknown,"Those commitments have been publicly indicated. For the edification of those opposite who are interjecting, you may choose to have a look at that, maybe on Google. It seems you continue to object to our trade training centres and our other proposals just as you continue to object about our computers in arrangements. We inherited a health system which the Leader of the Opposition had defunded and run into the ground.",133
177,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown, The member for Hughes will listen in silence.,133
178,Ms SMYTH,Unknown,"We faced a GP and nurses shortage and Australians know that we have responded by investing heavily in things like hospitals, GP superclinics and regional cancer centres. We have invested in the training of GPs, we have invested in the training of nurses and we have done so because we came to office at a time when all of these things had been undermined or left wanting by the Howard government and, in many instances, by the same people who are sitting on opposition benches today. We inherited a housing and homelessness crisis when we came to office. We responded swiftly. We responded in one way with the National Rental Affordability Scheme, which is intended to increase the supply of affordable rental housing by 50,000 dwellings across the country by June 2014. That is us taking the lead, to give people affordable housing, making sure they do not have to worry about that, making sure that they can carry on productive lives, making sure that they are supported and their families are supported. Those are the kinds of financial priorities that we have and have had since coming to office. Those opposite may like to note that we have made a continued commitment. We have made a commitment of $3.6 billion in the 2013 budget alone, delivering record investments in affordable housing and in investments to address homelessness. Once again, we carry on our commitment in managing the budget and managing the economy for ordinary Australians who have the kinds of needs in education, health and schools housing that Labor people know need to be responded to. It is the reason we have put together a budget against the backdrop of very difficult financial circumstances. They are circumstances where we have faced continuing global financial instability, which the opposition continues to wipe out of its memory, and where we have faced natural disasters around the country, which the opposition continues to wipe out of its memory. We have managed to maintain these objectives and make financial commitments that make a difference to the lives of ordinary Australians for whom we are managing the budget. I hope to see exactly for whom the opposition is managing the budget tomorrow night.",133
179,Mr BUCHHOLZ,Unknown," I rise to add my contribution to the discussion on this matter of public importance-in particular, the failure of the government to properly manage the budget. This budget comes down to who you trust. As a nation, who do we best trust to run the economy? What we have been hearing is rhetoric from the government with reference to a delivered surplus or delivering a surplus. Guess what? The reality is, with reference to this delivered surplus, it is a budget with a forecast next year for a budget of $1.5 billion. They have not actually delivered a budget, but that is the rhetoric and the spin. The spin doctors of Labor are better than ours. They will have you believe, through some of the speakers, that they have actually delivered a budget. In the next couple of weeks we will get to see the effect of Labor's forecasting, with the real deficit they will produce. I will take you back a little bit, to the 2010-11 MYEFO. In the next couple of weeks, the Labor government forecasted that they will be looking at a $12 billion deficit. In 2011-12, in the budget, they revised those figures to $22.6 billion. That was just 12 months ago. Then we had the MYEFO budget, six months ago, for the 2011-12 MYEFO. They revised their deficit figures again to $37 billion. Who knows what the deficit is going to look like? I would say it will be well in excess of $40 billion. When you look at the government's capacity to accurately forecast a figure into the future, be it a surplus or whatever, you need to look at their credibility and track record of effectively being able to forecast. On those figures, when it comes to dealing with the deficit or potential surplus, they do not-they could not hit the side of a barn with a forecast. You will also hear the Labor government make the comment about having the fastest fiscal consolidation in history. With the four largest record deficits that government has produced, I use the analogy that with the fiscal consolidation-for those of you who do not understand what it is, it is the capacity for a government to pay down debt-what you are going to see is similar to a contestant going on the Biggest Loser and whacking on 50 kilos before they go on the show, in order to rip it down a lot quicker. The amount of spending that this government has undertaken, and which has left us with a massive debt, is the government when talking about its fiscal consolidation. But it comes back to trust. This budget is about trust. It is about whether or not the nation can trust this government. It is whether or not the people of my electorate can trust this government. It is the hard working mums and dads who are suffering under the cost-of-living pressures. It is the business houses that are struggling under 26 new taxes. And the government says it is representing families and has given a budget for families. If you want to help families, get your hands out of their pockets-stop taxing them. There are 26 new taxes. This is unprecedented. Farmers are copping it as well, and I have a number of them in my electorate. Then the government goes on and asks us to trust them with their assumptions as to their forecast $1.5 billion surplus. When you make your assumptions on the top of a resources sector peak and commodity prices are starting to come off, you leave yourself vulnerable as a nation on trying to find the coin. If you go back and have a look at this government's track record, the way they will try to create the illusion of a surplus-which I really do not believe will happen-will be through a process of cooking the books. But when it comes to trust, who can forget the Prime Minister of our nation, before the last election, staring down the barrel of a this camera and saying, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead'? Who can forget that? And when you are working out who you can trust, ask: can you trust this Prime Minister? But do not let the Treasurer, who has put this budget up, get off scot-free, because within days of the Prime Minister making that comment, he was also asked about the carbon tax and his comment was: We have made our position very clear. We going to assist have ruled it out. So here you have a Treasurer, with a track record of not being able to be trusted, walking into this parliament, delivering a budget which talks about some hypothetical surplus in the future and trying to convince the nation that they are worth trusting. Well, I implore this nation to think very hard about who they trust when it comes to the management of the economy. I want now to speak briefly about the offbook expenditure and the tricks that this government will use to try and create the illusion of a surplus. I will try to bring it back into a business context. One example of off-budget expenditure that the government are using is the NBN-around $36 billionand another is the clean energy fund, which is about $10 billion-$2 billion a year over five years. So when you look at the way they are doing it, it would be the equivalent of someone in a family budget not eatingshowing on their balance sheet that they did not eat for the whole year but that they bought a big wodge of groceries and stuck them in the pantry for the first half of the year and then saying that in the second half of the year they will go and do another grocery run. It is accounting trickery and it is deceit shown by this government. The government talks about the cash rate and says that it was lower under Howard. I want to make the point as a business owner: I encourage Labor to go and talk to their businesses and go and talk to those people with mortgages. I would be surprised if you did not find out that no-one can borrow money at the cash rate. So while you make the point that the cash rate may have been lower under Howard, what we need to really focus on is the spread and what the variable rate is; and I can assure you that the variable rate under this government does not come anywhere near what we had it at under Howard. As to spending ratio, as a percentage, to GDP instead of the tax to GDP: again, these are just tricks",133
180,Mr Dreyfus,Unknown,What-tax to GDP is a trick?,135
181,Mr BUCHHOLZ,Unknown,"No-spending as a ratio of percentage to the GDP instead of tax. The point I want to draw your attention to is your spending-spending to GDP. The Assistant Treasurer recently made a comment on Sky that running the budget was not that dissimilar to running a household budget. With the full record deficits, could you imagine buying an $800,000 home, not making a payment on it for the first four years and then going in in the fifth year and saying, 'Listen, I would really like to service some of my debt, and I've got $2.60 to give you,' because basically that is what it comes back to as a percentage when you start looking at the $1.5 billion potential surplus that may eventuate in the future-to start drawing down some of these record deficits that this government is continuing to bash us around the head with. I cannot lose the opportunity of speaking about the increase in the debt ceiling from $250 billion to $300 billion. Today we were advised in the House that, 'We just need to have a buffer.' Well, did we need to have a buffer when we took it from $150 billion to $200 billion? Did we need to have a buffer when we took it from $200 billion to $250 billion? But guess what? They are saying they are not going to draw down on that. They just need it there as a buffer. When you go and have a look at the budget forecast, they have actually taken a provision for the interest to service that debt into the future. In 2015 they are making provisions for the interest on that debt, which they try and tell you that they are not going to draw down on. Who can you trust? When it comes to this government, when will they learn that you cannot tax and legislate a nation into prosperity? In closing, I just want to make a quick comment on the AAA credit rating. When Standard and Poor's and Moody's give credit rating assumptions for nations around the world, they give us a thing called a comparative rating. Why is it that, when we were in government and had money in the bank, and no debt, and now here we have a nation with unprecedented debt and very little capacity to service, with structural deficit",135
182,Mr Dreyfus,Unknown,This'll be good! You never got a AAA rating while you were in government! The DEPUTY SPEAKER Vamvakinou): Order! The member will be heard in silence.,136
183,Mr BUCHHOLZ,Unknown,"With comparative credit rating, as other nations around the world soften, by default, Australia ends up with a AAA credit rating. It is unprecedented, unthinkable, that this government would blow their own horn to say that they are managing the economy when they are producing record deficits. I will make the point that they are structural deficits. In closing, I would also make this point: electricity prices under this government are up 66 per cent since Labor was elected, gas prices are up 39 per cent, food prices are up 11 per cent, petrol prices are up 11 per education and health costs are up 25 per cent. My message to the government is: get your hands out of the pockets of mums and dads; get your hands out of the pockets of businesses and let them flourish. (Time expired)",136

Defence Housing Australia, DHA, proposes to develop an 8.3 hectare prime property in Weston Creek, Australian Capital Territory. Land is in reasonably short supply in Canberra, and the rezoning of land to residential in the Greater Molonglo area, of which Weston Creek is a part, has opened up an opportunity for DHA to secure land and develop new housing which meets Defence standards in Canberra. The site is located approximately two kilometres from the Australian Defence College, within 12 kilometres of the Canberra CBD and has quick access to the Tuggeranong Parkway. The proposal is for DHA to develop the site for residential construction, consistent with the approved Weston Creek Estate Development Plan. Following the site development, the proposal envisages construction of 50 dwellings for the Department of Defence over a 12-month period. The remaining sites will be sold for complementary development. and The development of the site involves the provision of infrastructure of 73 singledwelling lots, of which 50 will be used by Defence families, plus three multi-unit sites which are expected to yield up to 47 dwellings. The first stage will provide this infrastructure and involves the design and construction of roads, stormwater drainage, sewer, water, natural gas, Reference telecommunications and electricity. Once the infrastructure is completed, construction of the 50 dwellings for Defence will be undertaken. The project costs of $39 million, inclusive of GST but excluding cost of land, will be met by DHA and recovered through the sale of surplus lots and the sale and leaseback program. Subject to parliamentary approval, sewer construction is expected to commence in January 2013, with dwellings construction to be completed by December 2014. I commend the motion to the House.

212,Mr GRAY,Unknown,"Brand-Special Minister of State and Minister for the Public Service and Integrity) (17:42): I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: development and construction of housing for Defence members and their families at Lindfield, New South Wales. Defence Housing Australia, DHA, proposes to develop a 13.8 hectare prime property abutting Lane Cove National Park in Lindfield, New South Wales. The site is about 3.5 kilometres from the Chatswood commercial centre and 14 kilometres from the Sydney CBD. This site has been used for tertiary education purposes since its development by the New South Wales government in 1969 for a teachers college. When colleges of advanced education were amalgamated into universities it was transferred to the University of Technology Sydney, US, and became known as US Kuring-Gai. DHA purchased the land by public tender from US in March 2011. The DHA development is adjacent to US Kuring-Gai and will complement the area. This proposal will involve road and civil infrastructure development, followed by the construction of 345 dwellings for an integrated residential community for the Department of Defence and other families. Following site development, construction will be undertaken to deliver 345 dwellings in five precincts. The site will provide housing for families of personnel posted to Fleet Base East, to major Defence establishments in the Sydney CBD and to other units and formations scattered around the Greater Sydney area. The site's close proximity to Chatswood, the Macquarie Centre and Macquarie Park also provides Reference Defence families with opportunities for employment, entertainment and shopping. The project costs of $202 million, inclusive of GST and escalation but the excluding cost of land, will be met by DHA and recovered through the sale of surplus lots and the DHA sale and leaseback program. Subject to parliamentary approval, civil construction is expected to commence in November 2012, with dwelling construction to be completed by November 2016. I commend the motion to the House.

214,Mr CHAMPION,Unknown," On behalf of the Standing Committee on Infrastructure and Communications I present the committee's report entitled Advisory report on the Aviation Transport Security Amendment (Screening) Bill 2012, together with the minutes of proceedings. In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.",144
215,Mr CHAMPION,Unknown,"by leave-This bill was introduced on 16 February 2012 by the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and the unanimous decision of the committee is to recommend that this legislation be passed. I note that the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee is also looking at this legislation via an inquiry. This bill proposes amendments to the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004. Specifically, it allows for the introduction body scanners at Australia's international airports. The aim of this is to enhance Australia's aviation security. enhancement has been brought about due to the security risk identified by the so-called 'underwear bomber' who attempted to detonate an explosive on a flight between Amsterdam and Detroit in 2009. That device was not metallic and so therefore did not trigger an alarm. It is useful to note that in the last week or so another plot to use a similar device on an American airline has been foiled. The proposal is that body scanners be introduced to deal with this threat. That is the heart of the bill, alongside other security measures. This bill also removes the opt-out provision. Currently, passengers can decide to opt out of a body scan and have an alternative screening, which is a frisk or a pat down. It removes that option and people will no longer have the opportunity to opt out. It is worth noting Report that there was a seven-week trial of this technology in both Sydney and Melbourne airports and some 23,000 scans were conducted. The issues identified by this inquiry were the nature of the technology used, any health impacts of such technology, security effectiveness, the removal of the opt-out provisions and the privacy implications. The technology that will be used in Australian airports is active millimetre waves, which are emitted by an L-3 ProVision device. The scan has a two-second duration, which causes less exposure to radiation than the average mobile phone call. Other types of body scanning, including backscatter X-ray technology, will not be used in Australian airports, even though they are used elsewhere in the world. According to expert advice from the Department of Infrastructure and Transport, there is no evidence of any health risk to the public from body scanners, of including to those persons with implanted medical devices. Indeed, the committee heard that many people with those devices This will opt to use these scanners rather than the metal ones because they do not detect metal hips and the like. With regard to security effectiveness, there were some submissions that said that this might not be the most effective way of screening passengers. The committee accepted the advice of the department, and the privacy impact assessment, that the only alternative method of detecting these sorts of explosive devices was an enhanced frisk search-and one can imagine that would have to be pretty enhanced to detect devices! These scanners offer the greatest chance of detection because they can detect and pinpoint the location of metallic and nonmetallic items within or underneath a person's clothing. In regard to privacy implications, and these are obviously of concern to the public, it is important for the public to understand these scans are not like a virtual strip-search. They will not generate body-scanned images of individuals; rather, they produce a generic, gender-neutral figure that simply identifies where there might be items that may be explosives. They do not have a dramatic impact on anybody's privacy. Most importantly, images will not be stored, transmitted or printed. I conclude by saying the committee decided it was not its job to go through the inquiry processes that led to this legislation being introduced to the House. There was a long period of discussion and, as I said, there were trials in Sydney and Melbourne airports. It is not our job to replicate that process. We simply looked at some of the concerns raised and considered them, and have no problem recommending that this bill be passed. Economics Committee Report",144
216,Ms OWENS,Unknown," On behalf of the Standing Committee on Economics I present the committee's report entitled Advisory Report on the Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 1) Bill 2012, incorporating supplementary remarks together with the minutes of proceedings. I ask leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with the report. In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.",145
217,Ms OWENS,Unknown,"by leave-The Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 1) Bill 2012 continues the government's superannuation reforms and consolidates aspects of the tax system. The passage of this bill will: simplify superannuation consolidation; give individuals relief from the excess contributions tax; increase the information about superannuation contributions on payslips; pause the indexation of the superannuation concessional cap; and provide the ATO with the discretion to withhold high risk tax refunds. Schedules 1 and 2 represent technical amendments which ensure that the goods and services tax is not paid on certain supplies and activities. Schedule 1 ensures that a supply made by a healthcare provider to an insurer, government entity or compulsory third party scheme operator is GST-free. Schedule 2 restores the policy intent that the non-commercial activities of government related entities funded through appropriations are not subject to GST. Schedule 3 pauses indexation of the superannuation concessional cap in 2013-14. This will lead to fiscal savings of approximately half a billion dollars over the forward estimates. This temporary measure will strengthen Australia's fiscal position. Schedule 4 will protect individuals from being subject to the excess contributions tax. Individuals who inadvertently exceed the superannuation contributions cap by up to $10,000 will be given the option of withdrawing the money from super and including it as personal income for tax purposes. Through this schedule the government is providing targeted relief to taxpayers. Schedule 5 will allow the ATO to provide super funds with details necessary to find members' lost accounts. Currently, there are five million lost superannuation accounts worth $20 billion. Members will provide their consent to the ATO prior to the disclosure of account details. This measure will help people find and consolidate their super accounts. Schedule 6 allows the government to make regulations which improve employees understanding of their superannuation. Employees will receive clear information on their payslips about their superannuation. The regulation initially requires employers to provide the amount and expected date of a super payment, with the longer-term aim of providing the actual date of payment. The committee has suggested that it would be more efficient to have a single commencement date which would provide for the reporting of actual contributions. Therefore, the committee has concluded that, if the industry could meet the 1 July 2013 deadline for introducing the reporting of actual contributions, then the government should cease plans for interim reporting. However, if the industry cannot meet the proposed 1 July 2013 deadline for actual reporting, then, in this case, interim measures should be considered. The remainder of the bill deals with other tax matters. Schedule 7 provides the ATO with the discretion to withhold and review tax refunds for as long as is reasonable. The committee believes allowing the ATO to withhold potentially high-risk refunds provides the appropriate balance between taxpayers' needs and revenue protection. On behalf of the committee I thank the organisations that assisted the committee during the inquiry through submissions or by participating in the hearings in Canberra. I also thank my colleagues on the committee for their contribution to the report. I commend the report to the House.",145
218,Mr CIOBO,Unknown," by leave-Opposition members of the committee made supplementary remarks to the report with respect to the Advisory Report on the Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 1) Bill 2012. I rise to speak in respect to a number of schedules of the bill. In many respects the schedules to the bill are technical in nature. There were, however, for coalition members, and in particular for Liberal members on this committee, specific concerns that we sought to highlight through our supplementary remarks to the report. In particular I would like to focus on them. Primarily among them was schedule 3, which sees the government pause the indexation of the concessional superannuation contributions cap. In our supplementary comments we make the point that, as a consequence of the pausing of the concessional superannuation contributions cap, the government will effectively be charging an extra $485 million in tax. The policy rationale put forward by the Labor government and by Treasury officials as to why this was happening was 'to improve the government's fiscal position'. It is worth noting, as Liberal members of the committee made very clear and as the evidence from committee members made very clear, the reason this was necessary to improve the government's fiscal position is that the government's fiscal position has deteriorated so much. That is the consequence of $485 million being slugged from Australians, who are building to provide for their own retirement, in order to prop up this government. That is why Liberal members of the committee went to some length to highlight the evidence which made it crystal clear that, had there not been such a rapid deterioration of the government's fiscal position, there would not be a need to raise this $485 million in tax. The point that is made explicitly in the document, in the report that the committee has put forward and in the supplementary remarks from Liberal members, is that had we not-and this is but one example-seen this government waste $1 billion on Building the Education Revolution there would be no need for this measure. The net position would have been a $515 million improvement for the Commonwealth's position. That is just one very straightforward example that Liberal members of the committee made in the report. In addition to that, the Liberal members the committee also dealt with schedule 4, the excess contributions tax refund. We looked at the testimony that was put forward by witnesses with respect to the government's rationale for the $10,000 limit and the requirement that there is effectively only one opportunity to breach the cap without penalty. It was the view of Liberal members of the committee that the rationale for this remained opaque and that there should in fact be from a policy perspective additional opportunities provided. It is very clear based on the evidence that came from witnesses that there is opportunity, as a consequence the reporting periods, for members to inadvertently breach the cap without any intent. That was another point that Liberal members of the committee made in our supplementary remarks. I will confine my comments to those two schedules. We did not oppose the passage of the bill; however, we felt that with the improvements that were outlined in the supplementary remarks overall the bill could have been improved. Appropriations and Administration Committee Report",146
219,Ms MARINO,Unknown," On behalf of the Standing Committee on Appropriations and Administration, I present the committee's report entitled Report No. 3: Budget Estimates 2012-2013 for the Department of the House of Representatives. In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.",147
220,Ms MARINO,Unknown,"by leave-I am pleased to present to the House the third report of the Standing Committee on Appropriations and Administration entitled Budget estimates 2012-2013 for the Department of the House of Representatives. The report addresses the requirement of understanding order 222A for the committee to provide to the Speaker for presentation to the House the amounts for inclusion in the appropriation bills for the Department of the House of Representatives. The total appropriation to be approved by the parliament for the Department of the House of Representatives in the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2012-13 is $22.691 million compared to $23.253 million in 2011-12. The committee is pleased to see that additional funding has been provided to of support the new statutory role for the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit in overseeing the Parliamentary Budget Office; however, funding for a number of other support services has not been provided. The committee notes with concern that the impact of the increased efficiency dividend will see that in the longer term the department's budgetary position will become more difficult. The committee will be assessing the position following further advice. I commend the report to the House. Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 1) Bill 2012 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Mr TONY SMITH (Casey) (18:02): This tax law amendment bill was introduced into this place on 21 March by the Assistant Treasurer. I will say at the outset that the opposition will not be opposing this bill. It has five schedules. I will very briefly run through each of them as the minister did during his introduction back in March. The first schedule disallows a deduction against rebatable benefits from 1 July 2012. This relates to a 2010 High Court case that held that study expenses incurred in gaining student Youth Allowance were able to be deducted from assessable income. In summary, that case changed what had been the previous law and practice prior to that decision. It was the position not only of this government but of previous governments, including the Howard government, that study expenses not related to employment were not tax deductible. Following the High Court decision, the government announced in the 2011-12 budget that it would disallow deductions from 1 July 2012, although it would allow them for 2010-11 and prior income years in line with the court decision. This change restores the tax position to what it was prior to that High Court decision or what the understanding of it was. The second schedule relates to limited trading stock exemptions for superannuation funds and removes the trading stock exemption to the capital gains tax primary code rule for certain assets of a complying super fund. The Assistant Treasurer outlined this schedule in some detail in his introductory speech. BILLS The third schedule is a tax exemption for ex gratia payments to New Zealand nonprotected special category visa holders. Essentially, it exempts income tax ex gratia payments to New Zealand non-protected special category visa holders paid in relation to the floods in January of this year. This schedule is necessary for consistent treatment with other previous natural disasters and payments in this regard and is non-controversial. Schedule 4 enacts a decision that the government announced, I am pretty sure, in the MYEFO with respect to the phasing out of the dependent spouse tax offset. The final schedule, as is always the way with these tax laws amendment bills, is a series of miscellaneous changes to address what are always termed 'minor technical deficiencies'. In this case, it is in the MRRT legislation, we are told, and a series of other drafting issues that are necessary. As I indicated at the outset, we will not be opposing the bill. Of course, as we have pointed out, the MRRT bills as passed were legislatively flawed-and the government knew it when they put them forward-and schedule 5 deals with very technical issues. Each of the four unrelated schedules relate to fairly technical tax issues and, as is almost always the case, the coalition comes to these debates wanting to see improvements in the technical aspects of the tax legislation, and this is no different. Mr STEPHEN JONES (Throsby) (18:07): Tax reform is continuous because it is essential that the government of the day ensures that our taxation system is fit for the purpose. Included in those purposes is regulating and encouraging activity, raising revenue and, in certain circumstances, discouraging certain activity, such as smoking cigarettes and the like. The measures contained within this series of bills go to each of those points. In most respects, they appear to have the support of all members of this House-and that is welcomed, because there have been instances where legislation intended to reform the tax system has not enjoyed support on all sides of this House-and it is probably why the Treasurer was able to stand up in his budget speech last night and deliver a budget which is going to return the budget to surplus in 2012-13 and at the same time provide additional funds for much needed social purposes. This is in complete contrast with those on the other side, who have a gaping $70 billion black hole in their budget. The reason there is a $70 billion black hole in their budget is that they are not willing do the hard yards-in particular when it comes to putting in place responsible savings measures. There are five schedules in the Tax Law Amendment (2012 Measures No. 1) Bill 2012; the first of which has the intention of putting in place amendments which will restore the intended operation of the GST law. This was made necessary because of an adverse decision in the Department of Infrastructure and Transport case. It will ensure that the supply by a healthcare provider paid for by an insurer or a government entity is treated as GST-free supply, where the related supply from the healthcare provider to an individual is GSTfree health supply. The amendments avoid increased compliance costs arising for taxpayers in the multiparty arrangements involving suppliers of health related goods and services, and have been supported by industry. The second schedule also deals with GST treatment of appropriations. The amendments again restore the policy intent of GST law following another adverse decision in 2009 of the full Federal Court in the TT-Line case. The amendments will ensure that payments under a government appropriation relating to the non-commercial activity of government related entities are not subject to GST. This was the understanding of the law prior to the TTLine decision. The amendments will ensure that there is no increase in compliance or cash-flow costs for government entities and that the Commonwealth, states and territories will not need to change their budgetary processes. Schedule 3 of the bill is a savings measure. Schedule 3 goes to the superannuation concessional contributions cap. It attempts to put back the indexation to that would otherwise have applied for the concessional contributions cap. It was expected that the indexation would increase the concessional contributions cap from $25,000 to $35,000 per annum in the year 2013-14. The pause in indexation essentially means that the cap will not now increase until 2014-15. As the higher concessional contributions cap for individuals aged 50 and over and the non-concessional contribution cap only move with changes in the general contributions cap, these contributions caps will not change in 2013-14. They are expected to generate savings in the order of $485 million over the forward estimates period. It is an important savings measure and again one that enables us to deliver a budget which will return to surplus. The fourth schedule goes to the situation where taxpayers either accidentally or inadvertently make contributions in excess of the concessional contributions, thereby attracting a greater tax upon those contributions. The measures in this bill will enable the tax office to refund-on the request of the taxpayer, without attracting any more than the marginal tax that would otherwise apply to those superannuation contributions-those excess superannuation contributions as if they had not been paid as superannuation and are just taken as any normal form of income. The fifth and sixth schedules go to the disclosure of superannuation information. The sixth schedule in particular is important because it places an obligation on employers to advise when the superannuation guarantee contributions are going to be made to their employees. This is important. It works handin-hand with the Fair Work legislation because it sends a trigger to the individual employee enabling them to check that their superannuation contributions have been made. The ATO reports that the vast majority of employers are paying in accordance with their obligations their superannuation contributions on behalf of their employees. But the 2010-11 annual report reported that there were in excess of 17,000 individual employee complaints in relation to suspected non-payment of superannuation entitlements. Nearly $269 million in superannuation entitlements was collected and deposited into employee superannuation accounts as a result of these complaints and the investigations by the tax office, and there were around $140 million in penalties. Whilst it may only be one per cent of the employer population that is not complying with their obligations, the impact on employees is profound, and that early signal to the employee, which enables them to check if they fear their superannuation contributions are not being made, saves a lot of heartache for the employee. It ensures that their entitlements are paid in full and on and alerts the tax office, as well as the employee, to other issues that may be going on inside the firm. I am very pleased that each of these schedules is enjoying the bipartisan support of all members in this place-as indeed they should. I commend this legislation to the House.",147
221,Dr LEIGH,Unknown," It is my pleasure tonight to rise on the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 1) Bill 2012. This bill is an important part of the government's economic reforms-a set of economic reforms that are laying the foundation for Australia's prosperity. It is a set of reforms that recognise we are here not just to help in solving immediate problems but also to put in place long-term solutions. I see the Assistant Treasurer in the chair here, and I would note in particular the aged care reforms, a set of reforms that are long overdue and that recognise that for too long the Howard government put bandaids on an aged care system that really needed root and branch reform. I commend him for his work on aged care reform. In the area of tax laws, this Labor government is committed to improving the tax schedule. We put in place the Henry review-a comprehensive review in the spirit of the 1975 Asprey review-which unpaid really looked right across the tax code at reforms that were needed. One of those reforms was the abolition of the dependent spouse tax offset, and this bill continues that. In an earlier bill, this parliament chose to abolish the dependent spouse tax offset, except for taxpayers with a spouse born on or before 1972. Now that date is taken back to 1952. That is an appropriate change, recognising the change in our society since the dependent spouse tax offset was put in place. It recognises that a dependent spouse tax offset was a measure that might have been appropriate in a day when most men time worked and most women were homemakers, but is not appropriate in modern Australia. In the same spirit, we are continuing to modernise a range of different tax measures. Today this House has been debating the abolition of the education tax refund and its replacement with the schoolkids bonus. That again was an updating of the tax and benefit system, and it was an updating that recognised that the education tax refund was not being claimed by one million of the 1.3 million Australians who were eligible for it. Those opposite in the debate today were arguing that the one million out of 1.3 million Australians who were not claiming the tax refund in full somehow did not want the money. Well, they would have been the first to have met an Australian who did not want $410 for a primary school child and $820 for a secondary school child. What is more likely, and the reason that we reformed that particular provision, was that Australians were simply too time poor and busy to be able to keep the receipts necessary to make those claims. One of my staff related to me a conversation she had had with friends of hers who had three young children and who were simply unaware of the education tax refund. They were on family tax benefit part A: they were doing it tough and they needed the money, but they did not know about the provision and they were not getting those benefits. As John Maynard Keynes once said: 'When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, Sir?' We on this side of the House looked at the facts and they were incontrovertible. One million out of 1.3 million Australians were not claiming the education tax refund. It just was not good enough, and we replaced it with the schoolkids bonus-a measure which goes to all Australians. Those opposite are concerned that the schoolkids bonus will not be spent on education expenses, but it is clear when you look at Australian families that they are spending substantial amounts of money on their children's education. It is unusual to see those opposite arguing that money going to families should be tied. If you like, it is a conservative notion, not a liberal notion. If you are a small 'l' liberal, then you believe in putting money in the hands of families. You trust them to do with that money what is best. If you are a conservative you do not trust families. It is the spirit of conservatism that gave rise in the United States to the food stamp system, a notion that you cannot just give poor people money, you have to give them tied moneymoney that is tied to spending on food. We in Australia have not had things like food stamps because we have trusted low-income Australians to do the right thing with money that is given to them by the government. That is the same spirit that embodies the schoolkids bonus. It is a spirit that says if you put money in the hands of parents of school-aged children they will do the right thing with that money, but it is not necessary to tie that money to educational expenditure to get a better outcome. Those opposite, taking the conservative path, distrust lowand middle-income Australians to do the right thing by their kids. We on this side of the House are taking the small 'l' liberal approach, the market-based approach-as on so many issues-by taking the view that Australians will do the right thing with money that is placed in their hands. We have seen the clear contrasts in this budget process. We have seen the strong recognition from the IMF of Australia's fiscal position and a broad recognition across economic commentators that Labor has a lower tax-toGDP ratio than the Howard government did-that it is Labor that delivered real spending cuts. It is a real contrast, in that very sense, with what happened in the Howard government under mining boom mark 1. The Howard government never had to face the tough decisions. It saw the money roll in and it just rolled it out the door. It is Labor which has made tough decisions about what we are not going to continue funding. The government is about values, priorities and making choices for things you are not going to do. That is a great Labor tradition, with finance ministers Peter Walsh, Lindsay Tanner and now Penny Wong. What it chooses not to do marks out a party as much as what it chooses to do. But in this budget we are choosing to invest in critical areas of the economy-in skills and training, in a national broadband network, in spreading the benefits of the mining boom, in putting a price on carbon and in returning the budget to surplus in 2012-13. Those opposite are like deer in the headlights. That is probably a little unfair to deer. Let us think about fish out of water. They are flip-flopping like fish out of water. We saw this in the famous budget reply of 2010. The Leader of the Opposition said that he would identify savings, and then the member for North Sydney said that he would identify savings and then the member for Goldstein was going to do it. Finally, the fish flopped here and there and was just left with an adviser at the back of the room shaking his head. We saw it with the $70 billion black hole. The member for Goldstein and the member for North Sydney went to-and-fro on talk show after talk show on whether or not the $70 billion black hole was a real figure. Sometimes they said: 'Yes, it's our figure. a big target to meet.' Sometimes they said, 'That's a Labor hoax.' They were flipflopping like a fish out of water. We have seen it in the question of entitlements. When we look to means-test benefits, such as family tax benefit part B, the baby bonus and the private health insurance rebate, those opposite say we are playing the politics of envy. They say that we are engaging in class warfare when we put in place means tests at $150,000. The shadow Treasurer went overseas and said, 'We'd like to have a Hong Kong style welfare state.' That is a pretty substantial cut to benefits, one would think. Then the Leader of the Opposition came out immediately and said: 'Oh, no. The coalition won't be cutting benefits.' They are flipflopping like fish out of water. When it comes to economic policy there is really only one member of their front-bench who does not look like a fish out of water and that is the member for Wentworth. He delivered a very thoughtful speech at a Melbourne institute event I attended here in Canberra. He spoke about his views on a sovereign wealth fund. I disagree with his conclusion that Australia needs a sovereign wealth fund but he put, quite provocatively, the argument that under the Howard government spending had sometimes got out of control, and argued that this could be the case for other governments. I can imagine his colleagues afterwards, saying: 'What were you doing up there on the surface? Surely you should be down here with us, down here swimming in the warm waters of populism.' We know what their view is on costings. We have had very clear statements that the coalition are now going to eschew the parliamentary budget office-the same parliamentary budget office that Senator Joyce and the member for Higgins said they It's would back. They backed off that because they realised how deep their budget crater is. They realised the problem they got themselves into last time, when they went to the election and were later found to have an $11 billion black hole in their costings. In response to Treasury finding the $11 billion black hole we saw the member for Mackellar and the member for Goldstein traducing the reputation of Ken Henry, a great Australian who was appointed Secretary of the Treasury by Peter Costello. Their response to Ken Henry finding that the coalition costings did not add up was a bit like the rich kid whose maths teacher finds a mistake in his homework-he immediately goes to the principal and asks for the maths teacher to be fired. They were in here attacking Ken Henry and attacking the Department of the Treasury for what they said was politicised work. It was nothing of the sort. The Department of the Treasury engaged in the same costings process for the coalition that it has engaged in for other political parties. The coalition have now moved to an audit commission. That audit commission is simply a phrase to disguise the fact that their costings will not be audited this time. Why will they not be audited? It is because when they went to the last election they discovered that audit has a legal meaning. If you want an accounting firm to audit your costings, it must afterwards say that they have been audited. I spoke yesterday in this place about the shadow Treasurer's attempts to suggest that there was such a thing as a small 'a' and that somehow the coalition could engage in a small 'a' audit rather than a large 'A' audit. Unfortunately, there is no such thing. That is where we find ourselves, with the coalition, at the moment: all promises to special interests but an inability to make the hard decisions that government requires. Government does require often unpopular decisions to be made. Certainly we would not be claiming that every decision made by this government has been greeted with universal acclaim by the Australian people. But that is true of all the major economic reforms in Australian history. Great reform is not invariably greeted with cheering in the streets. It requires steady argumentation. It requires engaging the Australian people in a long conversation about why reforms are necessary. You can imagine the Leader of the Opposition had he been leader when Australia was to float the dollar. He would have immediately engaged in fearmongering about foreign speculators. We know those opposite have engaged in fearmongering on foreigners. We see that with foreign ownership debates. 'What are foreign currency speculators doing determining the level of our dollar?' the Leader of the Opposition might have then said. In fact, we know he opposed the floating of the dollar as late as a decade after the dollar had been floated. But we now know that that was an enormously important economic reform. It acted like a shock absorber for the Australian economy. When international shocks come along, a floating exchange rate is enormously important to the prosperity of Australians. Can you imagine if the Leader of the Opposition had been leader when Australia put in place substantial tariff cuts-tariff cuts that halved the price of a pair of kids' school shoes, tariff cuts that puts thousands of dollars in the pockets of Australian audit households? They were tariff cuts which could, all too easily, have been demonised by a populist looking for short-term gain. You can imagine what the Leader of the Opposition would have done- (Time expired)  to speak, very quickly, in support of the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 1) Bill 2012. This bill is another step forward in the Gillard government's mission to reform the tax system and make it fairer for all Australians. It brings in 2011-12 budget measures aimed at fostering a prosperous and even-handed taxation system-an improved system that supports all Australians. Australian Labor governments continue to lead the way. We have led our country through global economic uncertainty to today, where it stands as a powerhouse economy on the world stage, the envy of Europe and the OECD, as acknowledged by the leader opposite-when he is in Europe. We have ensured our fiscal position remains strong despite the global financial crisis. Unlike many other nations, we have successfully avoided recession and prevented serious job losses. This alone is a record of which to be proud. But not only did we safeguard our budget position and Australian jobs; we oversaw outstanding employment growth and a record investment pipeline of $456 billion, as I heard from the Treasurer today, despite the gloom and doom predictions of those opposite of what would be happening in the minerals sector when we brought in the MRRT. More than 750,000 jobs have been created since the Labor government was first elected. Obviously there is more to be done. It is a patchy economy; we know that. While others pause we push ahead in the interests of the Australian people, and that is what this legislation is all about. A key Australian value is the concept of a fair go. This bill moves to correct inequity the tax system created by the High Court decision in the Commissioner of Taxation v Anstis case. It simply is not fair that taxpayers with the same level of income will have different deduction entitlements depending on whether they receive a taxable government assistance payment. The Anstis decision violates the basic principle that expenses incurred in generating income that is effectively tax-free should not then be deductible-that is, no money into the public purse should prohibit you from taking money out of the public purse. Overturning the High Court decision is the right thing to do in order to make the system fairer for everybody. The Gillard government is committed to helping Australian students on income support, but this must be done efficiently and effectively. Providing assistance via the transfer system is more targeted and timely. The university students of Australia have not been forgotten by Labor governments. I stress that. After a decade of underinvestment by the Howard government, Australian universities were in a dire state when Labor came to power in 2007. That is why we increased funding to universities by more than 50 per cent. Griffith University is one of Australia's most innovative tertiary institutions and its Nathan campus is located right in my electorate; I drive past it every day when I go to work. I have spoken of Griffith University many times in this chamber, and I am very proud of its numerous achievements. Many students at Griffith are already well supported by the Gillard government's measures. For example, we provide start-up scholarships worth $2,100 to students receiving youth allowance, Austudy and Abstudy living allowance. We have lowered the youth allowance age of independence in and we are helping many first-year students who must live away from home to study with relocation scholarships worth up to $4,000. This assistance, plus $1,000 in subsequent years, will go a long way to making sure that Moreton students who can no longer live at home get the best start to their tertiary education. I thank the Gillard government for its focus on nurturing tomorrow's leaders. Another function of this bill is to remove the ability of complying superannuation entities to treat certain assets-primarily shares, units in a trust and land-as trading stock. This measure will reduce present ambiguity around the application of the trading stock provisions. Another aspect of this bill which speaks to the fundamental principle of fairness in Australia is tax exemptions for payments to individuals impacted in recent flooding in New South Wales and also in my home state of Queensland. The Gillard government is making ex gratia payments to New Zealand special category visa holders who have been impacted by the 2012 floods exempt from income tax. This is in line with the payments' counterparts, the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payments, which are also exempt. We made these payments exempt for eligible New Zealand residents during the summer of sorrow in 2010-11, and again for those struck by Cyclone Yasi in February last year. New Zealanders living in western Queensland need our help to cope with the financial hardship wrought by the 2012 floodwaters just like their Australian neighbours. Natural disasters have rocked Queensland in recent times but have served to show the world the compassion and resilience that exists in Australian communities. This spirit was evident in the faces of many people in my own electorate who were hit hard by the 2011 floods. I welcome all measures to help everyone affected by this most recent natural disaster, as my community is only just starting to get back on its feet. On a different note, but still on the theme of doing the right thing, this bill extends the phasing out of a truly outdated tax offset, the dependent spouse tax offset. This relic of the tax system is better placed in a black-andwhite television show than in modern-day Australia. The dependent spouse tax offset was introduced at a time when a husband was expected to maintain a spouse, even without children, and there were limited employment opportunities for women. Considering that the leader of our country and our head of state are women, this is definitely no longer the case in modern Australia. Our action to phase out this offset is based on a recommendation from the Australia's Future Tax System Review. Actions such as this are vital as we update the tax and transfer system to better align with community expectations. It is important that all Australians who can work do so. However, we know it can be unreasonable for a spouse who has been out of the workforce for a very long time to be expected to find work. That is why we are keeping the current system for spouses who were born before 1 July 1952. In the 2011-12 budget the Gillard government introduced the carer spouse and invalid spouse tax offset to ensure that taxpayers who maintain a spouse who is unable to work because of their invalidity or carer obligations are not affected by these long overdue changes. We have also taken the limited employment opportunities in regional areas into account, making sure that taxpayers eligible for the zone tax offset will not have their entitlement affected. Finally, this bill makes miscellaneous amendments to the taxation laws. These changes are part of our commitment to look after the tax system. Such changes are made from time to time to correct technical or drafting issues, remove anomalies and correct unintended outcomes in the tax legislation; in this case the changes address minor technical issues which have been identified with the minerals resource rent tax legislation. Such bills have been aimed at delivering practical measures to support individuals, families and small businesses across Australia. We must continue to improve the quality of our systems, continually evaluating processes to ensure they suit the aims of modern Australia. This bill is a fine example of the Gillard government's commitment and I commend it to the House.",150
222,Mr BRADBURY,Unknown,"Lindsay-Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (18:38): I would like to thank those members who have contributed to this debate. Schedule 1 of the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 1) Bill 2012 implements the government's 2011-12 budget measure to disallow deductions against government assistance payments. The measure reinstates the principle that stood prior to the High Court decision, in Commissioner of Taxation v Anstis, that taxpayers should not be able to claim a deduction for expenses they incur in qualifying for government assistance income. Disallowing deductions against rebateable benefits recognises that these benefits are effectively tax free because of the operation of the beneficiary tax offset. This measure is important as it restores equity in the tax system so that individuals with the same level of income pay the same amount of tax. The measure is also important as it provides certainty to taxpayers on the scope of eligible deductions. The government provides targeted and timely assistance to the students who need it the most through the transfer system. Measures this government has introduced include startup scholarships for new students, relocation scholarships for students who need to live away from home to study and a reduction in the age of independence for youth allowance to 22 from 1 January 2012. Schedule 2 amends the income tax law to clarify the tax treatment of certain assets owned by a complying superannuation entity, including shares, units in a trust land. These changes remove the ability of complying superannuation entities to treat these assets as trading stock, which is consistent with the general industry practice of treating shares on capital account. Schedule 3 provides an exemption for ex gratia payments made to certain New Zealand visa holders affected by the recent floods in New South Wales and Queensland. Exempting these payments from income tax maximises the amount of payments that individuals receive and is consistent with the tax exemption provided to the equivalent payments to Australians, which is the Australian government disaster recovery the payment. It is also consistent with the exemption provided for ex gratia payments to certain New Zealanders affected by the 2010-11 floods and Cyclone Yasi. Schedule 4 of this bill implements the government's 2011-12 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook measure to phase out the dependent spouse tax offset for dependent spouses born on or after 1 July 1952. The dependent spouse tax offset needs to be reformed to allow for Australia's modern and growing economy. This reform is an important measure to reduce the disincentive for dependent spouses without children to undertake paid employment. Taxpayers with a dependent spouse aged 60 or over on 1 July 2012 will not be affected by this measure, nor will dependent spouses with children, or taxpayers whose dependent spouse is a carer, an invalid or permanently unable to work. Taxpayers eligible for the zone, overseas forces or overseas civilian tax offsets are also not affected by this measure. Schedule 5 rectifies some minor technical and machinery errors which have been identified in the taxation laws. The government periodically progresses and miscellaneous amendments like these as part of its care and maintenance of the taxation laws. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading",156

224,Mr MORRISON,Unknown," Australia's student visa industry is of enormous importance to Australia's national economy and it enjoys the strong support of members on this side of the House, as it has for many years. At its peak in 2009 there were more than 491,000 international students enrolled in courses in Australia, generating $18.6 billion and making it the nation's third largest export industry, behind coal and iron ore. At the start of this financial year more than half of the 332,700 international students in Australia were studying at universities, while a third were on vocational training visas studying diploma courses. Our student visa population is made up of students from more than 197 countries. Students from China and India, our top source countries, make up about a third of the students here on visas. The majority of students choose to study mainly in New South Wales, my home state, or in Victoria. In the decade leading to 2009-10 the student visa program grew at an average of 15 per cent per year. Australia's share of the international student market increased from 5.1 per cent in 2000 to seven per cent in 2009, making Australia the largest provider of international education services in 2009 behind the United States, at 18 per cent, and the United Kingdom, at 10 per cent. A recent paper on the student visa industry last year by the Bureau of Statistics observed that, considering the relative size of Australia's population, such high representation in the international student market was indicative of the ongoing importance of this sector to Australia, both economically and for communities. We certainly do punch above our weight when it comes to competing in the space of international education. Following a series of government measures between 2008 and 2011, along with other factors such as the strong dollar, more competition for students overseas and the damage done to Australia's reputation following attacks on Indian students, enrolments fell by between 10 and 30 per cent. A large number of colleges that were aimed at providing courses purely for migration purposes collapsed as a result. In 2009-10 student visa applications dropped by 19 per cent, making that the first year of negative growth in total applications. The negative growth continued in 2010-11, when international education activity contributed $16 billion to our economy and there were just 141,600 applications lodged offshore-a drop of 20 per cent on the previous program year. According to the ABS, declines in student visa applications have been most prominent in the VET sector, despite 150 per cent growth in that sector between 2006-07 and 2008-09. The number of student visa holders in Australia dropped by 13 per cent between June 2010 and June 2011. Given the significant contribution the international student sector makes to our economy, and not only to that economy but also to our society more broadly, protecting the future success of this industry and enabling it to remain competitive is, and should be, an ongoing priority for all members of this place. It is therefore extremely concerning that the Auditor General found last year that management of this critical industry and of the visa program was not sufficiently robust to effectively meet the challenges involved in achieving the government's objective for the student visa program of balancing industry growth and program integrity. The ANAO found that more than 350,000 non-compliance notices issued to students had not been acted upon, prompting fears that the backlog could obscure serious cases of non-compliance. The Auditor-General's report in May 2011 also found the department was unable to effectively monitor the 20-hour work restriction on student visas or to enforce compliance, because of the lack of an appropriate regulatory regime. In June 2011 Michael Knight, a former Labor minister in New South Wales, presented his review of the student visa program to the government with 41 recommendations, which included measures to introduce a more targeted, strategic analysis of non-compliance. On 22 September last year, Ministers Evans and Bowen announced the government's response and accepted all of the 41 recommendations made in that report. On 22 March this year, this bill was introduced into the House to enact recommendation 24-that is, to remove the blanket automatic cancellation regime currently in place for student visa holders who breach the academic progress or attendance requirement, and replace it with a more targeted strategic analysis of non-compliance. While the government has agreed to adopt the recommendations of the Knight reviewand we believe this will go some way towards addressing these issues in relation to Australian universities-the coalition awaits with interest a second report in mid-2012 to tackle these issues across the international education sector more broadly-something that has so far been ignored. It is necessary to ensure that Australia's reputation in the provision of excellence in education is not compromised by linking those outcomes with migration outcomes. We are in the business of selling world-class education; we are not in the business of selling education visas as a pathway to permanent residence. We will look carefully at the legislative and regulatory changes when they are introduced into parliament to ensure that the proposed changes address the issues and do not create more unintended consequences. With that in mind, the coalition does not, in principle, oppose this bill as we believe that, on the face of it, the bill seeks to streamline and better target resources towards migration fraud and non-compliance in the student visa sector. This is important because the Australian public has to have confidence in the integrity of our immigration program. When they lose that confidence, then any opportunities for us to continue to advance the immigration program-which has been what has brought luck to the lucky country in so many respects-are lost. We already know of the serious and significant failures of the government in other areas of the immigration program, particularly in relation to the illegal entry of boats to Australia and the chaos that has been created there, which I will not dwell on this evening. Australians have lost confidence in this government's ability to run an immigration program effectively, securely and successfully. In this area it is important that we ensure integrity measures are in place. The coalition will always support measures that improve the integrity of the immigration program. Further clarification is going to be required as to the thresholds, the definitions and the trigger points that would accompany the new compliance regime. In particular, we need to be clear about the resource requirements that this new regime will demand. The coalition awaits with great interest the final report from the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee that is due on 18 June this year. This bill will serve as an eraser to the embarrassing administrative backlog of the government's own creation, wiping out the administrative backlog of over 350,000 non-compliance notices created by Labor's mismanagement of this scheme. If the department could not handle these mandatory notices, it is hard to see how it will find the resources to manage a discretionary regime with the kind of integrity that Australian taxpayers and Australian citizens would expect, given the pressures that are placed upon the Department of Immigration and Citizenship as a result of the government's policy failures, particularly on our borders. The rationale for introducing a mandatory cancellation regime was to ensure that basic threshold requirements, such as actually attending an educational institution and passing a course of study, were met as an absolute requirement of holding a student visa-no exceptions. After all, if you are not attending your classes and you are not passing your course, you obviously have no need of a student visa and one has to wonder what your purpose is in being here in the place. At the end of 2010, the Auditor-General found there were more than 250,000 students who had failed to comply with one or the other of these requirements and had been issued with non-compliance notices. None of these notices had been dealt with. In the three months of 2011 alone, more than 30,000 new non-compliance notices were issued every month. The Knight review found that around 35 per cent of these-over one-third-fell into the high risk categories. The fact that this important compliance regime fell apart under this government is not surprising. Enforcing compliance and upholding the integrity and robustness of Australia's immigration program is, though, in the vanguard of what the coalition believes should be the approach to immigration, including Australia's student visa program. I note with some concern that last week there were reports of serious allegations of fraud and non-compliance in other areas of the migration program. They concerned applications coming through our post in Islamabad. As yet there has been no explanation from the government. There has been no announcement of how many cases have been referred to the Australian Federal Police, of how many prosecutions are pending, of how many visas have been potentially compromised or of how many investigations have been launched into cases referred to the Migration Review Tribunal which could have been connected to what those whistleblowers in-post were suggesting might have been fraudulent activity. All of these matters have gone completely unaddressed despite the fact that, in the same report on 7.30, the department's own spokesperson acknowledged that there had been a problem-and there was a problem. All of these matters remain unaddressed and first dismissed. These matters of integrity are incredibly important, and I accept that the government is with this bill seeking to address them. But there will be questions about how effective the measures in the bill are, and, as we go through the Senate committee process, we hope to learn more first about how they are going to be addressed. So the coalition will be watching very closely to ensure that this new regime is properly resourced to deliver compliance and integrity in our student visa program. It is important that everyone seeking to game this system be identified, that their visas be cancelled and that they be promptly removed. The Senate committee report should go some way to providing clarification on the new regime, the practice of which will also need to be scrutinised. I note that the government has as usual failed to manage its legislative program in this place in such a way as to ensure that the Senate's report is completed and made available to the parliament prior to its being brought before this House for a decision. I hoped that we would have had the opportunity for the measures in the bill to be looked at further before it is brought to a decision and to make any amendments that may be required as a result of the interrogation of the bill. In good faith the coalition is not going to oppose this bill in this place. It will come under scrutiny in the other place, and we will consider the matter in closer detail once there has been the opportunity for a review. I hope that, once the review is concluded, any concerns-if indeed there are any-can be resolved. I go now to some of the more technical points about the bill. The bill seeks to amend two items of legislation: the Migration Act and the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000. This legislation sets out the consequences of non-compliance for student visa holders who fail to meet mandatory course attendance participation requirements. Currently, students who fail to meet either of these are, as I noted before, subject to the automatic cancellation of their visa. Under the ESOS Act, education providers are required to monitor course progress and attendance of international students and must at minimum intervene where an international student has failed more than 50 per cent of the units attempted in any one study period or is at risk of failing to attend between 70 per cent and 80 per cent of total course contact hours. Where achievement or attendance has not been satisfactory, the education provider must report the 8202 breach to the Department of Innovation, Industry, Science, Research and Tertiary Education. Currently, under section 137J of the Migration Act, the automatic cancellation of a student visa is triggered when the student receives a notice of breach under section 20 of the ESOS Act. The student then has 28 days to comply with the notice or to attend a departmental office to make submissions about the breach and circumstances leading to the breach; otherwise, the visa is cancelled and the student is excluded from applying for further visas for up to three years. Any family-dependent visa holders would also have their visas cancelled. This blanket non-compliance regime would be replaced under this bill by a system in which information conveyed by student course variations is used as an input into a more targeted and strategic analysis of non-compliance, and for the assessment of the individual circumstances of student visa holders. This bill would prevent registered providers from sending those notices under section 20 to a student visa holder who breaches a prescribed condition of their visa, effectively repealing the automatic and cancellation under the Migration Act. This bill proposes that, rather than blanket cancellation rules being applied, cases of non-compliance be examined in the context of the minister's discretionary powers under section 116 of the Migration Act to allow infringements to be investigated and prioritised according to risk, taking into account individual or extenuating circumstances. What is important here from our perspective is that we know what the threshold tests are going to be and that we understand how they are going to screen, identify, target and then act upon those cases of non-compliance that warrant action. This is a difficult task. I welcome the more riskoriented approach rather than the blanket approach. We do not want to create a bureaucratic merry-go-round and a paper trail and a paper chase in this area simply the sake of it; we need to target. I think that these areas will require very close attention when dealing with the genuine and very real cases of potential fraud and of non-compliance within our immigration program. What is necessary is a clear understanding of the resources, of the processes, of the intentions, of the transparency and of the opportunity to further ensure that we are targeting areas of risk. Whether it is student visas, work visas, holiday visas, protection visas-any element of our visa program-it is absolutely critical that we uphold the integrity of our program at every single stage of the process because when you fail to uphold the integrity of either the construction of the program or its administration you are at great risk of allowing this program to fall victim to a lack of confidence from the Australian community. The coalition is committed to the integrity of our immigration program. We believe strongly in our immigration program. We want to see it succeed and to see it welcomed, appreciated and supported in the Australian community. In that spirit we welcome the measures that are put forward in this bill and we look forward to further scrutiny of them in the other place. NA",157
225,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown," Order! It being so close to 7 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Budget",161
226,Ms LEY,Unknown," It is the day after the federal budget-a budget which sees this government talking the talk of fiscal for consolidation but walking the walk of reckless spending and of injecting money into their latest vote-buying exercise, whatever it takes. What a walk of shame this is. When I read through the details of this budget I am in despair and disappointment about its effect on my electorate of Farrer. The budget is dominated completely by the carbon tax-even though it was not really mentioned by the Treasurer in his speech. It is, without doubt, the elephant in the room. On 6 July last year, I extended a very warm welcome to the Prime Minister to come to my electorate to talk to my constituents face to face about her government's proposed carbon tax. My letter was penned in this House 309 days ago. I have had no reply; the invitation is still open for acceptance. The carbon tax is the overriding concern for families and individual members of my electorate, and there is a good reason. They know that it will push up the prices of everything-especially electricity, groceries and health care. If you want an idea of how this carbon tax will hit them-one you might not immediately think of-there is no better example than my home town of Albury, where the local council has just factored in the impact of the new carbon tax. The irony is that in the very first year Albury City Council expects to have a zero carbon tax liability. Despite there being apparently no impact, Albury has just drafted its budget for 2012-13 and it will bump up rates by over $150 a year per household. The mayor reported that the increases are needed to meet future carbon tax liabilities and increasing electricity and fuel costs. There will be an eight per cent increase in our electricity charges alone due to the carbon tax. The council has also calculated that the extra cost to recover for future local waste collection will be an extra $35 per annum per household for domestic waste. From day one, year one, my constituents are being hit, and that is before they even leave their house. I was in Broken Hill at the fabulous Agfair last weekend, meeting the people of the far west of New South Wales. It was with them in mind that I looked through the budget last night and I found one thing-one item of any specific note for my electorate, which covers a third of rural New South Wales. The University of Sydney Department of Rural Health in Broken Hill has received money in the federal budget for part of a regional health package: $4.7 million. It was a project that I and many others supported and we are grateful. The Rural Doctors Association has welcomed the investment, with a big 'but'; the chief executive said that the budget does not do enough to ensure that rural communities have enough medical staff. infrastructure spending might be still in place-just-but the actual incentives to get medical allied doctors et cetera to the bush not there. On ABC Radio today, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Bernie Ripoll, said that the government is focused on keeping doctors in rural jobs. But why does this government get it wrong time and again? That was the program that was cut back in last night's budget. Over the next four years, $5.454 billion is being stripped from Defence. This cut, of around 10 per cent, is the biggest single reduction in Defence investment since the end of the Korean War-but in entirely different strategic circumstances. I have Bandiana Army Base in the electorate of Indi, close to me in Albury-Wodonga. There is Kapooka in the electorate of Riverina, and the member for Riverina is concerned about that. There is also Mulwala, which is where propellant is manufactured for explosives and bullets that are used overseas. I will be watching very closely to make sure that none of these facilities is affected by this budget. I also place on record my great concern for the veterans not only from the Korean and Vietnam wars but also from Iraq, Afghanistan and our peacekeeping forces, who need care and attention from the Department of Veterans' Affairs. The government had better not be cutting one single dollar from looking after our returned service men and women. There is disappointing news from the Murray-Darling Basin in my electorate, and I will talk about that at another time. Essentially, the government is allocating over $1 billion to water buybacks post 2015- (Time expired) Australian Marine Engineers",161
227,Mr MURPHY,Unknown," I have been approached by constituents who are The concerned about the standards of training for Australian marine engineers and proposals to change the current standards. I place on the is record the following salient facts about the profession of marine engineering and the importance of maintaining the current standards of training. Marine engineers are the officers employed on ships and other maritime vessels who are responsible for the operation and maintenance of the ship's machinery. This includes the main propulsion machinery with all its control systems and the steering gear. It also includes all of the ancillary machinery that provides electrical power for the vessel, the fuel storage and transfer system, and fire-fighting systems. The standards of training and certification of marine engineers are covered by Marine Orders, which are regulations under the Navigation Act. These Marine Orders, or MOs, are issued by the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority-AMSA. Marine Orders Part 3, or MO3, is the Marine Order dealing with qualifications of deck officers and ratings, as well as of marine engineers. Concerns have been raised with me about the reduction of standards that has been proposed in a draft MO3 circulated by AMSA in late 2011. One effect of the proposed changes is that the training time for marine engineers will be reduced from the current 36 months to 12 months-that is, from three years to one year. There are serious concerns that this period is inadequate to produce a highly skilled technical officer with the understanding and expertise to deal with the complex systems of modern vessels. One Australian shipping operator has suggested that the current minimum period should actually be increased to 42 months. It should be noted that the minimum period was four years not that long ago. This minimum training period includes theory training in college, workshop service ashore and qualifying sea service on a ship. Whilst the current Australian standard of 36 months of education for an engineer cadet could well need to be reviewed, a reduction to 12 months is not the answer. All stakeholders should meet to discuss and agree on what should constitute an AMSA approved marine engineer cadetship and the outcome should be inserted in the Marine Order. Furthermore, any reduction to the amount of sea service required to obtain a specific certificate of competency would have the flow-on effect of lowering the standard of Australian certification. Another major concern regarding the draft MO3 that has been brought to my attention is that entry into the marine engineering training courses would be open to persons who do not possess the prerequisites currently required for new entrants. These prerequisites are either HSC-level passes in English, mathematics and physics or relevant trade qualifications. In the area of theoretical knowledge, of particular importance to marine engineers are, of course, the subjects of mathematics and science, including electrotechnology and perhaps steam propulsion systems. A third concern that has come to my attention is the proposed deletion of the current mandatory requirement to demonstrate practical proficiency by successfully completing an oral examination conducted by a qualified examiner of marine engineers. Examiners employed by AMSA cannot conduct practical examinations onboard ships and so the oral examination is the crucial final step in the training process to ensure the standards of training are maintained. Deletion of the oral examination would be a retrograde step, as it could allow a reduction of the training process to end in the granting of a certificate of competency to a person who may not actually be competent as a marine engineer in any practical sense. Therefore, there should be no weakening of the current regulation that a certificate will not be issued until the applicant has passed an oral examination conducted by an AMSA examiner. The constituents who have approached me want to see that good maritime standards are maintained. In particular, they are concerned about the standards of training for Australian marine engineers and proposals to reduce current standards. I, too, share concerns. The Nationals",162
228,Mr CROOK,Unknown," I was elected to federal parliament as the Nationals member for O'Connor, with a clear mandate to deliver a better deal for my electorate and a better deal for all of regional Western Australia. Throughout the 2010 federal election campaign, I was critical of both major parties for their unwillingness to deliver back to regional Western Australia. With a tightly contested federal election campaign likely to deliver a hung parliament, it became apparent that there was more to gain for my electorate and regional WA by remaining outside of the federal National Party room and sitting on the crossbench. I campaigned strongly on this platform. While at the time this was a difficult decision, it was a decision I made with the full support of the Western Australian National Party and a decision based on the best interests of my electorate of O'Connorthat being a member of the crossbench in a hung parliament provided more opportunities to deliver. I stand by that decision, and my influential position on the crossbench allowed me to deliver some strong outcomes for my electorate in the first 18 months of parliament. In the first few months of being elected I was able to secure $1.2 million in funding from the federal government for the Albany Community Care Respite Centre. Other successes have included more than $6 million in federal government funding for the Albany Centenary of ANZAC Alliance and $2 million towards planning for the PortLink intermodal transport hub in Kalgoorlie. These have been positive outcomes for my electorate. I have always used my position on the crossbench to vote in the best interests of their regional Western Australia. One of my most controversial votes in parliament was my decision to support the federal government's flood levy. It attracted some criticism, however; the negotiations included for the flood levy to be extended to the flood damaged Carnarvon, and I ensured that no Carnarvon resident who was affected by flooding would be made to pay the flood levy. The flood levy was also used to lend assistance to the communities of Laverton, Leonora, Menzies, Nungarin, and the Shire of Ngaanyatjarraku, following heavy storms and flooding in February last year, through the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements. Without the flood levy, this assistance would not have been made available for these communities and the state government and local residents would have been left to carry this burden without federal government support. It was my crucial vote that saw the plain packaging legislation for cigarettes passed unamended. It was also my position that ultimately prevented the Labor government from introducing into the parliament its Malaysia solution for the processing of asylum seekers. In the face of these results, I absolutely stand by my decision to sit on the crossbench over the past 18 months. The nature of politics is dynamic and recently we have seen the make-up of the federal parliament change. With these changes I believe the crossbench is no longer the best place to advocate for regional Western Australia. Last night's federal budget was disappointing for the people of regional WA and further vindicated my decision to leave the crossbench. I want to lend my voice to the campaign against the Labor government and allow regional Western Australia to be better represented in any alternative government that arises as a result of the next federal election. The federal Nationals and the Nationals WA, while maintaining some differences, also share some key similarities. It was to the team of Warren Truss and Tony Abbott that I gave my confidence and support following the 2010 federal election. Around 90 per cent of my votes in this parliament have aligned with the federal Nationals. We have stood side by side on key issues affecting regional Western Australia, such as opposing the carbon tax and the mining tax. I thank them and the Liberals for their support of my amendments to the mining tax. In terms of policy, we both believe more investment is needed in regional Australia. I have made the decision, with the unanimous support of the Nationals WA State Council, to campaign for a better deal for regional WA inside the federal Nationals party room. I certainly will not be taking a step back on my election commitment to reform GST funding and create a fairer and more transparent GST system for all states and territories. I also will not be taking backwards on gaining support for a federal regional development policy on par with the Western Australian state government's Royalties for Regions program. I thank the Nationals team, including Nationals WA Leader Brendon Grylls, federal leader Warren Truss, Federal Director Scott Mitchell and Federal President John Tanner for their commitment towards delivering a better outcome for regional Western Australia. I also thank the members of the National Party for their very warm welcome into their party room, and members of the Liberal Party who have supported my move. I also take this opportunity to thank Prime Minister Julia Gillard for her willingness to engage with me on issues important to my electorate. Along with the Prime Minister, Ministers Warren Snowden, Anthony Albanese, Kate Ellis and Jenny Macklin have also visited O'Connor over the past 18 months, and I thank each of them for their interest and commitment to my electorate. I also thank my crossbench colleagues for taking part in this journey with me; I appreciate your friendship and support to me as a first-time member of parliament. I thank you all. I look forward to continuing to represent O'Connor and regional Western Australia with the federal National Party. (Time expired) Ipswich Motorway",164
229,Mr NEUMANN,Unknown," To paraphrase the words of the Queensland Times newspaper of the 26 April 2012, the Ipswich Motorway pain is over at last. This federal Labor government committed $1.95 billion for the Dinmore to Goodna section of the Ipswich Motorway. The Dinmore to Goodna section was delivered by the Origin Alliance, comprising the Queensland Department of Transport and Main Roads, a step Abigroup Contractors, Fulton Hogan, Seymour Whyte, SMEC Australia and Parsons Brinckerhoff Australia. The motorway has been the bane of the lives of the people who live in the western corridor between Ipswich and Brisbane. I parked on the Ipswich Motorway with a bumper sticker given out freely and readily and applied to cars in the western corridor. But the completion of the Dinmore to Goodna section of the Ipswich Motorway enhances opportunities for commerce and creates a faster and easier commute between Ipswich and Brisbane, the capital of Queensland. The new motorway provides a level of safety for people, and they deserve it. About 95,000 cars a day travel along the Dinmore to Goodna section of the Ipswich Motorway-up from 70,000 just five years ago. The volumes are expected to grow as Ipswich is one of the fastest-growing regions in Australia. The new motorway has a capacity of 180,000 cars a day, which is expected to be reached in 2032. It can then be made four lanes. I am not quite sure that I will see it, but I look forward to that day. The Ipswich mayor, Paul Pisasale-I congratulate him on his recent victory in the council elections-was, and is, thrilled with the new road. He said recently: The motorway is looking fantastic and it generates a new level of respect for the city Ipswich. Every day the road becomes more bearable for the people of Ipswich. I understand Councillor Pisasale, speaking at an RDA function at the University of Queensland's Ipswich campus, said: How good is the Ipswich Motorway? You watch Ipswich come ahead now. I have 10 meetings in the next few weeks with large companies wanting to move here. It is not just the three lanes each way-the new service roads have made a big difference: the northern service road from Brisbane Street in Ipswich Central to MCEwan Street, Riverview; the southern service road connecting Law Street, Redbank, to Aberdare Street, Dinmore; the Smiths Road extension connecting Mine Street, Redbank, to Smiths Road, Goodna, which assists not only the people of Goodna but also the people of Redbank. It also assists in the commerce between St Ives shopping centre in Goodna and Redbank Plaza. We are talking about approximately 17 bridges being demolished and 31 new ones being built and approximately 70 new retaining walls; we have widened the motorway from four lanes to six, with provision for eight lanes in the future. There have been major upgrades to intersections; new and improved pedestrian and cycle paths; new road and pedestrian bridges and new motorway crossings connections; new local connection roads, as I said, and remediation works on the abandoned mines. After years of neglect and three federal election campaigns where this road was opposed by the coalition, including a policy of stopping construction on the Ipswich Motorway at the last election, I can truly say to the people of the western corridor, 'This federal Labor government has delivered an important nation-building infrastructure project for the benefit of people in South East Queensland.' If the coalition had won of the 2007 federal election, it would have been left dangerous, congested and untouched. I want to thank my good friend Mr Ripoll, the member for Oxley. He and I have campaigned on this issue for year after year, fighting valiantly against those oppositethe forces of conservatism who believe in inaction, inertia and idleness when it comes to road construction in Queensland. Those opposite opposed every cent we have put into nation-building funding across the Warrego Highway and throughout the roads in Queensland-$8.5 billion of federal government road, rail and port funding in Queensland-double what the Howard government spent in is time in office. I thank Gerald 'Mango' Murphy-that is his real name, everyone knows him as that-the project manager from the Department of Transport and Main Roads, Queensland; Cindy Thomas, the community engagement person from Origin Alliance; and all the workers from Origin Alliance for their overwhelming community response to and engagement with this issue. I look forward to next week when Minister Albanese, who has been a great champion of this road, meets with me and the member for Oxley to officially open this road for the benefit of the people of the western corridor. Congratulations to all involved in the construction of this wonderful facility. Carbon Pricing",165
230,Ms MARINO,Unknown," The Labor Party's carbon tax is a direct attack on Australian households and businesses. It is a new tax on every power point in every house and business, and we have now had confirmation that it will rip millions of dollars out of a number of businesses in the south-west of Western Australia. The release of the incomplete liable entities list last week confirmed the bad news for some key service providers and employers. The list of companies operating in the Forrest electorate that are included the government's carbon tax hit list include: Alcoa, Alinta, Worsley Alumina, the Dampier to Bunbury Natural Gas pipeline, Verve Energy, Synergy, Iluca, Millenium Inorganic Chemicals, Simcoa, the Griffin Coal Mining Company now owned by Lanco Infratech, Water Corporation, Wesfarmers Kleenheat Gas, Wespine and Yancoal Australia Ltd. All of these companies will have to review their operations and will have no choice but to work out how, in tough economic times, they will either absorb or pass on the costs. The power companies Verve Energy and Synergy will have to put up their prices so we will all pay more for our electricity. Verve faces a $165 million tax hit on its Collie operations alone. will have to pay the carbon tax, so we can expect to pay more for gas. Added to this, the Dampier to Bunbury Natural Gas Pipeline will also be hit. They will have to pass on this cost by raising the price of gas supply to Alinta, who will in turn pass it on to consumers-so gas prices will take a double carbon tax hit. This is just one simple example of the compounding effects of the carbon tax. The Water Corporation will pass on this new tax to its customers, so a lot of the south-west's residents will be paying more for water and sewerage. A lot of private companies will not be able to pass on the cost of the tax because they sell into competitive international markets, but their market competitors here and overseas will not have to pay this tax. What a gift that is to Australia's market competitors! Alcoa, Worsley, Iluca, Millenium, Simcoa and Wespine will have to absorb the cost of this new tax. It will impact on their bottom lines, undermine any expansion plans and could threaten jobs into the future. Simcoa, for example, faces a tax hit of $2.5 million every year, before any industry in assistance it might get, and if they continue their expansion they could be hit for every furnace they add. They will be hit. This will be on top of a minimum 10 per cent increase in power costs and increased gas costs which will also cost the company millions. Whilst these companies may get some compensation in the way of free permits, they still face major carbon costs, and a cost that will increase from $25 to $29 a tonne in three years. Coal suppliers to our power stations are expected to be hit by the carbon tax, but they may not be able to recoup the cost due to long-term, set contracts. This will have a negative impact on an industry beset with problems. Of course, companies not on the list Alinta should take no comfort. An incompetent all government has, naturally, produced an incomplete list. Labor's legislation means any company producing over 25,000 tonnes of emissions is required to measure their emissions and pay the tax. But many companies do not yet know what they emit. There are hundreds of Australian companies that may have emissions of that level who will now be looking and spending thousands of dollars working out what their emissions actually are so that they can then spend millions paying Labor's tax. I want to warn companies, particularly those in my electorate, that the government is not going to advise you if you are liable to pay the carbon tax. So, do not take any comfort from that incomplete list that you saw a week ago. The government has placed the responsibility and the liability firmly onto you as a company and you as part of the industry. There will be others around the south-west, other than those on the comprehensive list that I mentioned, who do not know yet whether they will have to pay this new Labor government carbon tax. Businesses face significant penalties if they get it wrong. another cost, it is another risk and it is another major burden for businesses to carry. As I said, there are a number of businesses and entities in the south-west that will be impacted on. Look at the millions and millions of dollars that this government is going to rip out of the south-west of Western Australia. More from the south-west! It comes from a Labor Party giving us an incomplete list, threatening industries, hitting on households, and it is no doubt an incompetent government. (Time expired) Health Services",167
231,Ms RISHWORTH,Unknown," I rise today to talk about the importance of good healthcare services. I am proud to be part of a government that has done so much to invest in better healthcare services. Of course, we still need to keep up the effort and we need to keep investing. However, I am pleased to be part of a government that turned around years of neglect under the previous Howard government. During the break from parliament in April I was able to go and see first hand some great funded initiatives that are impacting on and improving the lives of people in my electorate. On 12 April I was able to attend the opening of one of BreastScreen Australia's upgrades, namely their clinic in Marion in South Australia. The federal government made a commitment of $120 million to upgrade breast screen equipment to digital mammography, which has funded the upgrade of the Marion clinic and also has funded an upgrade of technology in Noarlunga. Both of these clinics service my electorate. This technology is truly a breakthrough technology. It allows for early detection of breast cancer. The minister and I got to speak with staff It is first hand to see how this will impact. With the improved screening capacity that will come from this funding, 30 per cent more South Australians will have access to this service. That will mean 23,000 more South Australian women will have access by 2015. This is critical in terms of early detection and in ensuring that we save the lives of many, many women, including those that come from my electorate. In addition to what we saw with the improved capacity, this new technology is much more comfortable for patients, and this was something that I got to hear about first hand from the staff, the radiographers and the patients at the clinic. The patients said that it is much more comfortable to have the screens, and the staff said that it is much easier for them to manipulate the equipment. This is a good investment and is something that is really improving lives and, hopefully, will save many lives in my electorate. In addition I was also able to attend the opening of the Flinders Centre for Innovation in Cancer. This is a collaborative initiative, and I would like to congratulate the many, many people who have worked for many years to put this centre together. This is something that will be at the apex of cancer research and treatment in Australia. It is, once again, an example of South Australia batting well above its weight. One of the key things of the centre is to bring research, treatment, clinicians and a whole range of people together to translate what they know into improved clinical outcomes. That is really critical. The federal government contributed $10 million to the centre, and money was also raised from private organisations, from members of the community and from the state government. There was real ownership over it. I think it will have some wonderful benefits for cancer sufferers right around Australia. I would like to make the point that it is not just the official health professionals that make a difference-they do a great job-but it is also volunteers in cancer support groups that make a real contribution to helping the people suffering from cancer and helping their families. In particular I mention the Fleurieu Cancer Network's Friendship Support Group. This group is instrumental in connecting people suffering from cancer, along with their families and friends, to provide support understanding and to share experiences. This can be so important as people go through cancer treatment, cancer therapy and eventually come out the other end. Indeed, cancer does change some people's lives forever, even when they have recovered. This group fosters and improves community participation and advocates as well. I take this opportunity to thank two people in particular who have been the backbone of this group-Artie and Julie Ferguson. They have volunteered many hours of their time helping people in our local community in the City of Onkaparinga. These are just some examples. I could not get to the diabetes program that I visited, which I did want to also talk about. That program is, once again, making a difference to people's lives in South Australia. There are many initiatives funded by this federal government, and I am pleased that we are making a difference to health care in our community. (Time expired) Flinders Electorate: Sorrento Post Office",168
232,Mr HUNT,Unknown," I wish to raise the issue of the Sorrento Post Office and postal services in Sorrento, Victoria within my electorate of Flinders. There are two concerns that the residents of Sorrento have about the current circumstances of the post office. There is a proposal that the post office be closed down and that it be replaced by a licensed post office. There is also great concern about the heritage status of this building. To his credit the CEO of Australia Post, Ahmed Fahour, spoke with me recently in response to concerns that we had raised on Cancer behalf of local constituents. I am pleased to be able to convey not just to the House but in particular to the people of Flinders and the residents of Sorrento that he made a rockand solid guarantee-and I utterly believe thisthat the postal services will stay in Sorrento and that the hours will be extended, assuming that an appropriate local provider can be found. There will be a tender process, but the rock-solid guarantee I have from the CEO of Australia Post, who has personally engaged with this issue in response to our representations, is that Sorrento postal services will be not just maintained but extended. Nevertheless, my first preference is that of the majority of people in Sorrento. It is to keep the old post office. But, given that this tender process is underway, I think it is critical to have reassurance that the services will be retained and ideally extended, potentially by as many as 10, 15 or even 20 hours a week, with the potential for Saturday and Sunday services for the first time. Beyond the question of postal services is the issue of protection of the heritage building. Again, I thank Ahmed Fahour for his commitment that the building is heritage listed and that Australia Post will ensure it will be used-whether they sell it or whether they lease it-for purposes compatible with that heritage listing. There is, however, one development of extreme concern that has nothing to do with Australia Post. It has everything to do with bad faith by the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Mr Tony Burke, I would assert. In recent weeks we have discovered buried away in the minutiae of the minister's departmental website a decision by the minister in May last year to quietly remove some of the post office's heritage protection. It is very curious that the minister quietly sought to remove some of the Sorrento Post Office's heritage protection. I remind the House what is special about this post office building. It has been in operation since 1905. It is one of the oldest post offices in Australia and I am advised it is the oldest Commonwealth era post office in Victoria still under Commonwealth ownership, control and continuing usage. It is also a beautiful building. So to lose these heritage values would be of deep concern. It is my understanding that, were the building sold, it would automatically lose the remaining Commonwealth heritage list status and therefore it would potentially lose all of its heritage protection. I call on the minister to undo the damage he has done and to commence the process of listing the Sorrento Post Office on the National Heritage List. If it was good enough for the Commonwealth Heritage List, it should be good enough for the National Heritage List. I will be writing to the minister for the environment and heritage to list the Sorrento Post Office on the National Heritage List. That way we can be assured that, whatever its use, it will be done in a way that is compatible with the great historic capacities and nature of this building. It is that deeply disappointing that, in the dark of night under the cover of a back page buried in the internet, the minister has stripped away heritage protection. He should apologise and he should address this damage. (Time expired) Beef Industry",169
233,Ms SAFFIN,Unknown," Tonight I am going to raise three issues of concern to local beef producers, as they are indeed of concern to other producers across Australia. These are the current role and structure of the Cattle Council of Australia and of Meat and Livestock Australia, and the whole structure of the meat industry; their ability to adequately represent all producers, particularly the smaller ones; and the state of the meat processing industry, notably the decline of abattoirs across Australia. The current structure of the CCA and the MLA has to change so that they can provide better representation in the other activities they carry out for those they represent and make the process of selecting members of those bodies democratic. It is a 1998 model and is not serving the current needs, markets, trends and the producers. The bigger the herd, the bigger the vote is how it works now. Those times are past and a compelling case for change has been made by small producers and increasingly even larger ones who are dissatisfied. A local farmer has put it this way: he says a democratic election process and a requirement to have beef products accurately described in a simple and understandable manner at a consumer level would be an excellent start to improving the industry's situation. The number of bodies has been expressed as a problem as well. In the words of small and large producers, local and across Australia, there are just too many peak bodies falling over themselves and not providing cogent and clear advice to government on the needs of the beef industry. There is the MLA, RMAC, ALFA, CCA, AMPC, AMIC, LESC and all the state based organisations and so on. There is more. Luke Bowen, the head of the NTCA, was reported in the Rural Press following their April meeting as saying: The system isn't providing a singular voice to represent us at a national level. I can attest to that, having seen it close saw that with the live export issue. I am told that last year, when RMAC chair, Ross Keane, was asked about the advice RMAC had given to the minister over live exports, he was said to have answered: 'We could not reach a consensus, so we didn't provide any advice.' That is just not an acceptable place to be. NTCA President, Rohan Sullivan, is quoted as saying that the lack of a single beef industry voice was a 'glaring deficiency' in efforts to deal with the live export matter. I also note that at a meeting of the Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association in April this year over 300 beef producers backed a proposal to use RMAC funds to review beef industry representation. I am not sure whether funds could be used in these particular ways, but it would be good to have it industry led. So far a few major players are saying it needs to be done but there is the lack of a single voice, leading all bodies to say who will do it and how it will be done. On this topic I note that the CCA have had meetings amongst themselves and with others who are concerned about the structure and the industry, notably the Australian Meat Producers Group. CCA have put up a proposed model but it violates the guidelines for levies and would require some of the producers' levies to go to the representational work of the CCA. So it has two strikes against it. It cannot be taken seriously by the levy payers or by government. The levy payers are not going to let them hive off their levy money in that way. I recognise that there are problems with funding for all of the organisations. The CCA have also suggested that four of the 12-member board be directly elected by levy payers. Yes, it is a start, but it is not good enough. It ignores the MLA's structure and operations. The third point is the silence around the decline in the meat-processing industryup. I namely, the closure of abattoirs around Australia. In 1979-80 there were 475 meatprocessing abattoirs. By 1996 there were 160 fewer abattoirs, down to 315. In New South Wales, 17 closed-four in our area aloneand nine are left, with five being owned by foreign companies or jointly owned. This is a crisis in an industry that no-one seems to be taking notice of. Meat processing is local. It has local content, it is about value adding and it needs support. It is also a major regional employer, with most meatprocessing facilities in local government areas having populations of 50,000 or fewer. According to Gary Burridge, the immediate past CEO of the Casino based Northern Cooperative Meat and spokesman for the AMIC- (Time expired) Work Experience in Parliament House Mrs GASH (Gilmore) (19:40): Just before the break, Jessica Cohen from my electorate of Gilmore came and did some work experience. Tonight, I would like to relate how she found Parliament House. Just before I relate her words, I would like to say that I wish Jessica well. It was a pleasure to have her here and she certainly fitted in with our office. She said: My name is Jessica Cohen and I recently completed a degree in international relations at UNSW. I am now currently at the stage of my life where I am searching for a career. Considering my major was in development studies, I am keen to have a career that involves working with the community. A few weeks ago a close friend of mine suggested that a career in the political sector could be very rewarding. It would allow me to work on issues that affect our community and it also relates closely to my degree. The suggestion motivated me to contact Joanna Gash my local MP, in order to gain work experience and a comprehensive understanding on how our political system works. Like most politicians I understand that Joanna is a very busy woman and I was delighted to receive her prompt reply. She kindly invited me to Parliament House to introduce me to the internal workings of our parliament. A day in the life of an MP is quite a diverse and active one. In the morning I accompanied Joanna to a meeting on international trade. Senators, members of DFAT and MP's all attended this meeting to discuss Australia's options in regards to trade policies with particular countries. The meeting was interrupted with a siren from a nearby clock flashing green, signaling a division in the House of Representatives. Without delay, a third of the people in the boardroom left to vote. Divisions in the House of Representatives and the Senate occur frequently when parliament sits. For me, it was quite exciting to watch. The meeting was interrupted a total of three times due to the division in the House of Representatives, however the people adapted to deal with the disturbance and the meeting continued. Joanna offered me practical experience too by asking me to write media releases and to draft letters to the community. This practical experience has not only equipped me for future jobs, it also has given me a personal insight to the day-today workings of a local MP's office. After lunch I was able to acquire tickets to the House of Representatives question time. Although question time is always covered by the media, it was quite a different experience watching it live. The arguments can get quite heated at times with people in the benches bickering in the background. A politician must have a lot of skill and focus when speaking in Parliament as they can speak clearly and confidently even though a group of opposing people are verbally disputing their position. In the afternoon Joanna invited me to sit in on a proposal from a non-government organisation appealing for support for their medical research. Equipped with a PowerPoint presentation, this non-government organisation detailed the actions they are taking to assist in the management of some of the world's most deadly diseases. Senators and MP's from different parties attended this meeting and each person had a different stance on the subject at hand. Although everyone supported the motion of the eradication of HIV, each person raised issues from different standing points during question time. The most thought provoking question from my perspective was simply ""how will you be able to determine the success of your project?"" As I have learnt in development studies, every development project must have an effective monitoring system that can measure the success of your actions. One specific thing I noticed from my experience at Parliament is that contrary to the popular belief that parliament can be filled with a range of parties, opposing each other for the media, behind the scenes, many of them have good working relationships. I feel as if they are aware that there is a benefit to an opposition when it comes to decision and policy making. After my work experience at Parliament House, my interest in a political career has grown. Working in this sector exposes you to a range of relevant issues that are faced by our community, and it provides you with a chance to improve the way people live. The work of a politician is a meaningful career. If any member is looking for a talented, able person for their office, then you cannot go past Jessica. In the spare time that I have, could I add that having students, regardless of their age or experience, has been very rewarding for me. We often have a perception of young people that can be negative. However, when you have students like Jessica and others we have had in our office it is, as I have said, very rewarding to be able to read their stories into the Hansard to show that we should not be so quick to judge from what we perceive. Holt Electorate: National Youth Week",170
234,Mr BYRNE,Unknown," On the subject of young people and the contribution they make, I rise tonight to talk about some very special young people from my electorate and the surrounding region and some of the thoughts that they have had. The city of Casey has a large number of young people. The 2006 census had the total number of young people aged between 10 and 25 at 59,953. I am sure, given it is six years since that census was taken, it is many more than that now. This is a significant cohort of young people. They are the future of our community and the future of our country. The opinions of these people actually matter. What has concerned me for some time in my electorate and the surrounding region is the way in which our young people have been categorised and the pressures that they are under, because obviously a large number of young people live in the area. In the community, if, say, a young man throws a party which comes to national attention, that is front and centre in the national media. when it comes to the many constructive things that our young people do and the contributions that they make to our community, we never read about it. What sort of message does that send to our young people? 'If you don't do anything bad you should not be reported upon; your opinions do not matter; your values do not matter; we do not want to hear you.' So, as part of National Youth Week, I asked some of our city of Casey's 2011 and 2012 young student leaders to meet with me to tell me about the issues that concern them, to make sure their voices would be heard. It is ironic. This is allegedly the communication age of Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Pinterest, Google+-you name it. At the push of a button you can communicate with anyone. Yet, in this torrent of communication devices, our young people in the community are often very alone. They feel very isolated. They feel very unheard. That was one of the key messages that I took from the meeting that I had in my office on 13 April. These young community leaders to whom I spoke are: Kathryn Hazell, Tanisha Beveridge, Shabnam Safa, Danielle Rothwell, Luke Pel, Amanda Carron, Justine Jaramillo and Emilijia Stefanovic. They are great young leaders in our community and they are facing incredible challenges from within their community. They represent their community and the city of Casey extremely well. We discussed a number of issues, and one issue that came out loud and clear was that they are being required to define who they are as people at ages 16 and 17. When we were growing up, Madam Deputy Speakerand we will not talk about our age here-I did not feel that pressure. I did not have to have my life basically mapped out when I But, was 16 or 17, but we are asking our young people to do that. How fair is that for them? They certainly feel it is not fair. They are asked to behave a certain way. There is enormous peer pressure. They have to wear certain clothes. They have to drink at a younger age. They are subjected to a lot of bullying. One of the most disturbing things is their mental health and well-being. I am hearing story after story of young people who know young people who have taken their own lives. That was one of the things highlighted by that group of young people with their lives before them. They had been touched by colleagues and friends who had committed suicide at such a young age. What is that saying? In fact, I was contacted by a young student leader about another suicide that happened a couple of days ago. What is going on in our community? We know the issue of youth suicide is an incredibly important issue and governments pay attention to it, but our young people are still dying-and that is not good enough. One death is too many. We have to do whatever we can in this place to listen to our young people and ensure that their voices are heard so that we do not have this situation continuing where young people feel they have no alternative but to take their lives. I said to our young community leaders that I would pass that message on. They also spoke about the pressures that they have in year 12 to get that elusive university entry score-again, they are being asked to define themselves by whether they go to university. Even when they are seeking part-time work they are asked: do they have a university degree? Are they studying? That is enormous pressure for young people in our community to be put under, and it is not fair pressure. We were not subjected to that. I say to our young community leaders: thank you for sharing your thoughts with us. We will listen to you. I am going to continue to have these forums and we are going to make sure your voices are heard in this community and in this place. Budget Mr VAN MANEN (Forde) (19:49): I touch tonight on the budget that was presented last night. I think at best it can described as a 'get them by' budget. It is a budget that has no coherent strategy to deliver strong economic growth or long-term sustainable surpluses, or even a strategy to tackle the mountain of debt that this government has accumulated in four years. We saw that debt in the current year blow out from $22 billion to $44 billion. How do we expect to see a surplus in the next financial year's budget? Our net government debt will climb to a record $145 billion. This has required the government to legislate to increase its debt limit-the limit on the national credit card-from $250 billion to $300 billion. These are records that nobody should be proud of achieving, nor are the number of new or increased taxes that this government has introduced since 2007. With this budget's various tax hikes and measures, the total now stands at 26. These new and increased taxes have done nothing to help ease the pressure of the rising cost of living for the Australian community. They do nothing for families who are facing higher costs of living every day. As an example, since this government was elected in 2007, electricity prices have gone up by some 66 per cent, and that is before the introduction of a carbon tax on 1 July; gas prices have gone up by 39 per cent; food prices have gone up by 11 per cent; petrol prices have gone up by another 11 per cent; and education and health costs have gone up by some 25 per cent. This is Labor's second budget in a row that has not provided tax cuts for everyday Australians. Instead, Labor is hitting Australian families and the economy with more tax hikes, including the world's biggest carbon tax, which will push prices up even further. The carbon tax will result in $9 billion a year in new tax revenue, an immediate increase of around 10 per cent in electricity bills and a nine per cent increase in gas bills in the first year alone. be The impact on families will get worse with a carbon price rising to $29 a tonne in just three years. This compares to a current global carbon price of $6 to $8. Needless to say, this toxic carbon tax will have devastating effects on industries and jobs yet will do nothing for the environment. The compensation and handouts from the government are being given out to cushion the blow of these new taxes but no amount of compensation can be measured to protect the jobs of everyday Australians-and no amount of compensation will compensate them for losing their job. These sugar hits are counter-productive: they do not go the distance and they do not keep pace with the new and increased taxes designed to drive up the cost of living. We just saw with the legislation passed today that the education tax rebate was dumped and replaced with the schoolkids bonus. Not only that, but we have blowouts like the NBN, which is not in the budget. There is another $1.4 billion blowout in asylum seeker management. Defence continues to be cut. A broken border protection and onshore-processing policy rages out of control. Labor has delivered its fourth deficit in four years, which is, in total, $174 billion. I said earlier, the blowout in this financial year's proposed deficit from $22 billion to $44 billion is a great example of what we are going to see over the coming 12 months. The baton of debt will be passed down to the children that are supposedly getting the benefit of these handouts. Once they enter the workforce they will be paying the interest on the debt and they will be paying their taxes to repay this debt. This government is protecting itself and the Prime Minister is doing everything in her power to keep her job. The budget is a purely political document-as I mentioned at the outset, a 'get-em-by budget'. It is only the coalition that has a proven track record of providing hope, reward and opportunity. (Time expired) Budget",173
235,Mr BANDT,Unknown," This is a fairer budget than last year but it could have been fairer. The Greens helped prevent Labor's big business tax cuts, which will save the public purse $16 billion over the next decade. Unfortunately, the government chose to maintain an obsession with an early political surplus and has not used these savings, in our view, in the best possible way. The Greens would have put an extra $50 a week into Newstart to help people living below the poverty line. Unfortunately, the government did not agree. The Greens would rather maintain tax breaks for green buildings but, unfortunately, these have been removed. The Greens believe Australia should honour its pledge of increasing overseas development assistance to 0.5 per cent of GNI by 2015-16, but this has been delayed. The Greens also advocated scaling back the diesel fuel tax rebate, but this suggestion was As not picked up. The budget unfortunately does not sufficiently invest in long-term economic goals, preferring instead to focus on a shortterm political surplus that will not help Australia after the mining bubble bursts. It is not smart planning for the future to put virtually no new money into schools, skills, training or higher education, to cut over 3,000 public service jobs or to invest virtually nothing in innovative manufacturing to set us up for a future beyond the mining bubble. The government says that a surplus is our best defence against global change. The Greens say that healthy, well educated and confident Australians trained in working in the new clean economy are our best preparation for the challenges of the 21st century. I commend the government for some big and important reforms such as the National Disability Insurance Scheme and extra funding for aged care. I applaud the government for honouring the agreement with the Greens and putting half a billion dollars towards dental health, and initiating steps towards getting dental care into Medicare. I am very glad that the government agreed to the most significant funding boost SBS has ever received-$95 million over five years-and to a further $63 million to be invested in national Indigenous television. The government also agreed to exempt many of our national cultural institutions such as the National Gallery, National Library, National Museum and the National Film and Sound Archive from the efficiency dividend which would have cut into their budgets. I am also pleased to have been able to secure funding for a number of important projects, such as a $1½ million lifeline to secure the future of Job Watch, the Carlton based employment legal centre that will continue to make a difference for vulnerable workers. The Baillieu government in Victoria cut 60 per cent of Job Watch's funding. Services that were at risk included free and confidential legal services, community education, advocacy and law reform services. I know the crucial and unique work that Job Watch does for working people and I am delighted that their good work can continue. High-speed rail from Melbourne to Sydney is closer to reality with $20 million in the budget to establish a high-speed rail unit. The unit will build on the work of the multimillion dollar high-speed implementation study secured as part of the Greens agreement with the Gillard government. High-speed rail will transform the way we move around the country. We are now one step closer to building a 21st century rail network. The government has also agreed to start funding again to important programs and to invest more in maths and science education. There will be a $54 million investment in programs such as Science by Doing and PrimaryConnections, two programs I have been championing. Boosting maths and science education in schools is smart because innovation is central to our future prosperity once the mining bubble bursts. We now need to push for a big investment in our schools in the next budget. I am pleased that there is no federal funding for the Baillieu government plan to drive a tollway through the middle of Melbourne. There is no money for the tollway in this year's budget and, at this stage, none planned for future years. The fight is not over but it is a promising start. We now need to focus on getting the Baillieu government to invest in rail, not roads. I was also able to negotiate $20 million to protect and celebrate the Royal Exhibition Building, the birthplace of Australia's parliament and a World Heritage icon for Melbourne. I have been working with Museum Victoria and residents groups on reestablishing a walkway on the building's dome as well as a democracy education centre and recognition of Indigenous Australians. I note that our parliament turns 111 today and I am pleased that we have delivered an appropriate gift to preserve its original home. I also commend the government for its $67 million investment in the Victorian rail Comprehensive Cancer Centre in Parkville. I will be looking at the budget over coming weeks to see if there are better ways of investing our tax dollars but I also note that without the Greens in the balance of power many of these important reforms would not be happening.

Order! In accordance with standing order Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Cognate debate. Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Mrs MIRABELLA (Indi) (10:02): I rise Amendment Bill (No.1) 2012 and the Customs Bill (No.2) 2012. I note that these bills represent the government to give effect to the anti-dumping year. So, appreciating that it may drag out this intend to restate many of the points and arguments previous occasions that anti-dumping has been Federation Chamber. Suffice it to say that the coalition does, on each of these two bills. In fact, we have regime since before the 2010 election-in finally announced its own changes. We have current anti-dumping regime wherever those happy to accept that this tranche We are glad, in particular, to support the range of options in applying duties to goods Australia. If the removal of limitations upon the relevant good or goods works as I think step. We also have no problem with altering more scope and flexibility for anti-dumping nominated termination date. That said, we amendment is not ultimately used as an excuse critically important for all of us to recognise slow and cumbersome and undermine the very place. Anything that potentially adds to that obviously a step backwards. On that note earlier debates, I also want to make the point that administering Australia's anti-dumping dumping money shifted into the branch from other areas large cuts have already been made to other areas cuts in its history in last night's budget. The important thing that a government can anti-dumping policy is provide an appropriate step more than any other which will help to increasing the opportunity to use preliminary NA Improvements) Bill (No. 2) 2012 Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2012 Second Reading to speak on the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment (Anti-dumping Improvements) the third tranche of changes introduced by announcements it made in the middle of last debate for far longer than is necessary, I do not that I have made on each of the recent the subject of debate in the House and the again, intend to give its support to the government been pushing for revisions to the anti-dumping other words, from long before the government consistently said that we support changes to the changes are sensible and practical. And we are of legislation meets those tests. changes that give the minister a wider ambit and that are considered to have been dumped in the calculation of the so-called 'normal value' of the government intends, that is also a positive the minister's powers in such a way as to provide duties to be extended beyond their originally need to be very careful that that particular for procrastinating and delay, because it is that some of the current processes are simply too purpose of an anti-dumping regime in the first problem of the slow and cumbersome culture is and at the risk of repeating myself again from the coalition believes it is critical that those system be provided with new resources, not of Customs and especially not at a time when of the agency, including some of the deepest do in the first instance in the area of effective level of administrative support because it is that bring cases to a speedy resolution, including by affirmative determinations. Just in passing, I also want to quickly note that clause 9 Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill says: The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Dumping complex. With that in mind, I would suggest in good faith from Customs that they may want to have a references in the explanatory memorandum-in clause 7.1 of the explanatory memorandum Improvements) Bill No. 2. I may well have something but, on the face of it, I think some the very least, some words may need to be changed that clause for most people who come to read stands, at least to my eyes, the first part of addition to a small problem with pluralisation On the first page of that same explanatory the regulation impact statement for the bill wording exactly, it says that statement can another bill. And then to complicate matters other bill. On top of that, the explanatory presume, it is referring does not seem to contain when we are dealing with quite complex legislation these changes is to make things easier to understand, Not delving all that far back into history, poorly chosen wording in explanatory memoranda. the innovation portfolio that the government concession into a R&D tax credit. Given processes to which all of that has ultimately still no clarity in many areas-I would urge possible terms to steer violently I would like to restate the coalition support happily stand ready to continue to make a range to Australia's anti-dumping arrangements to ensure effective in preventing goods being dumped in expects-just a system that actually works and access. Indeed, if we are privileged enough we look forward very much to the potential anti-dumping policy we announced publicly widespread industry acclaim.",187

But if I am reading that be found in the explanatory memorandum for yet it gives what I think is the wrong title of that memorandum for the bill to which, I can only a regulation impact statement anyway. So and when one of the clearly stated aims of confused drafting like this does not help. there were many examples of poor drafting and For example, the infamous recent bills in used to erroneously change the R&D tax the horrible confusion and severely botched contributed-and I might add to which there is the minister and Customs in the strongest away from that type of drafting. for each of these bills and to say that we will of very practical, very sensible improvements that they are accessible and that they are Australia.

Mr Jobe said: Chinese manufacturers are currently exploiting dumping laws haven't been updated in over a decade, are being brought up to date. A key weakness in Australia's approach to Howard coalition government and its unmitigated market economy as a precondition of FTA negotiations. authorities to apply subrogated or proxy pricing assessed. China, for example, makes it very adequately funded or resourced in the past stakeholders like the AWU, Capral and other back because of the complete and utter disaster recognition of China as a market economy. application of relatively small dumping duties United States, which adopt a very different In this country we need a properly resourced responding to dumping and to complaints of The Australian Customs and Border Protection anti-dumping and countervailing investigations Officer provides an independent administrative This is probably amongst the most complicated example, Capral itself has been involved in considerable money on the services of a advice and to represent them in these types of matters. Paul Howes, the national secretary of historically in this regard has been manifestly failure in the past to address and resource Howes says there is insufficient legislative As I said, the United States and Canada application of this type of legislation in the domestic industry. We have not adopted that and the establishment by the Howard coalition recognition of China as a market based economy. In the past, the trade measures branch of licensing bureau in Yes Minister-a poor cousin activities.

As Phil Jobe believe their luck. We have seen a rising Australian industry. The consequences are and circumventing existing legislation … The antiso it's good to see that under this government they dumping is the abject failure of the previous disaster in the recognition of China as a That has restricted the ability of local in cases where normal values cannot be easily difficult in this regard. Customs has not been and is really fighting this issue-as are organisations-with one hand tied behind its of the Howard coalition government in the This has resulted in a limited and partial in some cases, compared to Canada and the approach to that of Australia in this regard. and independent anti-dumping agency stakeholders like the AWU, Capral and others.

It all comes back to the ground rules government in relation to the FTA and Customs has been a little akin to the Swansea to colleagues focusing on border protection We have seen importation of Chinese aluminium Australian industry. Capral at Bundamba in is about 60 per cent. It is the result of imports. There has been a loss of well over has been the elimination of production activities of plant in Australian facilities-for example, at The Chinese have further expanded anti-dumping decisions in the past have actually said to me in numerous meetings, they cannot Australian dollar, and this has threatened the that Chinese extrusion companies are supplying primary aluminium at rates that are about 20 are simply setting artificially the yuan rate, cent lower than it should be. In addition dramatically, dumping lower-than-cost products is unfair for our employers and it is unfair exporters aggressively capture well above 35 On a per capita basis, according to the evidence Australia are more than five times higher than of failures in the past. So we need to believe in fair trade as well This is about creating the opportunities for operators, like those at Capral, to make sure compete competitively. It is not about breaching about making sure that countries comply with products into our country in breach of those effective improvements to Australia's anti-dumping its effectiveness. At the same time, we are rules. We believe in free trade in this country, but believe it is fair to Australian workers and country-exports its goods to Australia at prices or below cost. That materially injures Australian So we have announced a number of reforms, and tranche of those reforms. I am quite committed making sure we protect Australian jobs. By whether union members or non-union members, Aluminium, Capral and others in the Ipswich shake with respect to the operation of businesses. I am pleased that Minister Clare has met can do everything we can in the legislation manufacturers a fair go. Specifically, the legislation the Australian Customs and Border Protection basis of all facts available in determining whether and the amount of the countervailing subsidy Customs by the country of origin or the company are Chinese state-run companies. The legislation of profit when considering a normal value review of anti-dumping measures and a continuation proximity to one another. That is one of the after inquiry after inquiry-one after another-which One of the great reforms we put in place AWU and Capral to have standing-locus countervailing measures and to use litigation. they needed. So we are going to do a number per cent lower than prevailing world rates. They which a lot of commentators say is 20 to 30 per to that they are subsidising their industries into Australia. It is unfair for our workers, it for our industry. We have seen Chinese aluminium per cent of the Australian market in recent years. I have obtained, Chinese extrusion exports to to any other country, and that is a direct result as free trade. This is not about protectionism. our very skilled workers and our very skilled we have a level playing field so that we can our obligations under the WTO rules. It is those rules and that they do not unfairly dump rules. We are rolling out some of the most regime in more than a decade to improve reaffirming our commitment to the world trading we believe that trade should be fair. We do not Australian manufacturers that China-or any other below the price it charges in its home market businesses and puts Australian jobs at risk. the legislation before us today is the third as a local federal member in my area to that I mean making it fair so that employees, of companies like G James Glass & area and the western corridor are given a fair with Phil Jobe and stakeholders to make sure we to protect Australian jobs and give Australian before the House today gives the CEO of Service-the minister-the power to act on the a countervailable subsidy has been received if adequate information has not been provided to being investigated.

They are measures will help in a small way to address the inherent support for this legislation exposes another that we in the coalition oppose everything. as that in these bills, we will support it but, been poorly thought through or is nothing other of Australia, the coalition will make no These bills are the third tranche of legislative regime that Labor has made during this term least one or two additional bills to be introduced these changes in our anti-dumping laws to be over 12 months? This remains a mystery that would have been far more efficient for all, especially our anti-dumping regime had been made in efficiency and this Labor government are not Going to the specifics of the bills, they firstly the minister to use different forms of interim change is consistent with the World Trade currently does not mandate the method for dumping duty is imposed. These amendments valorem duty or a fixed amount of duty, a combination the minister can only use a combination form component or a variable component. This legislation to impose the penalty duty required. The bills also add new provisions to the subsidies provision in the Customs Act to better provision of the World Trade Organisation Measures. In addition these bills amend division measures', of the act, which will enable measures level of applicable duty, if the minister decides amending measures that are to be continued measures in close proximity to the continuation dealing with the problem of dumping. In addition, Customs Act to remove the current limitations normal value of the relevant goods alleged deletion implements the government's response Trade Remedies Forum report on the effectiveness Customs Act. Despite these changes, there are still many are actually dumped. For example, how do markets where prices change frequently, responding week? Is it the price last month? Is it the price will be in the future? What about exchange actually calculated the exchange rate? A company current market, where we have seen such extreme do you calculate the price in the domestic same goods being sold at different prices in Then there are the terms of sale. Price discrimination, may be explained by a difference under a letter of credit this obviously has a terms with 30or 60-day open terms. There are changes to Australia's existing anti-dumping of parliament and I understand that there are at later this year. Why has it been necessary for made in four or more separates tranches spread perhaps only the government can answer. It Australian industry, if these changes to one block of legislation, but unfortunately words that are often found in the same sentence. amend the dumping duty act in order to allow dumping duties from those currently used. This Organisation's anti-dumping agreement, which calculating the level of duty where an interim will enable the minister to impose either an ad of the two or a floor price.

Again, this gives greater flexibility in the bills repeal section 269TAC(13) of the on determining profit when constructing the to have been dumped in a foreign country. This to recommendation 3.4 of the International of market situation provisions in the practical difficulties in determining when goods you calculate the normal price of a good? In to market conditions, is it the price last last year? For commodities, is it what the price rates? How do you calculate how a firm has may use an internal hedge, especially in the volatility in exchange rates. Further, how market, where different costs may result in the different regional markets within one country? differentials, which often may seem to be price in trading terms. If goods are purchased different price, as if they were sold on trading also credit risks and statutory warranties. All these factors need to be considered in the apply a quantity discount? This is another calculation whether goods have been sold below cost. This an Australian Customs official to determine at a price that is different or lower When determining whether goods are being we need to make an apples-with-apples comparison. the goods and products exported to Australia the home market. So where an apples-with-apples Customs officials can look to the price charged the calculation based on a combination of the normal profit margins, it is simply impossible determine what the price would be if the goods market. Thus, any estimation of prices by Customs a few examples of the difficulties that our legislation. A recent example of the problems represent where a dumping investigation Border Protection Service upon an application Prysmian Power Cables and Systems Australia like goods into an alleged dumping concerning the People's Republic of China. I am sure these into the Australian market at below the cost as a result of Customs and Border Protection's electric cables exported from China to terminated the investigation. We must also recognise that an effective line. An anti-dumping regime that is too harsh protectionist measure, which harms Australian example, many Australian manufacturers rely in Australia. However, an anti-dumping regime manufacturers being tied up in red tape, defending which they need in their processes here in Australia. We also need to be aware that this could Australian exporters go overseas and try to sell pricing with a sharper pencil and that would However, these modest amendments to Australia's many factors that are causing the declining are that while many Australian companies Australia because they seem cheap, the reality our competitive advantages. In business, you can only succeed if you it, for your competitive advantage is your lifeblood. while if it has competitive parity but if this just around the corner. In Australia, our pricing of goods. Further, how do you actually that Customs must make in determining makes it very difficult, if not impossible, for whether a good has been exported into Australia than the exporter's home market. sold at higher prices in the Australian market, But this is very difficult because often are simply not the same as those being sold in comparison cannot be made, although by an exporter in another country and make exporter's production costs, other expenses and for Australian Customs officials to accurately were theoretically only available in a foreign is purely an arbitrary figure. These are just Customs officials face when implementing this in determining this arose in the electorate I was undertaken by the Australian Customs and lodged by Advance Cables, Olex Cables and on behalf of Australian industry producing electrical cables exported to Australia from firms felt that the goods were being dumped of what they were made for in China. However, investigations, Customs determined that the Australia had not been dumped and therefore and workable dumping regime treads a very fine and is too complex can easily be used as a industry and harms Australian jobs. For on imported components to manufacture goods that is too complex can result in these dumping claims for a vital business input also work against us in Australia. When most their goods on overseas markets they do their be against World Trade Organisation rules. anti-dumping laws are not a cure against the competitiveness of Australian industry. The facts may consider that goods are being dumped into is that as a nation we are giving away many of have a competitive advantage and you safeguard A company may be able to survive for a turns into a competitive disadvantage, extinction is labour costs are traditionally a competitive disadvantage. We will never be able to compete-nor on labour costs. But one of our greatest competitive supplies. Abundant supplies of high-quality black of the few competitive advantages we have here of economic treason, has surrendered this released by the Energy Users Association of Australia are now amongst the highest in the takes effect, Australian industry will be Interestingly, South Australia, which boasts else in Australia, can now also boast that they Australia but have the highest It is important to note that, under the World not just selling goods below cost for an anticompetitive dumping also includes merely selling a good charged for the same good in the exporter's legislation attempts to ensure that a firm makes as it does on a domestic market Under World Trade Organisation agreements, or merely threatens to cause material injury when it all boils down, dumping is merely geographic basis-the selling of the same goods at different are able to be segmented by international borders. with speaker after speaker condemning dumping-geographic international markets because it causes or threatens business, we must also condemn geographic within our borders, especially where it causes Australian business. Otherwise, if we fail While it is important that we have effective when it occurs across political boundaries and we also have strong laws when it occurs internally Australia has no provisions in our competition price discrimination when it occurs across different free market capitalism, the USA, the Robinson-Patman geographic price discrimination. It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, contract to sell, goods in any part of the United States elsewhere in the United States for the purpose of These laws simply do not exist We should never forget that under these that was broken up into 34 separate companies, engage in the practice of geographic price discrimination. was to sell oil below cost in one domestic market force them to exit the market, while in another already been driven out of the market, they do we want to-with China and India advantage is our low-cost electricity coal, generating low-cost electricity, is one in Australia. But this government, in an act national competitive advantage. A recent report Australia shows average electricity prices in world and, once the world's biggest carbon tax paying the world's highest electricity prices. about having more wind turbines than anywhere not only have the highest electricity prices in electricity prices in the world. Trade Organisation's definition, 'dumping' is purpose. The WTO's definition of for a lower price in a foreign market than is domestic market. Effectively, anti-dumping the same level of profits in an export market for the sale of the same good. dumping is rightfully condemned if it causes to a domestic Australian industry. Essentially, price discrimination on an international prices in different markets where the markets If we are to stand here in this parliament, price discrimination-across to cause material injury to an Australian price discrimination when it occurs internally or threatens to cause material injury to an to do so, we are nothing more than hypocrites. laws to deal with geographic price discrimination internationally, I say it is equally important that in Australia. Yet, unlike other countries, laws to deal with anticompetitive geographic markets within Australia. In the home of Act has a specific provision against This act provides, in part: in the course of such commerce … to sell, or at prices lower than those exacted by said person destroying competition, or eliminating a competitor … in Australia's competition laws. laws it was the notorious Standard Oil company, all competing against each other, found to The strategy used by Standard Oil to drive the competitor's profits down and area, where other independent businesses had raised prices. This would be unlawful across international borders. In America where it is unlawful. Unfortunately, here in Australia competition laws. Further, while these bills seek to address than their cost in the home market it would not with goods being sold at lower prices virtually a reverse dumping. It is clear now prices in the world for goods.

Today I pay tribute to was an extraordinary person. And I say he 1967, when we had the referendum that gave very little recognition and very little opportunity country. So for an Indigenous person to be indeed remarkable. Yet Jimmy Little was able What made it even more remarkable was that everywhere. To break into the music and entertainment feat. It was a very competitive industry, it was was an industry in which discrimination was rife. is something that should be acknowledged in its USA, where in the same era a number of African-Americans industry, and we look at the stories associated understand that, because of the competition someone to be recognised and to get through, ability and what talents you had but of who and make it possible for you. Jimmy Little did no-one in particular to open doors for him and lagging behind the American and perhaps even Jimmy did break through and he obviously his singing ability. His singing ability quickly number of songs that I recall were played regularly the forum through which any entertainer was through he became an inspiration and a leader because he broke through in the years leading leadership and the inspiration he provided changes to the Constitution in 1967. In fact, the Indigenous leaders of the time who was to all Australians that he was a talented performers who paid their own tribute to and personal reflections on how Jimmy Little With your indulgence, Madam Deputy are no objections to the tabling of that finish by saying that we have lost a great that you can achieve things doing what you powerfully-through the voice, through song and in speaking on this condolence motion and of Jimmy Little. I did not personally know and I knew of his music. I listened to his music him not only because of his music but because he was an extraordinary person because, up until some recognition to Indigenous Australians, were given to Indigenous people across this given any form of recognition prior to 1967 was to achieve that, and he did it through his music. in the 1950s and 1960s budding artists were industry was in itself a very difficult a selective industry and, according to some, it So for Jimmy Little to in fact break through own right. If we look across the oceans to the had in fact broken into the music with the industry there, it is pretty easy to and the pressures within the industry just for quite often it was a case not so much of what you knew within the industry to open the doors that here in Australia, when I suspect there was make it possible, because Australia was in fact the English entertainment industry of the time. broke through because of his personality and brought him to fame. He performed and sang a on pop radio. Pop radio was, at the time, given some sort of recognition. In breaking for his community. That in itself was important up to the 1967 referendum. His success, his to others undoubtedly contributed towards the I saw a brief film clipping where he was one of interviewed in the lead-up to the 1967 vote. Again, he was interviewed because he was being people of this country. Undoubtedly, he did pave the way for numerous other Indigenous artists and, successful in this country. I am sure that all many of them. But it was not just Indigenous was Indigenous people across the country. successfully performing in a whole range representing this country in sports. One of represented Australia in boxing and won a world hit single here in Australia. Again, that is that you can be successful if you put your mind to it. It is always difficult for anyone to achieve first one to break through. I said earlier on that not just because of his talents but because have been many a talented person who have unfortunately, for one reason or another, were community. Other speakers have talked a little his personality, he struck me as a person understand others and, in a very peaceful way, was his strength. He then went on to use that assist Indigenous people in this If you look at his record subsequent to his continued serving the Indigenous people of standing up for what he believed was right. to those recognitions in just a moment. Interestingly, couple of years ago that he came to this place Jimmy Little was known to the world mainly and passed away on 2 February 2012. He was by the Cummeragunja in New South Wales. career as a singer-songwriter and guitarist, a is quite remarkable. Also, as other speakers including Shadow of the Boomerang in 1960 performed in a stage play, Black Cockatoos.

I believe that that extraordinary personality or characteristic to country in so many different areas. artistic acknowledgement, you will see that he this country until the day he died. He continued He received many, many recognitions. I will come from my recollection, it was only a to support the Indigenous people of Australia. for his singing.

Australia has long been a very tireless International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, world recognised that, following what had occurred tense situation developing between the United Republics, a strong collaborative effort was required Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Australia set about ratifying the treaty, and that the IAEA does in the areas of not only and the manageable use of nuclear While Australia certainly could not be nuclear technology for research purposes-for in New South Wales. Domestically, the Australian enforces our standards and facilitates IAEA for carrying out the more practical concerns utilisation of this technology is, of course, a future safety of all Australians. The sentiment among the vast majority of weaponry. This has been increasing for some down the decision in 1994: There exists an obligation to pursue in good faith nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under Furthermore, in 2007 the Five-Point Plan United Nations General Assembly, which recognises global interest in nuclear disarmament continues China, France and the United Kingdom reaffirming Republic of Korea to cooperate fully with the to comply with United Nations Security Council a strengthened IAEA safeguards regime, including risks of nuclear fuel cycle multilateralisation; of nuclear weapons, including the possibility of for multilateral disarmament improve; from weapons of mass destruction and their delivery terrorism within the framework of the IAEA and the I would like to thank the Prime Minister for motion. I strongly support the motion that this world, and its support for the Weapons.

The developed the non-proliferation treaty as the in World War II and with the increasingly States and the Union of Soviet Socialist to protect the future of our world. As the Weapons, the NPT, came into force in 1970, we did so in 1973. I note the very significant work non-proliferation but also disarmament in general research for peaceful purposes. considered to be a nuclear power we do utilise example, at the Lucas Heights research reactor Safeguards and Non-Proliferation Office activities in this country.

More recently, as this ratified the measures for the further reduction START, in February 2011. We have also seen cooperation between Australia and Japan on this support the consensus views expressed by the 106: Nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament. Unfortunately, in 2012, there are ongoing significant from South America to South-East Asia. There Middle East, with some countries there having Whilst Australia has maintained on an international nuclear-free Iran, the IAEA is in fact unable indeed peaceful. In many ways, the uncertainty the world. I strongly support the call in this Middle East zone free of weapons of mass destruction.

That is why it must be the go away, so it is up to world leaders such encouraging other countries to join the cause. the NPT to join the treaty as non-nuclear weapon states. I would like to take the opportunity in contribution from the International non-proliferation and to acknowledge their fortunate to gather with the Prime Minister launch of the Parliamentary Friends of the with my colleagues Mr Bruce Scott, Mr Graham forward to working with the Red Cross to see very important work they do.

By continuing to raise in developing international humanitarian law, the protocols to the Geneva conventions in between civilians and combatants and harm being caused to civilians during times of by nuclear weapons would fail to meet the no Red Cross launched its official campaign impact of nuclear weapons. It is a campaign of destruction these weapons can cause.

Our leaders must focus on the devastating Remember that a nuclear weapon does not discriminate. civilians, hospitals, doctors, land for farming, out a city; it also wipes out so much more.

Those are compelling words. We cannot humanitarian cost, but neither can we ignore uncertainty and the threats which lie within Should a nuclear weapon fall into the hands consequences would be devastating.

Of course, Pakistan the case that as a valued neighbour, an democratic nation, India's ongoing rejection well placed to be a strong supporter and disarmament politics. I think the motion before of ratification of the treaty by India now. There has been recent debate around expanded come to one of those shortly, but the fact remains along with the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban global nuclear disarmament framework. disarmament. The motion before us also affirms and recognises that we are closer to the unthinkable, device that would cause untold misery and destruction. In order for us to play a full and proper we continue with the endeavours underway-which by the Prime Minister at the Nuclear Security is growing. At the same time, within the nuclear have not been able to find common ground on timely actions for disarmament. treaty saw parties agree to 'reduce goal of eliminating those weapons'.

This would recognise that every country must needed to get the world onto a structured path a nuclear weapons convention has been in place from the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty and that has continued to grow from the mid-90s the treaty to ban landmines provides a clear period of time.

By the way, India has builds internationally, it is very important the way; continues to press for the remaining the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty; and an essential major step to abolishing nuclear and our future demands nothing less. background to this motion is that it was Committee on Treaties, which I chair, non-proliferation and disarmament in 2009 report, Report 106: Nuclear Non-Proliferation Minister and the Leader of the Opposition for and very unusual bipartisan motion. members-one of whom is sitting beside me, a 230-plus-page report, but also for their say something significant and worthwhile, which this task.

Throughout the history of the stressed non-proliferation-that is to say, weapons-while the nuclear have-nots have nuclear-armed countries to get rid of their movement, essentially have-nots, are frustrated often this difference of approach has led to action on both fronts-non-proliferation and disarmament. I am aware of resistance from within countries to the idea of the International security function. But my view is that every from developing nuclear weapons. It is not enough weapons we are doing everything we can. The universal adherence to the additional protocol aspirations for an indigenous enrichment capacity The road to nuclear hell is paved with defensive nuclear weapons after it was attacked during United States and Russia developed nuclear War.

But, more importantly, Committee on Treaties-which I was privileged highlights the issues that revolve around highlights the actions that can be taken When it comes to nuclear weapons, there is the most weapons, the country that has the largest is depending on its nuclear war stock is never the world are not winners either. There is a between those who have nuclear weapons and that have nuclear weapons want to make sure weapons remain in that position. I do not think any further forward. Nuclear weapons do not world that we can expect to be occupied for the rid of them.

This places the believe the motion the Prime Minister has On 2 July 2009 I attended the Conference disturbing of all was that the debate that took for discussion of nuclear disarmament. Moving disarmament was not happening, because those could not even agree on an agenda and the format that is good enough. I think it is very, very important acknowledge that nuclear weapons are dispensable tomorrow is not through nuclear threats. It is very important that we coax and coerce cannot deal with issues such as this unless all part of the role that Australia plays in nuclear with all those countries that have nuclear weaponry.
