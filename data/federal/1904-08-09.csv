1,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"I desire to make a personal explanation. Last week, when the Seat of Government Bill was being discussed, and the honourable membeT. for Hume was speaking, I . interjected that a statement had - appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald to the effect that the honourable member had said that he preferred Lyndhurst to the southern sites. His reply was that that was not so; but I am now able to read to the House the absolute words of the statement to which I have referred. It occurs in a letter written to the Sydney Morning Herald on the 4th April, 1904, by the Rev. H . D. Seely-Vidal, a Church of England clergyman, residing at Carcoar, in New South Wales, and is as .follows: Ere going on board the special train at Lyndhurst, when the subject of the possible sites was being discussed, I heard Sir William Lyne dis. tincliy say, in the presence of several others, that he, personally speaking, considered Lyndhurst the most eligible site, but that South Australia, Victoria, and Tasmania would outvote the other States, and keep the site down south. then spoke to Sir William, and said- "" Look .here, Sir William, you throw all the weight of your influence on to the side of Lyndhurst, and we will chance South Australia, Victoria, and Tasmania outvoting it . """,12
2,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I have never read the letter from which the honourable and learned member has quoted, ""nor have I heard it read before; but the statement itself is untrue.",12
3,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"I also desire to make a personal explanation. When on Thursday last I moved a motion affirming I the desirability of a re-adjustment of the Tariff, I stated that the total value of some twenty lines of food stuffs produced in Victoria was ,£12,000,000 per annum, and that 'the local consumption of these lines was about £1,200,000 per annum. The figures were challenged at the time by the honourable member for Gippsland. As I then explained, T had received them only the night before, so that I had not had time to digest them. On referring to them again, I find that my statement of the total production was correct, but that my statement as to the local consumption was incorrect, because, instead of the line relating to local consumption, I read a line relating to population. I desire to acknowledge and. to correct the mistake, so that honourable members may not be misled by my original statement. PREFERENTI AL TRADE .",12
4,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I ask the Prime Minisnot ter whether his comments upon the suggesbecause tion' for the holding of an' Imperial ference to consider the question of tial trade were based on general cable information only, or on some other communipare the way. cation which had reached him. If based only on press statements, they were,- I venture to suggest, premature.' whether, in view of the vital importance of the matter to Australia, he sirable to discourage the formulation of an official proposition by the British Governof ment as soon as possible. If the question Chamber. .is officially submitted to him. will he not feel it his duty, before replying, to afford honourable members an opportunity to press their views in regard to it? ' Mr WATSON - The observations which I made were based upon no other foundaof tion than the ordinary press cables. I .asked by the representative of one great English dailies to express an opinion on a. suggestion which had made, and my reply was to the effect a Conference is hardly necessary at present time, and that we should await declaration of the people of Great tain of their own desires in the (natter.",13
5,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Eve n before a prelimiing narv discussion?,13
6,Mr WATSON,Unknown,I think that the minary discussion has already taken place.,13
7,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Not a discussion bedebated. tween Great Britain and her Colonies.,13
8,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"-The Australian vernment was represented by Sir Edmund Barton at an Imperial Conference which carried a resolution approving of preferential trade, and the matter was' afterwards put before the electors at the last general elections by the honourable and learned member himself, who was then at the head of the Government. Later on, it was referred to in the * Governor General's speech. I do not suppose that I should be justified in asking if the concurrence of the other leader of the Opposition has been arranged for in this matter; but the fact that no action in regard to it was taken on the Address-inReply practically amounted to an admission that, so far as Australia is concerned, a decision has been arrived at, and the electors generally favour preferential trade. Assuming that to be so, I do not think that any further step can be taken until some tangible proposal is made to us by the Imperial Government- I do see the value of. another Conference, details cannot be arranged until' Conthe principle of preferential trade has preferenbeen assented to in Great Britain.",13
9,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,A Conference would pre- Mr Glynn - rThi s House has not yet I ask him spoken on the .subject.,13
10,Mr WATSON,Unknown,Australi a has exconsiders it depressed her wishes.,13
11,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,The opinions of the people Australia have never been tested in this,13
12,Mr WATSON,Unknown,-The fact that the matter was allowed to go by default is equiexvalent to a test having been made. Our free-trade friends Hid not test the. opinions of members in reference'; to an alteration the Tariff; but the feeling of the people was was admitted when they allowed it to reof the main in its present condition.,13
13,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I have already pointed been out that when questions are put to a that Minister it is only courteous for the House the to let him give his own answers to them. the I ask honourable members not to attempt to Briput words into the mouthof the Prime Minister, and to receive without interjectthe replies which he pleases to give. I would remind the House that at question prelitime members may only ask direct questions, and Ministers may only reply to them. Questions of policy must not be . Mr CONROY - Is it in order fpr the GoPrime Minister to express views which many""of.us think absolutely erroneous?",13
14,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I understand that question time was instituted to give honourable members an opportunity to a>sk questions to"" elicit the views of Ministers, and to give Ministers an opportunity to express their views.",14
15,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"I was expressing merely my own views; I would not attempt to express those of the honourable and learned member. I have shown how the matter appears to me. In my opinion, we should now wait until a proposal comes from Great Britain.",14
16,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,What I speak of would be a proposal for a Conference.,14
17,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"If the proposal for a Conference is made to the Government it will have our grave consideration. Hitherto I have dealt only with a suggestion which was not put forward by any one holding office. Although Mr Chamberlain occupies a very prominent and honoured position in England, he is not at present a responsible Minister. It therefore remains merely a suggestion. If it shape, and becomes more than a suggestion, it will, of course, receive every consideration. MEDICINE CHESTS: P.ORT DARWIN TELEGRAPH LINE .",14
18,Sir LANGDON BONYTHON,Unknown,"Las t the week I asked the Postmaster-GeneralAre medicine chests supplied to the outlying stations on the Port Darwin telegraph line, as was the case when the line was under the control of the South Australian Government ? The Minister repliedYes, except at Port Darwin and Pine Creek, where medical services can be obtained. I have excellent authority for believing that answer is not correct. I am in formed that Sir Charles Todd, the Deputy Postmaster-General of South Australia, on available. the 24th February, 1902, formally notified that supplies of medicine for stations the overland line were to be discontinued, and that no medicines whatever have been provided by the Federal Government. Mr. Herbert and Mr Mitchell, the representastated tives of the Northern Territory in the Australian House of Assembly, have been in communication with me in regard to j£i2.000 this matter. Mr Herbert writes as lows : I have noticed the information elicited from the Federal Government to the effect medicine chests are supplied to outlying stations on the overland telegraph line, as was the tom under the State control. The answer, fear, has been given under a misapprehension. I believe I am absolutely correct in saying that the supplies of medicine for the chests referred to were stopped by the Department, and that they have not been since resumed. If the Minister would like me to give him a specific case of a station not having a chest of medicines provided, I think I can name one-the Powell Creek Station. I desire to know whether the Minister will make further inquiries into the matter.",14
19,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I certainly shall make further inquiries. It would appear, from the information furnished by the honourable member, that there has been some misapprehension. When the Department was under State control, the authorities supplied medicines at the outlying stations, and it may be that in the departmental view this duty still rests with the State Government, because it cannot be contended that it is necessary for the proper administration of the Telegraph service that medicines and surgical appliances should be supplied in such cases. They are protakes vided for the convenience and assistance of persons who are travelling, and that being so, I conceive that the matter is ehtirely within the domain of the State Government.",14
20,Sir LANGDON BONYTHON,Unknown,"But the officers employed at the stations, and also stations, are under the control of the Federal Government.",14
21,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"That is so, and to the extent that such officers require medicines or surgical appliances, I presume that the Department will be prepared to supply them; but I am not aware that it is our duty to keep medicines or appliances for' the convenience of the travelling public. that However, I shall make further inquiries, and furnish the honourable member with any additional information that mav be on SERVICES RENDERED TO STATES GOVERNMENTS.",14
22,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether it is a fact, as in the Age of Friday last, that the South Commonwealth Government is making a claim upon the Victorian Government for odd for '-various services rendered folby Post and Telegraph officers; further, whether it is a fact that this claim would by you not have been made had it not been for that some remarks made by the Premier of Viccustoria. I trust that the Minister will be able I to enlighten us upon this point, because it is distinctly stated that the Government are playing a game of tit-for-tat, and that the claim would not have been made but for their resentment of Mr Bent's criticisms. - Mr WATSON - I understand that some claim against the Victorian Government is being prepared by the Post Office authorities, in consideration of services rendered to the State. I am not aware of the details, or'the grounds upon which the claim is made, because it has not yet come to me for presentation.",14
23,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown,The claim is not being made in a spirit' of revenge ?,15
24,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Certainl y not. The relations which have, so far, existed between all the States Governments and this Government have been of the most cordial description. We have had no reason to complain, nor do I think that this Government have given any cause for complaint by the States Governments. UNIFORM WHARFAGE CHARGES.",15
25,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"I desire to know from the Prime Minister what steps, if any, have been taken with a view to secure uniform wharfage rates in the various States?",15
26,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Some little time ago I stated that it was the intention of the Government to take whatever steps were possible to persuade the various States authorities-whethe r the States Governments or bodies acting under their authority-to so regulate their wharfage charges, and to so harmonize them, fhat no distinction would be drawn between the produce of any of the States; the idea being, of course, to obviate the necessity for appointing the Inter-State Comimission, so far as that aspect of. the matter is concerned. Since then my honorablecolleague, the Minister of Trade and Customs has, in one or two cases, asked to be relieved of the work of collecting differential rates, as a preliminary to further action being taken by the States Governments themselves. That has occurred in Victoria. My"" honourable colleague holds that we have no power to collect the differential rates, and I believe that the Victorian Government proposes to take action in the direct tion of equalizing the charges. I have addressed letters upon the subject to some of the other States Governments. not yet aware of the detailed proposals which they intend to carry out; but I am satisfied that there should be no great difficulty in arriving at some arrangement for getting rid of the existing anomalies. ELECTORAL ACT COMMITTEE.",15
27,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Minister of Home Affairs whether, in - view of the very serious irregularities that seem to have ocurred in the Electoral Department in Sydney, he will take steps to appoint a Royal Commission to pursue the inquiry commenced by the Electoral Act Committee, which seems to be finable to spare the time necessary to attend to the matter. At present, I need not say any more than that the evidence recently taken in Sydney discloses a very serious state of affairs.",15
28,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"I do not think that the Select Committee are unable to obtain the evidence necessary to enable them to arrive at a conclusion as to whether or not grave irregularities have occurred. I do not regard it as necessary to appoint a Royal Commission, because I consider that the Select Committee will be in a position to inquire fully into the whole question.. Evidence in rebuttal of that recently given in Sydney will be presented by the Department. STEAMER SUBSIDY: WESTERN AUSTRALIA. - Mr KELLY -- I desire to. ask the Prime Minister, without notice, whether he will"" take steps to test the legality of the action of the Western Australian Government in granting a subsidy for a fast steamer ser0 vice between Geraldton and Perth.",15
29,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"I have not had time to look into the matter referred to, and, therefore, I should like further notice before I am called upon to give an answer. I imagine that the subject is rather an important one. OBSOLETE FIELD GUNS'.",15
30,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister a question having reference to the offer of certain obsolete field guns, for ornamental purposes, which was recently made to the States Governments. I understand that some of the States Governments have declined to accept the guns upon the conditions laid down in the offer. In view of that fact, and in order that no municipality may be deprived of any guns which it may desire to obtain, will the Government make a similar offer to the muniI am cipalities direct?",15
31,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"I am aware that the Government of Western Australia has intimated that it scarcely cares to accept the responsibility of these obsolete weapons. In some cases- I do not say that my remark applies to all-it seems that the guns so heavy that a fair expenditure would quire to be incurred to remove some people do not care to be saddled with "" white elephants "" of that description.",15
32,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Ver y few of the guns are mounted,",16
33,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"T h a f is so, and consea quently it is necessary to construct carriages or some kind of mounting for them.",16
34,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,It cost the munimight cipality of Parramatta .£15 to mount their hour named. guns.,16
35,Mr WATSON,Unknown,It . is satisfactory know that Parramatta could afford to would spend that sum in beautifying its public parks.,16
36,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"Does that remark apply to any part of Australia, as I for some of the guns for Geelong?",16
37,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"The Government .enterveral tain no objection £0 allowing any local body or representative institution to obtain these guns so far as their number will permit. member for Hume. My general impression is that the military, authorities are very anxious to use the storage room which is at present occupied by these obsolete weapons, and therefore they would be extremely glad to them. SEAT OF GOVERNMENTBILL .",16
38,Mr REID,Unknown,I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether he is prepared to allow of a short suspension of the sitting prior to the ballot being taken in connection with the Seat of Government Bill. I understand that some of the trains were late to-daythe Sydney express was somewhat behind time-and I believe that one or two honourable members who have come tOoMelbourne for the express purpose of taking part in the ballot have not yet reached the House. I suppose that there is a disposition upon - all sides to allow honourable members who have journeyed here for that purpose an qpportunity of recording their votes.,16
39,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,How long an interval does the right honourable member suggest?,16
40,Mr REID,Unknown,"- I think that a suspension of the sitting until a' quarter-past 3 would allow a very fair latitude. I know that one or two honourable members who' have come to Melbourne for the purpose of recording their votes have not yet reached the House. They may put in an appearance at any moment, and I am sure that nobody desires them to be shut out from the ballot 'for the sake of a minute or two. I would .therefore suggest that the sitting of the are House be suspended until a quarter-past 3 reo'clock, if the Prime Minister thinks that them, and is a reasonable proposal.",16
41,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"I have no objection to meeting the convenience of honourable members in the way suggested; but perhaps some other honourable member might desire suspension of the sitting for a few minutes longer. If not,. at the conclusion of the ordinary business, Mr Speaker leave the chair, and resume it at the",16
42,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"If any delay to is to occur in the taking of the ballot, I suggest that the sitting should be suspended for a little longer period-sa y t ill half-past 3 o'clock-becaus e there are several honourable members in the city with whom have applied we cannot communicate.",16
43,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,There are seothers who wish to get away.,16
44,Mr WATSON,Unknown,I am quite prepared to f all in with the suggestion of the honourable,16
45,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"In accordance with the arrangement which has been arrived at, I shall leave the chair after questions have been answered until half-past 3 o'clock. get rid of NEWSOUTH WALES VOLUNTEE R REGIMENTS.",16

SEAT OF GOVERNMENTBILL . The order of the day for a ballot to determine the district within which the Seat of Government should be situated having been read,",16
48,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"When a similar ballot was taken last year some rules for the conduct of the ballot were prepared and followed, and I propose, with the approval of the House, that these rules shall again be observed. Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear.",17
49,Mr REID,Unknown,"I understand, Mr Speaker, that the signature of an honourable member is essential?",17
50,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Absolutely .,17
51,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Are honourable members to understand that they must place a cross opposite the area for which they desire to vote?,17
52,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Honourable members, of course, may make only one cross and that must be placed opposite the one of the three areas for which they vote. The House 'then proceeded to the first ballot.",17

Wales.",17
55,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown," The ballot which has just Keen taken leaves the wording of the clause now under consideration very much as it stands. The Government have stated throughout the discussion that it was their intention to narrow down the locality to much more restrictive limits than a radius of fifty miles. A radius of fifty miles would include two or threesites which have been suggested. But the important sites in the South-Eastern District are Bombala and Dalgety. I understand that the majority of honourable members who voted for a site in the South-Eastern District are in favour of the Dalgety site. order that we may obtain an expression of opinion which will be more definite than the clause at present contains. I think that it would be better for me to move the .omission of all the words from "" within"" to ""Bombala,"" with a view of inserting the words ""twenty-five miles from Dalgety."" The radius would give us a sufficient margin to enable the best, site within that district to be selected. It would exclude Bombala and a number of towns which, it is generally agreed, it would not be desirable to select. If the course which I suggest is adopted, it will be understood as an instruction to the Government to obtain a site within a reasonable distance of Dalgety. That, I believe, is what is generally desired. I therefore move That the following words be left out portion of New South Wales bounded on the north by a direct line running from the town bula to the town of Cooma, thence due west border of the State of Victoria, and within . miles of Bombala.""",18
56,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown," I to obtain a somewhat clearer explanation what the amendment means than I have been able to gather from the statement of the Minister. Does amendment mean that when the is selected any possibility of obtaining a port within the Federal Territory excluded; or does it mean choosing the actual Seat of Government, reserving the right at a later stage in a port with the territory? It. is to the Committee that honourable members; should know exactly what is meant far the proposal goes.",18
57,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,The territory is dealt with in the next clause. The purpose 'of the clause under consideration simply is to determine the locality of the Seat of Government.,18
58,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"That only ? . Mr BATCHELOR - Yes , that only. The question of the territory to be chosen will be considered in connection with clause 3.",18
59,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown," I would suggest to the Minister of Home Affairs that the better way to amend the clause in order to attain the object in view is first to settle which site is the more favoured by the Committee, Bombala or Dalgety. We should take a vote in order to elicit an expression of opinion as between In Bombala and Dalgety. If the proposal which the Minister has submitted is adopted we shall probably find ourselves blocked in the endeavour to obtain a port within the Federal area.",18
60,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Not at all. Mr AUSTIN . CHAPMAN - Then an amendment will be required in clause 3, which provides that the territory to be acquired is to be the territory mentioned in clause 2. We must first of all obtain an expression of opinion as to whether Bombala or Dalgety should be selected, and we must not deprive ourselves of the right to claim a port, the desirability of which has recommended the Bombala site to many honourable members. To lay it .down in clause 2, as the Minister proposes to do, that the site selected shall be within a radius of ""twenty-five miles of Dalgety, would, unless clause 3 were :- "" that amended, exclude all possibility of the of Pamterritory embracing a port.' We should to the endeavour to leave the Bill as nearly as fifty possible in the state in which the Senate sent it to us. To adopt the amendment wish proposed by the Minister would be pracof tically to make a new Bill of it.",18
61,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"The object of the Government is to get a nearer indicathe tion of the opinion of the Committee. In area order that that may be done, we must first settle the question whether Bombala will be or Dalgety is to be chosen. That can be that we are determined by one vote.",18
62,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown," I quite agree with the proposal subdue: mitted by the Minister. The words which he proposes to omit are absolutely useless for and howthe purpose for which they have been inserted 'in the clause. In the first place, they provide that the. Seat of Government shall be within a territory which in one direction would be 150 miles in length, and the description of the territory is then limited by a subsequent description that it shall be within fifty miles bf Bombala. As applied to the Seat of Government, the two descriptions are inconsistent. The proper place in which to define the territory is the next clause.",18
63,Mr WATSON,Unknown,If it is necessary to define it at all.,19
64,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Jus t so; but the words proposed to be left out are absolutely useless, and are made useless bf the subsequent provision that the Seat of Government shall be within fifty miles of Bombala. I can only account for the inconsistency of the clause by assuming that the various amendments proposed in the Senate created confusion. We are here not to fix a district, but to determine the Seat of Government. We should do that, and we should not leave it to a subsequent selection from a large area which may include several sites.",19
65,Mr MCCAY,Unknown," I agree with the honourable member for North Sydney as to the vagueness of the clause. I desire to know something with respect to the method by which the Minister proposes to ascertain the desire of the Committee. I should like to say that Governments and Parliaments have, before now, found that it is easier to create a blank than to fill it. If we create a blank in this clause as proposed, there will be nothing to prevent that blank remaining unfilled for' ever, so far as this Committee is concerned, by a combination of supporters of two sites as against the supporters of a third. I am not saying this with any desire to secure an advantage for the site mentioned in the Bill, or the site which was selected a few minutes ago by honourable members, because neither of them is my first choice. We have had previous examples of combinations. To move that these words should be left out, with a view to insert other words, would be a .perfectly right course to pursue, in the circumstances, if we knew that, as a matter of course, the . striking out of these words would be followed by the formal insertion of the other words proposed. But once these words are left out, the whole question is again enlarged. I should advise the insertion of certain words first, if they - could be agreed to, and we could strike out the superfluous words afterwards. desire is to secure ' f a ir play for all concerned, because, as I say, Bombala and Dalgety are by no means the objects of my primary selection in this matter.",19
66,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Bland - Treasurer) In accordance with the suggestion of the honourable and learned member for Corinella, it might simplify the procedure, and assuage any fears which some honourable members may entertain of the difficulties always liable to crop up in connection with matters of this sort, if the Minister of Home Affairs were to withdraw his present amendment, and move the insertion, after the word "" within,"" of the words "" a radius of twenty-five."" Then any honourable mem- . ber, who desired to do so, could move an amendment upon the amendment, with the object of altering the word "" twenty-five"" to "" fifty,"" if that should be desired.",19
67,Mr DAVID THOMSON,Unknown,Why not make it fifty miles in the first instance?,19
68,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Because , in my view, it is absolutely ridiculous to talk of the selection of a site within a radius of fifty miles. The necessity for getting this Bill through is, that Parliament may, by some determination, indicate where it wishes the Federal Capital to be, and if we indicate a territory with a diameter of 100 miles, no one can say that we have thus indicated where the Capital should be. It might be anywhere within that vast range of country.",19
69,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,We could leave that to the two Governments concerned.,19
70,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"In my opinion, the Federal Parliament should indicate its choice much more nearly than that, for the benefit of the Government. I do not say that it would be putting too much responsibility upon the Government, but it certainly would be burdening the Government to ask them to interpret the will of the House in making a selection within such an area as that to which I have referred. I think that a radius of twenty-five miles would cover the maximum range of choice which should be allowed. Even that would give a diameter of fifty miles to the circle, and I am rather inclined to agree that that is a little too much.",19
71,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"It would cover 1,963 square miles.",19
72,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"That is a very big range. The object should be to ciit the area down to .as fine and definite a point as is consistent with our present information, and with the possibility that a new location may be necessary My only for the actual site of the Federal city - that is to say, within a mile or two of particular place we select. I think, thereever, fore, that the better plan, following the suggestion of the honourable and learned member for Corinella, would be to propose the insertion of the. words I have indicated, including the words "" twenty-five,"" and the Committee could afterwards take a vote upon the insertion of the word Dalgety in lieu of the. word Bombala, if honourable members so desired.",19
73,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown," We have selected the district in which the Seat of Government is to be located, and it has now become our duty to my select the site. The best way in which to proceed is to ascertain from the Committee which site within this disconviction trict honourable members prefer. Four sites have been named and inspected-Dalgety Bombala, Delegate, and Coolringdon. pears to me that what we have to do now is to find but which of those four. sites : favoured by the majority of the members the Committee. Having done that, the of Government should be fixed within sonable distance of the site selected, twenty-five miles would be a more than ample range, knowing the localities as dp. We know that the Bombala site not more than thiee or four miles from the town of Bombala; the Dalgety site would be within a radius of five miles the bridge at Dalgety; the Delegate would be within three or four miles' of the town of Delegate; and the Coolringunderstanding don site is well known. No doubt choice of the Committee will be either Dalgety or Bombala. A very few miles from either place would suffice to clude the site of the actual Capital, and whether we say ten or twenty-five miles will make no difference in the selection. Then we have the question the area of the territory, which will be considered on clause 3. By the course I suggest, we should let it be well known, that every site in this district has had chance of being dealt with; whereas, i adopt the proposal of the Governmentthough I have no objection to it, personally - it might be thought we were barring claim 0? some sites. What we have to now is to definitely say which site in this possible in the Bill. district is approved b.y a majority Committee.",20
74,Mr REID,Unknown," I quite agree with the course the Government taken; in fact, I think they are scarcely the definite enough in the amendment. Howthe amendment means a better state of things than is contemplated in the clause. So far as I am concerned, as a representative of New South Wales, though I have strongly and consistently endeavoured to procure the selection of Lyndhurst, I have the consolation, after the division which has taken place, of recognising that that division is an honest expression of opinion by the House. I accept that decision as not brought about, as some other position might have been, by any unfair imeans, but as a fair and honest expression of the views of the majority; The decision'is much against own views, but I have at least the satisfaction of feeling that the selection which has been made does represent the honest of the majority of the members of this House. Therefore, so far as I am con, cerned, I want to help the Government so It apfar as I can. What New South Wales may think is another matter; it is for New is South Wales to look after her own affairs of in her own Parliament. I am strongly Seat against the large area, but it must a reabe left to the Government and the and people of New South. Wales to look after their own interests. I will do all I we can in this Chamber to get the views I reis present expressed in the provisions of the Bill ; bur, so long as the procedure is, as it has been, thoroughly bond fide, I am not' . of going to carry my protest further. I wish site to say that I accept in good faith this radius amendment to insert Dalgety, upon the that the site' is within the a reasonable distance of Dalgety, as intended by Parliament. I have made no secret of my view that I should not inconsider the choice of Dalgety one which, manifestly, I could not regard with some sort of feeling of respect; I have never denounced that site as one with regard to of which I had any sort of decided feeling one have to way or the other. I am prepared, so far as I am concerned, as a member of this House, to accept the decision, which has a fair been honestly arrived at, without any manif we pulation of votes;-whic h expresses a preference as between Lyndhurst and Dalgety. But 1 do not think that, having now chosen the Dalgety, we ought, in the interest of all do parties,_to make our selection as definite as Of course, I shall of the accept the Government amendment, to make the radius twenty-five miles, as an improvement on a radius of fifty miles; but I do have so on the distinct. understanding that the Government place upon that amendment a reasonable interpretation-that it means Dalgety, and not some other places twentytended. five miles away.",20
75,Mr WATSON,Unknown,Quite so.,21
76,Mr DAVID THOMSON,Unknown,Why not take a vote on Dalgetv as against Bombala?,21
77,Mr REID,Unknown,I think that would be the straightest course of all.,21
78,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"The Government should not be tied to a mile or two-ther e ought to be an allowance of ten miles, at least.",21
79,Mr REID,Unknown,I desire that we should carry out the spirit of the decision arrived at by the House.,21
80,Mr WATSON,Unknown,That is the idea.,21
81,Mr REID,Unknown,"The Government will be charged with carrying out the spirit of the decision; and the spirit is that the site shall be within the Dalgety district. If it is found that by going a mile or two away from a particular spot a better Site may be found, no human being will raise the slightest objection. But it is to be understood that there must be no sort of undermining, so as to bring about the selection of Bombala.",21
82,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,Bombala is thirty miles away.,21
83,Mr REID,Unknown,"The distance is greater, I think; but I should like to be satisfied by the honourable imember for Eden-Monaro, that he, as the representative of the - district in which these two sites are, accepts the decision of the House in regard to Dalgety-that he accepts that decision, just as I do.",21
84,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,That is a question for the decision of Ministers.,21
85,Mr REID,Unknown,But I want to be satisfied that the honourable member for Eden Monaro has not in his pocket some other site within twenty-five miles.,21

88,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"South Sydney) seventeen miles? - I agree with the honourable and learned member for Corinella as to the way in which we should proceed. It would be a mistake, I think, to omit a large portion of the clause, with a view to inserting some other words. Bv so doing we may get into trouble; and we ought, therefore, insert after the word ""bounded"" some I the merits of Dalgety. words which will clearly express what is inThe only difficulty is as to the radius.",21
89,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"Shoul d not the words which I think the honourable member has in mind, be inserted after the word '-' within ""?",21
90,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"I suggest that after the word "" bounded,"" the following words be inserted: "" by a circle, the radius of which measures seventeen miles from the township of Dalgety."" That is the area marked out on the map as the Dalgety site. With a radius of fifty miles, or even of twenty-five miles, we should increase the subsequent difficulty in settling the site; and I think that a radius of seventeen miles-, as marked on the map, is amply sufficient, as we have already decided on the district. I am quite in accord with the leader of the Opposition that the House has come to an honest and legitimate - decision. I have - supported Lyndhurst all through, but I recognise the decision now arrived at as one we must respect, and> notwithstanding differences of opinion as to the relative merits of the two over sites, a decision amply justified by the qualifications of the site chosen. It would be a mistake to create trouble such as we have had in the past, and such as we might be supposed to have got rid of ; but difficulty might arise if we created a large circle in which the Seat of Government must ultimately be fixed. If the Government will not adopt mv suggestion, I should like to test the feeling of the Committee by moving an amendment in the terms I have indicated.",21
91,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,The honourable member cannot submit 'that amendment. The question before us now is the omission,21

It seems to me, in view of the reports of skilled officers, that this area probably contains any site we to could have had in mind when discussing To extend the area to twenty-five miles would be to give a great deal further trouble in th? ultimate decision. >I think the Prime Minister admits himself that we should be wrong in making the area too large-that we should thereby complicate the final settlement. If , however, we have a radius of seventeen miles, as marked on the map, we shall keep faith with the decision of the House, and by adopting the Dalgety district with that limitation, we shall be much nearer to having the exact site fixed beyond all question. adopted a larger area, we should probably have other sites submitted, and the whole competition, though narrowed down to ' a smaller compass, would practically have to be once more faced. „",21
95,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown," I think that some of the speeches which have been made upon the amendment have been a little previous. There is nothing to prevent an honourable member from movabsent when the ballot was taken. ing the insertion of any site. to be supposed that we are confined to sites within the South-Eastern District. intend to move the insertion of a site is not in that district. The balloting no doubt honest, but, unfortunately, honourable members were absent. they been here, the South-Eastern District would have been rejected on the first counted for. ballot, and the contest would have been between the Southern District and the Western District, which would have entirely altered the position of matters. HonorI able members have not yet had an opporportant tunity to give a straight-out vote for against anv particular district. raising this objection for the first time directly upon the sites. now, because some time ago I suggested to the Minister that an exhaustive ballot should be taken. What we have just has been only a single ballot, whereas exhaustive ballot would have pitted every proposed site. proposed site against every other proposed site. After the first ballot had - been be agreed to taken, and the Southern District rejected, there should have been a ballot between the two remaining sites, and then the southern site should have been pitted against each of those sites. That would have been an exhaustive ballot. to induce the Minister to adopt that ner of balloting, because it is the only fair one. I understand, however, that now it is open to me to of any site in the Southern District, while other members could move the insertion Lyndhurst, Dalgety, Bombala, or any proposed site they wish. This will be the only opportunity to really test the feeling of honourable members in regard to the proposed sites.",22
96,Mr EWING,Unknown,The words proposed to be left out must be left out before the name of any proposed site can be inserted.,22
97,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Quite so. [ think that the proposal made by the Mini-ster in the first instance is the proper one to adopt.  If we member accept his "" licking "" like a man ?",22

The amendment which I desire to submit is upon the lines of the suggestion of the honourable member for South Sydney, that the Seat of Government should be situated within a radius of seventeen miles from the town of Dalgety, but I have framed my proposal in a somewhat different form.

The honourable member for Gwydir will then be afforded an opportunity of 'proposing by way of amendment to insert before "" Dalgety"" the word "" Tooma."" The adoption of that course will enable the Committee to reach some finality. If the honourable member will agiee to my suggestion I shall adhere to my first choice and vote for the selection of the Tooma site, although I do not suppose for a moment that it has any chance of winning. After we have turned our backs upon the vagueness represented by districts, and have set our eyes upon a definite locality, it seems to me veryundesirable that we should retrace our. steps.

148,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"I presume, then, that after the site of the Capital has been selected we shall requirl to enact legislation in respect of the territory surrounding it. If that be so, of course I am satisfied; but it appears to me that in its present form the Federal territory will embrace an area within a radius of seventeen miles of Dalgety.",26
149,Mr REID,Unknown,Absolutel y no. The two matters are quite distinct.,26

155,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown," I m o v e - others. That after the word "" of,"" in the words inserted, the word ""Welaregang"" be inserted. I do so because of the alteration which has been made in the radius within which the Seat of Government shall be selected. It has now been fixed at seventeen miles. The Tooma and Welaregang are identical. The former name has been used by honourable members during this debate, merely because it is that of the township adjacent to thesite, and is better known to honourable members because it is the terminal point of the visits which they paid to that district. I hold that a serious injustice will be done, not only to the people of today, but to those of the future, if we do not select the site which is superior, on account of its situation. spite of all the reports which have been submitted for our consideration-and I have read them very carefully- I claim that the Welaregang site, or one within a radius of seventeen ""miles of it, would afford a unique position for the Federal Capital. In discussing"" the relative merits of the Tooma and Dalgety sites, I need not recapitulate the statements which I made upon a previous occasion. The climatic conditions obtaining at the two places constitute a most material difference between them. Moreover, the land adjacent to th?. Welaregang site is of better quality, and consequently far more productive than is that in the neighbourhood of Dalgety. These two factors have weighed very strongly with me in inducing, me to conclude that the former site is preferable to the latter. Some honourable members affirm that the Commonwealth should possess a port of its own. If it be possible for us to secure a port-and I believe it is very improbable that we can obtain a port in connection with the Seat of Government in the Southern Monaro district- I hold that no honourable member can express a definite opinion as to the expenditure which will be required to establish it, and to construct a railway to it. In my judgment, the possession of a port is not so essential to the Seat of Government as some honourable members appear to think. I be that its possession would render the I Capital more easy of attack than it would",27
156,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,Whereabout s at its own. It Tooma is there a port?,27
157,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,I am not speaking of a port at Tooma. The honourable member has a habit of misconstruing the remarks of,27
158,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,I merely put the question to the honourable member; there was a possibility of misunderstanding.,27
159,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,If the honourable member were speaking there would be a still greater possibility of misapprehensites sion;,27
160,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,Are we to have another general discussion?,27
161,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I intend to express t my opinions with regard to the relative merits of Tooma and Dalgety, and, if the opportunity offers, to vote for the better of those sites. I i the Federal Capital were connected by railway with a port close at hand, which would be open to attack by an enemy, it would be exposed to In great danger-to ""a danger which would not exist if the Capital were situate at Welaregang. I trust that a realization of the danger of having a port close at hand will deter honourable members from selecting Dalgety as against Tooma. It is also important that consideration should be - given to the climatic conditions of the, several sites. I have made inquiries from relatives and others who have lived in the Monaro district, and have ..been informed by them that the weather there is intensely cold, and that the winds are almost penetrating in their keenness. Surely honourable members are not anxious to select a site at which they could not .reasonably reside for several months in the year. That would be the position if the Capital were established at Dalgety - At Tooma, however, the climate, in both summer and winter, is ideal, and, so far as I am aware, is unequalled by that of any other part of Australia. I trust that honourable members will recognise that we have to consider riot our own personal comfort, but the desirableness of selecting a site which will cause the Capital to be attractive to tourists and others. If the Capital were situated in a picturesque spot, . * 0 many persons would be induced to visit it from time to time, and in that way we should secure, an increased railway revenue which would assist in the payment of interest on the cost of the railway .to the Capital, or on the cost of the establishment of the Federal city itself. Tooma has a water supply, which, in its volume, purity, and permanency, is equal to that of Dalgety, and it has so many other essential elements that I feel that I am doing my duty to the State from which I come in recommending that it be selected. I do not wish to labour this question, because I have already dealt f u l ly with the .Tooma site, but I submit the amendment in order that the Committee may have anopportunity to arrive at a decision that will be in the best interests of all.",27
162,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"I desire to know, Mr. Chairman, whether the amendment is in order, as I understand that the Welaregang site is not within the South-Eastern District, which the House has selected by ballot. If honourable members turn to the resolution passed on the 27th ultimo, determining the method of selection, they will find that it provides that. . . A further ballot shall then be taken on the names of the remai'ning .sites, and the name of the site receiving the majority of votes shall be reported to the House by the Speaker, and such site shall be deemed to i i the site preferred by honourable members. . . The House shall thereupon resolve itself into a Committee of the whole on the Bill. The Standing Orders were suspended, and it seems to me that Ave can work only within the authority of the House, and that the resolution as to the method of procedure is binding.",28
163,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"On the point of order. I submit that the taking of the ballot has been practically a mere waste of time. That ballot had no necessary reference the Bill, and there is nothing in the resolution to which the honourable and learned member has referred u^iich relates to measure now before us. It is open to the Committee to reverse all that we have done by the process of the ballot. ballot 'did not take place in the House, and does not bind us in any way. method of procedure was adopted, purely for the convenience of honourable members, and the Committee is not bound or limited by it in any way. ' The CHAIRMAN - The point of order raised is that the Committee is bound by the result of the ballot. I would out to the honourable and learned member that the Committee has no official cognizance of a ballot, and that we are dealing with the Bill now before us in the ordinary way. As the honourable member for Parramatta has said, the Standing Orders were suspended for the convenience of honourable members, and to conserve the time of the House. It will be competent for an honourable member to move any amendment, either on this clause or any other clause of the Bill , provided that it is in accordance with the Standing Orders.",28
164,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown," It is remarkable that, with only one exception, every honourable member who inspected' the Tooma site came to the conclusion that it was the best that could be selected. Before visiting Dalgety, I was greatly impressed by what I had read and heard of its suitability, and remarked that if it came up to my expectations, it would assuredly receive my vote. I visited the district, and my expectations with but one exception were realized, the exception being in regard to the value of the soilI should have been disappointed had I voted for Dalgety without visiting Tooma, and I feel sure that if honourable members had inspected both Dalgety and Tooma, as I did, the last named district would have secured an exceedingly large majority.",28
165,Mr CONROY,Unknown,Would not the selection of Tooma be somewhat out of keeping with the spirit of the Constitution?,28
166,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"Certainly not. It would be within both the letter and the spirit of the Constitution. The Constitution empowers us to select the best site in New South Wales, provided that it be not less than 100 miles distant from Sydney; and, therefore, we should not violate its spirit by voting for to any site in the Tumut district.",28
167,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"Why was it agree'd that, pending the establishment of the Capital, the the Parliament should sit in Melbourne?",28
168,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"That compact was entered into by the representatives of New The South Wales and Victoria, and seemed at the time to be satisfactory to both parties. A certain It was a bargain, and, to my mind, New South Wales is likely in the end to have the best of it. <- Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Not if Tooma be selected.",28
169,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"The honourable point member seems to desire to secure for New South Wales the whole of the advantages accruing fijom the establishment of the Capital; his one fear appears to be that some advantage may accrue to Victoria. Mr. JOSEPH COOK , - No ; we merely ask for some little advantage for New South Wales.",28
170,Mr REID,Unknown,Dalget y is far enough away from Sydney.,29
171,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,It is also so far away from Victoria as to render it impossible for. that State to secure any benefit from the establishment of the Capital there. The honourable member - for Parramatta is adopting a very narrow view of this' question; he will be quite satisfied as long as the whole of the advantages go to Sydney.,29
172,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,- I have anything of the kind.,29
173,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"If the Capital be established in the Tooma district, New South Wales will certainly secure the greater advantage. Had it not been considered that the Capital would be an advantage to the State in which it was established, the right honourable member for East Sydney would have fought just as valiantly for its establishment in some other State, as he did for the insertion of the clause in the Constitution providing that it should be located in' New South Wales.",29
174,Mr REID,Unknown,Why this attack on me?,29
175,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"I give the right honourable member the fullest credit for having made an excellent bargain for the State which he represents- a bargain in which the State from which I come will not be able to participate. The establishment of the Capital in New South Wales will be a great disadvantage to South Australia. At present the representatives of that State may attend the sittings of the Parliament in Melbourne, and at the same time give some attention to the businesses in which they are engaged; but when the Capital is established in New South Wales they will not be able to conduct any private business; they will have to remain at the Capital during the whole of each session.",29
176,Mr REID,Unknown,They will be very desirable colonists.,29
177,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,And I admit that New South Wales is a very desirable State . for colonists; but I wish to secure the selection of the most eligible site in which to reside.,29
178,Mr REID,Unknown,A burial ground.,29
179,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,I have only ' to say in reply to the right honourable member that. I did not see a.cemetery in the Toorra district.,29
180,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"Because the place is not inhabited. Mr HUTCHI . SON - I begin to think that the sooner it is inhabited the better. I am willing and anxious to seea large population settled at the earliest moment in that district. It is a much more desirable district than that of Dalgety. I deplore the spirit evinced by some of the representatives of New South Wales, who show that their one great fear is, that Victoria may derive some advantage from the selection of a certain site. not said Mr. JOSEPH COOK - So far there has been no such suggestion.",29
181,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"The suggestion may not have been actually made, but actions spejak louder than words; in this instance they have spoken much louder than words.",29
182,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,There need te no advantage to either State.,29
183,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"I speak as a looker-on. I am quite satisfied with the bargain which has been made with New South Wales-the mother State-that ""she shall have the> Federal territory within her borders. We are not going to take the Federal Capital away from her. From having the Federal Capital within her territory, New South Wales would certainly derive advantages.",29
184,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,That is precisely what is proposed to be done-w e are taking it away.,29
185,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,I call attention to the statement of the honourable member for Parramatta that we are going to take the Capital away from New South Wales. Away to where?,29
186,Mr JOSEPH CCJOK,Unknown,We are going to place a portion of her territory under Federal control and ownership,29
187,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"We are going to have Federal control over a very small part of New South Wales, and that will lead to very great advantages to that State. In my opinion, Victoria would not have been a party to the Federal compact if it had not been that her people saw that there was going to be a very great advantage to this State through the Seat of Government being fixed in Melbourne for a considerable time.",29
188,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown,There would have been exactly the same majority for the . Constitution if the Seat of Government had been fixed at Brisbane.,30
189,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"I doubt that statement very much. I doubt whether Victoria would have been a party to the 'Federal compact if it had not been seen that a considerable advantage would be derived by this State from the Federal Parliament meeting in Melbourne. lieve that every honourable member, representing Victoria, will admit that there has been a considerable advantage in that direction.",30
190,Mr CONROY,Unknown,How does that affect the question before us ?,30
191,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"Order ! the attention of the honourable, and learned member for Werriwa to the fact that the front seat on the right of the Chairman is reserved for Ministers.",30
192,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,I am in favour of the best district being selected. We have heard the praises of another district sung by the right honourable member for East Sydney,30
193,Mr REID,Unknown,"We are beaten, and knowledge it.",30
194,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,I believe that all the right honourable member said of the other district was thoroughly justified. But I should have been very glad if he had been able to pay a visit to Tooma.,30
195,Mr REID,Unknown,"I should have done so, if beauty of scenery had been in my mind a chief factor. I admit that it is a beaut if u l place.",30
196,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,I thoroughly agree that it is a most beautiful place.,30
197,Mr REID,Unknown,I objected to it on account of its want of accessibility.,30
198,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"No matter we fix the Federal Capital, it is going to be made accessible at the earliest moment. Any part of New South Wales in which we choose to fix the Capital will be made accessible at once.",30
199,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,B v whom?,30
200,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"I shall be sorry if that State is so short-sighted as not to provide access to the Capital. that case it will be the duty of the Comwould' monwealth Parliament to see that access at once provided. I am quite . that that will be done. accessibility is the very one that weighs with me in deciding that the best district in which to have the Federal Capital the Tooma district. The country fine as any in New South Wales. so good, indeed, that it is only a matter of time when there must be a large increase of population, and when New South Wales would make it accessible to settlers, whether the Capital were fixed there or not. I am quite sure that .that. State will derive a very handsome return from the railway that she constructs to thatdistrict. Of course, New South Wales possesses so much fine territory that I can thoroughly I be- understand that she cannot build railways to every part of the State. But I repeat that the consideration of accessibility need not weigh with honourable members. To my mind, Tooma is just as accessible as Dalgety. As far as railways are concerned, it is not so accessible as Lyndhurst; and the I draw very fact that Lyndhurst, being so accessible, has made so little progress, does not say much in favour of our choosing a site in that district. At any rate, I am very pleased that we shall have one more opportunity, if not two, to obtain an expression of opinion from honourable members in regard to fixing the Federal iCapital in the Tooma district.",30
201,Mr KELLY,Unknown," I am rather we acsurprised that the honourable member for Gwydir should have moved this amendment, because, some few weeks ago, he advocated .first choosing an area, and then proceeding with 1 the selection of a site within that area.",30
202,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,I am still of that opinion.,30
203,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I - hope so, because on turning to Hansard, page 3598, I find that while the Prime Minister was speaking, the honourable member made a significant interjection. The Prime Minister was sayingThe area within the fifty-miles' radius ""of a given point seems to be an enormous one to select where as a site for the Federal Capitalwhen the honourable member for Gwydir interjectedThe site for the Capital would be selected within that area. The honourable member was not an irresponsible interjector. As the mover of the motion then being discussed, he interjected In with a knowledge of what the result of it be. We have just chosen a site in the is South-Eastern District, and the honourable satisfied member is not pleased. Surely Tooma can The question of hardly be said to be within the SouthEastern District. Yet the honourable member moves an amendment in favour of thafsite, is although its selection would undo the whole is as of the work which we have just done. It is For that reason I am somewhat surprised that he should have submitted this 'proposal. I do riot propose to enter into the question of the relative merits of the sites. We have discussed that matter almost ad nauseam. Nor do I propose to follow the honourable member for Hindmarsh in his highly poetical panegyric with respect to the qualities of the almost uninhabited, region that surrounds Welaregang.",30
204,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Has the honourable member seen Welaregang?,31
205,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"No , but I should certainly have taken advantage of the very generous offer that was made to me to induce me to visit the site, except that, not feeling in the best of 'health, I feared that it might be fatal to me to visit such an inhospitable region. I do not propose to enter into the question of the relative merits of sites. I merely rose to point out that the honourable member for Gwydir seems to have reversed his former attitude. I think that the action of the Government is perfectly correct. We have reached the stage when we should deal with particular sites within the area the House has just chosen. We are dealing with them now in the best way. But I hope that we shall do nothing to stultify ourselves, by putting the question back to its position of two years ago.",31
206,Mr ISAACS,Unknown," I think that if the matter of the selection of the Capital Site were determined on its merits, there can be no doubt that the proposal of the honourable member for Gwydir would be accepted. If we looked at this question, not from a provincial stand-point, but from a national stand-point - and that is the aspect in which we should regard it - I believe we should have no hesitation in selecting a site in. the locality indicated in the amendment. It is strictly within Constitution. It is not only literally within the Constitution, but it is within the spirit of it also, as being within New South Wales,, but not within ioo miles of Sydney. I believe that if . the natural advantages and the prospective advantages to the Federation from the selection of that site were taken into consideration, it would be looked upon by honourable members in this House, and by the members of another Chamber, as the one most suitable to contain the Federal Capital of Australia. It is upon the great Australian river. It is within a district that is practically unlimited in point of its capacity for growth. I do not believe that there is a single requirement of a great national Capital which cannot be obtained near Welaregang or Tooma. It is of easy access, not only to New South Wales, being on a great trunk line of railway; but is equally easy . of access to Victoria and to South Australia. I do not believe that if we were to estimate the relative advantages of Dalgety, and compare them with those of Tooma or Welaregang, there would be any hesitation whatever in choosing the latter site. Because what would the selection of Dalgety or Bombala mean to the Victorians and South Australians? It would' mean a tremendous journey; we should have to go to Cooma, and then come back. The distance, as it appears upon the map, is not at all ' indicative of the actual distance that has to be travelled from the Southern States. There is nothing in the. interjections, we have heard, that we shall be infringing the spirit of the Constitution in choosing this site, if we do choose it. There is nothing in the objection that we shall be favouring Victoria or any other State. And though it seems almost hopeless to expect it at this' stage, I feel that we should be doing right, not only to this State, but to the whole Continent, if we were to choose the Federal Capital in the district now indicated. I cannot help expressing my surprise that so many Victorian members should differ from me in the view which they take upon this subject. I believe that from every stand-point we ought to select Welaregang.",31
207,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown," I do not intend to allow this matter to go to a vote without saying a few words in regard to some of the remarks which have been made. I would allude especially to an observation made, I think, by the honourable member for Wentworth as to the distance of the Welaregang from Sydney. I think I also heard the right honourable member for East Sydney make some such reference. First of all, I want to make it clear that New South Wales has practically decided to build a railway to this very spot.",31
208,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Practicall y decided?,31
209,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Yes ; and that line is to be built, not in the interests of Victoria, but of New South. Wales.",31
210,Mr KELLY,Unknown,H as the line from Tumut . to Welaregang been even surveyed ?,31
211,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Yes ; it has been reported upon, and carefully examined up to what is ' called Yarra Gap, which is the highest point before reachirig the proposed Capital Site. The object of building that line is to tap this very district, mainly in the interests of the trade of New South Wales. Of course, there is a double reason, to connect the head of the Murray-the river which is the main artery we have in Australia-wit h the lower dry plains, with a view to convey stock backwards and forwards, and to secure the Upper Murray trade. What is that trade now ? Where does it go to? Practically the whole of the business at present is done with Melbourne.",31
212,Mr KELLY,Unknown,What is the value of that trade ?,32
213,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"It is very heavy. I think the honourable member for Gippsland has some idea of its value. There are three districts, which mainly supply the Melbourne market with meat, namely, the Upper Murray, Gippsland, and the Western District of Victoria.",32
214,Mr MCLEAN,Unknown,"The honourable, member should have mentioned Gippsland first; it is a long wav ahead.",32
215,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Probably the honourable member is right, though I should have thought that the Western District came first. Most of the stock, and perhaps the best stock, they get come from the Upper Murray. It was to a 'large extent to retain part of that trade for the State that the Government of New South Wales commenced a railway, which will be extended right into the very heart of the country where this site is.",32
216,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Where are facts to be found?,32
217,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"They will be found by reference to the records Of the Public Works Department, in Sydney.",32
218,Mr KELLY,Unknown,In pigeon-holes there.,32
219,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"No . able members speak about this site in a manner which betrays their absolute rance of the whole matter. I do not think ago. that they knew sufficient of the geography of Australia before the site was mentioned here to be aware. of its existence, which shows. does not say much for their intelligence, or their interest in the State sent. This particular site, if selected, would shortly be much nearer to Sydney than would be, even if connected of which I have spoken, because an extension of the Tumut line, which will not be have stated times without number that, a very expensive affair, will give it direct communication with the metropolis.",32
220,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Mr Surveyor Chesterman says that he cannot be sure that the route is a practicable one.,32
221,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The honourable member need not worry about that.,32
222,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Mr Surveyor Chesterman's report is the only official report which we have.,32
223,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"And some honourable members appear not to wish for any other information. The . honourable member tried to burke further inquiry in reference to this place. He told us tonight that he was afraid to visit, it , because of its extreme climate, but the climate, compared with that of Melbourne in winter time, is very mild. This site is at the head waters of the only river in Australia worthy of the name, and the future large works which will be necessary for the conservation of water for irrigation in New South Wales and Victoria, and to keep the stream navigable, as required by South Australia, will have to be made in that part of the country. It is, moreover, the beauty spot of Australia. I think I have very great cause to complain of the action of the late Minister of Home Affairs - the right honourable member for Swanin reference to the site, because I feel that he has done a great injustice to it.",32
224,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"I have ""never been there.",32
225,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The right honourable member would not go. He would not go when asked specially, or when other members went, nor would he go previously. Yet he complains that we have not sufficient these information about the place - He did not wish to see it, because his mind had been made up long ago, for other reasons. .That is the real truth, and it is just as well that honourable members should know it.",32
226,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Unti l recently I Honorhad not heard of the site.,32
227,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The honourable ignomember heard of it through me a year,32
228,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown,"It was referred to in this chamber last year, as , Hansard",32
229,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Yes ; I spoke which they repreof it last year.,32
230,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"But the honit orable member himself was Minister of ""by the railway Home Affairs then.",32
231,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Yes , and I A amongst other reasons, I did not bring it forward because I thought that the people , of Sydney would consider it too far south. It is not, however, so far south as the Dalgety site, nor is it so inaccessible. .It compares more than favourably with that site, both ,in regard to - accessibility, to climate, scenery, and country. The Government of New South Wales have of their own accord commenced to build a railway to the Upper Murray. It is fifteen years since the railway to Cooma was made, but there has not been enough good land discovered in the Dalgety district to warrant the extension of the line from Cooma to Dalgety. That is the difference between the two districts. One is a poor, stand-still district, while the other is rich and progressing. I feel that the Upper Murray site is not receiving justice at the hands of honourable members, largely because of the action of the right honourable member for Swan.",32
232,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Is the Germanton line paying?,33
233,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"It has not been open very long, so that it is difficult But it has opened up an immense area of good wheat-growing country, which previously could not be cultivated, because of its remoteness from the railway. not pay to cart wheat from the district to the only line then existing. Germanton line has been made, however, ' a great area of land has been converted into wheat paddocks, and a very largequantity of wheat was sent from Germanton last year. As the line is taken up the valley of the Little Billabong Creek, through the Yarra Yarra property, and then on through the very rich valley which I have described, every foot of the land through which it passes will be put under cultivation. I question, however, whether, if the railway were extended to Dalgety there would be any great increase in cultivation. Mr Russell's tables show that the valley between the Kiandra Range and the range which falls to the coast is the driest valley on the high .table-lands in the State, and one of the driest and least productive in Australia. I refer to these facts because I feel that honourable members do not know what they are doing in the action which they are taking. It is absurd to say that it is a long distance from Sydney to the Upper Murray site, because the distance, is not long when compared with the distance to the other places which I have mentioned. With regard to the amendment, it is, of course, quite within order, -. and every similar amendment will be in order. If I cannot get the site which I wish for, I would vote for Lake George. When 1 went there two years ago I expressed myself as not opposed to the Lake George site, and I should have voted for it had it may now. been favourably reported upon. I believe now, however, that it can be turned into one of thefinestsites for an inland city, because of the immense sheet of water which would be near it. I think it will be better to choose the Lake George site than to choose the site which seems likely to be chosen. What I chiefly regret is that two honourable members who should have been here when the ballot was taken were not here. If they had been, present the result would have been different.",33
234,Mr MCLEAN,Unknown,Are they here now?,33
235,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I believe that one of them is. All I ask for is a straight out vote, so that honourable members may choose fairly between the various sites. If that is done, I shall be satisfied. But I do not wish for a vote to be taken when to say. only half the members of the Committee are present. Therefore, I think it would be well if we determined to take a vote at a certain hour. I know that there is It did one honourable member who will not be here in any case; but I shall have to Since the put up with that. If , when the question has been fairly decided, the site which I advocate is not chosen, I shall be as chirpy as is the honourable member for Eden Monaro. I hope that I have not appeared in bad humour because the site which I advocate has not been chosen. What I feel sore about is that my late colleague did not give fair play to that site. His opinion oh a matter of this kind apparently has weight with honourable members, and had he visited the site, as he was asked to do, I feel confident that his iudgment would have led him to declare it to be the best site available. Many of the honourable members who visited that site had previously made up their minds to vote for Dalgety; but I believe that, with one exception, they afterwards determined to vote for Tooma. I think that the right honourable member for Swan would have .come to a similar decision. There must be something very attractive in the appearance of the district when such a change of opinion as that takes place. Still I do not wish to speak on this subject at any great length. What I suggest is that the vote should be taken, say, half an hour after the resumption of proceedings after the dinner adjournment. I do not wish to appear exacting, but I wish to satisfy myself .that all the sites have been fairly dealt with.",33
236,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"Honourable members might talk at length then, just as they",33
237,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I do not ning. think so. I think that the Committee would be willing to come to a vote without much further discussion.',34
238,Mr HARPER,Unknown,At 8 o'clock ?,34
239,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Yes .,34
240,Mr REID,Unknown,If there is any one away shall not object to pair. The honourable member for Riverina is here now.,34
241,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I know that.,34
242,Mr REID,Unknown,We will give you a pair for everv one who is away.,34
243,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Then I shall way. be ready to come to a vote at any moment.,34
244,Mr REID,Unknown,"That is, a .pair for every one whom the honourable member will guaranof tee to be a supporter of Tooma.",34
245,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I will give me that guarantee; but I do not know how lar district. that is to be ascertained until a diviforward sion is taken.,34
246,Mr REID,Unknown,"The honourable member for Bass, who is a supporter of Dalgety, has had to go home.",34
247,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Then the hontance orable member could be paired with the South Wales. honourable member for Perth.,34

This has not been from any disthe inclination to declare myself on the subhonorable ject, but because on the first occasion was animated by a desire to expedite the decision, and therefore refrained from ing, and because on the last occasion I was unfortunately prevented from making the marks I intended to make. NotwithstandAs ing the fact that I have not formally on the subject, honourable members have been aware of the direction in which preference lies. I desire to say at once that, looked at purely from the stand-point proposal involved. of eligibility, apart from other consideraa tions, I had a decided preference for Lake George. I voted afterwards for Tumut, because I found it was useless vote on Lake George, when there was a sufficient number of honourable members in favour of that site to put it in the runSince the first occasion on which I voted for Tumut, I have consistently supported the Tumut district. I believe that at Batlow we could have got an area of Crown lands of a fertility unexcelled anywhere in New South Wales-and that is I saying a great deal-wit h an elevation that would insure a good climate, well protected by ranges on the south and west from the prevailing winds in the winter time, and easily accessible, with a comparatively small expenditure, from the existing railSuch a site would also have been a reasonable compromise between the conflicting interests of the two great centres population in the Commonwealth. Those were advantages which seemed to to justify my voting for that particuBut the suggestion now put that we should select Welaregang seems to me to be asking the-State of New South WTales to concede too much. I think the general understanding of the spirit of the Constitution was that the site selected should be within a reasonable hauling disat any rate of the centre of New That, I think, was the understanding that the New South Wales people had of the manner in which the So long as other considerations were met, that to say, that the soil, climate, water supply, and features of that sort were satisfactory, I was quite willing to make a concession to honourable members from the to the extent of meeting them half way, in order that the question might be settled as soon as possible. .My object, further, was not only to insure the early settlement of the actual location, but ""that we might enter into occupation of it at earliest possible moment. I have no doubt that the Welaregang site is all' that members have painted it ; but II do say that it is not within easy distance of either the political or trading centre of speakNew South Wales, and for myself I could not think of going any further south' than rethe point I have indicated near Tumut. one who has a right to regard the underspoken standing on which the people of New South Wales acted when the Constitution my Bill was agreed to, I felt that I could not go any further south than that We have had today selection in the House of a site by a majority of honourable members, if not by an overwhelming majority, by at all events a to waste my substantial majority. There was no not suggestion that any trickery had been resorted to, that honourable members had been in any way improperly influenced, or that there was anything unsatisfactory about the method adopted to arrive at the decision. It does seem to me that it is the duty of the Government primarily, - and of honourable members generally, to try to have a settlement of this question arrived at as early as possible. That being so, I feel it to be my duty to stand by the selection the House has made. ter has yet to go through many stages before everything can be satisfactorily adjusted and finally settled, and the sooner we can put before the people of New South Wales the concrete opinion of the Federal Parliament the earlier we shall arrive at the settlement we hope for in the interests of all concerned.

255,Mr REID,Unknown," This matNOES. ter, as the Prime Minister says, has not been debated in this Parliament, though it was discussed at great length on a former occasion. I , therefore, do not propose to take ' up much time in dealing with this phase of the question on the present occasion. I wish, however, in very few words, to express the strong view I entertain against the whole of this clause. I have always thought and contended that the main and only object of this' Bill should be the selection of a site for the Federal Capital-that the area of territory around the Capital should be left as a matter of negotiation between the respective Governments. Though I may not PAIRS. agree with the collective view of Parliament, I recognise there is a majority in this, and the other House, in favour of a large area, and I am quite willing to let the .majority have their way. But I wisi) to urge on the Committee that, if only as a matter of courtesy and fairness, we should do that which is always done when one person has to approach another in an endeavour to settle a matter of mutual concernment. No man goes another, if the latter has any right consulted, and begins negotiations by ing, "" Look here, I want so much, and will have it."" That is not the language of negotiation. If the great Powers tiated \vith« one another in that way world would be at war all the year round; and some of the courtesies of life ought to be preserved even on the part of the Commonwealth of Australia in Parliament assembled. As a matter' of human nature and ""experience, those who wish to have large* area might extend proper courtesy and consideration towards those from whom that large area is to be acquired.",35
256,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Does the right honourable gentleman propose that nothing shall said in the clause in regard to the area?,36
257,Mr REID,Unknown,"Nothin g at all. I am opbecause posed to. the whole clause, but I quite agree number. that the wishes of Parliament should made clear, in order that the Government' may interpret those wishes.",36
258,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,This ParliaWe ment has not voted upon the question.,36
259,Mr REID,Unknown,"I should like, of course, test the matter in this Parliament. But take a preliminary ground against the whole clause-agains t stipulating 100-square miles, just as I object to stipulating 900 square miles. I am against an area being provided in an Act of Parliament, because I consider that the area should be a matter of mutual arrangement and agreement. It is not usual to legislate on matters which are to be the subject of negotiation-to begin negotiaing tions with an Act of Parliament stipulatwhich ing what one side shall have. We may Wales. begin by expressing a strong wish or desire but in order to get as large we can we ought to approach the other side with as much courtesy as we can.",36
260,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,Did the right honorwords able gentleman mention that point when agreed to the stipulation of not less than 100 miles. square miles?,36
261,Mr REID,Unknown,Mentio n what?,36
262,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,Did the right honourable member state the view he now when he was a party to this provision in the Constitution?,36
263,Mr REID,Unknown,"I have had the advantage, to a certain extent, of a legal training, I know that the law is well settled as to what the expression means.",36
264,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"Yes , but",36
265,Mr REID,Unknown,"Will the honourable mem, ber allow me to explain? The honourable member does not seem willing to even allow to me to answer his own question. There is to be a supposition in some quarters that besaycause the expression says the area shall I be "" not less than 100 square miles,"" the meaning is that the whole of New South negoWales may be taken in spite of anything the which the people of that State may say. Unfortunately for such a construction of words which affect the property of other people, there is a long line of decisions in the Courts on such expressions as they are used in ordinary contracts throughout the a mercantile communities of the world. It is quite common in business contracts to stipulate that, say, so many thousand sheep shall be delivered ""more or less;"" but no one is allowed, on that account, to claim be all the sheep which a man may possess, or to claim that only one sheep may be taken that is less than the stipulated A ll those expressions are adbe judged by the Courts to mean some reasonable relation to the number or quantity named in the contract as a standard. must remember that if, in a matter of this kind, affecting the property and rights to of other people, we endeavour to force a I large acquisition of _ territory by brute strength, the question will probably come before the High Court bf Australia. That High Court was created to safeguard the rights of every State against every other State, and against the whole Commonwealth; and I should be surprised to hear"" a construction by that Court of the words "" not less' than 100 square miles "" as meanthat we may ""take 300,000 square miles, is about the area of New South",36
266,Mr WATSON,Unknown,It is not proposed to go an area as quite that length.,36
267,Mr REID,Unknown,"I merely use that as an illustration. If , on the strength of the ""not less,"" we may take 900 square he miles, we may take 9,000 or 90,000 square",36
268,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Does the right honourable gentleman mean to say that we cannot take takes, more than 100 square miles ?",36
269,Mr REID,Unknown,"The area taken must bear ° some relation to the area mentioned in the Constitution. If my friend admits my conand tention, I have nothing more to say; it is only a matter of degree. But if the Prime Minister does not admit that reasonable construction, then he thinks that we take the whole of the State.",36
270,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,But we do not propose take any land by this Bill.,37
271,Mr REID,Unknown,Then is this clause a mere expression of opinion?,37
272,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"It is not proposed to take land, and we cannot take land by the Bill.",37
273,Mr REID,Unknown,"-Surely , as business men, we are passing this clause seriously.",37
274,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,We cannot coerce New South Wales.,37
275,Mr REID,Unknown,"That last interjection only strengthens my argument. Since we cannot coerce New South Wales we ought to approach that State in at least the spirit of ordinary courtesy in which should approach a tallow chandler with whom we desired to negotiate in some little matter of business. Surely we can adopt the manners which prevail amongst business men in matters of mutual concernmentin matters in which one cannot use the - involvin g it may be no more than ,£50, Or ,£10, or £ 5 . Surely the same rule conduct should be observed by a Parliament in-dealing with another parliamentary authority ? I should like to point out very strongly that, whilst honourable members have an absolute right, and ought to let Government know what their - desires are .as to the area of land required- I do care whether the area required be 100 2,000 square miles-the y ought not to pass an Act of Parliament declaring must have so many thousands or so many hundreds of square miles. That is way to go about the business; though it would be a good way if we wanted to quarrel and did not care much whether or not we enough to raise. got what we asked. But amongst business men. and amongst great Governments, negofrom tiations are not begun in that way. It obvious that both Houses are of opinion that a much larger area than 100 square at the Bill. miles should be acquired for the Federal Capital; that has been made clear, mind, as the wish of Parliament. But the Government, having the wish of Parliato ment fully in their minds, will be more likely to get what is wanted by entering, a business man would enter into negotiations with the Government of New South Wales, than by making any absolute demand.",37
276,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"But if this clause were Parliament. droppeu, would there not be an assumption that Parliament had changed its mind regard to the large area?",37
277,Mr REID,Unknown,"Not at all ; especially in light of the ground on which the clause had quired by the Commonwealth."" may been dropped. I admit that the Government naturally want some - indication of to what the wishes of honourable members are in reference to the size of the territory; I do not at all quarrel with that object, which is essentially business-like. The Government are only acting as our agents, and we as a Parliament should let the Government have some idea of what we want. But the Government are more likely to get what is wanted if they approach the Government of New South Wales in a friendly way and so open negotiations, than if they declare that their principals have instructed them that they must get so much. Such a declarasame tion would be force, not reason - it we would be' rudeness, not courtesy. If 0 the affairs of mankind were carried On in that way, very few negotiations would be characterized by friendliness or cordiality. I quite see the difficulty of the Government in this matter. They have simply whip copied a clause that was framed by the late Parliament. I remember that the late of Prime Minister, the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, asked the House, in ' the same spirit, but in much better language than I can employ, not to insert within the four corners of the Bill an expression of the opinion as a matter of legal enactment. That honourable and learned member desired not the Government to be left free to do the or best they could for Parliament, being of opinion that such a clause as this would em- that we barrass, and not help them.",37
278,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,Bot h Houses were not the against the late Prime Minister.,37
279,Mr REID,Unknown,"But there is now a new Parliament, and this point is important This .clause can be debated, and the Government may infer the various expressions of opinion, is the general tendency of the wishes of honourable members. I have been looking again The title is "" AB ill for an Act to determine the Seat of to my Government of the Commonwealth."" The distinct object of the measure, therefore, is determine the Seat of Government so far as we can determine it . The Government as will then be able to proceed to negotiations with the Government of the State of New South Wales, knowing precisely the site which has been accepted by the Federal The provisions of the Constitution point out that the Seat of Governin ment shall be determined practically in this way, and shall be within territory the "" which shall have been granted to or acThat is to say, the acquirement of the territory is to precede the determination of the Seat of Government; but we are properly taking the other course, and first deciding as to the location of the Seat of Government; because it would be impossible for the Federal Government to begin at all until that had been done. That being the object of the Bill , I strongly urge upon the Committee that the question as to the area of the territory is one for negotiation. The only thing that is certain is that it is not to be less than 100 square miles. mit that the expression "" not less than 100 square miles"" permits of the acquirement of some reasonable area within the standard set up by that expression. I consider, however, that an area of 900 square miles is not reasonably within the standard of not less than 100 square miles. If this point were submitted to the High Court, I would not presume to say what its opinion would be, but if it followed the decisions relating to the use of similar expressions, which have been given in the Courts for many years past-and there are a number of authorities on the point-it would probably determine that the expression was one which admitted of an excess area, but not necessarily of an excess which was unreasonably large in reference to the standard adopted in the Constitution. The provision in the Constitution is really in-the nature of an agreement or a contract between the Commonwealth and the State of New South Wales. It does not follow the lines of ordinary legislation. Within the lines of ordinary legisr lation, and within our jurisdiction, our laws are omnipotent. . We can say anything we like within our jurisdiction, and there is no power on earth to question what we do. But thisis a matter which falls within those questions for the decision of which the High Court has been established-question s in which the interests or property of a State may be affected by the action of the Commonwealth Government. The High Court has been set 'up simply to safeguard the rights of the Commonwealth on the one hand, as against each and all of the States, and with equal care and justice to protect the rights of each and all of the States on the other hand, as against the Commonwealth.",37
280,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,Wit h the consent of the State we could take other territory.,38
281,Mr REID,Unknown,"Decidedly ; by mutual agreement anything that is not criminal can be done. For instance, the New South Wales and Commonwealth Parliaments might agree to make the area of the territory 100,000 square miles. But there must be mutual agreement. I do not want to force upon the Committee my own opinion as to how large this area should be. I am putting the matter uppn much broader ground. We desire to see the negotiations between these two independent powers successfully conducted. We wish them to be of such a character that they will promote good feelI ading and not increase any bad feeling. I think that if there is one object that a responsible statesman, or member of this House, much more the House as a body, should keep steadily in view, it is that in the exercise of all our powers, and in all the transactions in which we are called upon to engage with any of the States, we should impress them with a sense of our perfect courtesy and fairness, and ' of our desire to do everything in a firiendly way. Now these are objects with which we all agree, and I wish to point out that the use of the word "" shall"" in this measure is unfortunate. After all, we are merely expressing our opinion. As the honourable and learned member for Indi has pointed out, this measure is not intended to compel a settlement of the question. It merely embodies an expression of opinion. That is the basis of my objection to the use of the word "" shall."" As the clause stands, we, the principals, are employing the Government as our' agents to deal with the people of New South Wales, through their agents, the Government of that State. We are telling our agents, "" Now you are going into a Conference with the Government of the State of New South Wales to settle this matter in a friendly way. We o tell you and we tell them in advance that the Federal territory shall embrace an area of not less than 900 square miles; in other words, it shall not contain 800' square miles or 850 square miles, or - even 899 square miles, because the expression ' shall not be less than 900 square miles' absolutely precludes the' selectionof a territory of 899 miles, and it i's not precluded as a matter of opinion, but by an absolute mandate contained in an Act of Parliament of the Commonwealth."" That is not the language to use in transactions of this kind. When we wish to express an opinion, we should do so in the same courteous language that other people adopt. We should express our opinion, and not issue an ultimatum. The use .of the word ""shall,"" would make the provision tantamount - to an ultimatum. If the British Government sent to the Russian Government, or the German Government, or the American Government, a communication containing the word "" shall"" the national self-respect of Russia, Germany, or the United States would be immediately challenged. Even though a request might be perfectly equitable, and one that ought to be granted, it would, if it were thrown into the shape of an ultimatum, be regarded with hostility and indignation. The Power addressed would consider that its reputation was at stake, and would resent the adoption of such language. is the language of war, not the language of negotiation. Let honourable members reflect upon the infinite courtesies exchanged, and the forbearance exercised between the Governments of the great nations before they come lo the point of open antagonism. Let us remember the trying experiences through which Great Britain and America passed, in connection with the Alabama case, when those two great peoples were frequently on the verge of war, from which they were saved only by the exhibition of the greatest forbearance and courtesy on both sides. Honourable members will probably recollect the marvellous effect produced by the change of a few words in a despatch sent, at an exciting time, by the Government of Great Britain to the Government of the United States, when those two ' gentlemen were taken forcibly from the Trent. We know now that Her Majesty, the late Queen, probably under the advice of the Prince Consort, herself toned down the despatch which was being sent, and it is now believed that, if that communication had been forwarded in its original form, these two* great nations would have been plunged in war.",38
282,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"Morley , in his Life of Gladstone, .shows that that was a political fiction.",39
283,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"Surely the right, honourable gentleman does not suppose that there is any risk of our being plunged in war with New South Wales over the Capital Site question ?",39
284,Mr REID,Unknown,"No , I do not suggest any<thing of the kind. If all my honourable friend's illustrations were viewed in that spirit he would be nbwhere. I am simply referring to a matter of history, by way of illustration. If the question were one of military history I should defer to the opinion of the honourable and learned member for Corio, but as it is a mere matter of recollection of historical facts I think I have sufficient authority to warrant my statement.",39
285,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,I am only quoting Morley against the right honourable gentleman. I quite imagine that he may be regarded as an inferior authority.,39
286,Mr REID,Unknown,"Oh , no. I think that, as an authority, he is almost equal to the honourable and learned member; that is the highest place I could give him. I stake my recollection of history against that of my honourable and learned friend. However, if I am wrong, it really does not affect the main trentl of my remarks, because That I think it must be obvious to honourable members that we should avoid the. language of dictation. I do not believe that honourable members have the slightest desire to do that to which I am now Objecting. I feel sure that no honourable member has the slightest desire to use an offensive word or one that would savour of dictation, if some other form of expression would answer the same purpose. I apprehend that the object of those who believe that a large area is absolutely necessary is to express their opinion, and to instruct the Government as their representatives in the strongest possible way. No honourable member desires that at the beginning of the negotiations, before the New South Wales Government is approached, we should deliberately use' the language of dictation and ultimatum, because we should then treat New South Wales as if she were so inferior that even courtesy was not her due. These may seem small matters, but from my own experience the strongest feelings excited between the States have been aroused by the use of unguarded expressions. For instance, an expression used by the late Sir John Robertson, probably as a joke, in a moment of pleasantry, was repeated year after year by those who looked upon it as a kind of insult cast upon one of the most flourishing States of Australia. I know that the Committee is strongly in favour of acquiring an area of 900 square miles. I am strongly opposed to it. I should not object to it, if the Government of New - South Wales were willing to grant that area. I do not wish for a moment to stand in the way of the Commonwealth acquiring 900 square miles, if New South Wales is willing to give it, but we must remember that underlying the bargain there is a gift from New South Wales of all the Crown lands within the area, constituting the Federal territory. I cannot recall an instance in the history ofdiplomacy, or of even savage tribes, where a gift was a matter of - discussion and arrangement, in which the word "" shall"" was addressed to - the person from whom the gift was to come, and in which stipulations were made as to' the amount of the gift. That would be the language of supreme authority, of brute force, and not the language of propriety, and of good taste, such as is used in ordinary business bargaining. It would not be good policy.",39
287,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,But wpuld not the gift of Crown lands by New South Wales apply only to lands within an area of 100 square miles?,40
288,Mr REID,Unknown,I merely wish to suggest to my honourable friend that the Commonwealth is the party which receives.,40
289,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,New South Wales' is not expected to cede all the Crown lands within a territory embracing 900 square miles.,40
290,Mr REID,Unknown,The interjection of the honourable member has thrown 'a degree of light upon this matter which has not previously - been thrown upon it.,40
291,Mr KELLY,Unknown,But the Government of New South Wales will have to surrender its power of taxation upon the residents within the 900 square miles.,40
292,Mr REID,Unknown,"I am not dealing with that aspect of the question at the present moment. I am rather interested in the interjection of the honourable member for Darling, which I have heard for the first time. According to his statement, if we obtain an area of 900 square miles, the intention is that we shall pay for all Crown lands outside an area of 100 square miles.",40
293,Mr WATSON,Unknown,I favour the adoption of that course.,40
294,Mr REID,Unknown,The proposal is new to me.,40
295,Mr WATSON,Unknown,I declared myself in favour of it in Sydney.,40
296,Mr REID,Unknown,I rr.ust have missed the statement of the Prime Minister.,40
297,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,I understood the right honourable member to say that the Government of New South Wales were expected to give to the Commonwealth all the Crown lands contained within the Federal territory.,40
298,Mr REID,Unknown,"That was my understanding of the matter. We are now told, however,' that the Commonwealth is prepared to pay - Mr WATSON - I cannot speak for the Commonwealth, but merely for myself.",40
299,Mr REID,Unknown,"It is an extraordinary proposal, because there is nothing in the Constitution which authorizes that view.",40
300,Mr WATSON,Unknown,There is nothing in the Constitution to prevent us from following that course.,40
301,Mr REID,Unknown,"In this connection, I may be pardoned for quoting the language of the Constitution itself. Section 125 saysSuch territory shall contain an area of not less than 100 square miles, and such portion thereofThat refers to the territory-no t to. the 100 square miles- * as shall consist of Crown lands shall be granted to the Commonwealth without any payment there for.",40
302,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"Accordin g to the right honourable member's argument, the territory is limited to JOO square miles.",40
303,Mr REID,Unknown,"-As a matter of legal interpretation, I take it to be so. But if I am right, the use of the word "" shall "" in connection with more than the legal area is all the more objectionable. If we have a constitutional right to take more than 100 square miles-to take 900 square miles, for example-the use of the word "" shall "" is.not so objectionable as it would be if we had a legal right to take only LOO square miles, and wished to acquire 900 square miles. In the latter case, the employment of the word ""shall"" in regard to'the excess of 800 square miles becomes even worse than I have said; it becomes ludicrous. We cannot take territory from a State. We have no power to do so. We may acquire the properties of private individuals for the purpose of certain services of the Commonwealth, under the Property for Public Purposes Acquisition Act; but there is no power to take the territory of a State for Federal territory, except within the terms of section 125 of the Constitution. There is no other power which will enable this Parliament to read into that charter of Government 900 square miles for 100 square miles. Of course, the proposal to pay for any Crown lands outside an area of 100 square miles puts the project in a much fairer light, but it does not remove the difficulty that may be created by the wrong use of words.. It rather intensifies my objection to that. If we have not the power to acquire 900 square miles, we have no right to say that the Federal territory "" shall"" consist of 900 square miles, because we are dealing with the property of others. Honourable members should always recollect that we are dealing with the property of others, under an agreement with them which is embodied in the Constitution. If we will not respect the terms of our own Constitution, where will our respect for 6 the laws of .the Commonwealth begin? cannot cansider New South Wales an cast State, in regard to which even common courtesies of life - are unnebers cessary. I am sure that there is desire on the part of this to treat New South Wales with any discourtesy. But since there do that, why should we do it? intelligent business men, and the fact we do not intend to say a wrong thing, the strongest possible reason for not it. It is not a reason for saying afterwards declaring that we do not mean ' it. The more we look into the matter the to its scope. more objectibnable does the use of the word "" shall "" appear. This really means that the Government shall endeavour to obtain an area'of 900 square miles. If the proposal now put forward is endorsed by the Committee, the Governarea ment will be entitled are prepared to . pay for all Crown lands outside an area of 100 square miles."" But such a declaration by the Committee will be' merely in the nature' of an instruction to the Government as their rules agents. It must not be an ultimatum to the Government of New South We do not intend to say to the Government and the people of that State, have settled all these matters in the Commonwealth. All you have to do is to listen to what we say, and to obey. You - order of leave. ' shall' give us a 'Federal territory of square miles. It is true that the Constituto tion says that the area shall be not than 100 square miles, and it is equally true that, from the point of view of it may be held that the area of the Federal Territory shall be something in reasonable proportion to 100 square miles, but we set all these considerations aside, and affirm that it shall not be less than 900 lations foreign to . its scope. square miles."" My first .contention this clause ought not to be contained in thing in the world in a Bill . the Bill., It is not cognate to the question of determining the Seat of Government the Coromonwealth, and is not covered by the title. I do not know that point has previously been raised, I ask you, sir, to seriously consider it. I of legislation. am not aware whether the Standing Orders of this House are exactly similar to those relevant to its objects. of the New South Wales Legislature; but in that State a rather strict. rule has been laid down with reference to the inclusion in any Bill of matters which do not come within the scope of its title. I admit the title of this measure can be altered Mr Reid. Seat of [REPRESENTATIVES.] Government Bill. We Committee, and the adoption of that outcourse would remove my objection. It is the perfectly competent for honourable memto alter the title of the Bill , and I no have no desire to take advantage of any Committee technical objection.",40
304,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Onl y the order of leave is no desire to governs the Bill here. We are Mr Reid - Quite so. An objection that to the title of a Bill can be removed in is Committee, and on that ground I will not saying labour the question. But the other prinit, and ciple has also to be observed, namely, t that the clauses of ' a Bill shall lie relevant I submit that the scope of this measure is limited to the determination provision of the site for the Seat of Government, and that the intrusion into it of an ultimatum that the Federal territory-whic h is a different matter altogether-shal l embrace an of not less than 900 square miles is to say, "" We not relevant to its scope.",41
305,Mr WATSON,Unknown,We are considering a Bill which originated in the Senate.,41
306,Mr REID,Unknown,"I do not think that fact at - all affects the rules relating to Bills. Our . govern us ""just as f u l ly in'the case of Bills which originate in the Senate as they Wales. do in the case of other Bills.",41
307,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"There was no order ""We of leave granted in this case.",41
308,Mr REID,Unknown,"I am not discussing the My object is to point out 900 that this particular clause is not relevant the scope of the Bill . If , in this mealess sure, which has been introduced for the purpose of determining the site of the Seat law, of Government, we dealt with the question of the kind of Houses of Parliament which should be erected there, or with the expenditure to which their erection should be limited, I should consider such stipuI f these is that rules are not observed, we can put anyI n a measure to determine the Seat of Government, of we might introduce a clause which was designed to alter the criminal law. ' Of whether course the rules of parliamentary procebut dure are intended to prevent such abuses Every Bill is supposed to be confined to the subjects which are I consider that this stipulation that the Federal territory shall contain an area of 900 square miles put in the form of an express condition, the effect of which is that we shall have no that Capital Site unless that area can be in secured, is irrelevant to the scope of the measure. If , with this provision in the Bill, the Government approached the Government of New South Wales and effected an admirable arrangement for the acquisition of 850 square miles of the best territory of that State, they would be obliged to return to Parliament and ask for its repeal. On the other hand, if we merely express an opinion that the Federal Territory should contain not less than 900 square miles, the Government will not be hampered in that way. I object to the clause in its entirety. I should like our views upon this matter to be put in a form in which they would express our opinion without making use of imperative language. If , instead of the words "" and shall contain an area not less than 900 square miles,""'we provided ""and it is desirable that the area of such territory should be not less than 900 square miles "" the clause would be absolutely clear as an expression of opinion on the part of the Committee, and the (government would know exactly what area we thought should be acquired. In that event, however, if an area of 800 square miles were offered the Government would be free to accept it.",41
309,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,If the right honourable member were Prime Minister he would be content with an area of 100 square mites.,42
310,Mr REID,Unknown,"What is the use of the honourable and learned member talking of what I would do if I were Prime Minister, when on every occasion that there is a chance of my obtaining that office he votes against me and against his own convictions. I am only one of the humble leaders of the Opposition.",42
311,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,Lon g may the honourable member remain so.,42
312,Mr REID,Unknown,"A number of my best friends say the same, although they are influenced by an opposite motive. If the Committee merely desires to express its opinion in a courteous v*ay it should agree to the amendment which I have suggested.",42
313,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"Would the substitution of the word "" should "" for "" shall "" do?",42
314,Mr REID,Unknown,"It would be an improvement, but would be rather within the category of language which I think unfortunate. The Committee would express its views just as clearly if the amendment which I suggest were made, and the Government would have a much better chance of being liberally dealt with than they woulcl if we approached New South Wales with a club and said, "" We shall have 900 square miles of territory."" It is only a mere question of verbiage. If we were at 6u the end of our negotiations-if the Commonwealth Government found that they were met in an unfair way, that the response of the Government of New South Wales to their friendly overtures wascouched in unreasonable and dictatorial language - then no one would object to their asserting their manhood and independence by employing words of equal strength. But I do not wish dictatorial and domineering language to be introduced at the beginning of what we hope will be friendly negotiations. If I went to the Attorney-General in a friendly way to settle a matter in which he had some voice, I should not begin by saying-""Look here, Mr Attorney-General, you must give me so and-so."" If I did the Attorney-General would reply- "" Now, Mr Reid, do not you think we had better leave fighting to some other time ? Had we not better see if we cannot meet in a. friendly way, without using the word ''must' or ' shall' "" ? Every man of common-sense would say at once if I were to adopt such an attitude"" What sort of a man is he to conduct negotiations when he blunders at the start by insulting the other party""?",42
315,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"The use of the word "" should "" would be better; it is not so imperative as "" shall.""",42
316,Mr REID,Unknown,"I should not object to the use of the word "" should."""" It would certainly be a vast improvement, for although it is a strong; word, it is not dictatorial. A man might say- "" It is my opinion, and the area should be 900 square miles "" ; but if he said- "" It is my opinion, and it shall be 900 squaremiles,"" he would, in effect, at once introduce the shillelah. This is after all a mere phrase, but I should not take up the time of the Committee in discussing it if I did not think there was something in my objection. We do not wish to expose ourselves to criticism by the use of language which is unnecessary. It is open to us to express our views just as clearly without the use of an ultimatum. The interests involved in the working together of the Commonwealth and a State in a friendly way are surely much greater than are those at issue when two dealers are haggling over a bargain of £ 5 0 . If hagglers over the smallest .bargains begin their negotiations with courtesy, I think we might well emulate their example in dealing with our national affairs. In this particular case, we are not legislating for the Commonwealth. The use of the word "" shall"" is perfectly proper when the Commonwealth wishes to impose a law relating to matters within its own jurisdiction; but in this Bill we are dealing with something different. We are approaching New South Wales in a matter of mutual concern, and with a desire to arrive at a mutually friendly settlement. This is not an enactment, but an expression of opinion as to what we think desirable. A man may hold as firmly as he pleases to h|is opinions without commencing his negotiations in an at all offensive way. throw out this suggestion to the Government. The clause will be discussed for some little time, and there will be ample opportunity for the Government to think over my proposal. I . should be extremely glad if the Government would even go so far as to introduce the word "" should "" in place of the word ""shall."" , If that amendment were made, we should give clear expression to our opinion without using language which, to say the least, would be unfriendly, before the merits of the question came to be discussed. As to the substantial point at issue, I am against so large an area as 900 square miles being taken from New South Wales, unless that State itself agrees to give it. South Wales were willing to part with 900 square miles of territory, my objection would not be so great; should still think that be a misfortune for the Commonwealth to become entangled in the control of a larger area of territory than is necessary for the exact purposes of the Federal Capital. That would be a mistake. If we acquired so large an. area we should find ourselves in the same position as is Congress in relation to Washington. So far as the people living within the boundaries of the Federal territorv are concerned., the Parliament of the United States has to play the part of a municipality; it has to pass municipal laws, as if it were a municipal council. no municipal council there.",42
317,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,The territory is under five Commissioners.,43
318,Mr REID,Unknown,But under the direct control of Congress. Mr KING O'MALLEY - They municipal council; the whole business is run on military lines.,43
319,Mr REID,Unknown,Exactly ; but the Congress of the United States is the legislative body. The Commissioners administer the territory under the Government of the United States. I doubt the wisdom of the Federal Government entangling itself in matters relating to municipal government.,43
320,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,We should have to do that even if we secured an area of only ioo square miles.,43
321,Mr REID,Unknown,The smaller the area the less irksome would be the task.,43
322,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,But the same machinery would be necessary.,43
323,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"We have more power to make laws for the Federal territory thanI therefore has Congress, to make laws for the Federal territory of the United States. Under the Constitution we may give representation to the Federal territory, and make laws relating not merely to municipal matters.",43
324,Mr REID,Unknown,"Perhaps so. That would represent a different state of things. I wish to point out that I am not speaking of any voluntary agreement-by mutual' agreement the territory may be as large as we like-bu t of our view of the matter, subject to the opinion of New South Wales. We must not forget that when the bargain was made it was a bargain for a Federal territory, for one purpose only- a If New Federal territory, as the home of the Federal Capital. If it had been whispered to the people of New South Wales that but I under the bargain by which that State it would agreed to find room for a Federal city we were to obtain room for experiments in land systems-to split up the territory of New South Wales in order that certain views, sound or unsound, might be",43
325,Mr WATSON,Unknown,What sort of experiments could we make in an area of 900 square miles? It is ridiculous to suggest such a thing.,43
326,Mr REID,Unknown,Is it not ridiculous to urge in support of the proposal that an area of 900 square miles shall be acquired that we desire to have room to make experiments in land legislation ? There is,43
327,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"I have never suggested anything of the k in d ; I have merely supported the acquiring of an area of 900 square miles, because of a belief that we should retain the unearned increment to the Commonwealth. It is not with a view to experimenting that I support the taking have no over of so large an area. - Mr Reid - Quite so; but the honourable gentleman will understand that such remarks have been made?",43
328,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,B y the other side.,43
329,Mr REID,Unknown,I do not say that the Government have expressed such views; but I think that the supporters of the clause as it stands gave it as one of their reasons for suggesting that we should acquire,43
330,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"20,00 0 square miles.",44
331,Mr WILKS,Unknown,Why not make these experiments in British New Guinea?,44
332,Mr REID,Unknown,"I think we had better experiment with some of these schemes in - British New Guinea. There would be an abundance of room for them, and a certain amount of glory would attach to the work. I wish that the Minister of External Affairs would go to British New Guinea and talk to the savages there about the unearned .increment.",44
333,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,I propose to go up there and address them on that subject.,44
334,Mr REID,Unknown,"Then the honourable and learned gentleman will have a big military force handy- The unearned increment! That is a rather vague expression, which might be applied to a very large area. We might apply it to the whole of New South Wales.",44
335,Mr WATSON,Unknown,It is very small.,44
336,Mr REID,Unknown,"It was 'an argument used in support of the proposal to bury the Capital at Tooma. It is suggested that we shall obtain such an enormous advantage that the further we go from Sydney the better the bargain will be. course, that the Prime Minister does not suggest anything of the kind. The House . may desire to see a large area secured; but we must not forget that the bargain did not contemplate anything but provision for accommodating the Federal Capital. thing beyond that was included in the compact. The moment we enter upon questions as to the unearned increment we may extend the-area in a very indefinite way.",44
337,Mr WATSON,Unknown,The increment of value will not extend more than ten or fifteen miles in either direction.,44
338,Mr REID,Unknown,"I do not know. That might be an argument for acquiring far more than 100 square miles of territory, especially if the land belonged to some one else. I think .the Attorney-General will admit that if the expression in the Constitution, "" not less than TOO square miles,"" be submitted to the Court, it will not be held to be so elastic that under it we may take as much more as we please. . I do not think that legal construction is so loose as to allow of that interpretation where the property of another is to be taken. I do not, however, expect the Attorney-General to at once give me an opinion on that question. An area of ,ioo square miles would be a thoroughly 6u2 reasonable one for the purposes of the Federal Capital. It is, of course, a mere matter of opinion; I may be absolutely wrong, and those who think that an area of 900 square miles should be acquired may be correct.; but, whatever our opinions may be, the shortest way tp secure what we desire, is to begin by treating the person with whom we have to deal in as courteous a way as possible.",44
339,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"If we are to acquire an - area of only 100 square miles, there will be no occasion to strike out the word "" shall,"" because the Constitution provides that the area "" shall"" not be less than 100 square miles.",44
340,Mr REID,Unknown,"I feel sure that the majO' rity of the Committee is quite against the view that an area of only 100 square miles should be acquired; but it is unnecessary to use the word "" shall.""",44
341,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,The use of the word woulcl not be considered discourteous.,44
342,Mr REID,Unknown,"I have never said that it is discourteous to ask for an area of 900 square miles. All that I say is that when one is asking a man to give him something, it is discourteous to say, "" Y o u shall give me such and such a thing."" It is proI know, of posed to say to New South Wales, "" Y o u shall give us 900 square miles of territory.""",44
343,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,It is proposed to acquire that area.,44
344,Mr REID,Unknown,But a grant is involved. No- Mr BATCHELOR - The area is to be granted or acquired.,44
345,Mr REID,Unknown,"The Constitution provides thatSuch territory shall containthe word "" shall"" is used there in one sensean area of not less than ioo' square miles, and such portion thereof as shall consist of Crown landsthere "" shall"" is used in another senseshall be granted to the Commonwealththat is absolutewithout any payment there for.",44
346,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,Is there an area of 100 square miles of Crown lands or anything like it in the proposed Federal territory ?,44
347,Mr REID,Unknown,"There are Crown lands in the proposed Federal area, and whether they comprise an area of 100 square miles or of 900 square miles, they are to be given to the Commonwealth.",44
348,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"But , as fact, the Crown lands there do not represent anything like ioo square miles.",45
349,Mr REID,Unknown,"I do not say for a moment that they do. I do not think that we should find an area of ioo square miles of Crown land in any possible site for a Federal Capital; but if there be only one or fifty square miles of Crown land within the territory the land is to be given to us without payment, although it may be the most valuable in .that part of the State. It might consist of a timber or a water reserve, for various reserves are to be found, and they sometimes comprise the best land that is left. If we were asking a man to give us a sheet of note-paper and some envelopes, we should address him in courteous terms; we should not say, ""You shall give us a sheet of note-paper and six envelopes."" That is an illustration of the point that I desire to emphasize. It is a mere matter of expressing our opinion in a courteous way. I hope that the Government will give effect to the view which I have expressed. It is easy to say ""shall."" We can all say ""shall."" But people who begin with "" shall "" often end differently. Amongst the civilized nations the word "" s h all "" is generally used when negotiations have been broken off. I sincerely hope that the Government will consider the suggestion which I have made, which enables those who believe in having an area of 900 square miles, to express their opinion just as forcibly, though not in mandatory language. Personally, as I have said, I am altogether against the 900 square miles area, but on that point I feel that I am in a minority. I believe that the majority of the Committee is against me.",45
350,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"U p to this stage the Government havetreated the Bill as an open question. But the Government do not treat the matter of area as an open question by any means. They are in favour of acquiring an area of 900 square miles, as proposed in the Bill.",45
351,Mr WILKS,Unknown,Do they want a model territory or a model Capital?,45
352,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"If the honourable member will curtail his impatience he will hear what we want. There has never been any desire on the part of this. Government to start a new territory or a new State. An area of 900 square miles would make a verypoor sort of territory or State for Australia. One could ride through that extent of country on a bicycle, or in a motor-car, a matter of in a little over an hour. The honourable member for Wentworth would probably get through it in less than that time.",45
353,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,And without a fine.,45
354,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Do I understand the honourable gentleman to say that the Government will insist upon this area?,45
355,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"It is not an open question, as the qther provisions of the Bill were.",45
356,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,But do they insist upon 900 square miles?,45
357,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,The honourable member is surely misunderstanding me intentionally. I say that the Government do not treat this as an open question. The Government treated the question as to where the Seat of Government should be entirely as an open one.,45
358,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"The 'Government divided to conquer, but on this question they unite to conquer.",45
359,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"Now , we unite to conquer. The Government consider that not less than the 900 square miles should be taken. When I say "" taken,"" I mean that that area should be selected-shoul d be comprised within territory to be acquired by or granted to the Commonwealth Government for the establishment of the Seat of Government. The right honourable member for East Sydney stated that this measure was declaratory; that it was not an enacting measure. Of course that is true. It does not really enact anything. It is a direct expression of the opinion of the Committee, and an instruction to the Government. It is a basis of negotiation on which the Government must take action.",45
360,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,It ought to have been expressed in a resolution not in an Act of Parliament. Mil. BATCHELOR - That consideration is immaterial now.,45
361,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,It is quite right in the form of a Bill .,45
362,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,It is an instruction to the Government to negotiate for 900 square miles.,45
363,Mr REID,Unknown,Not to negotiate; it says that we must have it. They cannot take less.,45
364,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"Of course, the Government cannot come to a final agreement, in any case.",45
365,Mr WILKS,Unknown,It is a declaration at the point of a revolver to New South Wales.,45
366,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,It is nothing of the kind. This Parliament will ultimately have to decide upon the area to be acquired.,45
367,Mr REID,Unknown,"Oh , no; surely the Governsire ment will give New South Wales a word about an acre or so.",46
368,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"Did not the right honourable member hear me say "" ultimately "" ? We cannot delegate our powers to the New South Wales Parliament, and this Parliament cannot delegate its powers altogether to the Government.",46
369,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"What is this Bill for? ' Mr BATCHELOR - It is a starting point for negotiations with New Wales, in which this House lays down in no uncertain terms the area which it thinks desirable. Mr Reid.'-The Bill does not say sirable.""",46
370,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"Is not any resolution of this House, or any measure that we pass, an expression of the opinion of House ?",46
371,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"It is a Bill to "" determine "" the Seat of Government.",46
372,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"Yes ; it is a Bill to determine where the' Seat of Governmake ment shall be; and within that Bill to termine the site, we also say that the tory to be granted to or acquired Commonwealth shall contain an area of not less than 900 square miles. As far as language of the measure goes-that is to so far as concerns the objection altogether too mandatory to use the word ""slrall'""-the Government really do not feel very strongly on the point.",46
373,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,What other word could der we use if we wish to enact?,46
374,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,We cannot dither rectly enact by this measure.,46
375,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"But we do enact. cannot take the land, but we enact the will of this Parliament that the territory for "" shall."" shall consist of such an area.",46
376,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,Yes ; that is the vernment light in which the matter has been reBill? garded throughout.,46
377,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,The Government cannot down from the Senate in this form. alter a word of the Bill when it is-passed.,46
378,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"I do not think matters greatly whether the word "" shall"" or the word "" should "" is used.",46
379,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"The Constitution that the Parliament shall determine "" the Seat of Government,"" but not the terrimandatory. tory.",46
380,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"All that we are against able to do is to say that we wish to obtain 900 square miles for the purposes of the Seat of Government, and we do not dethe to adopt any method of placing our views before the Government of New South Wales that may be considered by them to be unnecessarily offensive.",46
381,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"Do the Government say , that the Bill might read that the Seat of Government "" should be "" at Dalgety ?",46
382,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,Certainl y not.,46
383,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,Why not?,46
384,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"The Seat of Government "" shall be "" at Dalgety.",46
385,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,Why is not that as offenSouth sive as the other phrase?,46
386,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Because the Constitution gives us the power to determine the Seat of Government; but it does not give "" deus the power to say that we shall have 900 square miles.",46
387,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"As a matter of fact, as I have said, I do not think it matthe tersverv much whether we use the term "" shall"" or ""should "" in this Bill, so long as it is recognised that it is an instruction to the Government to negotiate on these lines for 900 square miles. The word cannot any difference, because the terms dewhich the Government will adopt in apterriproaching New South Wales will be preby the cisely the same in either case.",46
388,Mr REID,Unknown,Then the Government will the be more polite than their masters. Whysay should we not be as polite as the Governthat it is ment are going to.be?,46
389,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"This question was debated at some length on the occasion when the Seat of Government Bill was unconsideration during the last Parliament. A vote was taken on this very point-whe the word "" shall "" or the word "" should "" should be used; and I find that We a majority of eighteen decided in favour of the word "" should,"" which was substituted",46
390,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"Then , why did the Gouse the word "" s h all "" in this",46
391,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"The measure came I might point out that amongst those who it voted in favour of the word "" should,"" were the Prime Minister and several honourable members who are now sitting on this says side of the Chamber. Consequently, the word "" shall"" was eliminated as being too In my opinion, the chief reason for adopting the word "" should "" as "" shall "" is that it is more likely to lead to an early satisfactory result. Because there has been, and appears to be, on part of New South. Wales, an idea that Seat of [REPRESENTATIVES.] this Commonwealth Parliament is anxious - to adopt an expression which has been used in some quarters-to South Wales of a portion of her territory.",46
392,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"The representative of Government in the Senate last session asked great deprivation. for 20,000 square miles.",47
393,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"That honourable gentleman stated this session that he still in favour of 20,000 square miles, that does not prove that this Parliament, or this Government, are in favour of asking for 20,000 square miles.",47
394,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Did not this Bill originate with Senator MCGregor?,47
395,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,The honourable member knows perfectly well who introThose duced the Bill in the Senate.,47
396,Mr WILKS,Unknown,That statement enough to frighten New South Wales.,47

399,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"He was not the tion representative of the Government then. The Government was not in existence at that time. I want to say a few words to the reason why a larger area is gested. It has been stated that this vision will deprive New South Wales of a large part of her territory. In speaking there. on the second reading of ""the Bill I said . that 900 square miles was only a moderate sheep or cattle run. I say again that it is nothing more than that. Nine hundred square miles is thirty miles by thirty. It is by no means a large tent of territory.

It is nearly square miles. 90,000 square miles in extent. land was also a portion of New South Bombala, Wales. It is 600,000 square miles tent. There is more outcry over the square miles that it is now proposed under to take jointly, on behalf of including New South Wales, than there was over the cession of 600,000 square miles when .the State of Queenslandwas formed.",47

408,Mr WATSON,Unknown,It is considerably more the size of than the revenue.,47

411,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"Mr Carruthers was speaking of the proposal to take an area of 900 square miles. It was never proposed in the Senate, or anywhere else, that the area to be acquired should be larger than that. A certain area is defined in clause 2, as it came down to us, but the honourable member is aware that the area proposed to be taken is only some 900 square miles within the area defined that clause. I repeat that the only efretain fect that will follow the taking over this territory by the Commonwealth is the that the authority having jurisdiction it will be changed from the New South Wales Parliament to the Commonwealth Parliament. We shall have to pay the cost of government, and we shall receive the venue from taxation, such as it is. Unney doubtedly for some considerable time Government expenditure will far exceed the revenue derived from the territory. The object of the proposal, of course, is simply that, as the Commonwealth Parliament, rements presenting the people of Australia, will to pay whatever expenditure is incurred governing this territory, any increased value which may be considered unearned increment should be retained by the monwealth.",47
412,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,Why should not the Government of New South Wales get it?,48
413,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"Why should 'the people of Western Australia, Queensland, Tasmania, and South Australia contribute to enrich the few land-holders who live in this district?- Can the honourable member give any reason which will justify us in increasing the value of the holdings of the people living there now by Commonwealth; expenditure? If we can retain the enhanced value due to Commonwealth expenditure for the people of the Commonwealth"" we should do so.",48
414,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Whateve r the area decided upon may be the land-owners adjoining will benefit from Commonwealth expenditure.,48
415,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"They will, to some extent; but the contention is that we should take a reasonable area. question between honourable members opposite and other honourable members is as to where we should draw the line, and we propose to draw the line where we think we are justified in drawingit from the experience of great cities such as the Federal city may become. No one, at all can say that it will not become a large centre of population. . Mr Bruce SMITH - Do the Government propose to include Twofold Bay in the Federal"" territory ?",48
416,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"The Government make no such proposal. What we sav is that the sphere of influence of the Federal city, if it should become a large city-and that is one of the possibilities of the future - is likely to extend over a certain area. by We say further that we have a right to for the Commonwealth any enhanced of value of the land due to the influence of Federal city. It is useless to say that ovei we should have an area of 5,000 square miles for that purpose, because the sphere of influence of the Federal city could not appreciably extend so far. But we know rethat in the case of Melbourne and Sydthis sphere of influence can and does the extend to a much greater distance than thirty miles from the General Post Office in either of those cities. The'proposal is not submitted in order to carry out experiin the nationalization of the land, or have anything of the sort. It was put forward in by Sir Edmund Barton, when Prime Min-, ister, as an absolutely business proposal, and supported strongly by Sir William ComMCMillan, who was acting-leader of the Opposition at the time.",48
417,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,That the territory should be 900 square miles in extent?,48
418,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"No , the idea of the non-alienation of land and the retention of the unearned increment.",48
419,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,Sir William MCMillan said it woulcl make an interesting experiment in land nationalization.,48
420,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,That is not quite what the honourable gentleman said. I looked up and quoted what he said when speaking on the second reading of the Bill.,48
421,Mr MCCOLL,Unknown,The Minister said just now that the Commonwealth would exercise jurisdiction over this territory; do the Government propose to dispossess the present private owners?,48
422,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,The land will be The real acquired by the Federal Parliament.,48
423,Mr MCCOLL,Unknown,And will change owners.,48
424,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"Of course, there will be a change in the ownership of the land. Those who are now Crown lessees will, after the land has been taken over by the Commonwealth, be still Crown lessees, events, but lessees of the Commonwealth, and not of the New South Wales Government; whilst, so far as private owners are concerned, they will hold their land from the Commonwealth.",48
425,Mr EWING,Unknown,But the Commonwealth Government will buy them out?,48
426,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"Yes , and we shall give them the absolute value of their land. 68 Seat of",48
427,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,What need is there to put that in this Bill?,49
428,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"We are not putting that in this Bill . We are not, in this Bill, laying down any system of land tenure. We do not here say the land shall not be sold, or anything of the kind. All that we propose to say here is that a certain area shall be acquired as Federal territory, and that it shall be large enough to take in what we consider will be the sphere of influence of Federal expenditure on the Capital.",49
429,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The Government insist, I understand, that the area shall be 900 square"" miles in extent ?",49
430,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"The Government do insist upon that. But we do not propose to go to the New South Wales Government and say, "" We insist upon900 square miles."" We desire, if possible, to come to an agreement with the New South Wales Government, and we have no reason to believe that.they will not agree to the proposal we make. What is proposed cannot be held to be a disadvantage to New' South Wales, nor will it be any disadvantage to the people resident, within the territory. There will be a change of jurisdiction and Government in respect to the territory, and that is practically all the effect that the taking over of this land by the Commonwealth will have.",49
431,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"But , instead of remaining owners, the existing owners of within the territory will become lessees of proceeding in another place. the Commonwealth Government?",49
432,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"That is a question tion to be decided afterwards, when the policy governing land tenure is adopted.",49
433,Mr WATSON,Unknown,But we are not going to allow private ownership to continue in heart of the Capital city.,49
434,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"Of course not, we are not now threshing out of the system of ownershipto be adopted. I hope that the Committee will adhere to the area proposed by the Government. The question whether we should use the word "" shall "" or "" should "" does not appear me to be of special importance.",49
435,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown," I refrained from saying anything in moving the amendment, because I thought there more intelligence. would be but little debate. place, I am very much interested in hearMinister ing the Minister say that this matter area of the Federal territory an open question, as other provisions of the Bil l and other parts of the procedure have been. But when the honourable member makes a distinction of that kind, I wish he would be a little more explicit, and would tell the Committee just what he does mean. Are we to understand that if an that area other than that proposed by the Government is carried by the Committee the Government will refuse to go on with the Bill?",49
436,Mr WATSON,Unknown,-'No .,49
437,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,That would be the. general acceptation of such a declaration as has been made.,49
438,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"We have said that it has been an open question with Ministers, as to some provisions of the Bill . They have voted against each other in the matter of the selection of the site, for example; but this matter of the area is a Government question. . Mr. JOSEPH COOK - But , so far as Ministerial responsibility is concerned, it is still to be an open question?",49
439,Mr WATSON,Unknown,Not at all. It is a Ministerial question. We are in agreement upon it.,49
440,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Are we to understand that the Committee may do as they please, and that the intention only is that the Ministry shall vote together on this matter. - Mr WATSON - Certainly .",49
441,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Then I understand the position. I look upon this matter land in the light of the genesis of the whole I put the statements made use-of in arguing the quesin another place alongside the very attenuated statements which have been made by Ministers in this Chamber. When this question had its rise in another Chamber, the under the control of the Government, and certainly without any effort on their part to but check or curb the extravagant language the details there indulged in- :",49
442,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"The Bil l of last year provided for an area of 1,000 square miles.",49
443,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,It was acknowto ledged that the original intention was to make socialistic experiments.,49
444,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"On .900 .square imiles? I gave the honourable member credit for In the first Mr. JOSEPH COOK - If the Prime would be more^, patient, and reof the frain from interjection, he would hear is not to be what I have to say.",49
445,Mr WATSON,Unknown,There is no proposal by the Government for any .larger area.,49
446,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I can say that a member of the Labour Party in another place proposed an area the sides of which would be seventy-five miles long, and he changed that subsequently to an area containing 5,000 square miles. H is idea was, and he made no secret of it, to give the various States an object lesson, not only in land nationalization, but also in the nationalization of industries.",50
447,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"The honourable member is only knocking down a straw. Mr j d SEPH COOK - The honourable gentleman may fine it down as he pleases, but he is aware that it was intended that a social experiment should be undertaken, and that that was the root of the whole proposal.",50
448,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,That is utter nonsense.,50
449,Mr WATSON,Unknown,On 900 square miles?,50
450,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The Prime Minister has said that the Government desire to retain the unearned increment', or to get as much of it as possible, for the citizens of the Commonwealth.",50
451,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"I should say so, and so would any other patriotic man.",50
452,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Is not that a social experiment?,50
453,Mr WATSON,Unknown,Not of the nature at prescribed which the honourable member is hinting.,50
454,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The honourable gentleman is too impatient to listen to me. I say that he is anxious to make a social experiment, and I think I do honourable gentleman no injustice in sayabout ing that.",50
455,Mr WATSON,Unknown,I say that there is no social experiment in the retention of freehold of the land. M'D. JOSEPH COOK - It is an experiment as applied to a whole country.,50
456,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"The Government, which the honourable member was a memwhen ber, carried - that through in New South Wales, and I helped them.",50
457,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,No ; not in the same way.,50
458,Mr WATSON,Unknown,In a more wholesale fashion.,50
459,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I have no obbe jection to what the honourable gentleman proposing to d o ; but I see no .reason enlarging the area beyond what is prescribed in the Constitution.,50
460,Mr WATSON,Unknown,It is not beyond what is prescribed £>y the Constitution.,50
461,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"Interjection s are becoming rather too frequent. I suggest 6 to the honourable member for Parramatta that he should not adopt the interrogative form of speech, and I ask Ministers not to interrupt the honourable member.",50
462,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am only anxious for information, and I should like to address some more interrogations to Ministers. I want to know what is the intention of the Government in connection with this matter; they have not yet explained. If the two Houses reach agreement, will the Bil l be sent on in the ordinary, way for the approval of the Governor General? If so, I should like to know what the position of the Government will then be, as negotiators with the New South Wales Government? Can the Commonwealth Government say to the New South Wales GovernJ ment, "" We want to negotiate with you as to the area of the Federal Capital,"" and at the same time, say, "" Here are our limitations, hard and fast, under the seal of the Governor General"" ? How can the Commonwealth Government begin to negotiate in a matter which has already been determined by the Parliament ? ;",50
463,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,Are the Government to have no limitations?,50
464,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Yes ; and I think those limitations should have been in a series of resolutions affirming the opinion of this House.,50
465,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,Where is the difference?,50
466,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The difference is that we "" determine "" an area, and immethe diately instruct the Government to set altering that area. Otherwise, where is the object of the negotiations?",50
467,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"If we fixed the area by the resolution, would the position not be the same?",50
468,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The difficulty I see is that here is a Bil l to determine the of Seat of Government; and I take it that the act of determination is complete, the transaction is complete, so far as we are concerned. ^ Yet we are told that Ministers, at that' point, must begin to reopen the matter which we have just determined. The whole proceeding seems to my mind, if I may say so without offence, to just a little absurd. The proper course is would have been to get an expression of for opinion as clear and definite as we chose ---but still only an expression of opinionfrom each of the two Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament, land when those expressions of opinion had been brought into agreement, to begin the negotiations. The Commonwealth Government will look very strange if, after we have determined the Seat of Government and its size, have to begin to negotiate with an entirely different body for the purpose of settling these very matters. This clause me to be entirely unnecessary; but if we do perpetrate this legislative absurdityfor I can call it nothing else - we had better stick to the terms of the Constitutobe or vested tion. The amendment simply re-enacts wealth the language of the Constitution, to no exception can be taken. 900 square miles, or 5,000 square miles has been suggested, or a square, each of which is seventy-five miles long, is forward as the irreducible area",50
469,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"It has not been said that the territory should be a square, each side of which should be seventy-five miles long.",51
470,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"But that was to suggested in another place. I remind orable members that the proposal to have an area of 5,000 square miles was only feated by fourteen votes against ten-a n almost equal division. We should, thereParliament; fore, meet the other Chamber with a simple expression of our opinion that the terms of the Constitution ought to be hered to, at any rate in this period negotiation. It is time to fix our ultimate determination after the negotiations have been completed,, and when New South Wales has had, as she is entitled to and as the Constitution contemplates shall have, some voice as to the location and size of the Federal territory.",51
471,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown," Like area is the honourable member who has just spoken, j municateddetermined I carefully refrained from contributing to' Wales Parliament; that tothebv the series of debates which have taken place Wales on this measure, because it was evident that to place that territory at the disposal a large enough number of honourable memthe bers were taking part in it to bring it sooner or later to a satisfactory settlement. But "" r , ,7 T this stage I fed observations compelled which I made to lastrepeat some' f this very question. The honourable member quired who has just sat down, has expressed an private opinion with which I heartily agree. l seems to me that the whole difficulty which has arisen is the result of a misconceived form of procedure. J*I-sirii6nofarJle members to allow me to read that section of Constitution dealing with this matter; and I think it will then be evident body who regards the question from a thoroughly impartial stand-point', that the procedure in regard to this Bill is misconto ceived. I ask honourable members to place on section 125 of the Constitution an interthey pretation of an every-day, common-place character, and then to say whether we are not putting the cart before the horse. Secseems to tion 125 is as follows: The Seat of Government of the Commonwealth shall be determined by the Parliament, and shall be within territory, which shall have been granted acquired by the Commonwealth, and shall in, and belong to the Commonwhich 'There is no mistake; the meaning is not But when/ land which shall be granted in the future, as but land which ""shall have been granted "" side or acquired by the Commonwealth. Any one put who reads that section in an ordinary way can come to no other conclusion, than that it was contemplated that this House should, in some way or other, intimate to the State I Parliament of New South Wales the particular territory within which it was desired select a Capital site; that the New South honWales Government"" should then be invited by this House-no t that this House should dedemand it-to place the territory, including the proposed site, at the disposal of this and that this Parliament should then pass an Act determining the site within adthe territory which had been so granted by of the New South Wales Parliament. It has been suggested, in the: course of the debate; that we should introduce into this Bill the ,wqrd "" should "" instead of "" shall."" have, * Mr MCLEAN - Would the honourable and she learned member propose to first buy the land, and afterwards select the site? /> Mr Bruce . SMITH - No , I ' should fnot; .1I should recommend that whatever upon should be comresolution the New South New South' Parliament should then be invited of Federal Parliament; that the iFederal l Parliament should select its Capital site at .wiflhin that territory, and if it wanted < .wnami t u n territory, ana 11 11 wan year upon territory, the latter should be aceither by Act of Parliament or by t u r the r purchase..",51
472,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,Does the honourable and t learned member say that the land has to r be granted by New South Wales before or after we determine the site?,51
473,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"The land should the be granted before we determine the site. _ Mr ISAACS - Before we know where, we to everyare going to have the site? Mi. BRUCE SMITH - I refer the whole honourable and learned member for Jndi the Constitution. I am not saying what I wish, nor am I saying what the honourable and learned member would like to have done. I am referring only to the Constitution to show what must be done in order to conform with its provisions.",51
474,Mr MCLEAN,Unknown,"Does not that section nf the Constitution simply mean that before the Capital is built, the land shall hnv^ been granted or-acquired?",52
475,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"I ask the honourable member for Gippsland to apply to this question the same common sense which he would apply to any business transaction in which he was engaged. the words "" shall have been"" in section 125 to mean something that has occurred beforehand : not something that is to occur in the future.",52
476,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,Occurre d before what?,52
477,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"If the Constitution had intended that the Capital was to be within territory which should be granted in the future, it would have said, "" which shall be granted,"" and not "" which shall have been granted.""",52
478,Mr MCLEAN,Unknown,"I should construe that section to mean that the territory must be selected, then acquired, and the Seat of Government then built.",52
479,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"I am quite with the honourable member, who will see how the difficulty of the ""shall"" and ""should"" could have been got over. Instead of passing an Act of Parliament, laying it down in-black and white where the territory shall be, of how much land it shall consist, and where the Capital city shall be. and thereby tying the hands of Ministers, who are supposed to negotiate, we should have passed a resolution merely intimating the wishes of the Federal Parliament, as to the particular site which it was desired should be placed at our disposal. Ministers would then have had a free hand to negotiate, and to induce the New South Wales Government to place that territory at our disposal; and as soon as the land had been granted, we should have been in a position to choose the Capital site.",52
480,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"The honourable and learned member voted for "" should"" last year.",52
481,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"After the Bill had been passed. But I shall repeat what I said in 1903. On that occasion, after reading section 125, I saidEvidently the framers of the Constitution assumed either that some State would grant certain territory, or that the Commonwealth would acquire ""certain territory, before Parliament chose , a site, and, therefore, the section provides that the Seat of Government shall be determined by the Parliament, not within territory which shall be granted or acquired, but within.territory which shall have been granted or acquired. No territory has been granted or acquired, and yet we are asked to pass a Bill to determine the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth.",52
482,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"I draw the attention of the honourable and learned member to the fact that we are discussing the word "" nine,""' in relation to the question of the area, and not the word "" shall."" - Mr Bruce SMITH - The question of I understand the use of the word "" shall "" or "" should "" has been discussed at great length by the right honourable member for East Sydney, who has been answered by the Minister.",52
483,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,I understood that the right honourable member for East Sydney was to conclude with an amendment which would have necessitated the withdrawal of the amendment now before the Committee.,52
484,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"I hope I shall be allowed to answer one observation made by the Minister. ' The CHAIRMAN - But if I allow the honourable and learned member to do that, I shall have to allow other honourable members the same, latitude.",52
485,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"The debate has now gone on for two hours, and I have naturally come into it in order to deal with the questions which have been discussed.",52
486,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"If the honourable member for Parramatta asks leave to withdraw his amendment, and the Committee agree to that course, it will be competent for the honourable and learned member for Parkes to discuss the word ""shall.""",52
487,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I ask leave to withdraw the amendment. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.",52
488,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"I do not now propose to debate the question further whether the wishes of the House should have been expressed in the form of a Bill ; it is too late to do so. Last year, on the same ground, I took this exception to the Seat of Government Bill when it was before the House. I expressed privately to the then Prime Minister the opinion which I am now expressing, namely, that having regard to the wording of section 125, the wishes of the House should have been expressed in the form of a resolution. That course would have got rid of all the difficulty about going to the Government of New South Wales, "" pistol in hand "" ; it would have enabled Ministers to approach the Government of New South Wales, and negotiate with them, with a free hand, for the purpose of having certain territory placed at the disposal of this Parliament. To show that I am not speaking without authority, I ask the Committee to listen to the following passage from Quick and Garran's Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commomvealth:The chief question which has arisen in connection with these words is whether the determination of the Seat of Government rests, in the last resort, solely with the Federal Parliament, or whether the Federal Parliament is limited in its choice to sites offered by the Parliament of New South Wales. The opening words of the section strongly favour the former view; but it has been argued that the words "" shall be within territory which shall have been granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth "" point to a prior Act of Cession by the Parliament of New South Wales. Therefore I am not alone in the view I hold as to the meaning of the words in the Constitution, and I need not remind honourable members that in the interpretation of an Act of Parliament it is the commonly-accepted reading of a section which is taken by a Court. There cannot be two interpretations of the words "" shall have been granted,"" because, if the Constitution had contemplated that the Federal would choose a site within territory to be granted in the future, as we are proposing to do, the words "" shall have been granted "" would not have been used. I do not, I say, contend that we should now seriously consider the substitution of a resolution for an Act of Parliament; but what I have said is a strong argument in favour of our limiting ourselves to the selection of a site. If , as the honourable member for Parramatta pointed out, we not only provide in an Act of Parliament for the determination of a certain site, but lay down the area and the limitations of the Federal territory, our Ministeis will have no power of Imagine the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth approaching the Premieof New South Wales and saying, "" The Parliament of the Commonwealth .has passed an Act 'determining' where the Seat of Government shall be, and I now come to you, in accordance with the terms of the Constitution, to ask you to place certain territory at our disposal."" The Premier of New South Wales might .be willing to talk about it; but the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth would have to say, "" I cannot negotiate with you, because the Federal Parliament has determined where the Seat of Government shall be, and what the limitations and the area of the Federal territory shall be."" came back to this House and proposed the Mr Bruce Smith. acceptance of a smaller area than we had determined upon, we should be in the extraordinary position of having demanded, by Act of Parliament, something which we should have to subsequently forego. Would this Parliament then pass an amending Act, going back upon the original measure ? I ask the Minister in charge of the Bill how he would propose to act under such circumstances. If the Premier of New South Wales said, "" The Constitution provides that the Commonwealth shall have not less than ioo square miles, and we are willing to give you 200 or 300 square miles, but will not entertain a demand for 900 square miles,"" we should be in the rather .unpleasant position of having determined upon a certain territory which we could not get. The Premier of New South Wales might very well say, "" You have followed a wrong procedure. Under the Constitution you should have conie to us, and told us where you desired your Capital site to be. Then you should have asked us to place at your disposal such territory as you want, and as we are willing to give. Afterwards, it would bi; for you to determine where the Capital Parliament should be within the territory thus granted by us."" I do not, I ' repeat, make the impracticable proposal that we should revert to the passing of a resolution; but, having made the mistake of passing in a Bill what should have been in the form of a motion- a mistake which has been pointed out more than once, both to the last Government and to this Government-w e should take care that has ths measure is sufficiently elastic to give Ministers a free hand, subject to the confirmation of Parliament, to negotiate with the Government of New South Wales. That can be done only by limiting ourselves to negotiation. an expression of opinion, such as we have in clause 2, as to where the Seat' of Government should be. Having done that, and a debate having taken place as to what should be the extent of the Commonwealth territory, we should refrain from passing clause 3, and leave it to Ministers to negotiate with the Government of New South Wales on the subject.",52
489,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Coul d we not indicate what area we desire?,53
490,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"Yes ; but the honourable member sees the objection which has been offered to the use, in the Bill, of any other word than the word ""shall."" As the right honourable member for East SydIf he ney has pointed out, it would be very unwise to introduce into clause 3 a dictatorial direction as to the area which the Government of New South Wales should place at our disposal. I see very grave objection to the proposed insertion of the words "" not less than 900 square miles."" I know that there are certain honourable members-thoug h I am not aware who they aie-wh o think that the harbour of Twofold Bay should be within the Federal territory. If that be agreed upon, whatever territory is arranged for should extend down to the sea, and include Twofold Bay; but if Dalgety were chosen as the site of the Seat of Government, more than 900 square miles of territory'would be required to take in that Bay. because its distance from Dalgety is n o miles.",53
491,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,Sevent y miles is the exact distance.,54
492,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"An honourable member who I believe to be well versed - the subject has stated that the distance n o miles. That being so, if we selected Dalgety, and wished to take in Twofold Bay, we should have to arrange for a ritory n o miles long and eight or miles broad, which would be an absurdity. If , on the other hand, it is intended quire all the country, within thirty miles the Seat of Government, in order to presquare serve to the Commonwealth whatever may be added to it by the presence of the Capital, it will be impossible tn take in Twofold Bay. I ask honourable members square miles. whether they have any data for a reasonable expectation that there will be anv increment of value. Every one who resquare gards the probable future of the Capital without enthusiastic and wild expectation, must arrive at the conclusion that it not become a great commercial centre. mercial centres are not made; they evolve out of the economic circumstances of country. One cannot, by establishing Parliament in a certain place, evolve mercial centre out of the few hotels' boarding-houses which will be erected for the convenience of those who have to there.",54
493,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Not without othei tractions.,54
494,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"If the circumhad been adopted. stances of the city are. such as to it an attractive sanatorium for the of Australia, a small town may grow such as Bowral or Moss Vale, where a large number of people may go in the summer months; but honourable members have to look at the sanatoria of Australia -. thirty years' growth to see that the expected increment will be infinitesimal. To suppose that there is going to be any substantial increment at a distance of fifteen miles on either side of the Parliament House, in a district where commerce has never shown an inclination to concentrate, is not worthy of-sensible men, nor would the probability justify the incurring of responsibility in holding an unnecessarily large tract of land.. I shall, therefore, if the occasion arises, vote against the proposal to determine that the area of the Seat of Government shall be not less than 900 square miles. We have no right to ask New South Wales to cede such an area. The Minister instanced the separation of Victoria and of Queensland as still greater concessions, but that was an entirely different matter. At the time, New South Wales was an enormous territory which had not developed to anyin thing like the present importance of the is State; and to secure better local Government, a large part of the southern portion was made into the new Colony of Victoria, terwhile the State of Queensland was divided nine off on the north. What right have we, however, when the people of New South to acWales have accepted a Constitution providof ing for a territory of ""not less than 100 miles,"" to ask tEem to place at our value disposal nine times that area?",54
495,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,The Constitution does not say definitely that the area shall be 100,54
496,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"I admit that great the Constitution says ""not less than 100 miles "" ; but if we were to ask our constituents for ,£1,000 a year, on the ground that Parliament has the power to canincrease our remuneration to that amount, Comor if the Governor General were to say"" It is provided in the Constitution that I the am to have not less than .£10,000 per anthe num, and therefore I ask for ,£50,000,'* a comthe people would stand aghast. The people and of New South Wales would regard the request for a larger area of territory for the fro Seat of Government in a similar manner. If this clause were omitted altogether we atshould be in the same position that we should have occupied if a resolution The Bill might then make be regarded as a rather didactical exwhole pression of opinion on the part of this up, Parliament that we desired the Capital to be at such and such a place. It would then be open, and it is desirable that it should only be open, for the Government to approach of New South Wales and ask-no t demand, I but ask-the m to place at the disposal of the Commonwealth Parliament such territory, of an area of not less than ioo square miles, as they felt disposed to give us. I submit, therefore, that although the Government have taken an entirely wrong course in bringing in a B i ll instead of submitting a resolution, we should now do our best to so frame the Bill that it will indicate clearly what the Commonwealth Parliament desires with regard to the position of the site, at the same time leaving as much flexibility as possible for the negotiations between the Government and New South Wales. We. should not pass a Bill laying down in definite terms what shall be the area of the territory, because if we do so we shall inevitably tie the hands of the Government, and assume a somewhat offensive attitude towards the Government of New South Wales, which may stand much in the way of our success in dealing with them.",54
497,Mr ISAACS,Unknown," I have the misfortune to differ very materially from the honourable and learned member for Parkes. I think we should be very careful to remember our duties as well as our rights under the Constitution, and that it has been committed to the Federal Parliament to determine the site of the Federal Capital, and the extent of the area of the Federal territory.",55

499,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,Without any further limit than the reasonable discretion of this Parliament.,55
500,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,Where does the Comstitution give us that authority?,55
501,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"I am astonished that any honourable member should overlook, not merely the right, but the duty, of this Parliament to exercise its discretion as to the matters intrusted to it.",55
502,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Yes , as to the Seat of Government, not. the Federal territory.",55
503,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"Does the honourable member mean to say that the Constitution committed to the Government of New South Wales the sole right to determine the area of the Federal territory? Does any honourable member mean to say that we have nothing 'to do but to determine the spot upon which the Federal Capital shall be built, and that, even as to that, we are to go capin-hand to the New South Wales Government ; that we are to admit that it is only by their permission that the place we think most desirable can be selected as the site of the Seat of Government, and that if they do not choose to give us that site we shall perforce have to go wherever else they wish? New South Wales made it an essential part of the bargain that the Federal Capital should be established within that State, and with that condition, and the'further limitation that the Capital should not be within ioo miles of Sydney, the Constitution provides that it shall be left to the discretion of the Federal Parliament to determine where the Capital shall be, and that the Capital when established shall be within territory of a certain size at least. When the Federal Parliament has determined in its wisdom where the Capital shall be, and what area shall be embraced within the territory surrounding it, then, and then only, will the New South Wales Government be free to exercise its discretion and accede to our request or refuse it.",55
504,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"Then , according to the honourable and learned member's argument, we are at the mercy of New South Wales?",55
505,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"Not solely at the mercy of New South Wales. The arguments used by some honourable members would lead us to suppose that this Parliament' had nothing to say with regard to the determination of the Seat of Government. I contend, however, that this Parliament has not only the first word, but also the last word, although New South Wales also has necessarily some voice in the matter.",55
506,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"How does the honourable member view the provision in the Constitution that the Capital shall be situated within territory "" which shall have been granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth.""",55
507,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"The Constitution provides that the Seat of Government shall be determined by the Parliament of the Commonwealth. It may be determined at any time. It is further provided that the Seat of Government shall be-that is when it exists - within territory which shall have been granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth. ' That is to say, we can determine now, or at any future time, where the Capital shall be. But when it is established-at the moment of its establishment-it shall be within territory which shall have been already granted to or acquired by. the Commonwealth. The granting to the Commonwealth, or the acquisition - by the Commonwealth, is antecedent to the establishment of the Capital, but not to the determination of the Seat of Government.",55
508,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"This B i l mines the territory in which the Capital shall be established, and the area of such territory.",56
509,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,The honourable and learned member is departing slightly from his original argument.,56
510,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,But suppose the Government of New South Wales refused to grant the territory desired by the Commonwealth ?,56
511,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"Then the Capital could not be established unless this Parliament determined to take private land for the purpose. We might, if we chose, select a station embracing a sufficient area of land, and acquire it for the purpose of establishing the Federal Capital. fore, we are not wholly dependent upon the New South Wales Government. All that depends upon them is the grant of Crown land free of payment, and the Commonwealth has a power of acquisition, with regard to land other than Crown lands which may be obtained by grant. orable members grasp the wrong end of the stick when they say that all we have to do is. merely to say that the Capital shall be at Dalgety, and to go no further; to give instruction to the Government; to let them enter upon negotiations with the New South Wales Government, and, if that Government chooses to say, ""We will give you only 100 square miles,"" to rest content. Is that the will of Parliament? I think not.",56
512,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"If we cannot get any more, what are we to do?",56
513,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,Then we should determine not to establish the Capital there.,56
514,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,That tinctly Victorian view of the question.,56

That 'not my view. Although I have been from first determined that there should unnecessary delay in the establishment l deter- the Federal Capital, I am not willing to surrender the duty imposed upon me as a member of this Parliament to see that the best is done for Australia. We have been told that it is our duty to say nothing about the extent of the territory.",56
517,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,At present.,56
518,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,Are we ever to do so?,56
519,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"Yes , certainly.",56
520,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"Then let us consider where that would lead us. We have been told that we should first pass a resolution indicating our desire for certain territory, and that the Government should then negotiate, and, if possible, secure such territory. How could the Government be empowered to do that by resolution? How could they There- go to the New South Wales Government and say, "" We want certain territory "" ?",56
521,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,The resolution would confer the necessary power.,56
522,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"Coul d the Government, in such a case, guarantee that the Federal Parliament would afterwards determine Honthat the Capital should be established within that territory? Certainly not. Suppose the New South Wales Government said, ""We will grant you 100 square miles,"" and the Federal Parliament afterwards determined that the Capital should not be situated within the territory granted by New South Wales? What would then happen? Are we to hamper any' future Parliament? We might pass a resolution today, and the Government might enter into negotiations, and before the acquisition of the land was concluded, another Parliament might come into existence, and say, ""We think that the site selected is an improper one, and we shall not establish is a dis- the Capital there."" _ Mr Bruce ' SMITH - We should not be honin any worse position than if we passed y",56
523,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"I differ entirely from my honourable and learned friend.

I cannot see that a resolution would convey any such authostitute rity. Is it to be said that all the land - to be granted or acquired by the Federal Parliament, and the price paid for it, that then the Federal Parliament is to about considering whether that territory should embrace the site of the Federal Capital? With all respect to my honorthis able friends, it appears to me to be surd to advance any such contention.",56
524,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"A resumption would have to be passed to empower Government to take the land, and comits pensate the owners.",57
525,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"What we have to do at present is perfectly plain. We have determine where the Capital shall be, and thing for it. also the area of public land that shall surround it. and when that is done, and only then, the Government will have a manrequires date to set about negotiating with the vernment of New South Wales, with a view to ascertain whether the desired tory can be obtained. If we can secure it all will be plain; if we cannot all we require in the shape of Crown lands by grant we can acquire the balance.",57
526,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,How are we to acConstitution quire it ? M i . ISAACS - Unde r an Act of Parliament.,57
527,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,Exactly ; under a resumption Act.,57
528,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"A resumption Act would be required under any scheme. We should have to pass a law providing for the resumptions and the payment of a fair for the land. We should, however, proceed about our work in an orderly manposed ner, and not in the haphazard way sugclared gested by some honourable members. I we do not pass this clause we shall simply enact that the Capital shall be in a cerchose to acquire. tain spot, and, at the same time, say, in effect, ""We care not whether or not territory embraces only ioo square miles."" That is not the will of this Parliament. If we once did - that, New South Wales could turn round and say ""We shall fact remains that it did not. not give you more than ioo square miles. You have already determined the Seat of the Government, and yoii cannot help yourselves."" If I thought for a ment that the use of the word "" shall,"" in connection with the decision as to the aiea to be comprised within the Federal tion of any State. territory, would offer, in the smallest degree, an affront to New South should be one of the' first to agree to subsome other expression. In my view, is however, it would do nothing of the kind. It is not a mandate, but merely a declaraand tion in ordinary parliamentary form' as set to the area which shall be embraced within the Federal territory. The clause is a simple declaration that, in the opinion of Parliament-and this is the only way ab- ?n which Parliament! can express Sts opinion definitely - the Federal territory Actmust contain an area of so many square the miles. Then, if New South Wales sees way to give us such territory, we can establish the Capital.",57

539,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"It is not left to Wales, I this Parliament, either.",57
540,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"It is for this Parliament to say, as a condition precedent to the establishment of the Seat of Government what area the Federal territory shall comprise. I read into section 125 of the Constitution, practically a direction that Parliament shall determine the area of the Federal territory. Seeing that the Constitution provides that that territory shall embrace not less than 100 square miles, it stands to reason that somebody must determine its extent. Surely it is not a matter for the Government to settle, and as it cannot be settled by the High Court, it must have been left to Parliament to determine. .

Therefore I honorablesary say that where the Constitution a limitation shall be imposed upon Parliament, it expressly declares it, and where it does not intend that a maximum tion shall apply, it does not declare it. It is idle to talk about what is reasonable. Who is to determine that?",58
544,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The limitation is he ought to have done so. practically in the nature of a general direcstage tion.,58
545,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"The limitation is to be found in our own discretion, and that that will always be reasonably exercised. When we come to determine of the Federal territory, which is a totally different matter from that with which we are now dealing, it will no doubt be decided by the best evidence we can bring to bear cessible from the sea. upon it. I hope that nobody will even sider that by agreeing to the proposal the Government we shall offer an affront vernment from the sea. to New South Wales. That is a course the of action which I for one would not tolerate for an instant. I do say, however, that this provision is merely a declaration in land. ordinary enacting form of the will of Parentirely liament. We have declared that the Seat of Government shall be within seventeen miles of Dalgety. Why should we say to New South Wales, ""We shall have thai site or we shall take no other?"" But we do say it.

Suppose 'South Wales replies, "" Oh, no; we are perfectly willing to provide you with land at Lyndhurst or Lake George, but we are not prepared to give you land at Dalgety."" M.r. KELLY - Dole s not the Constitution give us the absolute power to choose a site?",58
546,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"Of course it does, and it also gives us absolute power to fix the area of the Federal territory. It does not limit that area; it merely fixes the minimum.",58

555,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,The better' plan would be to resume the whole of New South Wales.,59
556,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,Is the area of that State so limited that it cannot afford to part with what is equivalent to thirty miles square?,59
557,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,That is not provision which is contained in the Bill.,59
558,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,The measure provides for the acquisition of a territory comprising 900 square miles.,59
559,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,No . vides for the acquisition of an area of not less than 900 square miles. The honourable and learned member wishes the Federal territory to extend to the sea.,59
560,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,Undoubtedl y I do.,59
561,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Does the honourable and learned member wish to preserve the unearned increment for the Commonwealth?,59
562,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"That is quite another question. I am dealing now with the means of access to the Seat of Government. I take it that to provide for the expansion of the Federal Capital-irrespectiv e of whether it has a commercial future or only a political one- a very considerable area of territory ought to be acquired. Looking to the future, we ought to see that provision is made for access to the Seat of Government from Twofold Bay through Federal territory.",59

I proposed to say, and I do hope that honourable members will recollect-as the other Chamber has recollected - that they are here to declare their will fearlessly, without offence to any State or any person. At the same time, I am absolutely' certain that we are not doing anything offensive to the great State of New South Wales- I hope nobody will ever dream that we are-by affirming in plain, sinmle language, our determination in regard to the area which the Federal territory shall embrace. circumstances, I trust that the Government will retain the clause in its present form.",59
567,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown," The speech of the honourable and learned member for Indi-whic h I will not venture - to Question from the standpoint of the legal interpretation which he places on this provision - rather astonished me, so far as it related to the claim which he considers the Commonwealth has upon New South Wales in regard to the Federal territory. He stated that rather than surrender to the will of any State he would refuse to choose a site the for the Seat of Government. I could understand that declaration coming from an honourable member who desires to indefinitely postpone the selection of the Federal Capital, but I cannot understand it coming It pro- from one who is ready to promptly give effect to the provisions of the Constitution. Is our will-whateve r it may be-withou t consideration of the lights, the equities, and even the sentiments of New South Wales, to be enforced upon that State, and if that State declines to allow of its enforcement, are we to declare that we will not give effect to the provisions of the Constitution ?",59
568,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"That is not what I said. What I . said, in effect, was that the will of no State should be allowed to stand in the way of national sentiment and national requirements.",59
569,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Accord ing to the view entertained by the honourable and learned member, no consideration should be given to the request of that State for ordinary fair treatment, in regard to what was ^understood to be the meaning of to the Constitution. He has told us that, according to his legal opinion, every inch so? of the State of New South Wales could be resumed by the Commonwealth for Federal territory.",59
570,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,Who said so?,59
571,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,The honourable and learned member said so.,59
572,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,I beg the honourable member's pardon.,59
573,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"The honourable and learned member declared that no maximum area was imposed by the Constitution, but only a minimum, and that, therefore, the Commonwealth can take as much as it sees fit. As a matter of fact, I do not think that is so, although I should be very reluctant to set my opinion upon legal matters against that Under these of the honourable and learned member. Still there are 'many good lawyers who entertain a very different view. I think that any Court would decide that the area of the Federal territory must reasonably approximate to the minimum of 100 square miles prescribed by the Constitution, unless, as a matter of negotiation, New South Wales chooses to grant a much larger area. Like the honourable member for South Sydney, I am not averse to that State ceding a larger extent of territory if she chooses to do so, although I personally object to large areas.",59
574,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Suppos e that New South Wales refuses to negotiate with the Commonwealth upon any terms other than by granting it a territory comprising 100 square miles?,60
575,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I do not say that that State has any right to adhere too closelv to the minimum area of ioo square miles. The Constitution declares that there should be an extension of that area if necessary, but the extension should be merely of a give-and-take character, for which we see necessity, or consider the natural features of the' country require it. The intention of the Convention in this connection is very clear, although it was not the Convention which prescribed the minimum area of 100 sqxiare miles. The idea of the author of thiit limitation was that the Federal territory should embrace an area of approximately 100 square miles. The right honourable member for Swan was its author, and from the official report of the Convention debates, I find that when the area of that territory was under consideration, he interjected, "" Make it 100 square miles."" A little later, in speaking, he said I should like to see it laid down in the that the Federal area shall contain not less 100 square miles.",60
576,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,It was also intended that the large cities should be excluded from becoming the Seat of Government by that provision.,60
577,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I cannot in say. It appears to me that on that point arguments were advanced upon both sides. Some desired to have the Seat Government located in the capital of a State, and others did not. Evidently the right honourable member for Swan thought that 100 square miles was a desirable area daries. to acquire, in order that the city might be laid out in a manner worthy of its importand ance. Subsequently the very he suggested in the speech to which referred were incorporated miers' agreement, and embodied in the Constitution, which was accepted by the people of Australia. I do not argue that the vernment of New South Wales ought not give every consideration to the requirements which the Commonwealth may put before it. We must have a given area. In some localities one area would able, and in another a different area. When we demand from a State what we do not yet know will be of the slightest value to us, and without good reason say we must have our own way, we indicate a desire to humiliate"" that State. It is a proposal, by taking a large area, to cut ourselves off from the State, even if the characteristics of the country we acquire render that area undesirable. The Minister of Home Affairs referred to the question as if the Bill merely provided that an area of 900 square miles shall be acquired, and the honourable and learned member for Indi. also spoke of the same area. I interjected at the time that the Bill provides not that an area of 900 square miles shall be acquired, but that an area of "" not less than "" 900 miles shall be secured. That is a very important distinction. Under the clause as it stands it would be possible for the Government to ask, as suggested by an honourable member of another place, for an area of 20,000 square miles. I am altogether opposed to the acquiring of a large area, although I am not averse to negotiations on the part of the Parliament for what may be considered a suitable piece of country. I am personally opposed to the acquiring of a large area simply because I consider that it would be undesirable. No unearned increment would attach to some of Bill the territory taken under such a proposal than as this, and it seems to me that in respect to some portion of the area the Commonwealth would regret the - purchase that it would be compelled to make. If it be not intended that the area to be acquired shall exceed 900 square miles, why not insert the Bill a provision to that effect ? Why not provide that an area "" not exceeding 900 square miles"" shall be acquired? I beof lieve, however, that objection could be taken to even such a limitation as that, because, by taking over a slightly increased area, we might be able to secure much better boun",60
578,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"We might fix a minimum a maximum; there might, perhaps, be words which some reason for that. I have . Mr DUGALD THOMSON - The miniin the Premum is already fixed.",60
579,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,The honourable member is referring to the minimum fixed by the ConGostitution ; I am speaking of a minimum and to a maximum to be fixed'by the Parliament.,60
580,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,The honourable and learned member does not propose that the area to be acquired should exbe desirceed 900 - square miles ?,60
581,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"No,"" I say that we might provide that the area shall be not less than 800 square miles, and not more than 900 square miles.",61
582,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Such an alteration would hardly be worth making. The Minister of Home Affairs spoke of the way in which New South Wales had been whittled away since the establishment of that State, and seemed to think that it had become so accustomed to that process that we had only to continue it.",61
583,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,I did not think anything of the kind.,61
584,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,The honourable gentleman said that this area and that area had been taken away from New South Wales.,61
585,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,I said that there was a greater outcry over the proposal to acquire this territory than there was over ing Queensland a separate Colony.,61
586,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"There were good reasons for the establishment of Queensland as a separate State, but I cannot see any reason for the proposal that, without knowing how the land is to be utilized, without a knowledge of the outlines of the territory, without any information as to what area in the vicinity of the Seat of Government is worth taking over, we should take over not less than 900 square miles, whether the land be good or not. We are to provide for a minimum, and to say to the people of New South Wales, "" If you disagree with our proposal we have no right to surrender ourselves to your will, and you shall get no Capital in your State."" That attitude might be followed by eventualities which I should be very sorry to see. In the interests, not of New South Wales, but of Australia, I am absolutely opposed to the idea that we should acquire a territory which we may approach without setting foot on New South Wales soil. If there be anything foreign to a 'Federal union it is the feeling that we cannot establish our Government in any State- I care not what State it is-withou t the expectation that the people of that State will become antagonistic to us. If honourable members hold such an opinion, I can only say that we have not advanced far towards the realization of the true spirit of Federal union.",61
587,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Do not all our laws indicourteous cate that - we have the power to compel States to do certain things? ,61
588,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"It was not even dreamt of in the Convention or in the Federal Conference, and it has never been dreamt of in certain other Federations. What was the motto of those who advocated Federation ? Was it not "" One people, one destiny ?"" Yet here we are seeking to make ourselves a separate people; to insult a State; to say to the people of that State, ""We cannot put such trust in you as to allow it to be necessary for persons to pass through your territory in order to reach the Federal Capital; we must be able to get from the Federal Capital to the sea without passing over a foot of your soil. If we do not obtain that means of ingress, and of egress, we shall not establish our Capital in your State."" Is that an attitude that is calculated to breed goodwill between the States? Is that an attitude that is likely to make us one people with one destiny? I presume that if this mak- area is obtained the Government will ask for a large vote for fortifications, because of a fear 'that the people of New South Wales, or of the rest of Australia, may attack the Federal Executive. Instead of seeking to realise the Federal motto, ""One people, one destiny,"" we are endeavouring to create two separate destinies for the people. We are saying, in effect, to the people of one State, comprising a third of the people of Australia, that we should not trust ourselves to go among them, because if we did we might not be permitted to leave their territory. To my mind that is worse than ridiculous.",61
589,Mr CONROY,Unknown,Why do we trust ourselves to come here?,61
590,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"If we were in danger here we might escape, if we were lucky, by the Yarra, but the suggestion that we cannot trust a State is, to my mind, one of the lowest aspects from which to regard the Federation. If there are other good reasons for this proposal they may 'be considered; but how can we expect any State to give us a large portion of its coast line, arid to cut off its own territory north and south, simply for the reason which is implied, if not expressed, that we cannot trust the people of the State to give us means of access to and of egress from the Federal territory. I trust that the word "" should"" will be substituted for the word "" shall"" in the clause. The last Parliament adopted that policy, and we should do the same. the The honourable and learned member for Indi says that in the Constitution the word "" shall "" is used in reference to the Seat of Government. I courtesy was siiown than is proposed to be displayed in connection with the taking over tainly do not. of the Federal territory. The Government of New South Wales was communicated with in reference to the matter, but even before that stage had been reached it come before the Parliament. showed its willingness to assist the Fedeas ral Parliament in selecting the Seat of vernment. It appointed a Commissioner, whom every one will admit was thoroughly impartial- a man without leanings to any State-to inspect a number of sites that were suggested. Over forty sites were put forward, and having inspected those which he considered at all suitable for the purwould pose, he furnished a report to the State Government. The State Government not only offered the Federal Parliament the choice of any of the best sites, but said- "" As as possible we shall reserve the Crown lands within these areas so that you may get much as possible for nothing.""",61
591,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,I for one do not anticipate the slightest friction in this matter between the Commonwealth and the State.,62
592,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"If a deshare mand be made for this large area of tersame. ritory on the ground thai we have a right to demand io-and I , in common with have many legal authorities, doubt if we have that right- a difficulty will be created the very outset.",62
593,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,I have never said that have a right to demand.,62

I should like to see the clause so amended that it would provide that an area of ""not more"" than 900 square miles should be taken over, instead of an area of "" not less than "" 900 square miles. That indicate, at all events, that there was some limit to the authority given to the Government, and to our desire for the acquisition of New South Wales' territory. far According to the Minister of Home, Affairs and others, it is not anticipated that more as than 900 square miles will be required. It is rather extraordinary that the honourable and learned member for Indi voted today for the Upper Murray district, and that several other honourable members, who his views on this point, did the H a lf of the unearned increment attaching to the selection of that site would accrued to land on the Victorian side of the Murray. What, therefore, becomes of the at argument as to the - unearned increment ? I do not kno.w what weight the honourable we and learned member for Ind i attaches to it.",62
601,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"I did not say a word about it. Mr DUGA LD THOMSON - But many honourable members, who have advanced that argument, voted for the Upper Murray district, although the selection ot that site would have meant that half of the unearned increment would applv We to land in Victoria. That Mr FISHER - Parliament , in its wisdom, Mr DUGA LD THOMSON - But it was a very close vote. Is it because the State of New South Wales is concerned that the unearned increment is demanded ? I do not believe that, but look at the appearances. members were prepared to put the Capital in a situation where half ""the unearned increment would have gone into the pockets of an adjoining State; but when the I Capital is fixed in another position, the State in which it is located is to have no advantage from the unearned increment.

603,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I have been contending that we have to consider the interests of the people of Australia, but some honourable members appear to think that we are choosing the Capital for the benefit of a separate people, and that it must be barricaded round and kept away from the rest of the people of Australia. I do not object in any way to the unearned increment, if there is any, being received the Commonwealth Government, or the State Government; it does not matter which.",63
604,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"It should be received by the Federal Government, because the people of Australia will pay the money.",63
605,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,In any case the. amount will not be great.,63
606,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"It will pay the cost of the buildings, any way.",63
607,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"It is possible that, in the course of time, the value of the land within the Federal area may rise considerably, but not alone in consequence of the establishment of the Federal Capital there. The only suggested site where the unearned increment was likely to be considerable was Lyndhurst, because that is the only district which has great resources. But at Dalgety I am afraid that we shall have to wait for the unearned increment until land begins to get scarce in Australia. I was in Washington in 1884. It was then a skeleton cityI believe that it has improved very much since then. My visit was long after the city was established. I was amazed, first of all, at the beauty and expensiveness of the buildings, and also amazed to see that the cart-wheel streets that radiated from the centre, were nothing but skeleton streets with a few houses dotted here and there about them. I believe there has since been some considerable increase in the population.",63
608,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"There are 300,000 people there now.",63

613,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"In the older town there are two blacks to one white, certainly, but in Washington itself that is not the case. The city may have increased considerably since I was there, but apparently at that time there was very little unearned increment in Washington. If that was the case in Washington, which is situated close to the Potomac River, and right in the centre of busy coastal States, how much can we expect from an area situby ated in the midst of the Snowy Mountains at Dalgety? I am not finding fault with the site, but am simply pointing out that Dalgety is near no stream that reaches the sea.",63
614,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,The Snowy River runs to the sea.,63
615,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I mean a stream by which traffic can reach the sea. No traffic can at any time reach the sea by means of the Snowy River. I accept the selection which Parliament has made, but I fear it will be a very long time before there is any unearned increment from the site selected.",63
616,Mr WILKS,Unknown," Whateve r doubts I may have had in the early part of this debate have been entirely removed by the honourable and learned member for Indi. He talked about Federal sentiment and Federal ties, but he desires to strike the hardest bargain possible with New South Wales. His steel-pointed and casehardened idea with regard to the Capital site was enough to destroy the Federal spirit in almost any member of this Chamber. He talked as though a bargain were about to be made between two foreign countries-say , between Russia and Japan at the conclusion of the present war.",63
617,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,What is the hard bargain?,63
618,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"The honourable and learned member read the phrase "" not less than 100 square miles "" to mean "" as much more as we can possibly get."" If he fights so bitterly for what is contained in the Constitution, I must interpret in the same way his desire that the Commonwealth shall acquire not less than 900 square miles, as provided in this Bill. If the people of New South Wales have been caught once, they are not likely to be caught again in the same way. "" Once bitten, twice shy."" This is where the hard bargain comes in. If the honourable and learned member interprets ""not less than 100 square miles"" to mean that we can take 900 square miles, we may expect that he will interpret "" not less than 900 square miles"" to mean that we can take 90,000 square miles, or even the whole of New South Wales.",63
619,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,I have not said that I agree to that interpretation.,64
620,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"I think that it is an impudent action, to put in this Bill a demand for so large a territory. The right honourable member for East Sydney said that there is too much ultimatum in it. Let me add that there is-too little pomatum. The Prime Minister can easily approach the Premier of New South Wales, and say that the desire of the Federal Parliament is that 900 square miles shall be acquired. If he can show good reasons, I have no doubt that that area will be granted, and the matter will be over. But in this Bill we are not asking for negotiations. The Minister of Home Affairs points a revolver at the head of the Premier of New South Wales, and says- "" I am not going to negotiate with you; my position is that we must have 900 square miles, and you had better be a good fellow, and grant it."" But now the honourable and learned member for Indi says that he will not be satisfied even with that. He must have access to the territory by cause, he says, there is a danger that some time or other Federal members may be molested by the people of New South Wales. That, I suppose, is the Federal spirit! The honourable and learned member has the impudence to tell us that the people of New South Wales are a race of savages. He is afraid that he would not be able to travel through the territory of that State. We must give him a port. He must have a strip of territory from the Capital city to the sea, seventy miles by twelve. This attitude is not new on the part of the honourable and learned member. He played the same game in the last Parliament with the same motive.",64
621,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,Is the honourable member responsible for what he is saying?,64
622,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Yes , I am.",64
623,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,I should not have thought it.,64
624,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"The occasion was when Tumut was selected. The .honourable and learned member for Indi moved an amendment that the territory be stretched down to the Murray River, in order to get access to' the sea.",64
625,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"I was not even present when the vote was taken. I believe that it was the honourable member for Grampians who made the proposal, but I was not here.",64
626,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"I thought that it was the honourable and learned member who started the idea. I apologize to him for making the mistake. New South Wales did not expect to have a model territory carved out of her province. She did not expect to have experiments made in Socialism and collective industry. She took a rational view of this question, and was prepared to grant a certain area of Crown land to the Commonwealth. She did not contemplate that the Commonwealth was to take as much as it liked. If the Prime Minister can approach the Premier of New South Wales and show good reasons for a larger area being granted, probably it will be granted. But Ave should not demand it. The Prime Minister will find that if the people of New South Wales receive proper treatment, and are taken into our confidence, they will not be inclined to strike a niggardly bargain. They have always adopted the policy of open-handedness towards the people of Australia generally. But they certainly are suspicious when Federal members like the honourable and learned member for Indi say that they will not surrender this and that. He must have a Bill, which says that a sea, be- certain thing shall be done, that there must be an area of not less than 900 square miles - and that may mean any larger area-and that there must be access to the sea. The only lesson to be learnt from this by New South Wales is either that the honourable member wishes to filch too much territory from that State, or that he wishes to further delay the selection of the site.",64
627,Mr REID,Unknown," I desire to test the question I raised some time ago, and I now move That the word "" shall,"" in line 4, be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word "" should."" I recognise that, although I am opposed to an area of 900 square miles, ""the majority of the members of the Committee disagree with me on that point.",64
628,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,I am not so sure of that.,64
629,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"The amendment to substitute "" should "" for "" shall "" was carried by a large majority last year.",64
630,Mr REID,Unknown,"I content myself at present with the amendment I have moved. I believe that it will express the view of the majority of honourable members with perfect clearness, and will avoid, what seems to me, to be a positively offensive way of beginning what ought to be a friendly negotiation.",64
631,Mr SPENCE,Unknown," A great deal too much has been made of the attitude which it is assumed that the Government of New South Wales will take up. are all agreed with the sentiment expressed by the right honourable member for East Sydney, that the negotiations on this subject between the Commonwealth Government and the Government of New South Wales should be friendly. But it has been inferred, and even asserted, that the Government of New South Wales is so touchy and sensitive on this point that they will quarrel with the Federal Parliament because we use the word "" shall,"" and definitely state what it is we desire. Are we to understand that the New South Wales authorities are looking for a quarrel ? As one of the representatives of New South Wales, I cannot help feeling that a number of other representatives of that State are raising a noise about this without any justiwe fication. We know that certain remarks have been made on the subject in the New South Wales press, and by some New South Wales politicians; but no one will tell us that 'She New South Wales Government will take serious'notice of those statements. I think it is unfair to them to suggest that they desire to seek a quarrel with the Federal Government.",65
632,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"Does not the honourable member think they will, when they find that nine times the area mentioned in the Constitution is required?",65
633,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"The area required does not matter. I am now discussing the terms in which we propose to state what we want. We are all agreed that the negotiations should be friendly, and it is but fair to as- or even a larger area, has puzzled me. sume that the New South Wales Government will recognise that, and, personally, I think it is probable that there will be very little discussion about the area suggested. It is unfair to assume that the New South Wales Government will seek to quarrel with the Commonwealth Government, or that the Commonwealth Government will carry on the negotiations from their side in a way which will be annoying or offensive. The New South Wales Government will not analyze and criticise the wording of this provision, as our legal friends have done. Such criticism and analysis may be very necessary in connection with legal matters, but in business communications between members of Governments, who are men of the world, and have no desire to misunderstand each other, that kind of analysis of terms is not necessary. I have heard no honourable member state that he has any authority from the New South Wales Government for making the assertion that they will We object to the terms proposed in this clause. In my judgment the New South Wales people will have no objection to a formal statement of what we are asking for.",65
634,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"The honourable member for Darling voted for the word "" should "" last session on my motion.",65
635,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"I do not care whether the word used is "" shall "" or "" should "" ; but I protest against honourable members raising a dust and a stir when all is calm, peaceful, and serene. In my opinion, it is an unfair reflection upon the New South Wales Government to assume that they will analyze this clause in the way suggested, and that if we use the word "" shall,"" they will not negotiate with us, but that if use the word "" should,"" they will be prepared to do so. Honourable members in this matter have been making a noise about nothing. We are entitled to assume that the New South Wales Government will act with tact and judgment, and every one admits that the present Prime Minister of the Commonwealth - possesses tact and judgment.",65
636,Mr REID,Unknown,We should give the honourable gentleman a fair start.,65
637,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"In my opinion, the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Waddell, Mr Carruthers, or whoever he may be, will not quarrel with the Government over this matter. I wish to say a few words about the area. The apparent fear in the minds of some people in New South Wales about our taking 900 square miles, I am satisfied with the Government proposal that the area should be 900 square miles. I do not think that less than that area would do. I might give one or two reasons why, in my opinion, we should acquire a much greater area than 100 square miles.",65
638,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"The question now before the Committee is that the word "" shall"" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word "" should."" When that question is disposed of, the honourable member will be at liberty to refer to the area.",65
639,Mr BROWN,Unknown," I think there is a great deal more in the contention that we should approach the New South Wales authorities in this matter in a diplomatic way than some honourable members appear to imagine. I was quite in agreement with the policy of the late Government-who , - unfortunately, did not have sufficient back-bone to stand by their policy - that the Seat of Government Bill should fix a certain site, and that the question of the territory should be dealt with by sub sequent legislation, which should be the outcome of negotiations between the Common, wealth Government and the Government of New South Wales, and which should be based on information with respect to the territory proposed to be acquired, which at present we do not possess. We may deal with this matter in a reasonable, diplomatic way, or in an offensive way, and it must not be forgotten that the people of New South Wales are inclined to be a little sensitive on this subject. I remember that on the last occasion, when this matter was dealt with by this Parliament, and when, against the policy of the then Prime Minister, the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, the area proposed to be acquired was stated in the Bill, the Government, the leader of the Opposition, and a large number of honourable members at once committed themselves to an attitude of hostility to the proposal. That was due largely to the way in which it was put. I ask honourable members, on this occasion, to be guided by the experience we have gained in that connection. The late See Government, in New South Wales, was, if anything, over-friendly to the Federal Government. That is to be accounted for by the fact that it was, to some extent, a Government which had been brought into power by the honourable member for Hume, who was at first the Minister in charge of this measure. So careful were the members of the See Government not to in any way infringe upon the authority of the Federal Government, but on the contrary to consider their wishes in this matter, that although Sir John See was asked to move in the direction of suggesting a site himself, he resolutely refused to do so, and left entirely to the Federal Government. But as soon as word was sent to New South Wales that this Parliament was asking for a much larger territory than that mentioned in the Constitution, Sir John See, on the very limited information at his disposal, felt compelled to take a hostile stand at once, and the debate which ensued in the State Parliament was decidedly hostile to the Federal proposal, and largely because it was misunderstood. We do not wish to have any misunderstanding with the State Government on this matter. I wish to say that, in supporting the amendment submitted by the leader of the Opposition, I am not opposed to the larger area asked for. My view is that we should adopt the diplomatic method of dealing with this business. In order to prevent friction, and to have it settled as amicably as possible, we should meet the State authorities reasonably. The experience we gained in the last Parliament should teach us that to make anything in the nature of a demand upon New South Wales is not the most diplomatic way in which to secure the concession for which we are seeking. I hope that the Government will agree to the amendment, as it will in some way tone down the request we are making.",65
640,Mr MCCAY,Unknown," I had hoped to hear from, the Government that they intended to accept this amendment.",66
641,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,The Government do intend to accept it.,66
642,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"I mention this, because I see that last year a number of the members of the Government voted in favour of a similar proposal.",66
643,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,I did not do so.,66
644,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"-The Minister in charge of the Bill at present did not vote for the proposal, nor, do I think, did the then Minister of Trade and Customs; but the present Prime Minister, Postmaster-General, and Minister of External Affairs all voted in that direction, and - I know they are too consistent to reverse a vote on a maLter of this nature.",66
645,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"Unde r the circumstances I think, perhaps, it would be better for me to "" climb down "" than to ask my colleagues to reverse their vote. I admit that it is possible we shall be able to carry out these negotiations and bring them to a conclusion more quickly by using the word proposed in preference to any other word; and, therefore, I am prepared to the selection accept the amendment. Amendment agreed to.",66
646,Mr ISAACS,Unknown," 1 think there is some force in the observation that the clause as it stands leaves the area unlimited, . and I suggest that there should be a maximum as well as a minimum.",66
647,Mr REID,Unknown,"That would be worse than ever; that would hamper the negotiations more than ever, because there would be an ultimatum with two extremes. - Mr ISAACS - If the right honourable gentleman is content to leave the clause as it is, I also am content.",66
648,Mr REID,Unknown,"I am content, rather than increase the trouble.",67
649,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"It appears to me that my suggestion would not increase the trouble. At present it is left open to the Government to ask for as much more territory as they like, though there is a minimum below which the New South Wales Government cannot go. However, if the right honourable member for East Sydney thinks the clause will satisfy New South Wales, I have no more to add. Amendment (by Mr. JOSEPH COOK) proposed - That the word "" nine "" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word "" one.""",67
650,Mr SPENCE,Unknown," In regard to the matter of area, there are some considerations which I do not think have been laid before the Committee. There are several requirements of a Capital city which cannot, in my opinion, be complied with if the area be restricted to ioo square miles. For instance, commonage would be required, and there must be quarries for the necessary buildings. Further, it is desirable that the watershed and supply should be within Commonwealth territory; and there are other considerations, such as the provision of parks, a race-course on which to run the Great Federal Capital Cup Race, and other reserves for recreation. Of course, there cannot be a city in Australia without a race track; and I merely suggest these as requirements which it would be difficult to satisfy with an area of ioo square miles. Apart from the consideration of the unearned increment, an area of 900 square miles is not at all too large for the ordinary requirements of such a populous city as we hope to see at no distant date. therefore, that the Committee will not accept the amendment. Tn this matter we might, I think, safely trust the Government during the negotiations, to ask for 900 square miles more or less, because we cannot be exact to a yard. It is not fair to assume that the Government, composed of sensible men, will use any technical power they may possess to ask for a great deal more than is absolutely necessary.",67
651,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown," I recognise that the Committee are against me, and to save time. I ask leave to withdraw my amendment. I content myself by saying that I do not think there is the slightest chance of New South Wales agreeing to any such area as that proposed; and, in my opinion, such an area ought not to be granted.",67
652,Mr REID,Unknown," I am glad that the honourable member for Parramatta has withdrawn the amendment. I am just as strongly as is that honourable member against the proposal to take a large area, but I recognise that the majority of honourable members present wish that, at any rate, the attempt shall be made. I bow, with great reluctance, to the decision, feeling that when matters come to negotiation, a mutually conciliatory spirit will be shown. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.",67
653,Mr ISAACS,Unknown," I beg to move That the following words be added, "" and have access to the sea."" I have before explained why 1 think such a provision' is desirable, and i shall say only two or three words at the present juncture. Without disrespect to any State, I think it is extremely important and desirable that there should be Federal jurisdiction from the Capital to the sea-coast if possible.",67
654,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Would the honourable and learned member have submitted the same amendment if Tooma had been chosen ?,67
655,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"Toom a possesses natural advantages in relation to the Murray River, and in the matter of centrality, which, in my opinion, would have more than compensated for non-access to the sea. But, having chosen Dalgety, it is highly desirable, being possible and not difficult, to have access to the sea.",67
656,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,I ask the Minister in charge to consent to progress being reported.,67
657,Mr REID,Unknown," I ask honI hope, orable members to endeavour to conclude this business to-night. We adjourned over Friday, and this matter was discussed some time ago, and then thoroughly threshed out. A. great deal of the criticism levelled at us on account of the slow progress made with our business, is, I am afraid, somewhat justified, and I do not think that this matter ought to be taken over to another sitting. It is not as though this was a new proposal, because we have discussed it on all occasions when the question of the Seat of Government has been before us.",67
658,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,The .right honourable member means that it was discussed in the last Parliament ?,67
659,Mr REID,Unknown,"I feel that we have been going slowly enough in all conscience, and that we ought to finish to-riight.",68
660,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown," This is an amendment which requires consideration, and I should have liked to hear those gentlemen who discussed the matter in the last Parliament. It appears to me that a doubt is at once raised as to the distance from the proposed site to the sea, and thatj even if that distance be seventy imiles, we require to consider what access means.",68
661,Mr REID,Unknown,The amendment means the division of New South Wales along sixtymiles of country.,68
662,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Many honourable members who voted for Dalgety did so because they believed that that site would have access to the sea.,68
663,Mr REID,Unknown,There will be access; no fence will be put up.,68
664,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"But the honourable members referred to believed that the Commonwealth Government would have control of the means of access, and of the land in the immediate neighbourhood of the port.",68
665,Mr REID,Unknown,"And yet those honourable members voted for Tooma, where there would be no access to the sea.",68
666,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I am speaking of honourable members who voted not for Tooma, but for Dalgety. I am not speaking of honourable members who voted for Lyndhurst, where there was no possibility of getting any water. There is a great difference between voting for a site with a/i abundance of water, and where it was thought there would be access to a seaport, and voting for a site where, to say the least, I saw no water during my visit. The question arises how much territory do we want, and what is to be the width of the land connecting the territory with the port of Twofold Bay ? What land are we to reserve immediately around the Bay for the purpose of conserving ' the interests of the Commonwealth in its control of that part of the territory? Honourable members for Western Australia have said that they voted for Dalgety, not particularly because of the site and its surroundings, but because they thought that some day there will be a jiort at which they will be able to land, and from which they can be carried by a short line of railwav to the Capital without any very great inconvenience.",68
667,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,It is not necessary for the Commonwealth to own the land enable honourable members to reach the Capita] in that way; New South Wales will not stop honourable members.,68
668,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"But the question arises whether the Commonwealth should not hold that territory. I do not say that it is absolutely necessary that the land should be taken from the control of the State, because I know there would still be access to the harbour. But in view of the fact that the Capital is to be within seventy miles of Twofold Bay, it seems only reasonable that the Commonwealth should control a harbour which is open to attack by an enemvj and which it might be necessary to fortify - a work which could not be carried out by a State.",68
669,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,It has naval control.,68
670,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Yes ; but we have no guarantee that the Government of New South Wales will be willing to spend the money necessary to make the port suitable for the purpose.,68
671,Mr REID,Unknown,"Well , they would let the iCommocwealth do it.",68
672,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Yes , but the questionis : Would the Commonwealth be warranted in the expenditure if it had not possession of the harbour? As we seem to have selected Dalgety largely in the hope that we shall thereby secure a port at Twofold Bay, it is essential that we should have a strip of territory between Dalgety and Twofold Bay which would enable us to connect the Federal Capital with the port, and a strip of land round the foreshores of the Bay, which would enable us to fortify it, and to make it suitable for the purposes of the Commonwealth. I am not able to go very thoroughly into the subject to-night, because J. have not had time to examine the map, or to consider the matter in all its bearings: but if we do not get an approach to Twofold Bay, many honourable members will have voted for the Dalgety site under a misapprehension. T shall vote with those who are trying to get as much as they can under Commonwealth control. I object to the Dalgety site, but since it has been selected, I think we should give it a port for the advantage of the people of Western Australia and Tasmania, who will have to travel there by sea.",68
673,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown," Al though I was in favour of the selection of Tooma, I had, before seeing that site, ex L pressed myself in favour of Dalgety, and to I agree with the honourable member for 88 Seat of [REPRESENTATIVES.] Gwydir that quite a number of honourable gentlemen voted for Dalgety in order to obtain a port. The right honourable member for East Sydney has said that the Commonwealth will have access to Twofold Bay in any case, because the Government of New South Wales will not put up fences to debar them; but that argument maybe used in another way. It may be said that the Commonwealth Government will not put up fences. Furthermore, if the Commonwealth obtains possession of Twofold Bay, the State of New South Wales will be saved a large expenditure in making the harbour a good port. I think that if we choose a territory near the sea, it should extend down to the coast, so as to give the Commonwealth an independent outlet.",68
674,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,It is not necessary to make the proposed amendment in order to bring that about.,69
675,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"I think it is better to determine that Twofold Bay shall be part of the Federal territory,' and I hope that New South Wales will show sufficient Federal spirit to agree to the arrangement",69
676,Mr LONSDALE,Unknown,"If New South Wales shows the same Federal spirit as the other States are showing, it will not give anything to the Commonwealth.",69
677,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"I think that honor, able members who do not represent New South Wales have shown a large amount of .Federal spirit in this matter. Personally it is against my interests' to have the Capital removed from Melbourne, because it is very convenient for me to be able to get home at the end of the week; but I wish to carry out the provisions of the Constitution, and I believe that it would give plete satisfaction if the Commonwealth were to be granted a territory which would have an independent outlet. Judging from the remarks made by some of the representatives of New South Wales, there will be very little difficulty in getting the people of that State to give us a port, because of the benefits which the State will receive from the Commonwealth expenditure in making the port what it should be. I shall support the amendment.",69
678,Mr BROWN,Unknown," I think that it will be better to leave the matter to be settled by diplomacy than to agree to the amendment. If the Government of New South Wales is prepared to include Twofold Bay within the Federal territory, I shall not raise my voice against the arrangement, but if the State is not Government Bill. pared to do so, no vote of mine will be given for the proposal, and there is nothing in the Constitution which will require her to do so. New South Wales interests are supposed to give way whenever the Federal spirit is mentioned, but the Federal spirit is a practically unknown quantity with the representatives of the other States when dealing with New South Wales. What weighed with the members of the last Parliament was the desirability of obtaining access to the Federal Capital without going through New South Wales territory, and that, apparently, is the factor determining the decision on the present occasion. We have been led to suppose that the people of New South Wales are so hostile to Federation that it would be dangerous to have the Commonwealth territory situated entirely within that State. That does not seem to me to be a good exhibition of the Federal spirit.",69
679,Mr MCCOLL,Unknown," The substitution of the word ."" should "" for "" shall "" makes the matter one for negotiation with the Government of New South Wales, and therefore, I think it desirable that we should insert in the clause whatever conditions we wish to impose in regard to the Federal territory. To my mind, the selection made to-night is so unfortunate, in almost every respect, that some compensating advantages are required to make it palatable to the people of the Commonwealth. I believe that future generations will bitterlv rue the selection of Dalgety.",69
680,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,The honourable member is not in order in reflecting upon a vote of the House.,69
681,Mr MCCOLL,Unknown,"The one compensating com- advantage which can be given-and it was to secure this advantage that a large number of honourable members voted for Dalgety-is the possession of a Federal port, and, therefore. I trust that the Committee will agree to the amendment.",69
682,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"It is hardly fair to absolutely settle this matter to-night, since a considerable number of honourable members, who did not know that it was coming on, are absent.",69
683,Mr REID,Unknown,They should be here. I have never complained when a vote has been taken in my absence.,69
684,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,This is the first time. I have heard the leader of the Opposition urging the Government to go on with the business in hand.,69
685,Mr REID,Unknown,The Government are so preslow that some one must drive them.,69
686,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"We have gone right through the Bill today, and certainly cannot be accused of delay in connection with this matter. I propose to take a vote now; but the Government will agree to a recommittal, should it be desired, because a considerable number of members is absent.",70
687,Mr REID,Unknown,"That is fair, if a majority is in favour of a recommittal.",70
688,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"I think that the Commonwealth Government should have the right to connect the Federal territory by railway with the nearest port, should they desire to do so.",70
689,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,That right can negotiated for without the introduction of the proposed provision.,70
690,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"Quite so. I think, however, that it is well to place these words in the Bill .",70
691,Mr BROWN,Unknown,The right to construct a railway would be of no use unless the Commonwealth had the port too.,70
692,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"The port would be there, in any case. What we desire is access to a port, and we should negotiate for the right to make railway communication to the nearest port. If there were a strip of New South Wales territory between the Federal territory and the sea, the State Government might refuse to allow the Commonwealth to construct such a railway as I speak of.",70
693,Mr LONSDALE,Unknown,Why suggest that?,70
694,Mr REID,Unknown,On e would think that we were dealing with Manchuria instead of . with New South Wales.,70
695,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"The which I think New South Wales might take up is that which is being at present assumed by South, Australia in respect to the proposed Transcontinental Railway.",70
696,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,That is gross repudiation in the case of South Australia.,70
697,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,That may or may not be; but it shows that the' fear that some honourable members entertain that the Commonwealth may be denied access to the sea is not without foundation.,70
698,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,The difficulty will not be overcome by the adoption of the amendment.,70
699,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"I admit that I do not say that it is absolutely necessary to make a distinct provision in the Bill , because' negotiations must proceed upon the lines indicated. 8",70
700,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The Minister will have a stream of cold water poured down his back when he begins to negotiate.,70
701,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"That would not paralyze me, or prevent me from carrying out the negotiations on. the lines that this Farliament desires. I do not think that the amendment will make a great deal of difference, but I see no objection to inserting it in the Bill .",70
702,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,It will only make a further demand upon the New South Wales Government.,70
703,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"I cannot conceive that the New South Wales Government be would refuse to accede to such a reasonable request. The amendment is simply declaratory, and I shall support it.",70
704,Mr REID,Unknown,"There is no objection; we shall all vote for it . Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 4 agreed to. Bill reported with amendments. House adjourned at 11.7 p.m. attitude",70
