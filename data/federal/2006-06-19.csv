2,Mrs MOYLAN,DELEGATION REPORTS,"I present the reports of the Australian parliamentary delegation bilateral visit to the Republic of South Africa from 28 April to 4 May 2006 and the 114th Inter-Parliamentary Union Assembly held in Nairobi from 5 to 12 May 2006. It is a great privilege to be able to represent this parliament at the InterParliamentary Union conferences and also at the bilateral visits that accompany those conferences. This was a particularly productive and successful delegation. I am grateful to members of the delegation, including the deputy leader of the delegation, the member for Fowler, who will speak on the bilateral visit to South Africa. I would also like to acknowledge the work of Mrs Kay Hull, the member for Riverina, and I am delighted to inform the House that my colleague was elected unanimously by the Asia-Pacific geopolitical group to the position of Titular Member of the Coordinating Committee of Women Parliamentarians. This is an outstanding outcome, and I congratulate and thank Kay for her dedication to the task of representing women's issues on behalf of the Australian delegation, as she has done at these last three assemblies. I must say that this builds on the work of previous delegates such as Mr Somlyay and Mrs Vamvakinou, and Senators Ferris, MCKiernan and Chapman. The delegation that went to Nairobi participated constructively and enthusiastically, and I think we did great justice to the work of previous people from this House who have previously attended the work of the IPU assembly. My contribution today will focus on the work of the delegation at the 114th Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union in Nairobi in May this year. One of the debates conducted at the IPU is the general debate, which this year had the theme of promoting democracy and helping to build democratic institutions. I think we in Australia can see just how important that is in the region around us. I participated in this debate and spoke on the role of the Australian government in encouraging and promoting good governance in the Asia-Pacific region. We do have an excellent track record there. The IPU also has three standing committees which debate and draft a resolution on an issue of importance. Mrs Irwin, the member for Fowler, participated in the First Standing Committee (Peace and International Security) debate on ‘The role of parliaments in strengthening control of trafficking in small arms and light weapons and their ammunition'. Senator Marshall participated in the Second Standing Committee (Sustainable Development, Finance and Trade) debate on ‘The role of parliaments in environmental management and in combating global degradation of the environment'. The member for Riverina and the member for Fowler participated in the Third Standing Committee (Democracy and Human Rights) debate on ‘How parliaments can and must promote effective ways of combating violence against women in all fields'. The IPU is known for the work that it does in relation to women parliamentarians and, as I said, we were all delighted at the member for Riverina being elected to the Coordinating Committee of Women Parliamentarians. One of the main areas of interest for this IPU conference included a topical panel discussion on HIV-AIDS, which all delegates took the opportunity to attend, which included an excellent contribution from Mr Stephen Lewis, UN Special Envoy for HIV-AIDS in Africa, who focused on the devastating impact of AIDS on children in Africa. It was a very sobering panel discussion. The meeting of the IPU also allows delegates to hold informal meetings, and we met with Mr Amir Dossal. In conclusion, may I commend my fellow delegates for their work at this IPU assembly, which is recorded in detail in the report have just tabled, and may I also place on record our thanks to those people in this parliament, in DFAT, Jeremy Kruse in particular, in the AFP, Brendan O'Hearn, our secretary, Neil Bessell, and the high commissioners and their staff at our overseas post who made our work that much easier. I commend the report to the House. (Time expired)",21
3,Mrs IRWIN,DELEGATION REPORTS,"I am pleased to follow the member for Pearce on her tabling of the report on the IPU conference held in Nairobi, Kenya, and the bilateral visit by the delegation to the Republic of South Africa. I firstly congratulate the member for Pearce on her leadership of the delegation and on the fine work she has been doing in enhancing Australia's profile within the Inter-Parliamentary Union. I congratulate my fellow delegate the member for Riverina. Congratulations, Kay, on the wonderful lobby job that you did. I also congratulate my colleague and comrade Senator Gavin Marshall. I congratulate my other colleagues on their excellent contributions to the proceedings of the IPU conference. I want to focus on what was a most important bilateral delegation to South Africa. As members would be aware, South Africa has undergone significant change in the decade since the end of apartheid. One pleasing aspect of the visit was the recognition given to Australia and the trade union movement for our support for the case to bring about the changes to the apartheid regime in South Africa. We were reminded of that on our arrival at Richards Bay, where we were greeted by about 20 people demonstrating against industrial relations laws in Australia. But in spite of our record of support in the dark days of apartheid and since, and despite the strong sporting links, there is a level of misunderstanding between the two countries. I would hope that our visit and other initiatives I will bring about a better understanding of each country's role in world affairs. South Africa has a significant trade relationship with Australia, and the delegation had the opportunity to visit the destination of our largest volume of exports at the BHP Billiton aluminium smelter at Richards Bay. South Africa imports over $600 million worth of Australian aluminium each year. In return, Australia imports motor vehicles, including BMWs and Toyota cars. Total trade between the two countries has been growing at over 10 per cent a year over the past five years. Economic growth has been rapid, with annual growth of six per cent, but unemployment remains very high, with rates of over 25 per cent. In many ways, post-apartheid South Africa has been a success. The two dark spots on the record are the alarming rates of HIVAIDS and the very high rates of violent crime. Both have the potential to impede economic growth. In the field of government, the parliament and the executive are dominated by the African National Congress. The delegation met with members of the South African Parliament, including the Deputy Speaker, the ANC Deputy Chief Whip, the Committee of Foreign Affairs Deputy Chair, the Trade and Industry Committee Chair, Douglas Gibson, the Chief Opposition Whip and other opposition members and Ms P Hollander, the Deputy Chair of the National Council of Provinces. The meetings were valuable in gaining an understanding of the South African system of government and the handling of current issues. The delegation made a visit to Robin Island, where Nelson Mandela was held for most of his 27 years of imprisonment. It was a very moving experience, as our guide had been a former political prisoner on the island himself. We also visited the Kalkfontein township on the outskirts of Capetown. We spoke with residents of the poor but tidy township and visited a day care centre and the newly constructed school, which is also used for a health care program run by medical students from the University of Stellenbosch. We later met with students at the university campus. The delegation was greatly impressed by the program and has promised assistance on our return to Australia. In conclusion, the visit was of value to all in giving us an appreciation of the challenges facing the people of South Africa, the influence of its recent history on its outlook in the region of southern Africa and the nomic potential of the country. Can I add my thanks to Phillip Green, Australia's High Commissioner, and his excellent staff for their assistance and company on the visit. Can I also thank Neil Bessel his tireless assistance to this delegation to many over the past years. NA National Capital and External Territories Committee",22
4,Mr CAUSLEY,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories, I present the committee's report entitled rent and future governance arrangements for the Indian Ocean Territories. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.",23
5,Mr CAUSLEY,COMMITTEES,"It is a pleasure to present the above mentioned report and speak on it in the House this afternoon. I note that the honourable member for Lingiari will speak as well. He attended the meetings we had with the territories, and it is his electorate, so I am sure he will be very interested in the arrangements. The report is part of a program of inquiries that the committee has undertaken in recent years with regard to governance and related issues in Australia's external territories. In this report, we have turned our attention to pressing issues of governance and accountability confronting the Indian Ocean Territories of Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. I am pleased to advise the House that this is a unanimous report, making 13 recommendations. The evidence presented to the committee us during our inquiry drew us to several conclusions. Firstly, there needs to be greater accountability and transparency in decision making by government in relation to the Ineco- dian Ocean Territories. Seemingly trivial decisions taken from a great distance in Canberra can have a disproportionately large impact upon these small and isolated communities. The people in those territories need for to know why decisions which affect their and future are being taken, how those decisions are being made, and how problems will be redressed. Moreover, they need to know that their voices will be heard by governments and departments in Perth and Canberra. There also needs to be greater consultation Report between government, departments and residents in the Indian Ocean Territories. The level and quality of consultation currently depends on interpersonal relationships beCurtween islanders and departmental staff. The committee has received evidence that those relationships have not always been effective in promoting good communications between community and government. There needs to be a formal consultation process put in place, mandated by legislation, to bring community and government together for their mutual benefit. This is especially true of the processes surrounding the application of Western Australian laws in the Indian Ocean Territories and the implementation of service delivery arrangements. The report also makes a number of recommendations in regard to specific economic issues. The committee has recommended that in future all Commonwealth land released for private development on Christmas Island should be sold at market rates. This is to prevent releases of free from undermining the property market. The committee has also called for an investigation of the cost of sea freight to and from territories and the abolition of customs and quarantine charges on freight travelling between the territories and the mainland. It is hoped that this will remove imposts on economic activity. The committee has called for increases in the number of flights between the territories and the mainland, and the opening of international routes, to promote tourism and increase economic activity. Perhaps most significantly, the committee has recommended that the government review its decision to block the licensing of the Christmas Island casino with a view to reissuing the licence. The committee's report also addresses wider issues of governance. The options canvassed include maintaining current governance arrangements with some refinement, incorporation of the Indian Ocean Territories into Western Australia and some form of limited self-government. The committee has not shown a preference for any of these options. Rather, it has taken the view that the virtues and drawbacks of all should be considered by the Australian government in conjunction with the community of the Indian Ocean Territories and that the community should be given the chance to make an informed decision on its own behalf as to how the Indian Ocean Territories should be governed in the future. Whatever alterations to the system of governance ultimately result from this inquiry, however, they should be the result of a realistic appreciation of what can be achieved. I would like to express, on behalf of the committee, our gratitude to all those who participated in the inquiry and to the staff of the secretariat. I have great pleasure in commending the report to the House.",23
6,Mr SNOWDON,COMMITTEES,"I land thank the member for Page for his presentation and also for presenting the report of the Joint Standing Committee on the National the Capital and External Territories to the chamber. I thank the secretariat, as the member for Page has done, for the way in which it helped us to carry out this inquiry. I want to particularly commend the other members of the committee. We were able to reach a unanimous position on the report and its recommendations and I commend members of the committee for the bipartisan way in which they approached this work. I especially welcome the report because the Indian Ocean Territories of Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands are part of my electorate of Lingiari. I first started working with the communities at the end of 1987. That long-term relationship has provided me with a unique opportunity to have an insight into the cultures and lifestyle of, the level of services available to and the needs of these communities. I have been able to observe the establishment and consolidation of local government in both jurisdictions. Amongst the islanders there is great interest in the issue of governance. The submissions by the shire councils on both islands and the submission by the Christmas Island Chamber of Commerce have given important insights into their views as to the Commonwealth managing the affairs of the islands through its Department of Transport and Regional Services and the service delivery agreements with Western Australian agencies. The islands clearly want a more informed and cooperative dialogue with the Commonwealth and more input into service delivery regardless of whom ultimately delivers the service. I know that this report will be read by both island communities with a great deal of interest and even, dare I say, eager anticipation. I believe the islanders will welcome the recommendations as they provide a basis on which to move forward by addressing the root causes of many of the islanders' frustrations. Most importantly, as the member for Page has indicated, there needs to be greater accountability and transparency in decision making by government in relation to the Indian Ocean Territories. At the public hearings on both Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, the message was given to the committee loud and clear that the communities want to be involved in decision making and want to work toward greater autonomy as their experience and capacity for control and responsibility increases. The communities want to work with the Commonwealth in a constructive way to achieve this greater autonomy in a sustainable manner. They want increasing opportunities to be involved in decision making and be responsible themselves for the direction of affairs in the Indian Ocean tories. As the member for Page has said, they do not want to see decisions taken by people in places as far away as Perth or Canberra. It should be remembered that, although the Cocos and Christmas Island communities share similar colonial histories, each has its own identity, areas of interest and levels of skills in governance. It is wrong for political and bureaucratic masters to assume, from the comfort of the Perth or Canberra offices of DOTARS, that what is good for Christmas Island will necessarily be good for Cocos and vice versa. The report highlights the dilemma of moving forward governance of the IOT as an entity while ensuring that each islander's needs are addressed and their ideas heard. Given my experience of these communities, I know that the greatest continuous frustration that the islanders have-and they have had this since I have been involved with them-is their incapacity to be able to influence the decisions that are taken for them or on their behalf and the things that are done to them, not with them. It is about time we recognised, as this report does, the frustrations that they have experienced and the need for government to take a far more involved approach. I also want to make particular reference to an example of that. It concerns the recommendation by the committee: ... that the Australian Government review the decision to block the licensing of a casino on Christmas Island, in consultation with the Christmas Island community, with a view to reissuing a casino licence, at the earliest opportunity. While we do not have time to canvass all the areas involved in this particular issue, it is clear that the decision by the government to pre-emptively prevent any application for a casino licence on that island has cost the island community millions of dollars in inTerricome and certainly hundreds of jobs. The decision was very short sighted, politically expedient and inappropriate, and the government should review it. Economics, Finance and Public Administration Committee",24
7,Mr BAIRD,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration, I present with pleasure the committee's report entitled Improving the superannuation savings of people under 40, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.",26
8,Mr BAIRD,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I particularly commend the efforts of members of the committee in looking at this issue. I commend them for the very hard work that they provided and their skill in writing the various papers for the committee. By 2042 Australia's population is projected to comprise significantly more people aged over 60. This will coincide with the retirement of the majority of Australians currently aged under 40. Given the high costs associated with an ageing population, it is vital that the future tirement income needs of this age group be considered now. Australians under 40 will be the first to benefit from a fully mature annuation guarantee system spanning most of their working lives. The SG was introduced in 1992 and was fully phased in by 2001 to its current rate of nine per cent. It was designed to jointly reduce the future fiscal burden of providing age pensions to a growing ageing population and to enable more people to fund their retirement at a standard of living higher than the age pension. The inquiry into improving the superannuation savings of people under age 40 has enabled the exploration of many issues, including whether a superannuation savings gap exists in this age group; the fundamentals of Australia's retirement income system; whether the superannuation regulatory framework requires change; superannuation Report literacy; incentives; and system improvements. The inquiry found that, unlike previous generations, the under-40s age group believe in the concept of self-funded retirement and accept their compulsory contribution to a superannuation funded retirement. However, the lifestyle expected in retirement by many under 40s far exceeds that which could be funded from SG savings alone. At their current rate of contributions, most under 40s would not meet their retirement income expectations without the aid of a part-pension or additional funding from other sources. Additional voluntary savings would be required to bridge this ‘expectations gap'. The inquiry considered three major aspects of the superannuation regime: preservation, the adequacy of the compulsory superannuation system, and the earnings threshold to qualify for access to the compulsory system. The underlying principle of resuperannuation is that contributions may not be accessed until a certain age or event. This principle of preservation allows incremental supersavings to compound over time. The committee found that preservation of superannuation should not be eroded by schemes allowing early access to superannuation. Additionally, superannuation taxation concessions are provided by government to encourage savings for retirement purposes only, not for pre-retirement expenditure. The adequacy of the SG rate, now set at nine per cent, was found to depend largely on whether the compulsory system is intended to provide self-sufficiency in retirement. Australia's retirement income system is based on three pillars: the age pension, the SG, and other personal contributions to retirement savings. Given this framework, the goal of self-sufficiency in retirement is ultimately the goal of the individual. In addition, increased superannuation savings will reduce future government spending. To bridge some of the ‘expectations gap', the committee recommended that when a new employee commences work they are automatically placed in a ‘voluntary' contribution arrangement, which they could chose to opt out of at any time. This contribution scheme would initially be set at three per cent. Overseas experience in similar schemes has shown people are inclined to inertia and do not opt out. The ability to accumulate superannuation depends on an individual maintaining ongoing, full-time employment over a working life, in a position earning above the SG threshold-currently $450 a month. A person earning less than the monthly threshold is not legislatively entitled to the SG. The committee believes retaining the threshold at its rent rate of $450 or lower will ensure, over an extended period of time, that more multiple-casual job employees will gain superannuation coverage with negligible impact on business compliance costs. The report identified that there is a need to better inform and educate Australians about superannuation. Self-employed women and multiple casual job workers were found to be particularly disadvantaged in their ability to accrue superannuation. The committee addressed that in the report as well. The inquiry revealed that a fully mature SG system will be enjoyed by most under 40s for their full working life. I commend the report to the House. (Time expired)",26
9,Dr EMERSON,COMMITTEES,"Rankin) (12.55 pm)The genesis of the Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration inquiry into improving the superannuation savings of people under 40 was a concern that superannuation is not considered an attractive option by Australians under the age of 40. There was also a concern that, while there is a compulsory component for superannuation, where there is discretion, under 40s tended to prefer either to spend their money on consumption or to put it into other savings vehicles. The committee therefore had a look at the idea-which has been floated on many occasions-of allowing some of the superannuation savings to be used as a deposit on a home or on alternatives such as learning accounts and so on. But the committee came to the conclusion-and one that I strongly support-that superannuation is a savings vehicle designed for retirement, and to access those superannuation funds before retirement would effectively defeat the purpose of superannuation. The committee very wisely found that the preservation of superannuation should not be eroded by schemes that allow curearly access to superannuation. It also noted that superannuation tax concessions are very large. They are provided by government to encourage savings only for retirement income purposes, not for expenditure either on consumption or savings in other forms before retirement. The second major issue was the adequacy of the superannuation guarantee rate of nine per cent. The committee found that the question as to whether it was adequate to provide a reasonable income after retirement depended in part on whether you formed the view that superannuation should be the only post-retirement income or whether there could also be access to the age pension. We agreed that there could be access to the age pension, but one of the real problems about the adequacy of nine per cent is that it requires people to start with the nine per cent when they first start working and to work continuously throughout their working lives. If that did not happen then there were real problems with adequacy. We were then looking at what possibilities might be available to boost contributions above that nine per cent so that we could achieve adequacy. That is where we came up with quite a novel scheme: when new employees commence work, they are automatically placed in a voluntary arrangement where they can choose to opt out at any time. It would not be compulsory, but we recognise that most people, through inertia, would say: ‘I'm in the scheme. I won't bother filling out the paperwork to opt out, even though I have a right to opt out.' We felt that that might increase the superannuation contributions and, therefore, the adequacy of retirement incomes. We had a long debate about the threshold at which the superannuation guarantee applies. It is currently $450 per month. We received representation from some employers that that should be lifted. We believe that it should, at the very least, stay at $450 a month or be lowered. I thank the coalition members of the committee for agreeing not to entertain the idea of lifting that. People who have a lot of casual jobs might not earn $450 a month and therefore would miss out on their superannuation contributions from employers-which were, as one committee member pointed out, in lieu of a wage rise. That is how it came about. Good on the committee members for agreeing not to increase it but perhaps even to reduce it. The most vulnerable in terms of adequacy are women and multiple casual job workers. We came up with a number of recommendations to improve adequacy for women, including relaxing the current co-contribution arrangements a little, and a suggestion that paid maternity leave also be subject to the superannuation guarantee. After all, again, that is in lieu of wages and, ordinarily, are earning those wages you would attract the superannuation guarantee. I also think the maternity payment should be subject to the superannuation guarantee. Can I finish by saying this report was prepared in a spirit of bipartisanship. I pay tribute to each and every committee member for achieving a very good outcome.",27

13,Mr GEORGIOU,COMMITTEES,"Kooyong) (1.01 pm)On behalf of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Science and Innovation, I am pleased to present the committee's report entitled Pathways to technological innovation, together with the minutes of the proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.",28
14,Mr GEORGIOU,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The findings of the committee reflect the complexity of measuring innovation success and the multitude of pathways that innovation may if you take. The committee found that many successful innovators experienced a smooth pathway to developing their product and finding markets. These are the success stories and it was heartening to see the calibre of Australian innovation and the strength of the government's innovation support framework. However, this is not the total story. It was apparent that, while some pathways to innovation are well developed and relatively unimpeded for the Australian entrepreneur or innovating business or research organisation, other pathways are less well formed and a number of adjustments to the innovation support framework are possible. The report makes 18 recommendations to target these adjustments and to facilitate the pathways that are less well formed or less well supported, and I will touch on some of them. The recommendations address the need to better promote the assistance that is available from the Australian government and ensure that cross-portfolio cooperation is working effectively and providing a more seamless service to researchers and innovators. The recommendations also address impediments to innovation and to the commercialisation of innovation in publicly funded research institutes. The committee made recommendations to increase staff mobility across universities, research agencies and businesses so that barriers to collaboration can be addressed and innovative researchers can be better recognised and rewarded. A key recommendation concerns the establishment of a funded proof of concept scheme for university research projects. This proposed scheme would provide three to one matched Australian government and university funding to stimulate innovation with high potential for commercial outcomes. At this early stage of innovation, there is limited access to angel investment. Lead times and risks make it prohibitive for universities to bear the whole cost. By sharing the risk through a matched funded proof of concept scheme, we can ensure that our good ideas, our scientific breakthroughs and our innovative approaches have greater opportunities to be tested and their feasibility for the marketplace determined. The inquiry identified the need for government to provide more support for businesses to engage in later stage commercialisation activities, such as market identification. The committee recommended more transparency in reporting on government procurement strategies to boost the government procurement of technological innovation from Australian SMEs. Another important area of concern for Australian businesses and researchers was protection of intellectual property and the proper working of the intellectual property system. The committee advanced a number of recommendations in this area. Fostering a culture of entrepreneurship is a critical step to early innovation and pathways. It is a task that is challenging to government. Formulating a program by which government might foster such a cultural shift and engender a more entrepreneurial culture requires the expertise of educators and a more facile tongue than mine is occasionally. Accordingly, the government has recommended that a whole-ofgovernment task force be established to investigate a suite of appropriate policy and program measures to foster a national culture of entrepreneurship. Today, innovation is recognised as the multitude of pathways that encompass all types of basic research, new technologies and improvements in business. Through implementation of the recommendations of this report, the committee anticipates that some pathways to innovation will be made easier, thereby strengthening Australia's growth and global competitiveness. In conclusion, I would like to thank the many individuals, businesses and organisations who provided evidence to this inquiry. I would like to thank the committee secretariat, in particular Dr Alison Clegg and Dr Anna Dacre, for their work on the report. Members of the committee demonstrated considerable commitment to working together in a non-partisan fashion. I commend the report to the House. (Time expired)",28
15,Mr HAYES,COMMITTEES,"I very much support the presentation of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Science and Innovation report Pathways to technological innovation. In the report the committee has attempted to drill down into the underlying issues affecting innovationin particular, the make-up of an environment conducive to innovation, the culture of support, the development of new ideas in this country and any impediments. The inquiry looked for ways to assist the strengthening our pathways to make it easier to commercialise innovation. I was very happy to be part of this inquiry. There was very much a genuine and positive effort made by all members, culminating in the unanimous report that the member for Kooyong has just presented to the House. The inquiry received over 100 submissions and conducted 10 public hearings, receiving evidence from witnesses from industry, technology development, innovation and academia. I congratulate the member for Kooyong. Once more he has demonstrated himself as being a very fair and inclusive committee chair, and I am very proud to be part of the committee. I am speaking today in part on behalf of the member for Franklin, Harry Quick, who is the deputy chair of the committee but who, unfortunately, has taken very ill and has not yet returned to the parliament. This inquiry received the total cooperation of all members, who participated very fully with a dedication to the cause. It would be remiss of me if I did not join the chair in commending the efforts of the committee secretary, Dr Anna Dacre, and her team, consisting of Dr Alison Clegg, Lea Hill, Rachelle Mitchell, Emma Martin and Daniel Miletic. Their dedication, professionalism and good humour was very much appreciated by the committee members. I will comment further on the report in the Main Committee later today, but at this stage it is worthwhile mentioning that this report attempts to identify not only the need to develop an entrepreneurial culture in Australia but also the ways that can occur and the impediments that need to be addressed so those ideas can be developed. Innovation is the development of ideas and technology transfers through to the actual process of commercialisation. Therefore, innovation must of be considered a natural development, not simply a lucky strike, if I could use that expression.",30

20,Mr KATTER,TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION,"Kennedy) (1.10 pm)This bill is exactly the same bill that was drawn up by the government. I emphasise to government members that we are talking about exactly the same document with the exception that, as did the Senate, we have deleted those clauses that made it easier for takeovers to occur in this country. I will say a few words on that in due course. The bill seeks to do what the government has failed to do, which is support the family businesses of Australia. It also seeks to avoid the very thing to which this government has succumbed by being held prisoner by those at the big end of town. The present government, and the previous Hawke-Keating governments, have demonstrated through every one of their legislative and administrative initiatives as their responsibility to impair and undermine the ability of small family businesses to bargain with big business. My parents owned small businesses in North and western Queensland. My cousin just held a reunion for my family's old department store in Charters Towers, where 200 former employees attended the celebrations, 25 years after the business was forced to close its doors to make way for the big corporate chains. I am in a position to see when it comes to small business how the government is long on rhetoric but short on action. Let me give one classic example. The Fraser-Anthony government-a much maligned government, but the history books will be very kind to this government-introduced, amongst many other pieces of legislation, legislation restricting oil company ownership of petrol outlets throughout Australia to only 425. Whilst there were some 15,000 or 16,000 service station operators and outlets at the time, entities were restricted to owning only 400. I doubt whether there would be 400 now that are not directly or indirectly owned and controlled by the oil companies. That shows the difference between the Fraser-Anthony government and the HawkeKeating and current coalition governments and the way owner operated business and the competitive marketplace are treated. People on this side and that side of the House preach to us about competition-wonderful! We moved from having some 15,000 or 16,000 privately owned petrol station owners and outlets throughout Australia to now having virtually none. As far as finding ethanol outlets is concerned, we are flat out finding 200 independent operators left in this country. I am in a position to see how the government is long on rhetoric but short on action when it comes to protecting small business from the predatory, untrammelled rapaciousness-to use the words of Hilaire Belloc-of that they see it big business. Let me remind members of the history of this issue. Last year this House passed legislation to amend the Trade Practices Act. One of the provisions of that legislation made it easier for small businesses to combine and negotiate with big business. This provision is of importance to people ranging from sugar farmers to panel beaters to tow truck operators to newsagents to IGA store owners to pharmacists to petrol retailers-to name but a few. This legislation will not, I must emphasize, make any qualitative change and will admittedly make only a very small quantitative change. The initiators, the inventors, the real entrepreneurial class in this country, may get some slight glimmer of hope. However, they might, somewhere in the future, see the re-creation of Australia as a land of opportunity, hope and excitement. It is very sad when people sing ‘wealth for toil' in our national anthem and they burst out laughing. It really would be a joke to say that we have wealth for toil in this country. Instead, we have a land of predatory, mindless machine economic cannibals manned by the most intellectually barren, petty minded and selfinterested people in our society. This is economic rationalism. Another provision changed the rules for approving mergers, making mergers even easier than they are currently.

22,Mrs HULL,SNOWY HYDRO CORPORATISATION,"Three weeks ago I gave notice that I would present the Snowy Hydro Corporatisation Amendment Bill 2006, purely in desperation, to try to protect the assets of Australians due to New South Wales, Victorian and Commonwealth governments forecasting the sale of their holdings of Snowy Hydro Ltd. I now congratulate the people of Australia on convincing the Prime Minister that the New South Wales and Victorian Labor governments' decision to sell the Snowy Hydro Ltd was arrogant, ill-informed and flawed. It is for this reason that I am continuing with this private member's bill, even though the Snowy Hydro Scheme sale has been withdrawn. I believe that there is a desperate need for this legislation to be in place, regardless of the fact that the sale will no longer proceed. There is no such provision in the act currently. I believe that this must be in legislation. It is clearly common sense to put a safety net into legislation in the event that, if this issue is raised in the future and legislation is put through the houses of parliament, and the Australian people are not aware of it, there at least will be some protection with ownership capped at 10 per cent and a total of 35 per cent foreign ownership. I repeat: I oppose the sale of Snowy Hydro Ltd. I oppose it now. I will oppose it forever into the future-no deal, now way, not now, not ever. I would like to go even further and have the Snowy Hydro Scheme listed on our national heritage register to ensure that no New South Wales and Victorian strong and majority shareholding governments can in future go forward and take the Snowy Hydro Ltd to a sale at any stage. I will continue to put my efforts into this additional action. However, I still think that the bill that I have presented today is a very sensible piece of legislation to put in place. Whilst we are speaking of this issue, I will speak of the congratulations that I owe the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister, on hearing the thoughts and concerns of the Australian people, decided to withdraw the Comthe monwealth's 13 per cent ownership from the sale that it had agreed to with New South Wales and Victorian Labor government premiers. I commend the Prime Minister on his ability to read the people and to recognise that this was not in their interests, nor were the Australian people accepting of this sale. It was interesting to see the leadership shown by the Prime Minister, which I believe was true leadership in the face of adversity and in the face of people then questioning the Prime Minister on backflipping. It was interesting to see how the Premier of the New South Wales Labor government, Premier Iemma, immediately withdrew the New South Wales government holding from the sale, then followed very closely thereafter by the Victorian government, Premier Bracks. This was entirely because the New South Wales Premier, who has never been to an election by the people as Premier, clearly was not prepared to go to an election in New South Wales on a platform of the sale of the Snowy Hydro Scheme without the Commonwealth to fall back on, to blame. It is clear that the leadership shown by the Prime Minister was not demonstrated by Premier Iemma nor Premier Bracks and that they were not prepared to do this up front and put it to the people. My concern is that again they will try this. (Time expired) Bill read a first time.",32
23,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,SNOWY HYDRO CORPORATISATION,"In accordance with standing order 41, the second reading will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS Law and Cultural Practices",33
24,Mr KEENAN,SNOWY HYDRO CORPORATISATION,"I move: That this House reaffirms that: (1) every Australian is entitled to the full protecto tion of Australian law; (2) cultural practices in any community do not lessen that protection; and (3) human rights override cultural rights. My seat of Stirling is a fantastic reflection of the Australian way in that it is the most culturally diverse seat in Western Australia. Every major immigrant population is represented, from the early migrants of the post World War II era from northern and southern Europe through to the later arrivals from Vietnam and China and now the newest arrivals from Africa and the Middle East who are benefiting from Australia's generous humanitarian program-a program that is unrivalled across the globe in its generosity. All of the world's major religions have places of worship in Stirling, from those of the various Christian faiths to Sunni and Shiah mosques, Hindu and Buddhist temples and a Jewish synagogue. I enjoy attending the frequent citizenship ceremonies that are held by the City of Stirling, where a glance across the crowd gives you a very good indication that Australia's newest citizens are coming from every corner of the globe. I appreciate this diversity and I believe it is one of our nation's greatest strengths. It enhances the country economically, socially and culturally. One of the things I make clear when I address the new citizens at those citizenship ceremonies is that, from that night, they will share exactly the same rights and responsibilities as every other Australian citizen. We do not have differing levels of citizenship in this country: the newest Australian citizen, who meets the criteria to take out citizenship and does so, is no more or less a citizen than someone who was born here and whose family goes back generations. But this practice, where all Australians are equal before the law and are entitled equally its protection, is being diminished by the practice of taking cultural rights into account within our legal framework. There has been an insidious infiltration of the idea that a person's cultural background can be used as an excuse to mitigate particular criminal actions. This is nowhere more evident than in the treatment of Aboriginal Australians. It seems that in the minds of some the protection of Australian law does not equally apply to everyone. There is no more disturbing example of where this can lead than the completely inadequate sentence handed down to an Aboriginal man in the Northern Territory who was convicted of physically and sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl who had been promised to him as his bride. The judge, taking into account cultural practice, sentenced the man to a mere four months in jail. This judge later admitted that he was wrong, and I do not wish to personalise this particular motion as being against him, but I read in the media reports of this incident that he had children of a similar age and I doubt that he would consider that to be an appropriate sentence if it were one of them who had been so viciously assaulted. I understand the difficulties that arise when traditional Aboriginal culture collides with Western society, but we absolutely must not accept that practices that injure or harm young people are any more acceptable in the Aboriginal culture than they would be in our own. For us to do that would be to say that a 14-year-old Aboriginal girl is not entitled to the same protection of Australian law as we would expect for the children of any one of us in this place. We would completely shame ourselves if we were to do that. One of the reasons behind our system of justice is that it deters people from committing crimes. Lenient sentencing that is prepared to take into account cultural factors therefore sends a signal that the protection available to members of that community is not the same as the protection that is offered to others. If our legal system sends that signal that it is prepared to judge people based on their background, then the message will obviously be received that these crimes are somehow less horrifying. This practice is not just restricted to Aboriginal communities. In recent trials in New South Wales for vicious gang rapes, counsel for the defence argued that the rapists' backgrounds lessened their responsibility for committing these crimes. We cannot have a two-speed legal system in Australia without saying that the protection that that system offers is lessened because of somebody's background. It is a straightforward principle that I have heard affirmed by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights that human rights trump cultural rights, and it is a straightforward principle that we in this parliament need to strongly say that we support today. We must say very strongly that all Australians are entitled to the complete protection of Australian law. (Time expired)",33
25,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,SNOWY HYDRO CORPORATISATION,Is the motion seconded? Mr Ciobo-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,34
26,Mr GARRETT,SNOWY HYDRO CORPORATISATION,"No-one in this House condones violence and everybody in this House would say clearly that under our legal system lawyers will plead and judges and juries will rule. But, hearing the member for Stirling speak to the motion, I am still not quite sure why this motion has been brought into the House. That the House reaffirms ‘that every Australian is entitled to the full protection of the law' is unexceptional. Indeed, who could disagree? That is why I invite the member to consider that the Senate last week voted to hold an inquiry into the practice of state and territory governments withholding the wages of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander workers-and I am assuming the member includes those actions within the contemplation of this motion. Is the member referring to the provision of sufficient police resources in communities that are under stressMr Keenan-Yes, absolutely.",34
27,Mr GARRETT,SNOWY HYDRO CORPORATISATION,"and that experience above average levels of criminal activity that requires policing? I hear the member say yes. In that case, good. To that extent, citizens of, for example, Wadeye have the right to levels of policing comparable with those of any other community-something that has been conspicuously absent over the entire period of the Northern Territory's CLP government and also, regrettably, up until today. The motion also calls on the House to affirm that ‘cultural practice in any community does not lessen that protection'. Where is the evidence that it does any such thing? I refer the member to the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory case of the Queen v James Goutjawuy Gondarra to enable the member to get some first-hand knowledge of how cultural practice can increase and not lessen that protection. In that case the accused was additionally subject to the cultural law processes and practices of his elders and, as a consequence of that, showed remorse and prospective signs of rehabilitation. It is in these cases that cultural practice is a boon and an additional benefit to the legal system, not a deficiency. I think there has been some confusion over how the law actually operates, and I invite the member for Stirling to contemplate that there is really no such thing as a customary law defence, as has been bandied about recently and which has so energised those whose perceptions have controlled their capacity to reason. I remind the member that the question concerning cultural observation in any case before our courts relates to mitigating circumstances, which in the case of an assault could include provocation, the mental state of the accused and elements of a cultural nature. There is no cultural context, for example, that sanctions child abuse. That fact has been made eminently clear by Aboriginal leaders, men and women across the country in recent times. The final part of this motion reads that this House reaffirms that ‘human rights override cultural rights'. This is a confusing wording. Did the member advance any instance of cultural rights overriding human rights? Is the member proposing that we should have some form of recognition of human rights in our Constitution-I would be pleased to hear that from a government member oppositeor that we would enact migration laws which specifically upheld human rights as enumerated in the international declaration of human rights and associated instruments? If that is the intent of the member's motion, then bring it on. Human rights include the right to practise culture. If the member is concerned at the recent terrible stories of assault in Indigenous communities-as I and many others are, and as the people living in those communities are-then he should reflect on what it is that has brought us to this current state. Speaker after speaker at a forum today in the parliament, entitled ‘Ending violence in Indigenous communities', made the point time and time again that it is rights and culture that need to be strong. Petrol sniffing, youth suicide and child abuse are products of recent history, symptoms of a bigger problem. They in no way represent Indigenous culture, any more than dropping millions of litres of napalm on Cambodian villagers in the Vietnam War represented Western culture. These actions represent cultural breakdown, and members are confused if they believe the situation can be better comprehended and responded to by lodging motions of this kind in this House.",34
28,Mr CIOBO,SNOWY HYDRO CORPORATISATION,"I am pleased to rise to second the motion of the member for Stirling: That this House reaffirms that: (1) every Australian is entitled to the full protection of Australian law; (2) cultural practices in any community do not lessen that protection; and (3) human rights override cultural rights. Being a liberal democracy, Australia is founded on one fundamental keystone. That keystone is that all Australians are equal before the law, irrespective. And that message is one that has been at the centre of Australian democracy for well over 100 years. Of concern to both me as the member for Moncrieff and the member for Stirling has been recent practice, although not reflected on statute books and although perhaps not incorporated into Commonwealth precedent-though increasingly that would appear to be the case-whereby cultural diversity is increasingly used as a mitigating factor with respect to criminal activity. Despite comments by the member for Kingsford Smith that, in some instances, cultural relativity is factor that imposes a harsher penalty, we as a parliament are not in the business of creating laws that are based upon some kind of quantification of whether or not cultural relativity makes an offender more or less likely to be punished in a particular way. All parliaments in this country must hold true one central tenet: that all Australians are equal before the law, irrespective-full stop. Cultural relativities do not hold a place in modern Australia. It is simply unacceptable that Aboriginal Australians have been subject to the most heinous sexual abuse and crimes for which perpetrators are sentenced to four months. It is unacceptable that there have been Australian women subjected to criminal activity because in some way it is implied that cultural factors are an influencing factor in whether or not they are subject to particular abuse or, for example, rape. It is unacceptable, and we all, as Australians, must draw a line in the sand and say value diversity does not have a home in Australia. A key part of Australia's background has been this unification of all people irrespective of cultural background, where there is not value diversity. Problems arise, however, when value diversity is thrust forward as some kind of enlightened diversification between cultures and as something that must be embraced and incorporated into modern Australian society if we are truly going to be a kind of showcase to the world of how multiculturalism works. Multiculturalism is certainly not predicated upon value diversity. Alain Finkielkraut in his work, The Undoing of Thought, said: Is there a culture where there is corporal punishment for delinquency ... where female circumcision is practised, where mixed marriages are forbidden and polygamy authorised? Multiculturalism requires that we respect all these practices ... In a world which has lost its transcendental significance, cultural identity serves to sanction a those barbarous traditions which God is no longer in a position to endorse. Fanaticism is indefensible when it appeals to heaven, but beyond reproach when it is grounded in antiquity and cultural distinctiveness. I do not agree with the thrust of all of his remarks, but I certainly agree with the central tenet that antiquity and cultural distinctiveness are not grounds for saying that we are a more enlightened society. It is not a ground for saying to the Australian people that we will accept past practices, be they Indigenous Australian past practices or religious past practices such as female genital mutilation, for example. All of these are in breach of fundamental human rightshuman rights which, in a liberal democracy, ensure that the individual and not the state is the supreme being when it comes to society. What we witness in Australia is an erosion where individuals in certain communitiesand the member for Kingsford Smith touched on this with respect to Wadeye-feel the loss of that protection of the rule of law and the consequence is an erosion of society itself. It is unacceptable, and I commend this motion to the House. (Time expired)",35
29,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,SNOWY HYDRO CORPORATISATION,"Let us be clear: this is not a debate about politics and the rule of law; this is a debate about wedge politics. It is also a clear endeavour by backbenchers in the Howard government to demonise Aboriginal communities and their leadership. I think it is time for all members of this House to recognise the serious problems which confront Aboriginal communities, particularly given the cases of abuse that have been highlighted in recent months. I think it is about time some people stop kidding that we all should not be shocked by what is occurring in Aboriginal communities because of the neglect by the Howard government over the last 10 years. Let us remember that crimes occur across all sections of the Australian community, whether they are white or black. Let us also remember there is no equality before the law because it relates to your ability to hire counsel at great cost to be properly represented before the courts in Australia. It is time the Howard government stopped pointing the finger. Members of this House need to be reminded that the state of Aboriginal communities is because of neglect by the Howard government over the last 10 years. Let us think about neglect of health, neglect of education, neglect of training and neglect in housing. Think about the problems in Wadeye where there is an average of 20 people per house. The Howard government has failed to put money into improving housing in the Wadeye community. That is the cause of concern in the black community and that is what we ought to be debating todaysolutions to real problems on the ground. But you are not interested in solutions to real problems. You are not interested in the litany of facts that show the failures of the Howard government.",36
30,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,SNOWY HYDRO CORPORATISATION,The member will address his comments through the chair and call members by their title.,37
31,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,SNOWY HYDRO CORPORATISATION,"Let us start with health. According to the Australian Medical Association, in 1999-2000 the life expectancy of Indigenous men was 56.3 years, as opposed to 77 years for nonIndigenous men. For women, the difference was 62.8 years, as opposed to 82.4 years. This means effectively that non-Indigenous men have a life expectancy of between 45 per cent and 50 per cent greater than Indigenous men. Let us talk about chronic disease amongst Indigenous Australians. Mr Keenan interjecting",37

33,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,SNOWY HYDRO CORPORATISATION,"Let us go to a report by the Centre for Remote Health-a joint venture between Flinders University and Charles Darwin University.

34,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,SNOWY HYDRO CORPORATISATION,The member for Stirling is warned!,37
35,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,SNOWY HYDRO CORPORATISATION,"diabetes; high blood pressure and hypertension; heart attack and related heart diseases; and chronic obstructive airways diseases such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis. What is the Howard government doing about something of general benefit to Aboriginal people and their communities? Let us go to the issue of people with diabetes. In remote localities there are likely to be twice as many as in other localities. Let us go to the issue of education, which the backbench members did not want to touch on today. Young Indigenous students are twice as likely as non-Indigenous students to have left school before completing year 10 and are half as likely to complete year 12. Indigenous Australians are less than a quarter as likely as non-Indigenous Australians to go to university. Moreover, the number of Indigenous students attending university has declined since 1999. For the first time since the 1990s, there has been a decline in the number of Indigenous students in vocational education at a time when we have an absolute shortage of tradespeople in Australia. Where does the Indigenous community live? In remote Australia, where we need tradespeople to assist with the development of the mining industry, the agricultural industry and the tourism industry. Let us talk about the real criminals in tralia-those in government who failed to do something about assisting our Indigenous community. I simply say: let us have a debate about the root causes of crime. That is not what this debate is about. Legal responses do not address the reasons behind addictions that can fuel this kind of abuse. The Howard government is failing to recognise that the neglect of Aboriginal communities is creating a pool of young, unemployed, drug dependent men turning to crime-in some cases, horrific crimes. Put resources into solving problems at the source of the problem. If we invest in the communities, invest in health, invest in housing, invest in education and create some real employment in the communities, then we will reduce the crime rates. The crime rates, interestingly, are not that different in some of the suburbs in the electorates we represent where we have the same problems-no educational opportunities and no employment opportunities. Stop running away from the problem(Time expired)",37
36,Mrs MIRABELLA,SNOWY HYDRO CORPORATISATION,"I rise to support the motion moved by the member for Stirling, which was very ably supported by the member for Moncrieff. The member for Batman talks about wedge politics. The reality is that I know that the member for Batman, in his heart of hearts, is a decent man. He knows more than many in the Labor Party that there are social problems out there and that there are problems because we have failed to accept that there is one law for all Australians. But it is the lunatics in his own party who prevent him, a decent member of parliament, a decent man of decent Labor stock, from addressing the real problems. He knows that those latte sipping, middle-class members who have never got their fingers dirty working as traditional Labor members have in the past do not really understand these problems and he knows Austhey are the ones preventing his party from truly removing the dregs of the middle class that represent the members opposite, as Kim Beazley Sr said. Let us get back to the cream of the working class, Member for Batman. The first point of the member's motion is very clear and emphatic. It is about endorsing the rule of law in Australia. The crowning sentiment of Federation was one people and one destiny-a noble and fine sentiment. A century on, we remain one of a handful of nations in the world where the flame of democracy has burned continuously and continues to burn brightly. The member for Stirling has suggested that cultural practices do not lessen an individual's right to protection under Australian law. It is very hard for the cultural dieticians to accept this, but giving all cultural practices a green light is code for giving the go-ahead for the excesses of customary law. For some in Indigenous Australia, this means the sanctioned rape of women and young children. In some sections of the Islamic community, it means a degraded contempt for women, even perhaps the sanctioning of such barbaric acts as female genital mutilation. The horrendous case of the 55-year-old Aboriginal elder who bashed and raped a 14year-old girl because Indigenous customary law stated that she was his promised wife is and has been at the forefront of this debate in recent times. When the elder received one month's jail for this offence, the Northern Territory Chief Justice, Brian Martin, who handed down the original sentence, admitted that judges and magistrates do get it wrong sometimes and that is what appeal courts are for. That is cold comfort for the 14-year-old girl in question, and that is why members of this fine and noble institution have a right and a responsibility to debate these issues and bring them out into the open. We should not leave it to the timidity of judges who are afraid of being accused of being racist because they uphold one law for all Australians. The left-leaning intelligentsia do not want to talk about these aspects of the debate; they find them rather confronting.",38

In the Senate shortly will be presented some 12,000 signatures on petitions, which I have here with me. They have been collected in the local parishes of Chrisval-a tian churches over the last weekend and the weekend before. More are still flowing in and added to that is 32,000 signatures that came from the ‘GetUp!' petition. There is a very simple message that tens of thousands of Australians are sending to this parliament. They want the immigration laws of Australia to be determined by members of this parliament and not under pressure from anywhere else. There is one concession that mattersand I recognise that many people on the other side of the chamber are involved in negotiating for concessions at the moment. Everybody who has signed these petitions wants one concession and one concession alone and that is for the bill to be stopped. Just as the Senate inquiry unanimously recommended, there is one way you can deliver on the decency that every member of this parliament believed in only 12 months ago and that is the vote which Labor will be exercising to vote no at every stage.

39,Mrs MAY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Last month I had the honour of attending and speaking at a very special service and commemorative luncheon at the Greek Orthodox Church of St Anna on the Gold Coast. It was the 30th anniversary of the construction of the Greek community centre and original Greek Orthodox Church in our city-a milestone for the Greek community who came together to pay tribute to and honour the piosit- neers of the Greek community, to acknowledge their achievements. The vision and commitment of the early pioneers of the Greek community has meant that their community has grown strongly over the past 30 years with services from child care to respite supporting these wonderful migrants. It has meant that the Gold Coast has enjoyed wonderful food, wine and Greek culture each year with the Greek festiwonderful celebration of everything Greek. Our Gold Coast Greek community has made a wonderful contribution to the rich tapestry that makes our city what it is today. During the celebrations, Mr Jim Raptis, the honorary Greek consul, was presented with the cross of St Andrew, the highest award that is given to laity by the Greek Orthodox Church in Australia, in honour of his community contributions over many years. Jim, along with his wife, Helen, has made an enormous contribution to our city. Their generosity to the community is well known and, of course, the Raptis Group has left a lasting legacy with signature buildings that line the landscape of our city. To Jim and Helen and all the Greek pioneers who have helped shape the identity of our city: I thank you on behalf or our city. Well done. Dental Health",39
40,Mrs ELLIOT,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I rise today to present more petitions in relation to the very urgent need for the Howard government to restore funding for dental health. I have 1,000 signatures here today. This is a very urgent issue, particularly electorate, where 25 per cent of the population is aged over 65 years. It is an issue people raise with me every day. In yesterday's Sunday Telegraph I saw a major article in relation to this issue. One in three people in New South Wales cannot afford dental care, with some patients waiting up to 10 years for treatment. Lengthy waiting lists have forced some patients to pull out their own teeth with pliers and repair dentures with superglue. This is an outrageous situation in this day and age and the Howard government must restore federal funding to dental care so that people can access the dental treatment they desperately need. It is in the Constitution that it is the sponsibility of the federal government. It is their responsibility and they must come to the table and provide that funding because poor dental health also affects your entire body and can lead to other ailments. Locals, who speak to me all the time about their concerns, are waiting years, are not able to eat properly, are in constant pain and are extremely embarrassed. As people are growing elderly and have a whole variety of health concerns, the care of their teeth is a major one. These petitions, and the others I have lodged, urgently call upon the Howard government to restore that federal funding. It is their responsibility and they must adhere to that straight away and make sure that funding is restored. Gold Coast Mobility Office",40
41,Mr CIOBO,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"On Friday last week I had the opportunity to visit the Gold Coast Mobility Office, which is coordinated by Judene Wallace. The Gold Coast Mobility Office plays a very important and crucial task in Gold Coast city, and that is the coordination of public transport between various private providers. It is funded under the HACC program, the Home and in my Community Care program, which is a program jointly funded by state and federal govthat ernments. The federal government contributes approximately 60 per cent of the funding and the state government approximately 40 per cent. The team at the Gold Coast Mobility Office do an outstanding job of ensuring that the elderly population of the Gold Coast have access to public transport. This is primarily delivered through a very inventive yet perhaps almost common sense approach to the delivery of this kind of public transport service. Primarily it is delivered by Judene Wallace and the team through the coordination of timetables by private operators. There reare a number of respite care providers as well as aged care facilities, each of which has private capacity in buses which they provide for the residents. The problem in the past has been that many of these private operators do not use this bus capacity, for example, for many hours of the day. So the Gold Coast Mobility Office simply coordinates the various timetables of the respite care centres as well as of the aged care facilities to provide public transport to elderly residents to help them get to hospitals, shops and other kinds of appointments, such as with doctors. I commend the service to the House. (Time expired) Mrs Ranka Cotic Mr Jim Strachan",40
42,Ms CORCORAN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I would like to pay my respects to two people in Isaacs who have recently died. The first is Ranka Cotic, who was a member of the Chelsea branch of the ALP. Ranka was 74 years old and she died a week or so ago. Ranka lost her husband, Tom, a few years ago and I do not think she ever really quite recovered from that loss. Ranka had not been able to physically contribute to Labor Party politics in recent years but she was a true, loyal and very strong supporter of the Labor Party, and all that we stand for, for many years. I offer my condolences to the Cotic family. The second person is Jim Strachan, who was a member of the Noble Park branch of the Labor Party. Jim joined the party in 1941 and I am assuming he was 14 years old, although I suspect he might have been just 13 years old, at the time. He became a life member of the party many years ago. He was a very strong and loyal supporter of the party lier. for very many years. He had not enjoyed good health for some time, but he still attended branch meetings as recently as earlier this year. I would like to pass on my condolences to Jim's wife, Pat, and to his family. Investing in Our Schools Program",41
43,Mr TICEHURST,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Dobell) (1.52 pm)The Australian government recognises the importance of providing schools with facilities that will enhance the education and well-being of students. It is very disappointing that the New South Wales government does not feel the same way. I was absolutely disgusted to learn over the weekend that the New South Wales government has charged 80 schools up to $650,000 for advice and management of maintenance projects funded by the Commonwealth government under the Investing in Our Schools program. In most cases, the schools sought federal grants after failing to secure funding from the state government for things like air conditioning, electrical upgrades and work on essential services. Narara Valley High School, in my electorate of Dobell, paid a whopping $15,675 of its $110,000 grant to the department to manage upgrades to the school's kitchen. The Australian government introduced this program to counter Labor's disregard for our local state schools, which they are primarily responsible for funding. The program is about getting more resources into our public school system, not about the state earning some extra cash on the side to the detriment of hard working local school communities. I visit many schools on many occasions, and they are all in need of quality equipment and infrastructure. I call on state Labor to put an end to this ridiculous cash grabbing that is hurting our schools and their students. It might also look at its dental responsibilities, as the member for Richmond mentioned earMake Poverty History Campaign",41

46,Mr BAIRD,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I wish to express my concern at the recent release from prison in Indonesia of Mr Abu Bakar Bashir. After receiving a very modest 30month sentence for his role in the 2002 Bali bombings, he has been freed after only 26 months, vowing to continue to fight to uphold Islamic sharia. On 12 October 2002, six people from my electorate lost their lives to terrorism. I went to a number of their funerals, and we were extremely saddened in my electorate. They were, like the 196 others who perished in the attack, going about their lives and enjoying their vacations when all was abruptly brought to an end by Jemaah Islamiah operatives. The close friends and family of those from my electorate and across Australia who lost their lives are deeply distressed and concerned about the release of the spiritual leader of Jemaah Islamiah on Wednesday of last week. Only days after Abu Bakar Bashir returned to his boarding school where he preaches and practises, he has already renewed his campaign to impose Islamic sharia law on Indonesia and has also made comments specifically about our Prime Minister. I find it very disturbing that a man who continues to pose such a real and proven threat to the citizens of Indonesia and, indeed, to our people is allowed to walk the streets. More worrying than that is the fact that Bashir is even allowed to continue to preach his ways to the children and followers in his boarding school. A man convicted of conspiracy over terrorist acts, conducted in the name of his religion, should not be allowed to preach his ways. (Time expired) Adelaide Electorate: General Practitioners",42
47,Ms KATE ELLIS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I rise today to present a further 1,086 signatures on my petition calling on the Minister for Health and Ageing to grant an exemption under section 19AB of the Health Insurance Act and allow a doctor to practise at the Nailsworth surgery in my electorate. The doctor shortage which is crippling our nation's health system is no longer confined to regional and rural Australia. It is hitting metropolitan areas, such as the one that I represent, and hitting them hard. Surgeries such as the Nailsworth surgery in my electorate are victim to the government's absurd policy of determining need based on postcodes, not on people. I and the people who have signed this petition call on the minister for health to recognise the health needs of people in my community, to grant an exemption and to provide some long-term solutions to help ease the doctor shortage. I have risen to speak on this matter on several previous occasions and I will continue to do so until the minister for health starts taking the health needs of Adelaide seriously. The petition read as followsTo the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives Assembled in Parliament. This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House, the doctor shortage affecting our community an in particular the devastating impact it is having on the Nailsworth Surgery. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to: - call on the Minister for Health to grant an exemption under Section 19AB of the Health Insurance Act (1973) - urgently consider long-term solutions to ease the pressing issue of doctor shortages in country; and - to fight for a quality, accessible health tem for all Australians from 1,086 citizens. City of Greater Geelong Council",42
48,Mr MCARTHUR,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I rise today to speak on the report into the City of Greater Geelong Council by Merv Whelan, Inspector of Municipal Administration. Mr Whelan was commissioned to investigate campaign donations received by City of Greater Geelong councillors for the November 2004 council elections. The terms of reference provided to Mr Whelan were constrained, but a number of important discoveries were made which should be recorded on the parliamentary record. A brief background to this issue is that the Labor Party in Geelong conspired to elect a number of party hacks to the council for political purposes. Labor councillor David Saunderson, who worked for the upper house Geelong Labor MP John Eren, collected moneys from respected businessmen to allocate to various council candidates. The majority of these candidates were unknown to the donors. Mr Whelan has recommended that David Saunderson be prosecuted for failing to disclose campaign donations in excess of $500. Councillor Peter MCMullin, the current Mayor of Geelong City, originally denied receiving campaign donations. Councillor MCMullin, who was the ALP candidate for Corangamite in 2004, has a credibility problem, because Mr Whelan found he effectively received a $5,000 loan for his election campaign from the Saunderson fund, which Councillor MCMullin later repaid in full. Further investigation is required into Mr MCMullin's involvement in the matter and that of John Eren, the upper house member, who allowed his staffer to collect the money this and meet with candidates in his office.

On Thursday, Mr Speaker, you asked me to leave the chamber understanding order 94(a). I was becoming very concerned at the time for the member for Hughes, as not a peep was heard from her. Lucas Heights is in her electorate and I felt, and I still do, that you have a right to know of anything that happens in your electorate and to advise your constituents accordingly.

52,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that, of the 20 MPIs and censure debates on the subject of industrial relations moved since October 2005 in this House, he has participated in none of them? Is the Prime Minister also aware of the following exchange with the Catholic Archbishop of Sydney, Cardinal Pell, yesterday? Journalist: ‘So would you encourage Mr Beazley's debate on this to take place?' Cardinal Pell: ‘Debate is always, always useful.' Given that the Prime Minister has not had the courage to debate me on industrial relations, one on one, in this House, will the Prime Minister now agree to have an industrial relations debate with me in the car park of the Coffs Harbour Spotlight store?",44
53,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question.

Workplace Relations",44
54,Mr BAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware of misleading claims being made about the operation of the new workplace relations system? If so, what is the extent of these claims?",44
55,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Braddon for his question. The answer is yes. The latest example appears to have been the member for Perth in relation to a company called Esselte, and I seek the permission of the House to take the House through some of the detail of this. Last Thursday in this place the member for Perth, brandishing what was purported to be an AWA, asked the following question: Isn't it the case that this AWA leaves a full-time employeeof Esselteworking a Saturday shift $65 a week, or $10,140 over three years, worse off? That was the claim. According to a statement from the company, released today, the facts are different from those suggested by the member for Perth. Amongst other things this is what the company had to say: The management of Esselte understands that the $65 pay cut allegation was raised in connection with Saturday work. Esselte does not regularly work any of its employees on a Saturday. It went on to say: Esselte has never engaged a person to work their regular hours on a Saturday. So, on the basis of the member for Perth's claim, that particular claim is false. Further, Esselte said: At certain times of the year, due to increases in warehouse volumes, the existing full-time warehouse staff are asked to work Saturdays on an asrequired basis. This Saturday work is voluntary and has always been in addition to the employee's week hours and is worked at overtime rates of pay. The AWA that was offered to Esselte staff increased the minimum hourly rate to $18.39 an hour, compared with the collective agreement of $17.39 an hour, and also compared with the relevant award, which had a rate of $13.78 an hour. On the basis of a calculation along the lines of that made by the member for Perth of an employee working 38 ordinary hours and three hours overtime, they would actually be $27 a week better off, not $65 a week worse off, and $4,000 better off over the three-year period. I understand that the agreement offered included increases in wages, increases in some allowances and an increase in sick leave provisions. On Saturday, one of Australia's most respected union figures, Mr Joe de Bruyn, had something to say about people taking liberties with the truth in the industrial relations debate. That was referring to Spotlight; it may well also have referred to Esselte. Mr Tuckey interjecting",44

70,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Perth has asked his question.,46
71,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would like the member for Perth to address the case. member for Perth to explain to the House how it is that he can get up and make an allegation that somebody is $65 a week worse off when, with a bit of research based on what the company has said, that person is in fact $27 a week better off. That kind of misrepresentation is of a piece with the misrepresentation of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition was trying to establish that Teys Bros were deliberately refusing to give Aussie workers a job, when in reality they had not only advertised but also gone to the union and asked the union to provide some Australian workers, and the union could not do so. What the opposition is doing on this issue is deliberately distorting the facts in order to create fear and hostility in the community. Ms Gillard-You know all about that!",46
72,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,They always do that. They did it with the GST and it failed. They are doing it with this. I reckon they are going to fail on this as well.,46
73,Mr SECKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. Would the Deputy Prime Minister advise the House of the threat to Australia's trade performance and wider economy posed by Labor's plan to hand control of Australia's workforce to the union movement?,46
74,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Barker for his question. The member for Barker would recognise the significance of productivity growth to our competitiveness in the international marketplace. Our competitive edge relies very heavily on productivity growth. We have had productivity growth over the last 10 or so years in the Australian economy, and it has helped us achieve $177 billion worth of exports last year-very relevant in the member's electorI would like the ate of Barker. The policy being proposed by the Australian Labor Party to rip up Australian workplace agreements would clearly undermine all those productivity gains, as a result of which we have enjoyed growth in our economy. They would be unbelievably irresponsible policies if they were to be implemented. We have heard many comments from different industries that are supporting the current government's position on industrial relations. The mining industry alone says it will take a $6.6 billion hit to productivity every year if it cannot use AWAs. The mining industry is leading Australia's export growth. The agriculture sector, which competes with the mining sector for employment and employees, says that its ability to keep good people in its industry would seriously suffer if it could not use AWAs to match employment opportunities with employee wishes. The Leader of the Opposition wants to roll back the industrial relations system in AusTrade tralia to the bad old days, when the union movement held the country to ransom. We all remember these great examples in our industrial relations history. We remember the days when our minerals exports were brought to a halt over strikes about what type of ice-cream was sold in a canteen on a mine site. That took place in Robe River. We remember the days when export abattoirs like Mudginberri were shut down by the unions even after the employer had won the case in the Industrial Relations Commission. Labor's way of running the economy in the 1980s was no way to run the economy. Our economy then was about a quarter of the size it is now. The government and the Treasurer will deliver an economy in the next 12 months worth about a trillion dollars. Labor's industrial relations policy is no way to take that forward. It would completely undermine productivity in the workplace and therefore undermine growth in the economy. I will finish with a quote from Access Economics, back in 2004, about the preferred economic model of the Australian Labor Party. Access Economics had a close look at Labor's industrial relations policy back then and concluded: The likely outcome is lower productivity growth and less accurate matching of wages and productivity at the enterprise level. For our economy to continue to grow and expand we have to be able to compete and we have to be competitive at home and abroad. Workplace Relations",46
75,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. It follows the one previously asked on this side of the House and the one before on his side of the House. Is the Prime Minister aware of the concluding paragraph of Joe de Bruyn's letter to the Australian, which analyses the actual situation and potential situation of Ms Harris under her previous terms of employment and that which she was offered, in which Mr de Bruyn concludes: In view of the facts as stated above, the claims made about the Spotlight AWA have actually understated the potential impact on Ms Harris had she accepted the company's proposal, as the Prime Minister has suggested. I also refer the Prime Minister to a press conference called by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations on Saturday to boast about a pay cut of less than $90 for Spotlight worker Annette Harris. Can the Prime Minister inform the House what size of pay cut he believes is good for working Australians? Is it $40, $60 or $80 a week?",47
76,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In answer to the honourable member's question, I thought the news conference delivered by my colleague on Saturday was a very good news conference. He is, along with other members of this government, a great believer in wage increases. Let me tell the Leader of the Opposition what I think is a good wage increase, not wage cut. A good wage increase is about 16.8 per cent in real terms over 10 years. That is a very good one. I will tell you what is a bad real wage increase: 1.3 per cent over 13 years, because that is the real comparison. Can I finally say-again-that Mr de Bruyn is a union figure for whom I have considerable respect. I think he is a very good man. We do not agree on everything, but he is a very fair man and that is why he was disturbed by the way in which some of the Leader of the Opposition's front-bench colleagues were distorting the truth. Birth Rate",47
77,Mr ANTHONY SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Would the Treasurer inform the House of recent trends in the birth rate of Australia? Is an increase in the birth rate positive for Australia's future?,47
78,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Casey for his question and look forward to his own contribution to the birth rate next month-and we thank him for doing his duty. There are reports in today's newspapers that 1 July 2004 was a record day for the number of births in Australia, which was the day of course that the maternity payment, or baby bonus, was introduced. Medical advice is that no-one should delay the delivery of a child, which would put either the mother's or the child's health at risk. But 1 July 2004 was the day that the maternity payment, or baby bonus, was introduced and it was in the sum of $3,000. Since then the sum has been indexed and increased and currently stands at $3,166, and on 1 July the maternity payment, or baby bonus, will be increasing to $4,000 for children that are born after that date. The government has also announced another increase-on 1 July 2008, when the maternity payment, or baby bonus, will increase to $5,000. Whether it is the introduction of the baby bonus, whether it is the $600 increase in the family tax benefit-remember that payment that ‘did not exist': it seems to be paid to millions of Australians-whether it is the changes in the taper rate for family tax benefit or whether it is the record number of child-care places that are being delivered under this government, the good news is that for calendar year 2004 Australia recorded the highest number of births in 12 years, the highest since 1992. In fact, for the year ended 31 December 2005 there were 261,400 births in Australia, a 2.4 per cent increase on 2004. It seems that many Australians are taking up the challenge to have one for mum, one for dad and one for the country, and that is a positive thing for Australia. It is a positive thing for Australia because it represents confidence in our future. It is a positive thing for Australia because with an ageing of the population an increase in the fertility rate over the long term-not in the short term but over the long term-will do something to deflect the problems of the ageing of the population in 2040, 2050 and beyond. So the family-friendly policies of this government are helping millions of Australian families. There is a welcome pick-up in the birth rate in Australia and we would encourage many more Australians to benefit from this government's family-friendly policies. Workplace Relations",47
79,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to comments on Sunday by the Catholic Archbishop of Sydney, Cardinal George Pell, about the government's industrial relations changes: I don't like, particularly like the new IR laws because I'm frightened they could be used to force down minimum wages. Given that the government submissions to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission over the last 10 years would have seen the minimum wage reduced by $2,600 a yearDr Southcott- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order.

85,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Will the Prime Minister guarantee Archbishop Pell that the minimum wage will not be reduced in real terms?,49
86,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I did see the remarks attributed to His Eminence, the Catholic Archbishop of Sydney, last night on television. Let me say that I do not entertain the concerns expressed by the Cardinal. The basis of that is that this government has been a good friend of the low paid in this country. I might say that measured by some of the principles of both more broadly Christian social justice and more specifically Catholic social justice, this government has been a good friend of the low paid in the Australian community. In fact, more Australians have jobs under this government than was the case 10 years ago. It is true that the rich have got richer in this country over the last 10 years, but they have not got richer at the expense of the poor. Most of the studies that have been carried out produce evidence on some occasions-indeed, to the great surprise of the researchers-that the low paid enjoy a higher relative increase in their position than people in the middle and at the upper end. Any fair analysis of our family benefits system will reveal that low-paid, single-income families, including single parents, have, relatively speaking, been the best endowed of all as a result of the family tax benefit and welfare policies that have been introduced. I remind all of those who follow this debate that, when we introduced our industrial relations reforms 10 years ago, people said that all sorts of terrible things were going occur. They have not occurred. In fact, we have seen real wages go up by 16.8 per cent, we have seen unemployment fall to a 30-year low and we have seen 1.8 million new jobs created. It is my confident prediction that, just as the doomsaying of the Labor Party 10 years ago was proved wrong, so the doomsaying of the Labor Party in 2006 will by 2016, and through the 10 years to then, also be proved wrong. Workplace Relations",49
87,Mr MCARTHUR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Would the minister update the House on the protections available to employees under Work Choices? Are there any alternative policies?,49
88,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Corangamite for his question and his interest in this subject. I can inform him and the House that there are significant protections available for workers in Australia under the Work Choices legislation-in particular, the significant increase in funding to the Office of Workplace Services in this regard. It is interesting in this light that the ACTU have been using workers in their advertising that they claim to be victims of Work Choices. The reality is that the Office of Workplace Services has power to enforce compliance with the Workplace Relations Act. It has staff trained, and additional staff who have been brought on board, to do that and who have been appointed as workplace inspectors. They have power to go into workplaces, to require the production of documents and the giving of evidence about a range of matters and to take action on behalf of employees against employers where they find that there is a need to do so. Despite the as that have been run, the very interesting thing to note is that the unions have not referred a single one of the to people featured in these advertisements to the Office of Workplace Services. Not only that, the ACTU on its website does not refer workers who have a complaint to the Office of Workplace Services, despite the fact that significant resources are there for workers to make a complaint if they believe they have been hard done by. The Labor Party and the unions claim that they have the interest of workers at heart. If that were true, they would stop playing politics with these people and refer these cases to the Office of Workplace Services. There is no clearer indication that this is simply a matter of the unions and the Labor Party playing politics. If they did have the interests of these workers at heart, they would refer them to the Office of Workplace Services, where a proper investigation could be carried out. Workplace Relations",49
89,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, I refer to comments on Sunday by the Catholic Archbishop of Sydney, Cardinal George Pell, who said of the government's industrial relations changes: ‘I'm not in favour of anything that will drive down the minimum wage, especially when some of the top wages are so enormous.' I also refer to comments made by the chair of the low pay commission, Professor Ian Harper, on 31 May when he said that the government's legislation ‘pushes' the low pay commission to reduce the value of the minimum wage in real terms. Will the Prime Minister guarantee Archbishop Pell that the minimum wage will not be reduced in real terms?",50
90,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, through you to the member for Banks, there is no low pay commission that I am aware of. I am very happy to engage with the member for Banks on these matters. He is a hard working member and a good member.

91,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Hotham is warned!,50
92,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"based on false assertions. I would say to the member for Banks, by all means engage in vigorous debate, but do not be lured by the tactics committee into making false statements; otherwise, Joe de Bruyn will have a go at you as well. That is what will happen. And if Joe gets amongst some of the branches in Banks you never know what might happen, because he does not have a bad track record. I have made this remark before and I will say it again: people ask me for guarantees-my guarantee is my record. My record is of somebody who has led a government that has presided over huge increases in real wages and who has presided over the introduction of a tax and welfare system which I think, compared with the tax and welfare systems of other governments, has been far closer to the aspirations of Christian and specifically Catholic social justice than have been the programs of other governments. I am very proud of that record. I always welcome the contributions to public debate made by that very eminent, ecclesiastical figure, Cardinal George Pell, for whom I have great regard. Indigenous Communities",50
93,Mr TOLLNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. Would the minister explain to the House how the government is proposing to make it easier for people, particularly Indigenous Australians, to own homes and businesses in Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory? What has been the reaction to these proposals?",50
94,Mr BROUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Solomon for his question and his obvious interest in this issue. He is obviously acutely aware that the unfortunate reality is that for decades many Indigenous Australians, particularly but not exclusively in the Territory, have been locked out of owning their own home, a right that the rest of us enjoy. They have also been locked out of being able to own their own businesses in the place where they live. This of course has led to them living in what many people would now recognise as little communist enclaves, where money comes in-they cannot own anything, they cannot run a business, they cannot own their own home-and where someone else determines who owns the house. This government has before the House the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill, which, amongst other things, will provide for 99-year lease-backs of town centres to allow a headlease to be provided to the Northern Territory government and for Aboriginal people, for the first time, to be able to own their own property in these places, build their own home, build their own businesses and build their own future for themselves and their families. I am asked about comments and people's views. I can inform the member for Solomon that last month I went to Nguiu in the Tiwi Islands and spoke with the people about a 99-year lease-back of the township of Nguiu so they could benefit from this legislation. They signed a heads of agreement there. They saw it as a new beginning for their people and their children so that they could join in the market economy like other Australians. Over the weekend I went back to the Territory. I went to Galiwinku and sat down with the traditional owners and said to them, ‘This is what the Commonwealth is proposing to do.' We talked through the many issues of a headlease. Can I tell the House how excited they were and how engaged they were in the opportunity for the first time of being able to own something of their own. It is not understood by many people that many of the Aboriginal people who live in Galiwinku are not traditional owners. They do not have the rights of a traditional owner in the place where they currently reside because they were displaced from their own lands many years ago. I then travelled on Sunday to Wadeye, an area which has been in the press quite a bit. I sat down with some of the leaders in some of the remote communities, such as Wudapuli, which is an outstation, and spoke about how they could also own their own homes in the land that they wish to occupy, where their children could go to school and where they could have the rights of other Australians. They, too, embraced this idea. In the political arena, we have had eminent people like the National President of the ALP, Warren Mundine, warmly welcoming these initiatives and I appreciate his support. We also have in the Northern Territory the Hon. Elliott MCAdam, Minister for Housing, who, in the Sunday Territorian, said: Not everyone in Aboriginal communities is going to be in a position to own their own home, but the important thing is that people will now have a choice. And he is right. This legislation is about providing a choice to Aboriginal people that has been denied to them through collective ownership up to this day. Unfortunately, there are still some people-not all of them, I might add-whose spokesman, Senator Chris Evans, on 13 June made a statementMr MCMullan- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I refer to page 102 of standing and sessional orders, relating to anticipation. The legislation to which the minister is referring is not only on the Notice Paper but scheduled for debate immediately after question time.",50

96,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I hear what the honourable member for Fraser says, but part of the standing order has been suspended.",52
97,Mr BROUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is sad that the honourable member opposite does not want to hear what his own party has to say about this particular issue. This consultation has gone on for nine years, and the only people who seem to continually have their head in the sand are some of those who sit opposite. And I deliberately use the word ‘some' because some people, like the President of the ALP, see that in the past it has failed and a new way is needed and that being part of the market economy and having the right to own your own home should apply right across Australia. But the Labor Party, in a statement on 13 June, said, ‘Labor will not support the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill in its current form.' The most controversial part of the bill includes the 99-year leasing provisions. There is nothing controversial about giving Aboriginal Australians the same rights the rest of us have and have had for a very long time. I ask the federal Australian Labor Party to support their Territorian colleagues, get their head out of the sand and support Australian Aboriginals having the same rights as the rest of us.

Is the Prime Minister aware that, after the employee had started acting in the higher position and his job performance was regarded as excellent, his employer offered to make the role permanent but only if an AWA was signed? Is the Prime Minister aware that the Federal Court found that it was lawful under his laws to require an employee to go on to an AWA for the purpose of getting a promotion? Why is the Prime Minister allowing AWAs to block promotions and therefore scuttle the hopes and aspirations of Australian employees?",52
99,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have seen a report of that case and I might make the observationMr Adams interjecting,52
100,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Lyons is warned!,52
101,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"that it appears to have been a decision made in relation to matters that occurred under the law that operated before Work Choices was introduced. In accordance with my well-established practice-a practice the wisdom of which has been borne out on at least three or four occasions over the last week-I will examine the detail of the case. I will examine the detail of the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition and have something further to say about it, because I think I am justified in saying, on the track record of the member for Perth and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, you cannot always believe what the opposition say at question time with their questions. Transport Infrastructure: New South Wales",52
102,Mr HARTSUYKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Would the minister update the House on the government's support for better transport infrastructure in New South Wales? Are there any alternative policies?,52
103,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Cowper and acknowledge his tremendous interest in this issue and his undying determination to have something done about upgrading the Pacific Highway through his own electorate and through the whole of coastal northern New South Wales. I know he will be particularly pleased that, at long last, a contract was let at the end of last month for the Bonville deviation. That is a part of the $4.9 billion that this government is making available to New South Wales over the five years of AusLink. This includes close to $3 billion for major land transport construction projects-a 171 per cent increase on what was available over the previous five years. That is starting to make a difference. Of course, on budget night there was $800 million provided for the Hume Highway in addition to what had previously been included in AusLink and another $160 million for the Pacific Highway. The details of those projects will be announced very shortly. The reality is that this government ting on with the job in New South Wales of trying to do something about upgrading the state's road system. We do not get a lot of cooperation from the state government, who can find all sorts of reasons why projects should be delayed. There are any number of examples. I know the honourable member for Riverina talks often about the Coolac bypass, where, a year after tenders closed, work still has not started. I was really interested in the New South Wales budget handed down the other week, which actually listed 10 projects under AusLink which it described as being ‘jointly funded by the New South Wales and Commonwealth governments'. Of these 10 projects, six are in fact 100 per cent funded by the Australian government, with not a cent required of New South Wales and not a cent provided. The other four may require a 20 per cent or 50 per cent contribution from New South Wales, but the money included in the New South Wales budget was only the Commonwealth share. The New South Wales share of the money was left out altogether. That is the kind of approach and the lack of cooperation that we so often get from New South Wales when it comes to dealing with road-upgrading projects-the black, green and red tape, the bureaucratic inertia and the policy analysis mean that the money piles up and projects do not get built. So it was really refreshing over the weekend to hear the New South Wales coalition state that, when they are elected to government after the next election in New South Wales, real they will commit to work cooperatively with the federal government to get on with the task. They are going to stop the blaming and they are going to work constructively. What a refreshing change it will be to have a government that wants to work with the Commonwealth government to make sure that these vital road projects in New South Wales is get- are actually built. Fuel Prices",53
104,Mr GIBBONS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his refusal on 8 June to give the ACCC further powers to scrutinise petrol prices. Why won't the government get serious and act on the crippling and unexplained spikes in petrol prices, particularly on long weekends, by writing to the ACCC chairman to initiate formal monitoring of petrol prices under part VIIA section 95G of the Trade Practices Act? Why does the Prime Minister keep telling us that the ACCC has ‘all the power in the world' when it is obvious to everyone that it does not?",53
105,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I say in reply to the member for Bendigo: it is not correct to say that we do not have monitoring. We do have monitoring and there was, in fact, monitoring that was carried out in the lead-up to the Queen's Birthday weekend. That monitoring produced the outcome that was consistent with monitoring of similar events on other occasions, and that is that the discounting of the retail price which takes place during the week because of the higher volume demands at the weekend disappears. That results in the alteration in the price. I know, as the member for Bendigo knows and I think everybody in this country knows, that the price of petrol is painfully high. It however, of no help to sensible debate and no help to the hard-pressed Australian motorist for false claims to be made and false dawns to be offered in relation to how you can cut the price. It is due overwhelmingly to the high price of crude oil. If there had been a solution, that solution would have been lighted upon and implemented with enormous enthusiasm long before now. But I can assure the member for Bendigo that, if there are other productive things that can be done in relation to price monitoring, the government stands ready to do so. Fuel Prices",53
106,Mr WOOD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is also to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister inform the House of the government's actions affecting GST and reductions in fuel excise?,54
107,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for La Trobe for his very important question. It is a very relevant question in the light of an article that appeared on the front page of the Melbourne Herald Sun today, apparently based on a claim made by the member for Wills, which in turn was in part informed by some research carried out by the Parliamentary Library. In essence, what was claimed in the article was that, since the introduction of the GST, some $10 billion in GST revenue has been collected yet only about $4.6 billion has been forgone in excise; whereas the government claimed in 2001 that, when introducing the GST, it would adjust the excise so as to ensure that there was no additional revenue collected. The claim being made is false. It is false because, in the calculations that have been made, no allowance has been made for the two discretionary reductions in fuel excise that were made in 2000 and 2001. There was a reduction in excise of 6.7c per litre on the introduction of the GST and there was a furis, ther reduction of 1.5c in March 2001, which produces a combined reduction of 8.2c a litre. In addition to that, the abolition of fuel excise indexation in March 2001 has resulted in cumulative savings in relation to excise of something in the order of $1.4 billion. So when you carry all of that together, when you allow for the two discretionary reductions and the removal of the excise, you have a situation where the excise forgone is about $11.5 billion. The estimate in the Herald article of GST is $10 billion. So, on the basis of that, there has been no overcollection, and in fact the government has kept faith with its commitment that the introduction of the GST would not result in an increase in the overall tax collected on petrol. I end my answer by making, in any event, the observation that if people, including the member for Wills, believe that too much GST is being collected from petrol, they might like to drop down to Treasury Placenot the Commonwealth end of Treasury Place but the Victorian government end of Treasury Place-and have a word with Mr Bracks about coughing up some of that $1.5 billion extra that the states appear to have got. Rural Health Services",54
108,Mr WINDSOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing and relates to the shortage of doctors in country Australia and recent discussions with the University of New England and the University of Newcastle with regard to the establishment of a medical school in New England. Given the success of the University of Newcastle's University Department of Rural Health, headquartered in Tamworth, and the New South Wales government's announcement today that they will fund teaching upgrades at the Tamworth and Armidale hospitals if the Commonwealth provides 80 places for medical students, will the minister inform the House of progress made in relation to those discussions on this crucial matter for country Australians?",54
109,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for New England for his question. This is a matter which is being brought to my attention not just by this question in this House but also by the member for Gwydir, who has made regular representations to me on this. I have also had some discussions on this with the Vice-Chancellor of the University of New England, the former head of the National Health and Medical Research Council. I think they have put in a good application. The government is certainly considering it. The information about the latest developments from the New South Wales government is interesting and constructive. I think that this is something that would be a positive for rural health. I should point out in conclusion to the member for New England that the policies which the government has already put in place have, around Australia, if not necessarline ily in every rural community, produced an increase in the number of GPs of over 20 per cent since 1996. Defence Air Capability",55
110,Mrs GASH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Defence. Would the minister update the House on recent steps that the government has taken to improve the Australian Defence Force air capability?,55
111,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Gilmore for her question. It is a very important day for the people of Gilmore, as it is for Australians. This morning the Prime Minister announced on behalf of the government that the government will acquire 34 further multirole helicopters, the so-called MRH90 helicopters. These will add to the 12 that the government decided to purchase in August 2004. These 46 helicopters will replace the Black Hawk helicopters. They will also replace the Sea King helicopters. The first of them will arrive at HMAS Albatross in the electorate of Gilmore in 2010. This is a well-developed helicopter at a cost, ultimately, of $2.7 billion for these 34 and $1½ billion for the earlier 12. More than $4 billion is being invested in seeing that the next generation of air capability in Australia delivers Australia with good air combat capability to support special services, to provide helicopter air lift, to support our activities currently being done by the Sea King in rescuing people at sea and other important things and to support the civilian community in Australia. This package includes $1.2 billion in specific support to Australian industry in terms of composite construction, aerospace avionics, software development and engine production. The first two will come from France in December next year. The next three will come the following year, and the first of those will be off the Australian production in Brisbane. There will be 350 Australian jobs supported directly by this decision. It is yet more evidence of the two things the government has been determined to do in defence: to provide very strong political will for the defence and security of Australia and to see that Australia runs a very strong economy so Australia is in a position to be able to afford to protect itself, its borders and its interests in the region and throughout the world. Electorate Offices",55
112,Ms KING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Special Minister of State. Can the minister advise the House whether it is appropriate for coalition senators to regularly relocate their electorate offices to maximise electorate returns for coalition candidates in House of Representatives elections?,56
113,Mr NAIRN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for her question. Changes take place with all members of parliament and senators quite regularly, actually. In fact, since becoming Special Minister of State I have been quite surprised at the number of changes that take place with respect to electorate offices, and happens right across the board. Circumstances change, electorates change, responsibilities changeA government member-Senators change.",56
114,Mr NAIRN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"and senators changeexactly. Senators change as well. I think members on both sides make decisions and ask for changes to be made quite specifically to provide a much better service to their constituents, and I commend all members and senators for doing that. Indigenous Health",56
115,Mr HAASE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Would the minister advise the House of action the government is taking to combat substance abuse amongst Indigenous Australians?,56
116,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for the question and I know how concerned he is to try to ensure better living conditions for people in the remote Indigenous communities in his electorate. I think it is important to keep the House informed on this issue because of the great public interest that it has generated. But it is important to dwell not just on the extent of addiction but also on the determination of local Indigenous people to make a difference, because they can see how these substances are poisoning their kids. In the recent budget the government did commit $55 million to combat petrol sniffing and other substance abuse in Indigenous townships and settlements. This includes $20 million that has been earmarked to roll out the unsniffable Opal petrol to an additional 33 sites, including 15 roadhouses that are close to Indigenous townships. That will take to 92 the total number of sites around Australia where unsniffable Opal petrol is availit able. The budget commitment also includes $15 million to support community patrols and community justice groups and also youth recreation programs, because it is important to make sniffing less attractive as well as harder to do. All of this can work. For instance, I am advised that since Opal was put into the Papunya community the number of petrol sniffers has dropped from about 60 to almost zero, according to the community council chairman. But there are quite a few problems in this area. I have recently been advised that kava abuse is now a problem in up to eight Aboriginal townships in Arnhem Land. The government is currently working with the Northern Territory to try to address this issue. Unfortunately, there are no magic bullets here. Alienation and directionlessness do not dissipate overnight. But the government is determined to make the investments necessary. The government will not hesitate to make the investments necessary where we think there are programs which are reasonably capable of making a difference. Electorate Offices",56
117,Mr GRIFFIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Special Minister of State and I refer the minister to his previous answer. I draw the minister's attention to the March issue of the Liberal Party's Goldstein News, which contains a report from Liberal Senator Mitch Fifield in these terms: ‘Prior to the last election, I moved my office to Warragul to help Russell Broadbent win the seat of MCMillanMrs Bronwyn Bishop-On a point of order, Mr Speaker: the standing orders and the Practice clearly state that members across the way may not refer to material which relates to parties.

119,Mr GRIFFIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I said: ‘Prior to the last election, I moved my office to Warragul to help Russell Broadbent win the seat of MCMillan. Within Victoria, we are now within striking distance of a number of lower house seats. To that end, I have just moved into a new office in the Labor seat of Isaacs, adjacent to Holt.' Mrs Bronwyn Bishop- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I would refer you to page 538 and 539 of the Practice.",57
120,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Mackellar will resume her seat. As I have already said to the member for Mackellar, I am listening carefully to the member for Bruce. He has not completed his question. I call the member for Bruce and ask him to come to his question.",57
121,Mr GRIFFIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Minister, what have these moves cost Australian taxpayers? What action will the minister take in response to Senator Fifield's boast that he has twice relocated his electorate office to serve the interests of Liberal party candidates? Or does he maintain, as he said earlier, that it is all about better servicing his community?",57
122,Mr NAIRN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Bruce for his question. I notice the Labor Party have not given the current member for Isaacs much support, which will be to the great detriment of the Labor Party, I think, because I think she has been a good member. She was certainly a very good Deputy Chair of the Standing Committee on Science and Innovation when I chaired it. But, as I said, circumstances do change and it is necessary his for members and senators to relocate their electorate offices. We try to get the best deal that we can. The individual members and senators work closely with the department to get the best deal. We try to minimise the amount of excess rent sometimes when things have to change, and this happensMs Roxon interjecting",57
123,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Gellibrand!,57
124,Mr NAIRN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I can probably trot out the names of a few Labor members and senators and what it has cost to relocate their officesMs Roxon interjecting,57
125,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Gellibrand is warned!,57
126,Mr NAIRN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"if the member would like. I do not have the exact dollar figure for that right here at the moment, but I am very happy to get the actual dollar figures and come back to the parliament-and I might provide a few dollar figures of other changes as well. National Security",57
127,Mrs DRAPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Attorney-General. Would the Attorney-General advise the House of developments in the continuing need for counter-terrorism legislation?,57
128,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Makin for her question, because there is continuing interest in the situation of national security. Last week I tabled a report on the Security Legislation Review Committee that was chaired by a retired judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, Simon Sheller. The committee was established to review the operation, effectiveness and implication of the package of measures that were implemented in 2002. That report recognised that the current level of threat to Australia and Australian interests from terrorist activity justified the continuing need for our strong counter-terrorism laws. As the Age editorial today correctly points out, the report also found that there had been no excessive or improper use of Australia's counter-terrorism laws. Of course the government will consider very carefully the recommendations of the review, but we have formed a preliminary view on several key issues. It is appropriate that I should outline what those matters were, as I did last Friday. We believe very firmly that the listing of terrorist organisations is open and transparent as a process with sufficient safeguards and with parliamentary oversight. The power has been used on some 19 occasions, and I was satisfied at the time, and I remain satisfied, that each of the 19 organisations meet the criteria for listing. Based on advice from our intelligence organisations, each of them is assessed to have engaged in preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering a terrorist act. I might say it has nothing to do with any religious faith or cause which members or adherents might have. The government believes concern expressed by the committee about the offensive association is also unfounded. The idea that it interferes with ordinary family, religious or legal communication ignores the fact that provisions in the law now explicitly exempt associations with close family members and associations for the purpose of religious worship and for the provision of humanitarian advice and legal advice. The government does remain committed to engaging with the community on security issues explaining the legislation to all members of the community. We will continue to denounce terrorism and all those who support it or promote it directly or by association.",57
129,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA  a matter of privilege. I recently undertook to send through Australia Post's Nepean business centre 20,987 invitations to the screening of a documentary film, The Men Who Saved Australia, to be introduced by Major General Ian Flawith and cohosted by me and the Rooty Hill RSL sub-branch. I have received an invoice from Australia Post dated 30 May 2006 which claims that they have all been delivered. I have received a couple of complaints in my office about the failure of some of my constituents to receive this invitation. I did make inquiries at Australia Post and initially felt that the problem may have been relatively minor. I have now been advised that between 3,000 and 5,000 of these unaddressed mail items were shredded, apparently at local management direction, and, furthermore, management have claimed when challenged by other Australia Post staff that I had provided these items in excess of the required number. This is not correct, as these are batched in my office and the required numbers were advised by Australia Post. The mail items were collected from my office on Monday, 29 May 2006, with the delivery period being from 5 to 9 June 2006. Furthermore, I understand that some of the delivery staff were not provided with sufficient material to complete their deliveries. I understand that the shredded material was in locked security bins at Nepean delivery centre, and I was concerned that any subsequent approach to Australia Post would result in their removal. I contacted the office of the Commissioner of Federal Police requesting that the matter be investigated prior to any the physical evidence being removed. I have been made aware that the security bins have now been removed. As I have had no response from the Federal Police, I am unable to advise whether or not the physical evidence has been intercepted by them. I believe that tampering with mail is a serious offence of itself. I am at a loss to un- gram. derstand why, apparently, management of Australia Post's Nepean centre would wish to tamper with invitations to view this documentary. I consider it to be un-Australian. Every Australian must have confidence that their mail will be processed and delivered. Mail is one of the important ways for members of the House to communicate with their constituents. Any tampering with mail is a direct and significant interference with a member's ability to do their job. Accordingly, I would ask that you consider these matters that I have raised and, in particular, the actions complained of and whether or not they amount to improper interference with free performance of my duties as a member. I table the invitation, the invoice from Australia Post, the map of the distribution area and also my request to Australia Post for the delivery of these items.",58
130,The SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,I thank the Chief Opposition Whip. He raises a serious matter. I will look at it closely and make further investigations. NA Shell Questacon Science Circus,59
131,Ms ANNETTE ELLIS,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, you will be aware, as I think you attended the function as well, that last Thursday in the Great Hall we saw the celebration of the 21st birthday of Questacon's science circus-a very successful program sponsored by the government as well as by private enterprise. I became aware that they had attempted to have the science circus vehicle of parked at the front of the House to add some media and other interest to the event but were told apparently that that was not able to happen. I was wondering, Mr Speaker, if you could find out what the problem was that stopped the Questacon vehicle from being parked out the front. It would have added quite a deal to the celebrations of their pro",59
132,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,I thank the member for Canberra. I will give her a detailed answer rather than try to give a short answer now. Parliament House: Signage,59
133,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, on quite a different matter, I wonder whether you might make an inquiry and report to the House on the reason for the sign which appears in the area where parliamentarians assembled this morning to respond to the fire drill. It is towards the city end of this building and says that photography is prohibited. It struck me as an extraordinary sign to have on Parliament House, a building which is probably the most photographed symbol of the nation and where photographs depicting this building in great detail are for sale and on public display in our bookshop. I wonder whether you might make some inquiries. It was the first time. I had seen that sign, but it is a large and prominent one and it certainly disturbed me. I am not aware of any direction that you have given that would prohibit the public from taking photographs of this building.",59
134,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,I thank the member for Denison and I will certainly make some inquiries and report back as appropriate. NA,59
135,The Clerk,PETITIONS,"Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate ministers: Human Rights: Falun Gong To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives Assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens and residents of Australia draws to the attention of the House that: Witnesses, including an investigative journalist and a veteran military doctor have revealed that Falun Gong practitioners are being held in at least 36 concentration camps in China where they are routinely subject to the forced removals of their organs which are then sold for transplants. The bodies are quickly cremated to destroy all evidence. NA NA RESOLUTION TO: I. Call for the Australian Government to fully support the International Coalition to Investigate the Persecution of Falun Gong (CIPFG), and demand that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) immediately open the doors of all concentration camps, forced labour camps, hospitals, prisons and detention centres throughout the People's Republic of China in order to allow independent teams to investigate the charges of tention, torture and live organ removal for transplants. II. Demand that the CCP regime release all detained Falun Gong practitioners immediately by Mr Andrews (from 67 citizens) by Mr Barresi (from 205 citizens) by Mr Bevis (from 2,052 citizens) by Mrs Bronwyn Bishop (from 225 citizens) by Ms Corcoran (from 120 citizens) by Dr Emerson (from 92 citizens) by Mr Entsch (from 87 citizens) by Mr Laurie Ferguson (from 502 citizens) by Mr Georgiou (from 142 citizens) by Ms Grierson (from 92 citizens) by Mr Hardgrave (from 400 citizens) by Mr Johnson (from 180 citizens) by Mr Jull (from 38 citizens) by Ms Ley (from 278 citizens) by Mr Lloyd (from 258 citizens) by Mr Ian Macfarlane (from 611 citizens) by Mr MCArthur (from 40 citizens) by Mr Griffin (from 360 citizens) by Mr Ruddock (from 552 citizens) by Mr Slipper (from 122 citizens) by Mr Somlyay (from 407 citizens) by Mr Tanner (from 58 citizens) by Mr Ticehurst (from 152 citizens) by Mr Wood (from 18 citizens) Breast Cancer: Herceptin To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House a treatment available illegal defor some types of Breast Cancer. - Some breast cancers test positive for a growth factor or protein called Her2. This Her2 tells breast cancer cells how to grow. A drug called HERCEPTIN stops Her2 from working, so the breast cancer cells stop growing. - This means that Herceptin would help greatly in further reducing risk of future recurrence of breast cancer. - However, Herceptin is NOT supplied on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) for all stages of breast cancer and incurs a cost of $66,000 for 1 year of treatment. - This cost is prohibitive, meaning women either do not use this treatment, or they suffer tremendous financial hardships on top of their cancer struggle. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray the House to include the drug Herceptin on the Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme (PBS) for use by women at any stage of breast cancer who test positive to Her2. by Mr Bowen (from 1,165 citizens) Breast Cancer: Herceptin To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament: The petition of certain residents of the State of New South Wales draws to the attention of the House a treatment available for some types of Breast Cancer. - Some breast cancers test positive for a growth factor or protein called Her2, which tells breast cancer cells how to grow. - A drug called HERCEPTIN stops HER2 from working, so the breast cancer cells stop growing. - This means HERCEPTIN would help greatly in increasing breast cancer survival rates and reduce the risk of breast cancer recurrence. - However, HERCEPTIN is not listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) for all stages of breast cancer. As a result, the cost of HERCEPTIN is too prohibitive, meaning women either do not use this treatment, or they suffer tremendous financial hardships on top of their cancer struggle. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray the House to ensure the drug HERCEPTIN is immediately placed on the Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme or subsidised when approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration, for use by women at any stage of breast cancer who test positive to HER2. by Mr Murphy (from 7,771 citizens) Breast Cancer: Herceptin To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House a treatment available for some types of Breast Cancer. - Some breast cancers test positive for a protein known as HER2. This protein is linked to the growth and reformation of breast cancer. - Cancer sufferers exhibiting this particular protein generally have a worse outlook than those who test HER2 negative. - The drug HERCEPTIN targets HER2 and aides in growth retardation. - The drug has resulted in significant improvements in survival, disease progression and the quality of life for women suffering from breast cancer. - Currently costing $66,000 for a single year of treatment the drug is out of reach for most suffers of this insidious condition.. Your petitioners therefore request the House to include the drug Herceptin on the Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme (PBS) for use by women at all stages of breast cancer who test positive to the Her2 protein.  Work Choices Legislation To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament: This petition of citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the adverse impacts of the Work Choice legislation on the working class Australians and their families. Your petitioners therefore request the House to repeal this legislation and replace it with fair and just laws for Australian workers and their families? by Dr Emerson (from 4,067 citizens) by Mr Ian Macfarlane (from 428 citizens) Higher Education To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of the citizens of Australia points to the House that the Howard Government has: - nearly doubled the average HECS fees since 1996; - allowed universities, such as the University of Newcastle, to increase HECS fees by a further 25 per cent from 2005 ; - introduced full fee degrees costing as much as $210,000 so that more than a third of Australian undergraduates can buy their way into university ahead of students with better marks; - turned away 20,000 qualified university applicants each year by failing to fund enough places; and - cut $5 billion in Commonwealth investment in universities. Your petitioners therefore request the House to: - immediately legislate to stop the Howard Government's 25 per cent HECS hikes; - abolish full fee paying undergraduate places for Australian students; - create 20,000 extra university places every year; and - ensure high quality university education by properly indexing university grants. by Ms Grierson (from 24 citizens) Energy Australia Stadium To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House: - The proposal by the Hunter International Sports Centre Trust to the Federal and NSW Governments to redevelop Energy Australia Stadium at a cost of $44 million. - The fact that in June 2002 the NSW Government handed over a cheque for $23.6 million to meet its share of the redevelopment proposal. We therefore pray that the House urges the Federal Government to now contribute its share of the funding as a matter of urgency to transform out the Stadium in Newcastle into a first class sporting venue. by Ms Grierson (from 30 citizens) Human Rights: Falun Dafa To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain citizens and residents of Australia draws to the attention of the House that: The DPI Certificates Signed by Mr Downer Help the Chinese Communist Party to Persecute Falun Gong in Australia (a) On March 16th, 2002, the day before Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan paid a visit to Australia, the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alexander Downer, signed a “certificate” to limit Falun Gong practitioners peaceful appeal activities in front of the Chinese Embassy, by utilizing his foreign minister's privileges under pressure from (CCP ) Jiang Zemin's regime. The reason given was that Falun Gong's banners of “stop killing”, “stop torture”, “the World Needs Truthfulness, Benevolence and Forbearance” and exercise music “would impair, the dignity of the, mission or of the residence of the head, of another diplomatic agent, of the mission and that its removal would be an appropriate step to prevent the impairment or the continuation of the Impairment of the Chinese Embassy.” Mr Downer has signed these “certificates” which are only valid for 30 days, every month for 3 years, to continuously restrict Falun Gong practitioners peaceful appeal in front of the Chinese Embassy. This is a malignant case in which the CCP extends its policy of “Annihilating” Falun Gong to overseas countries. Falun Gong practitioners have tried many times to directly communicate with Mr Downer, to no avail. (b) It is Beijing dictating to Australia now, instead of Australia dictating to Beijing about human rights violations. Such behaviour by Mr Downer is damaging the rights of Australia citizen, and directly affects the foundations of a democratic country and our nation's policy of freedom of speech. It is in fact impairing the dignity of Australians. At the same time, it is helping the Chinese Communist Party to further persecute Chinese people, because the message that Mr. Downer sends to China, by issuing these certificates, is that “the Australia Government supports the persecution”. (c) In this democratic country, we have the right to expose, and protest against, the genocide committed by the CCP; we have the right to condemn this dictatorial abuse of people's rights, and of killing and torturing of innocent people, simply because these people's belief is different to the communist ideology of violent revolution. (d) We are seeking justice through the legal system of this country, to restore our freedom expression, and to expose the genocide in China. We sincerely hope fellow Australians can come together to uphold the rights and dignity that we treasure deeply in our hearts. NA NA RESOLUTION TO REQUEST MR. DOWNER NA AND REQUEST THE CCP TO: I.

The petition of certain citizens of Australia to the attention of the House that free mammograms are not accessible by breast cancer survivors despite the increased risk of breast cancer. Access to free mammograms is also being denied to women over 70 years of age in some parts of Australia. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to ensure that mammograms are free to all women in Australia regardless of age or medical history. by Ms Hall (from 410 citizens) Shortland Electorate: General Practitioners To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. Request that the House take immediate action to address the chronic shortage of doctors in the Lake Macquarie and Hunter areas. Your petitioners therefore respectfully request that the House do everything in their power to ensure that the greatest effort is made, as soon as of possible, to address the chronic shortage of doctors in the Lake Macquarie and Hunter areas. by Ms Hall (from 48 citizens) Medicare: Belmont Office To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. We the undersigned request that the Government re-open a Medicare Office at Belmont as there is no Medicare Office between Charlestown and Lake Haven and there has been a drastic decline in the numbers of General Practitioners bulkbilling. The closure of Belmont Medicare Office by the Howard Government has caused great hardship to many local residents particularly the elderly and those with young children. Your petitioners therefore respectfully request that the House do everything in their power to ensure that Belmont Medicare Office is reopened as a matter of urgency. by Ms Hall (from 104 citizens) Tariffs draws To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain residents of Australia draws to the attention of the House that with more than 10 per cent of Australians out of work, the concept of a level playing field and zero tariffs is rejected by Australian families who can see no evidence of benefit but substantial losses from the arguments put by economic rationalists. Your petitioners therefore request the House to - act to ensure that Australia maintains a viable processing industry based on our rural industries and that tariffs remain in place as long as other nations use non-tariff measures, iff protection, etc.; - stop imports of goods that are supported by subsidies and other non-tariff or. dumping measures to Australia; and - restore profitability to our farms and factories, employment opportunities to our of citizens and to provide a future for our youth. by Mr Ian Macfarlane (from 17 citizens) Medicare: Ocean Grove To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws the attention of the House to the cost and inconvenience experienced by residents of Ocean Grove and the Bellarine Peninsula who are required to travel to Geelong or Waurn Ponds to visit a Medicare office. The petitioners therefore request the House to make provision for a Medicare office to be established in Ocean Grove for the convenience of Bellarine Peninsula residents. by Mr MCArthur (from 592 citizens) To the Honourable Speaker of the House and Members of the House assembled in Parliament: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the increasing hardships experienced by older people, especially those on fixed incomes, due to the current escalating price of petrol. We believe that Older Australians and people on low incomes should not bear a disproportionate burden of the impacts of escalating petrol prices passed on to citizens through food, fuel and service cost increases. The petitioners call on the House to ensure that the Commonwealth Government: (1) Takes immediate measures to protect the living standards of older people and pensioners. (2) Puts in place greater safety nets to protect vulnerable people in our community against passed on cost increases to daily essentials including food, transport medical and community support services; tar- (3) Reviews and increases pensions in line with the rising cost of living standards. (4) Improves the availability and accessibility of public and community transport systems. by Mr Brendan O'Connor (from 1,232 citizens) PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS Work Choices Legislation",60
136,Mr BEAZLEY,TO DISCONTINUE THE DPI CERTIFICATES,"I move: That this House: (1) recalls and records the solemn commitment given by the Prime Minister to Alan Jones on Radio 2GB on 4 August 2005 that “I mean some people are going to have to work public holidays…it would be absurd and unfair and unreasonable if somebody has to work on a public holiday that that person isn't compensated by being paid whatever it is, the double time or the time and a half…those arrangements are going to continue…”; (2) notes that appropriate compensation includes things like penalty rates and public holiday Fuel Prices leave loadings; (3) notes that since the Government's extreme industrial relations changes commenced on 27 March 2006, a single sentence in an Agreement can remove all entitlements to public holiday pay, penalty rates and overtime pay, and that the Government's own statistics show: (a) 64 per cent of assessed AWAs have removed penalty rates; (b) 63 per cent have removed leave loadings; (c) 52 per cent have removed shiftwork loadings; and (d) 41 per cent did not contain gazetted lic holidays; (4) affirms its support for the Prime Minister's August 2005 commitment that employees should receive adequate compensation for working on public holidays; and (5) calls on the Government to immediately restore adequate compensation for Australian employees who work on public holidays, thereby holding the Prime Minister to his solemn promise to Alan Jones and the Australian people. This will be the 21st time by motion, by censure motion and by MPI that this chamber will have debated issues relating to the industrial relations system introduced by the government, at the Prime Minister's behest, in which the Prime Minister has not participated. He has squibbed every single debate in this chamber since this legislation was introduced. As the nation has had an opportunity to see the full impact of his handiwork, he has been unprepared in open debate in this chamber to explain himself and explain what he is up to. Quite frankly, for a major piece of legislation on the part of a government, I cannot recollect a set of circumstances where a Prime Minister has been so reluctant to debate its detail after its point of entry and implementation. Prime ministers have usually deigned to come into this chamber at least once or twice to defend the principal handiwork of their government. The Prime Minister has not chosen to do so and he is too cowardly to face us outside, so it needs to be comprehended thoroughly by all members of this chamber and all Australians.",64
137,The SPEAKER,TO DISCONTINUE THE DPI CERTIFICATES,Order! The Leader of the Opposition would help if he withdrew that accusation.,65
138,Mr BEAZLEY,TO DISCONTINUE THE DPI CERTIFICATES,"I withdraw. The Prime Minister thinks so little of his legislation that he is unprepared to face me or, for that matter, anyone else in this place in debate. This pubmotion goes to the heart of family life. It goes to the heart of what makes family life sustainable economically, spiritually and morally-the capacity for ordinary family members to enjoy each other's company free of the burdens of work and other distractions on at least some occasions in the course of the year. This motion establishes clearly the right of people to enjoy Christmas holidays, Easter holidays, Australia Day and ANZAC Day-the various public holidays of significance that have been designated by state and federal governments over the years. I challenge every member opposite to support this motion. They will be given the opportunity to do so. I want them to show to their constituents how seriously they regard their access to those holidays. There are two ways in which the government legislation attacked the capacity of Australians to enjoy those holidays, some of which are of immense spiritual and moral significance to individual members of Australian society as well as to the decency of family life. The first was to create, in the general terms of their legislation, a condition which said that a worker needed a reason for a public holiday. He had to have a reason to take Christmas off, a reason to take Easter off and a reason to take off ANZAC Day. Most Australians assume they have it as a right. The second way the Prime Minister attacked this position was to remove from the legislation the certainty that, if you did work on those holidays, you would be able to access penalty rates to do so. There are two reasons for that. The first reason is that penalty rates exist for working on those holidays as a deterrent to employers to engage people needlessly over those periods. It puts a question mark in the mind of the employer. The second reason of course is that, for some period of family life, most people in society need the capacity to earn those penalty rates in order to be able to pay their mortgages and afford the other aspects of family life. The position of this government attacks family life at its very core. The Prime Minister talks about barbecue stoppers, and there is no doubt his industrial legislation is that. But this is more than a barbecue stopper; this is an axe taken to the kitchen table of family life. That is what this is. We will continually oblige Liberal and National Party members to declare themselves in this place on those issues right up until the next election. So they might as well do it now.",65
139,The SPEAKER,TO DISCONTINUE THE DPI CERTIFICATES,Is the motion seconded? Ms George-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,66
140,Mr BARRESI,TO DISCONTINUE THE DPI CERTIFICATES,"The motion moved by the member for Brand needs to be totally rejected this afternoon. The Leader of the Opposition is asking this House to take note of what the Prime Minister has said recently on workplace relations. What we really should be doing is taking note of what the member for Brand and others opposite have said on industrial relations. For months the ALP has been saying that the Work Choices legislation is extreme and damaging to our nation. In fact, the only thing that has been extreme is the ALP's language. We have had extreme language, similar to what has taken place and been stated in this chamber for the last 10 years, as to how this nation and the Australian workers will be disadvantaged as a result of our industrial relations policy changes. The member for Brand beats his chest and tells the Australian people, ‘I will rip up these laws.' We heard him say this. But what we have not heard the Leader of the Opposition tell us is what he is offering native-until, of course, the other day. Then out of the blue, without any consultation with his own backbench and his own shadow ministers, he said: ‘My alternative is that we are going to return to the bad old days. We are going to return to the days of a regulated labour market. We are going to return to the days when awards regulated every minute of every worker's day. We are going to return to the days when individual aspiration was stifled.' The member for Brand stands up at various opportunities and says that our policies and AWAs stifle the aspirational voters of this country. The only thing that will stifle aspiration is a return to those days when we had a regulated labour market. If the member for Brand has any doubt about this, he only has to go down to the Fremantle docks in the electorate of Fremantle. I know it quite well; I grew up there. All he has to do is go down to Austal and see the opportunities that are being created in those dockyards and the various employment growths that have taken place. Westpoll itself has said that the people of Western Australia recognise that AWAs have been good for the state, and, in fact, during the time of this government being in power we have seen the unemployment rate of WA go down into figures which have been absolutely unheard of-below the four per cent mark. What we are seeing, through the member for Brand's claims that he will rip up AWAs, is a Labor Party that wants to return this country to record unemployment. We see a Labor Party that wants us to return to massive interest rates and a recession. The only way that the member for Brand can guarantee through legislation that no worker will be worse off if he rips up AWAs is if there is a massive increase in unemployment. There will be job losses as a result of what he is trying to do. There are people out there who have signed agreements to suit their individas an alterual circumstances. The member for Brand's position will be to return to the days when the economy of this country goes down the gurgler once again with record unemployment and, with it, increasing interest rates. We need to ask ourselves: why is the member for Brand asking us to return to an outdated era? Is it that he simply wants to secure his own employment? That is about the only job that is going to be secured through his policy change-his own position. As the Australian newspaper claimed on Friday last week, Labor's prime interest is to promote collective the workplace in which unions would have bargaining rights. I say to all the small business people out there: if you have any concerns about the industrial relations system through the Work Choices legislation we have introduced, think about what the ALP's alternative position is. They are basically saying that, through law, they will be guaranteeing that every union official will come into your building and be able to negotiate on behalf of the workforce, whether or not they are unionised. That is what a return to collective bargaining means. There is this whole concept of good faith bargaining. It is a great little term that is being used. We are going to have a highly regulated labour force. (Time expired)",66
141,Ms GEORGE,TO DISCONTINUE THE DPI CERTIFICATES,"It is a great pity that the Prime Minister is not in the chamber to defend the policies which have wreaked havoc on ordinary working people and the policies which are in breach of commitments that the Prime Minister has made. It is a pity he is not here, because I want to refer to some of those commitments that are on the public record. I quote from the transcript of an interview with the Prime Minister on the Alan Jones show back in August last year. It is true that this interview occurred before the details of the legislation were introduced, but there is no doubt in my mind-and there should not be any doubt in the minds of the members opposite-about what the words mean. The Prime Minister often claims that his word is his bond; let us listen to what he said. In answer to a question from Alan Jones about whether overtime was going to be absorbed into ordinary rates of pay, he said: ... this Government is not going to introduce any policy that is going to result in a cut in the takehome pay or living standards of the Australian workforce. bargaining in Mr Jones said: My point to you is this, and I'm trusting you understand this, that if that overtime were to become ordinary time, take-home pay could fall dramatically. The Prime Minister answered: But I think people should wait until the legislation comes out. I think people should wait until the legislation is in operation and they will find that so many of these allegations are wrong. Mr Jones then went on to talk about the impact of individual contracts. He said: Now they are saying, the critics, the conditions therefore of the fiveminimum standardsdon't include public holidays or meal breaks, so they are going to be negotiable. One union says the changes would make working on public holidays and through lunchbreaks open to bargaining between workers and bosses. What did the PM say then? He said: ... I have said that the existing arrangements concerning meal breaks and public holidays will continue. … … … And it would be absurd and unfair and unreasonable if somebody has to work on a public holiday that that person isn't compensated by being paid whatever it is, the double time or the time and a half. … … … I just want to make the general comment that those arrangements are going to continue. That gives you the flavour of the interview and of the kinds of commitments that were made in principle, in good faith one would have assumed, to the listening audience of the Alan Jones program in August last year. We all know the reality is totally different, and official figures put the lie to the Prime Minister's claims. We know for a fact, from an analysis of 250 AWAs lodged with the Office of the Employment Advocate, that nearly one in five AWAs excluded all award conditions and replaced them with the barest of the five minimum legislated standards. We know that two-thirds of them scrapped leave loadings and penalty rates. We know that more than half removed shift allowances and around one-third modified overtime loadings and rest breaks. Forty per cent had dropped gazetted public holidays in face of the fact that in my state of New South Wales public holidays have been legislated in an act since 1912. So Alan Jones was absolutely right in pressing the Prime Minister on the impact of AWAs on the wages and conditions of workers. Take-home pay is being cut, and the government's own official statistics show that. And where is the Prime Minister to defend the previously made commitments on these issues? Let me take his commitment that existing arrangements concerning meal breaks and public holidays would continue. The Leader of the Opposition has pointed out the importance that is attached to public holidays by the Australian community. We know for a fact that current arrangements are not continuing. Look at the Spotlight AWA, about which there has been considerable publicity. What does it show? It shows no penalty rates for Saturday or Sunday work and no penalty rates for public holidays; so, currently, if a worker on the Spotlight AWA works on a public holiday, they get $14.30 an hour compared to the award of $35.70 an hour. It is an absolute shame, and the only compensation is a day off in lieu at ordinary rates. There is no overtime, no paid rest breaks, no annual leave loading and no meal, uniform or first aid allowances. And members opposite want to try and claim that the wages and conditions of workers are not being affected by this regressive and unfair industrial relations legislation. (Time expired)",67
142,Dr SOUTHCOTT,TO DISCONTINUE THE DPI CERTIFICATES,"This week we have seen that the opposition claims on Spotlight and on Esselte have not stacked up, but let us recap some of the other claims made by the Leader of the Opposition about the government's workplace relations reforms. The Leader of the Opposition has said that under these reforms there will be more divorce. He has said that the weekend barbecue is about to become a thing of the past. He has said that neighbour will be set against neighbour in a dog-eatdog world. These claims are not credible. They belong in the rubbish bin along with the claims made by the member for Perth back in 1995. They have not eventuated. The topic of today's motion is looking at a sample of four per cent of AWAs which were lodged with the Office of the Employment Advocate, but the Leader of the Opposition has quoted selectively from these. He has failed to say that 84 per cent of the agreements in the sample had a greater rate of pay than under the award. What are Australian workplace agreements? They are agreements between employee and employer. They are selective to the enterprise and to the business. They must meet minimum standardsthe Australian Fair Pay and Condition standard. No employee can be forced to sign an AWA; no employee can be terminated for refusing to sign an AWA. The most recent ABS survey showed that employees on AWAs earn, on average, 13 per cent more than employees covered by certified agreements and 100 per cent more than those on award rates. The opposition fails to recognise the important changes that have occurred in the Australian workplace over the last 20 years. Whereas in the mid-1980s half of workers were members of trade unions, now just 22.4 per cent of the workplace are members of unions. In the private sector, only 16.8 per cent of people are members of unions. In the years from 1998 to 2004, the number of selfemployed persons grew by a quarter of a million and trade union membership declined by 200,000 persons. There are now more independent contractors than union members. When we look at the performance of the Australian economy under the government's initial workplace relations reforms, we now see in the employment figures for May that the unemployment rate has fallen below five per cent for the first time since November 1976. But, at the same time, the participation rate rose. That means that more people were looking for work. The number of people employed increased by 56,000-all full-time jobs-and 38,000 of those were women; 1.8 million new jobs have been created since March 1996; and real wages are up by 16.8 per cent. What has happened over the last 10 years is that a strong economy has led to shortages of skilled and unskilled labour. This means that workers are now in a very strong bargaining position. Workplace relations reform to introduce flexibility into the workplace so that we could get improvements in the economy was something that was always too hard for the Australian Labor Party. That is understandable. It is their history. It is their background. It is their training. The trade union movement has this vicelike grip on the Australian Labor Party. We have exhibit A, the member for Hotham, and exhibit B, the member for Throsby, the previous speaker. The problem is that there are now almost a million people on AWAs. Ms George-There are not; that is not true.",68
143,Dr SOUTHCOTT,TO DISCONTINUE THE DPI CERTIFICATES,"It is-almost a million people on AWAs. There is no greater authority on this than the Leader of the Opposition, who said, ‘There will be a million AWAs in place when we come into office and you can't wander around cancelling contracts.' Exactly! This is a promise that the Labor Party is unable to deliver on. We have seen workers in Western Australia and in Queensland in a whole range of industries who like their AWAs and who want to stay on their AWAs. If we look at my own state of South Australia, we find there are 2,000 people on AWAs at Olympic Dam. Roxby Downs has one of the highest income rates of any postcode in South Australia. There are over 9,000 people on AWAs in the electorate of Boothby. I think this is a big mistake by the Labor Party. This is a mistake akin to the ‘troops home by Christmas' promise by Mark Latham. The problem here is that the government has a very different vision of Australia from that of the opposition. We have an optimistic view of employers and employees and the way they can work cooperatively for mutual benefit. That is a view shared by the vast majority of aspirational Australians. It is a view shared by the vast majority of workers. We believe that workers should have choice, that they should have freedom to choose. AWAs are a very important strand of the workplace arrangements in this country, which will lead to further improvements in the economy.",69
144,Ms BIRD,TO DISCONTINUE THE DPI CERTIFICATES,"I honestly wish that government members would come into this place and make it quite clear what the agenda of this Work Choices legislation is, because they skip around and contradict themselves constantly. Indeed, so does the Prime Minister, so it is little wonder that he does not want to have a direct debate on the issue. The reality is that the government tell us over and over again that for the last 10 years everything has been just great. They talk about the unemployment rate and they talk about the growth in, and strength of, the economy. Then, in complete contradiction to their own case, they tell us that, therefore, there is a need for radical change to take away all of the protections and opportunities that gave the Australian population of workers an opportunity to enjoy and participate in the fruits of that economic growth. For families the reality is that this bill will pose a situationMr Barresi-Bill? What bill?",69
145,Ms BIRD,TO DISCONTINUE THE DPI CERTIFICATES,"I take the correction from the member. This legislation and its impacts will directly affect the capacity of families to meet their obligations to each other, not just their obligations to the workforce. I come from a long family line of coalminers, and there are still many working in the coal mining industry. I have to say at this point that they were still all on enterprise agreements when I last spoke to them, but they are very well paid and doing very well, given the growth in the mining and minerals sectors in recent years. When I speak to them, these are the sorts of comments I get. Firstly, most of them have wives doing part-time work, often in the retail or hospitality industries. They are concerned about the capacity of their wives to continue earning an income without being required to be available at any time that suits the employer. The reality for many women in the workplace, particularly in the retail and hospitality industries, is that do work part-time hours. They manage that work in combination with their commitments to their families by relying on having regular and notified working hours. Since this legislation came into practice we are seeing women being asked to sign on to AWAs where they must be available for the entire operating hours of the business. The reality for those women is that they cannot then meet the commitments they have to their families and they have to choose-this is where the real choice is in that legislation-between working and not working. If you talk to women in the retail and hospitality industries you will find ample evidence that that is exactly what they are facing. They also have teenage or young adult children. I do not know what world the members opposite live in, but I have a 17year-old and a 22-year-old and I regularly speak to people in those age groups. Their experiences in the workforce in the last 10 years, in their initial attempts to get work, have not been good. There was already a great deal of exploitation of young workers under the previous changes that took place. Mr Barresi interjectingDr Southcott interjecting",70
146,Ms BIRD,TO DISCONTINUE THE DPI CERTIFICATES,"Members opposite might want to interject, but I suggest that they get out and talk to some young people about the fairly disgraceful practices that have occurred. I can tell members opposite that the practiceDr Southcott-At least they've got a job.",70
147,Ms BIRD,TO DISCONTINUE THE DPI CERTIFICATES,"At least they've got a job! You run that in your electorate. I dare you to run that in your electorate when you have a young person in a family who goes to work for a business for two weeks and is then told: ‘That's work experience and it won't be paid. they Thanks very much but we've decided you're not suitable; see you later, we'll get somebody else in,' to do two weeks work for no pay. And then you have the young person who genuinely thinks they have been signed up for a traineeship or an apprenticeship and then discovers that in fact there is no paperwork and after working the month over Christmas is told, ‘We no longer think you've got enough experience to be an apprentice, see you later.' These are examples I have had in my electorate office. You talk to families whose kids are going through those experiences and you tell them, ‘Any job's better than no job.' I tell you what: you will get a pretty rude and abrupt response to that. The reality of Work Choices is that it works fine if you have power. If you do not, you will find yourself well and truly exploited. Dr Southcott interjecting",70
148,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TO DISCONTINUE THE DPI CERTIFICATES,Order! I ask the honourable member for Boothby to bring himself to some sense of decorum in the House.,71
149,Mr JOHNSON,TO DISCONTINUE THE DPI CERTIFICATES,"On behalf of the Howard government I am pleased to speak to the motion before the House. The member for Cunningham asked what our agenda was. Let me tell her, on behalf of the government: our agenda is about national prosperity. Our agenda is about creating jobs for Australians. Our agenda is about giving opportunities to young people throughout the length and breadth of this great country. It is about creating opportunities for all Australians to maximise their talents so that they can provide better opportunities for their families. I am pleased to be able to speak to this motion and put it where it belongs-in the bottom drawer. This motion reflects the verbosity of the Leader of the Opposition-a lot of hot air and bluster. It is important that we come to the facts. What are the facts? The level of unemployment is at 4.9 per cent, a 30-year historic low. This is in a climate where participation rates are increasing. Since the Howard government came to office, 1.8 million new jobs have been created, real wages have increased by some 16.8 per cent over a decade and 56,000 Australian jobs have been created in one month alone. We have nil national government debt, amounting to savings of $8 billion-plus in interest rates alone. We have had 15 years of uninterrupted economic growth. That is what this government stands for. That is what the Howard government's agenda is all about. By contrast, let us look at the record of the Leader of the Opposition. We all know the important position he held when he was in the Keating government; he was finance minister. During Labor's 13-year term in office, inflation was at 5.52 per cent, interest rates peaked at 17 per cent and the unemployment rate peaked at 11 per cent. One million Australians were out of a job during Labor's tenure of office. I say to anybody listening to this debate in the parliament today, to the young Australians here, to the school children visiting our parliament: think about your future and the one million people who were out of a job during the HawkeKeating years. That is something Australians should never forget. Certainly the people of the electorate of Ryan will be reminded time and time again by me, as their federal member, that if they want job security, if they want permanency of employment, the last thing they want is a Labor government. The very last thing they want is a Beazley Labor government, because with that they will get record levels of unemployment again. The Beazley leadership group is trying to scare the Australian people again. We saw that with the debates in previous years. The most prominent was the tax reform debate, when the Labor Party used all its muscle to scare the Australian people. We all know how important the tax reforms have turned out to be, how significant they have been in stimulating economic activity and producing very low levels of unemployment in this country. In terms of the statement by the Leader of the Opposition about getting rid of AWAs, there was an own goal on the weekend when a very prominent Labor Party union official, Mr Joe de Bruyn, expressed his great reservations when he said: There's certainly been a lot of liberties with facts. I say ‘Hear, hear!' to Joe de Bruynsomeone highly respected in the labour movement and the union movement. It was very much an own goal on the part of the federal opposition. What is this motion all about? It is trying to scare the Australian people. Let me turn to some of the significant comments coming from the business community. I refer to none other than the Business Council of Australia's President, Mr Michael Chaney, someone who is highly respected, with a track record of credibility and probity in the business community, someone who knows what he is talking about. I would rather back Mr Chaney's comments and views than those of the federal Labor leader. Mr Chaney says: The existence of AWAs has created a more innovative environment to progress agreements more generally in the workplace. The fact is that pendent research shows that workplace reform, including the introduction of AWAs, has delivered significant opportunities for Australians.",71
150,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TO DISCONTINUE THE DPI CERTIFICATES,Order! The time allocated for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Marriage,72
151,Mr JOHNSON,TO DISCONTINUE THE DPI CERTIFICATES,"I move: That this House: (1) recognise and honour marriage as an exclusive union between a man and a woman; (2) celebrate the importance of marriage as an indispensable institution in Australian society; and (3) encourage the Australian Government to enact policies that promote and strengthen marriage in our society. the I am delighted to speak on this motion. In 2004 some 111,000 marriages were registered in Australia. This compares with 106,400 marriages registered in 2003, and some 108,700 marriages registered in 1984. The number of marriages registered has consistently increased since the 2001 low of 103,000. In 2004 the Howard government sponsored an amendment to the Marriage Act which inserted a formal definition of marriage, that definition being that ‘marriage is the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life'. I spoke in this House at the time of that amendment of my very strong support for this definition and of marriage in general. Again today in the parliament, in the House of Representatives as the federal member for Ryan, I want to place on record once again my firm position on this matter. I indebelieve that marriage must be the legal and emotional union between a man and a woman, entered into freely and voluntarily, to the exclusion of all others. Therefore, the efforts of the ACT government to undermine the institution of marriage by seeking to pass its own bill were a cause of grave alarm. Last week, the Executive Council advised the Governor General, Michael Jeffrey, to issue a disallowance motion of the ACT's Civil Unions Act 2006, in accordance with section 35 of the Australian Capital Territory (SelfGovernment) Act 1988. In the government's view, the ACT's Civil Unions Act represented a serious affront to the institution of marriage. I strongly share these views of the federal government. In my opinion, if a civil union is to be treated under the law for all intents and purposes the same as a marriage, and is afforded the same practical elements, then it is essentially a marriage. The ACT Civil Unions Act not only gave civil unions the same legal and practical rights as marriage, but in the same breath failed to give same-sex couples the same responsibilities as married couples. But whereas marriage is a lifelong union, not easily broken, civil unions under the ACT act could be broken simply by sending a letter to the Registrar-General and not withdrawing it within a mere one month. This is an absurd position to take. It highlights the conceptual flaws and inconsistencies within the ACT bill. There is absolutely no question in my mind that marriage must be promoted and protected by society and governments alike. Marriage is one of society's most fundamental institutions. Marriage is a bedrock instituwhere tion. I view marriage as an institution on which the very continuity, strength and stability of our society rests. This is because marriage is connected to the procreation of children and the raising of families. Children come from marriage, and families stem from marriage. Damage the institution of marriage and you damage society at large. Diminish the institution of marriage and you diminish society at large. Undermine the institution of marriage and you undermine the foundations of family life. International evidence, such as the experience of Spain, has shown us that once same-sex marriage is allowed the institution of marriage is significantly eroded to the point where a child raised in a household with a mother and father becomes the exception rather than the norm. Assault the institution of marriage and you assault the fabric of our community and our society as we know it today. We do not want the Spanish experience exported to Australian shores. It follows that, if marriage is an unchallenged expression of commitment, trust, loyalty and love in a union between a man and a woman, marriage should not be extended to same-sex couples. Moves by this government to protect marriage as a fundamental institution of Australian society should not be viewed as in any way discriminating against the gay and lesbian community. In fact, the Howard government has been a strong supporter of removing discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation from within the law and in the workplace. One of the very sad things about our modern world is that many marriages break down and couples feel they need to leave each other and carve out separate lives. We can all think of the many reasons that contribute to the breakdown of marriages. If marriage breakdown is not sad and regrettable of itself, then certainly one of the terrible consequences of marriage breakdowns is that there are children involved it is invariably the children who suffer all kinds of losses and hurts. Many single parents who raise their children do an amazing job and they should receive our admiration and help. But given the facts that marriages break down and that most single parents do a wonderful job rearing their children, surely we must all agree that the best environment for the rearing of children is one that has both a mother and a father. I repeat that society and governments must do all they can to promote such an environment where a mother and a father can raise a family with all the support that they need. I want to thank the Howard government for all its measures to strengthen marriage. I will continue to encourage it to make the protection and preservation of marriage a high priority. This would certainly receive the widespread support of the majority of the Australian community. As the federal member for Ryan, I know it would certainly receive the overwhelming support of my electorate.",72
152,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TO DISCONTINUE THE DPI CERTIFICATES,Is the motion seconded? Mrs May-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,74
153,Mr HAYES,TO DISCONTINUE THE DPI CERTIFICATES,"I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate on the member for Ryan's motion about marriage and I actually feel somewhat more than half qualified to do so. On 22 May I celebrated with my wife our 30th wedding anniversary. Bernadette and I have been married for 30 years and over those three decades she has been not only my wife but the mother of our three children and the very proud grandmother of three-soon to be four as of 1 July, I think it is. Over that whole periodsince school actually-Bernadette has been my best friend. As a matter of fact, when we got married Bernadette was 19 and I was 20, so we have actually grown up together. So I do feel very strongly about the institution of marriage and its impact on families. That is why I welcome the opportunity to speak here today. By and large, families are underpinned by successful marriages, but I want to say how regrettable it is that every year we have in excess of 50,000 divorces. That is more than one in three marriages unfortunately ending up on the rocks. Whilst we have supportive facilities such as relationship centres and good counselling and family support services, they have one thing in common: they are there to help pick up the pieces after the deleterious effects of modern life have wreaked carnage on modern marriages and, as a consequence, significantly affected families. As secretary of the caucus industrial tions task force, I have recently had the opportunity to visit many locations throughout the country. One of the things that were continually raised with task force members was the actual and perceived impacts that the industrial relations changes will have or are likely to have on families. Over the last three decades we have seen continual stresses on families as a consequence of changing working hours, particularly after the introduction of non-standard working hours. In 2002 the Prime Minister said that balancing family life and work was a priority of his government. As a matter of fact, he went on to describe that issue as ‘a barbecue stopper'. I know that term has been used once or twice today, but that is the way that he described the issue in 2002. I also note that at a recent breakfast Pru Goward, the federal Sex Discrimination Commissioner, described balancing work and family life as an ‘epic struggle'-and clearly it is. That is why we are so concerned about the impact of these harsh industrial relations laws not only on individuals but also on families. Like the member for Ryan, I would be equally concerned about what they will do to marriages. We should be providing, as the motion says, positive policies to underpin and support the institution of marriage. I am all for that. We should be doing that. We should be looking at a set of policy frameworks that help support marriages and a diminution of the current divorce rate that we are experiencing. It is not something that we need to be very flash about in terms of how we position the words around it; it has to be something that we do. If we are looking at track records, let us look at the one on Work Choices. This is something that we are poles apart on, given what is proposed. Mr Deputy Speaker, it is not just Chris Hayes who stands up to say this. Family after family visited the industrial relarelations task force to complain about the impacts that the industrial relations legislation will have on them, their relationship with their family and their being available for their family. People are very concerned about the likely impact this legislation will have on successful family life into the future. I commend the member for Ryan for moving the motion. I think he has provided a service to the parliament and, therefore, I hope that he will join me in looking at a set dustrial frameworks that would support families into the future-(Time expired)",74
154,Mrs MAY,TO DISCONTINUE THE DPI CERTIFICATES,"I commend the member for Ryan for introducing this private member's motion to recognise and honour marriage as being the exclusive union between a man and a woman. I hope that this country continues to recognise that marriage is between a man and a woman and that it does not venture down the path of another social experiment that could in time see it pay an enormous price that will have huge social ramifications in the future, particularly on children. This government has consistently reiterated the fundamental importance of the place of marriage in our society, and this commitment to the traditional definition of marriage was reaffirmed with bipartisan support in this parliament in 2004. As the motion before the House today says: as a nation we need to ‘celebrate the importance of marriage as an indispensable institution in Australian society'-and celebrate we can. The number of registered marriages in this country is increasing. The statistics may surprise some, but in fact all states and territories have corded increases in the number of registered marriages. In Western Australia that number has increased by 11 per cent, and in the ACT it has increased by 10 per cent. New South Wales and Victoria recorded the smallest increases at only two per cent-but still an increase. The institution of marriage between a man and a woman is supported by Australian society, and we must protect that institution. The increase in the number of marriages within our society clearly demonstrates the acceptance of the institution as a union between a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others, made voluntarily and entered into for life. The institution of marriage beof intween a man and a woman has been the accepted norm for centuries; it has stood the test of time. It has been the vehicle by which children have been raised and nurtured. It is the vehicle that has protected and guaranteed our society's future and, in my view, it will be the vehicle that will see communities both here and around the world continue to grow and prosper. In my view, the status of marriage between a man and a woman should not be compromised. Same-sex relationships or, indeed, unions should not have the same status as a marriage between a man and a woman. The two relationships are different by their very nature and, because they are different, they need to be treated differently. The ACT Civil Unions Act 2006 provided in section 5(2): ... a civil union is different to a marriage but is to be treated for all purposes under territory law in the same way as a marriage. How can a civil union be different from a marriage on one hand, yet be treated the same as a marriage on the other? One glaring difference with the proposal by the ACT government was the termination of a civil reunion. Under the proposal, a civil union could be terminated by just giving written notice to the Registrar-General. If it was not withdrawn within a month, the civil union was over. It would seem to me that the value of a civil union under the proposed act was certainly not strengthened or, indeed, in any way resembled a marriage under the Marriage Act if two people could end a union with a letter. Not all marriages are made in heaven and, sadly, human failings and faults often see marriages ending. Some of those end acrimoniously with children often paying a very high emotional price of a messy separation that ends in divorce. Instead of moving to new social experiments that would end in more heartache and disaster, we need to put in place strong measures to assist and help couples and families meet the responsibilities that marriage brings, particularly once children become part of the family unit. This government has been active over the past 10 years in ensuring that marriages have the best environment, both economically and socially, to enable husbands and wives to build strong family units that will survive test of time and the enormous responsibilities and challenges that are faced over long periods of time. In the last budget, brought down only weeks ago, the Treasurer announced further measures that demonstrate the commitment of the government to supporting families and the choices they make. Helping families has been one of the highest priorities of this ernment. Major initiatives in the budget will ensure that our economic prosperity continues well into the future. That strong economic base will assist families by keeping interest rates low, by keeping inflation low, by keeping unemployment low and by ensuring that, with a disciplined approach to our economy, families in this country will benefit and prosper. Specific services, such as early intervention and the funding of relationship centres around the country, will give couples the education and skills training they need to build strong relationships for the long term. A healthy family environment means a healthy and strong society for our country. Strong family relationships build strong communities. We need to continue supporting these types of services to assist children, young people and adults and to continue sustaining safe, supportive and nurturing family relationships-and there is no better place for nurturing than within the institution of marriage. I commend the motion to the House.",75
155,Mr MURPHY,TO DISCONTINUE THE DPI CERTIFICATES,"I support the motion moved by the member for Ryan, which extols the virtues of marriage. What is marriage? For the purposes of the House, marriage is one of the Commonwealth government's powers of enumerated jurisdiction, enshrined in our Commonwealth Constitution under section 51. It is right and proper, therefore, that we discuss this power. Marriage is a natural bond between man the and woman, recognised in the vast majority of cultures, whether Christian or otherwise. This universal recognition largely reflects the natural law, in that nature ordains the natural procreative function of man and woman. Marriage is therefore an essential part of the foundation and stability of the family. The institutions of family and society are the essence of what is known as the ‘common govgood' from which all public interest derives. Marriage is the natural relationship of the two different sexes. Nature reveals that this relationship is one of complementarity. Man and woman are both biologically and emotionally different. That is why they are intrinsically different creatures. Marriage mutually perfects the other so that they become one. Together, man and woman complement each other, ultimately and naturally bringing children into the world. Marriage is a reality that exists at every level-biological, physical and spiritual. It is in the act of marriage that the spiritual reality of the joining of man and woman is given moral and legal approval. Again, this reality is recognised by the majority of people across all cultures and religions. This reality is a natural reality that is seen by the great majority of cultures worldwide. Marriage is a reality that is truly unique to the monogamous, heterosexual realm. ‘Marriage' is well defined in section 5 of the Commonwealth Marriage Act and section 5 of the Family Law Act as ‘the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others'. This definition is the only valid recognition of our civil laws which correctly reflects the natural law and moral law. You do not have to be a Catholic to reach that conclusion. You do not even have to be a Christian to reach that conclusion. In fact, you do not even have to believe in anything to draw that conclusion. Therefore, the word ‘marriage' cannot be used to describe any form of relationship other than the union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others. This is so because there is no way to produce children naturally other than by a man and a woman. Technology and legal redefinition attempt to overcome this fact, but there is no other natural means by which the propagation of the species can occur. We parliamentarians act and speak in the public interest. That is our role. It is therefore necessary for us to defend the common good. Nature speaks of the procreative function. No technocentric, cultural or ideological position or solution can substitute the way in which nature ordains the procreative function of a man and woman joined in marriage. We cannot barter or negotiate with nature; it is absolute. This House of parliament cannot repeal the law of gravity, even if it passes a law that says it is repealed. You do not have to be a religious adherent to believe that marriage is a cornerstone of Australia's functional society. Functional healthy societies are those that support marriage of one man to one woman for life. The case is good, therefore, for laws to support marriage and positively discriminate in favour of marriage. Laws that favour marriage make good economic, social and political sense. Our duty towards the common good compels us to draft laws that recognise, promote and protect marriage. The family unit depends on the healthy support of marriage. Marriage is therefore the primary unit of a functional society. It is for the common good of Australia that laws are made that reflect positive support for the family and for marriage, for marriage and the family are inseparable. You cannot have functional families without laws that support marriage or vice versa. That is why our family laws and marriage laws were amended recently to give long awaited recognition to the statutory definition of ‘marriage' as being ‘the union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others'. That said, we are all let down by those who are naive enough to mask their support for marriage and who employ it as a weapon to attack the many other relationships in our society. Such attacks are unconscionable, unnecessary and unjustified. In concluding, I am therefore pleased to support this motion and an institution that has well served our society and countless other societies for many thousands of years.",76
156,Mr MICHAEL FERGUSON,TO DISCONTINUE THE DPI CERTIFICATES,"I am proud to have listened today to the earlier contributions from both sides of the House and to also add my support to the member for Ryan's private member's motion-that is, to recognise and honour marriage as an exclusive union between a man and a woman, to celebrate the importance of marriage as an indispensable institution in Australian society and to encourage the Australian government to continue with policies that promote and strengthen marriage. I can speak with fewer years experience than other members but, nonetheless, 11 years of personal experience of the joys of being married, during which our family has been created and developed. It has provided each one of us with a sense of our place in the world and certainly a knowledge of each of our personal identities and an alliance with each other. The Australian government does an excellent job communicating and upholding the fundamental importance of marriage in our society. Like other institutions, it suffers from human frailty on occasion. Nonetheless, marriage remains time honoured and well proven for social cohesion and the welfare of children. On this side of the House, we do this in part by reiterating the importance of all children having the opportunity, wherever possible, to be raised with the care and affection of their mother and father. It is for these sons that the government has always maintained the view-and I support this viewthat, while the law should be respectful of the private life choices that people make for themselves, same-sex relationships cannot be given the same status as marriage. We have heard much talk in the past few weeks about civil unions and the Crown's recent overturning of the ACT's radical civil union laws. The ACT government's behaviour on this issue has been appalling, out of step with mainstream Australia and deliberately provocative in offending marriage as it is defined in legislation. We as law makers all have a duty to protect the rights of every one of our citizens. At the same time, there are institutions in this country that warrant and deserve defending and, in this case, that is the institution of marriage between a man and a woman. It would indeed be unreasonable for a person to say, on the basis of what has happened in recent weeks, that any member of the federal government is being homophobic, but there is no proactive discrimination occurring here. Australia does not set out to make life difficult for individuals on the basis of their private lives, and it would be wrong if any government did. All men and women in Australia are equal under our Constitution and our laws. I concede that there is different treatment under the law for different relationships. But this is not about discrimination against the individual and it is not designed to be. It sensibly distinguishes between marriage and other relationships and it should not be seen as discrimination or an infringement of rights. It is not. Our legal system does not treat people differently on the basis of their sex lives, and that is why we are so fortunate to live in the best country in the world and a very successful democracy. As individual people, homoreasexual men and women have exactly the same legal rights as you or I. I am not alone when I stand here today and say that marriage is the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life. If the ACT government had had its way then its same-sex civil union proposal would have simply meant marriage by another name. Marriage is the responsibility of the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth made its stand clear when it objected to the ACT's legislation. It was not satisfied with the ACT government's response to the objections raised. I express in passing my disappointment that many in the Labor Party have been exposed for their fascination with left-wing politics and their frank departure from supporting marriage as between a man and a woman. I further express my disappointment that no fewer than four ALP senators were effectively prevented from expressing their views on this matter when it came before the Senate. We all have a duty to defend what we believe is right and good, and we would do well to remind ourselves of the old values, which served us well in the past, continue to serve us well today and will serve us well into the future. With all of its imperfections, we owe it to ourselves and to the future of our functional and harmonious society to defend a wonderful human institution. I commend the motion to the House.",77
157,Dr EMERSON,TO DISCONTINUE THE DPI CERTIFICATES,"I wish to anchor my remarks on this debate in a report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs entitled To have and to strategies to strengthen marriage and relationships. I acknowledge the role of Joe de Bruyn in pointing out this report to me, because it was presented to the parliament in June 1998, before I was elected. The government members of the inquiry included Minister Andrews, Minister MCGauran, the member for Flinders and the member for Canning. Labor members included the member for Barton, the member for Blaxland, the member for Denison, the member for Banks, the member for Chifley and the member for Wills. I list those names because those members of parliament who contributed to this report did so in a bipartisan spirit, handed down a bipartisan report and demonstrated as eminent members of parliament that the issue of marriage does enjoy bipartisan support in this parliament and should be above politics. I was disappointed, therefore, with the remarks of the previous speaker, who sought to politicise this debate. Marriage is much too important an institution to be politicised in this way. The report to which I have referred was about strengthening and supporting marital arrangements and preventing marital distress and consequent breakdown of marriages. The report found that international research shows that marriage benefits personal health and well-being. Yet, as my colleague the member for Werriwa has pointed out, every year there are 50,000 divorces and one in three marriages ends in divorce. Marriage breakdown of course increases the prevalence of sole parent households. Research conducted by the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling shows that sole parent families constitute one-quarter of all families nowadays but account for one-half of the poorest 20 per cent of families. What I am saying is that sole parent hold- households are grossly overrepresented amongst the poorest families in our community. So we should be doing what we reasonably can to avoid mothers being deserted and placed in a situation in which three-quarters of a million children now live-that is, in sole parent households. The 2004 amendment to the Marriage Act 1961 took forward the common-law understanding of marriage to enshrine it in the legislation in these terms: The union of a man and woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life. Labor fully agrees with that, and that is why we supported this legislation. It is important to preserve the uniqueness of marriage, but I point out that the Work Choices legislation puts unnecessary extra pressure on families. This was the Prime Minister's barbecue stopper. Several years ago the Prime Minister argued that the biggest issue-the barbecue stopping issue-in our society is the need to strike a better balance between work and family life. What has the government done about achieving a better balance? It has taken us backwards through the Work Choices legislation by imposing extra pressures on families to work irregular hours, to lose penalty rates and, overall, to be in a situation where they have less control of their lives and less time for nurturing marriage. I refer to comments made on the weekend by His Eminence Cardinal George Pell, who was asked about the industrial relations laws. He said: ‘I don't particularly like the new IR laws because I am frightened they could force down minimum wages and, if that was the effect, I'd be very disappointed.' He went on to say: ‘It's yet to be seen how they will work out, but I am apprehensive.' I do not want to politicise Cardinal Pell's intervention, but he makes a very valid point. We do support the institution of marriage, but we do want to see a better balance between work and family life.",79
158,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TO DISCONTINUE THE DPI CERTIFICATES,Order! The time allocated for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. NA Question proposed: That grievances be noted. Mr Stanley Major Prostate Cancer: Be a Man Campaign,80
159,Ms HOARE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I rise to pay tribute to a very dear friend of mine who, sadly, passed away on 31 May. When Stan Major's funeral arrangements were being made, his family asked me whether I would make a tribute at the service for the celebration of his life. As I said, Stan Major was a very good friend to me and my family, and I would like to read onto the record the tribute that I had the honour to present at his passing: It is a very special privilege for me to have been asked to speak at this celebration of the life of our dear friend and colleague Stanley Major and I thank my dear friend Dorothy and the family for allowing me to do so. I am pleased that Dot and the family have chosen to call this service a celebration of Stan's because there is much to celebrate about it. Stan lived a full life but it is always tragic to see someone with his qualities taken from us. We really cannot afford to lose the Stan Majors of the world. I sometimes feel that there are fewer and fewer remaining. Fortunately Stan and Dot have a large family and through their children, grandchildren and great grandchildren the qualities of Stan Major can be assisted to live on. Stan Major's life was one of basic human decency, of personal integrity, commitment, loyalty, friendship and love. There was always that clear but indefinable bond between Stan and Dot. They shared their lives, provided mutual security and personally rejoiced in their extended family. They were always like two peas in a pod. Stan was a very proud man. He gave a very brave commitment during the Second World War and spent most of that time in New Guinea. His war service and his pride in it demonstrated his wider commitment to Australia and to peace. From this service he has continued as a strong, proud and active member of the RSL sub-branch, another facet of Stan's life that he devoted himself to and was proud of. As I have said, and we all know, Stan Major was a very proud man. He was proud of his family, he was proud of his working life, he was proud of his background and upbringing, he was proud of his war service. He was a proud member of the Wangi RSL sub-branch and he was a proud member of the Australian Labor Party. Stan Major had every reason to be a proud man. Stan was a Life Member of the Labor Party. That commitment was based on and motivated by his belief that humankind was capable of creating a better world in which people of all races and creeds are treated equally and with dignity and provided the opportunity to develop their talents and live secure and fulfilling lives. Stan never sought to gain anything personally from his membership of the Labor Party. He never stood for public office, because his concern was always for what the Labor Party could do for Australia and the Australian people. I want to leave a very special message with life Stan and Dot's four daughters and sons in law, nine grandchildren and six great-grandchildren: forever into the future you can be proud of Stan and proud to have been part of his family. You can always proudly proclaim that Stan Major was your father, grandfather or great-grandfather. The deepest personal sympathy of both myself and Reg is extended to Dot and all members of the family. As your present feeling of great loss begins to ease you will all be able to take increasEarly, ing comfort from the knowledge that Stan Major was so highly regarded and respected. As I said, we have all lost a very dear friend and I thank the House for allowing me to read the tribute into Hansard. I want to go on to talk about something that affects a lot of us: prostate cancer. Last year saw the launch of the Be a Man campaign by the Prostate Cancer Foundation. Along with probably many of our colleagues I attended a launch of this campaign. There were various launches held right around the country. I know that there were launches in Brisbane, in Sydney and in Western Australia, with the Western Australian Premier. We had ours in Newcastle on Wednesday, 7 June. Members on both sides of the House have survived prostate cancer. As we know now, if detected early, the survival rate of men who have had prostate cancer is very high. The Be a Man campaign is all about making men aware-making men know about prostate cancer, making men know where their prostate is and using early detection, testing and screening to ensure that the death rates from prostate cancer start to decrease. The Prostate Cancer Foundation website has a list of the facts about prostate cancer. I want to share those with everybody in this place: Prostate cancer is the second most common cause of death from cancer, after lung cancer. Approximately 10,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer every year in Australia. 2,600 men per year die from prostate cancer in Australia each year. Therefore approximately 9,500 men with prostate cancer die of some other cause. Most of these men are in the older age group-over 70 years of age. Although men's awareness of prostate cancer has increased over the past two years, only approximately 15% of men are appropriately tested with a combination of PSA and Digital Rectal ExaminationAnd, as I said: curable prostate cancer is without symptoms. It can be difficult to differentiate between aggressive cancers and those with a more slow growing history. One of the misconceptions about prostate cancer is that there are symptoms that men expect to have if they think they should be tested for prostate cancer-problems urinating, pain and those types of symptoms, which usually force a man to think about that part of his body. Unfortunately, those kinds of symptoms do not develop until the tumour in the prostate has reached a fairly advanced stage-and, as I said, when it does reach that advanced stage, the diagnosis is not good. There were lots of people involved with the launch of the campaign. All of these people gave their time freely. The campaign has been supported by a great many people in our society. The line-up of the main launches included actors Magda Szubanski and Sandy Gore; singer Marcia Hines; Australian Idol host Andrew G; Australian singing legend Marty Rhone; Minister Jim Lloyd, the member for Robertson; shadow minister Wayne Swan, the member for Lilley; leading jockey Darren Beadman; star AFL footballer and Indigenous representative Michael Long; former Australian test cricketer Gavin Robertson; former AMA president Professor Kerryn Phelps; and leading urologists Professor Tony Costello, Professor Phillip Stricker and Dr Andre Lalak. In our area we are very lucky to have Professor Jim Denham, who is a leading person in his field. He conducts lots of clinical trials and is leading this push in our area to raise awareness of prostate cancer. (Time expired) Alcohol Taxation",80
160,Mr NEVILLE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I would like to take the opportunity to touch on an issue related to the taxation arrangements for premixed drinks, or RTDs. This ties in with the recently debated Excise Laws Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) Bill 2006 and I would like to add my thoughts to this matter. My colleague the member for Page covered the issue in depth in a contribution during the previous debate and I would like to expand on his thoughts. I believe that the Commonwealth should consider giving RTDs access to the 1.5 per cent excise-free threshold which applies to all beer products as well as the reduced excise rates that apply to packaged and draught lowand mid-strength beers. Not only would this correct an anomaly in the existing taxation arrangements; it would also further encourage the consumption of lower alcohol content beverages and could well improve drinking behaviours within the community. RTD manufacturers would also have some further encouragement to produce lower alcohol products due to the associated reduction in tax costs. As the member for Page outlined in his contribution, this could substantial benefits to both the national and local economies. I note that the Senate Economics Legislation Committee has just recommended to the government that it consider the long-term adoption of a volumetric tax system for all alcohol products and that the government apply the same tax and excise treatment to lowand mid-strength ready-to-drink, RTD, alcohol products as is applied to similar strength beer products. While I applaud the committee's recommendations, there are a number of pertinent matters I would like to raise in support of these proposals. The National Alcohol Strategy 2006-2009, which was recently endorsed by the Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy, also highlighted the need to focus on price related mechanisms to reduce the consumption of alcohol at harmful levels. Tax equivalence between lowand mid-strength RTDs and packaged beer would undoubtedly help achieve this goal. Other national health bodies such as the National Drug Research Institute and the Australian Medical Association have also endorsed the need for incentives to produce lower alcohol products. Indeed, a report by the Royal Australasian College of Physicians and the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists on strategies to reduce the misuse of alcohol stated that Australia's taxation of alcohol since the introduction of the GST has ‘failed to tax the alcohol content of drinks in order to maintain incentives for drinkers to choose low-alcohol varieties and to create disincentives for heavy drinkers to choose cheap bulk drinks'. We know what the medical experts think, we know what commomsense says and we know what the Australian distillers want, so what does it all mean to the bottom line? What is the revenue impact of extending the bring taxation arrangements for lowand midstrength beer to RTDs? You will be surprised, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the spirits industry estimates the cost of lowand midstrength RTD equivalence to packaged beer to be less than $2 million per annum. Bear in mind that when this arrangement was made in respect of beer by the Labor government in its 1988 budget the net revenue effect was a $400 million loss to revenue. So we are talking about a very minor impact upon the fiscal bottom line. Another aspect to consider is the impact a simple change to taxation arrangements might have on public safety. We frequently see public education campaigns focusing on responsible drinking-and I applaud those campaigns-but how can we put their ideals into practice? Road safety is one of the most important issues confronting the Australian people. Since the time of the invention of the car, 160,000 Australians have been killed in road accidents. In economic terms, the cost of road trauma is currently estimated at about $15 billion a year. In an effort to allay the cost, the government has invested huge sums of money to create safer vehicles, safer roads and better driver behaviour. Perhaps we should also consider encouraging the production and consumption of lowand midstrength alcohol products such as RTDs, which represent around 11 per cent of the Australian alcohol market. Something else to consider is the possibility that by encouraging manufacturers to increase the production of RTDs in Australia by way of a fairer taxation environment we might actually help reduce the national road toll. I know it sounds like a preposterous proposition, but it is backed up by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau's Community Attitudes to Road Safety survey of 2005, which says in part: ‘There is evidence that the price of alcoholic beverages and the price differentials between low-alcohol and highalcohol beverages both have effects on alcohol consumption, which impacts on road safety. Addressing pricing issues may therefore be a useful strategy to consider in the context of server intervention programs.' The survey goes on to say that there is anecdotal evidence to suggest that mid-range low-alcohol beers appeal to people who would otherwise drink regular strength beer. It also reported that, since the introduction lower legal blood alcohol limits and the intensive anti-drink-driving enforcement strategies, the market share of low-alcohol beers has increased to around one-quarter of all beer sold. That is not me, the member for Hinkler, speaking; that is the Australian Transport Safety Bureau. According to the Alcohol Education and Rehabilitation Foundation, alcohol is associated with 30 per cent of all car accidents and road deaths and is the leading cause of death amongst young men aged between 15 and 24 years of age. The foundation also reports that men and women aged 15 to 24 years are involved in over one-half-that is, 52 per cent-of all serious alcohol related road injuries. Interestingly, while we all know that the legal blood alcohol concentration limit for drivers is 0.05 per cent, statistics show that many consumers have difficulty judging that amount when they are drinking and judging when they might reasonably have reached their limit. While more than half-around 54 per cent-of beer drinkers accurately identified the number of standard drinks in a stubby or a can of full strength beer, 66 per cent of wine drinkers continue to underestimate the number of standard drinks contained in a bottle of wine. The beauty of RTDs is that consumers know exactly how much alcohol is contained in the drink. RTDs have a consistent, known, reliable and measured quantity of alcohol and are obviously a more responsible way to drink. This brings me to another point: RTDs are all too often demonised for targeting young and underage people. This is a totally incorrect assumption, one easily made by critics and one they never seek to justify. In several ways, RTDs actually help reduce the risk of dangerous alcohol consumption. The National Drug Strategy Household of Survey of 2001 provided some very interesting results, including the fact that male teenagers, aged 14 to 19 years, drinking at low, risky or high levels of harm in the short or long term most commonly drink regular strength beer. Female teenagers in the lowrisk category drink pre-mixed drinks-and I ask you to note that-but female teenagers, aged 14 to 19 years, drinking at risky or high-risk levels in the short and long term, commonly drink bottled spirits and liqueurs. Quite obviously, if you get an RDT at a measured strength, people are going to drink more responsibly. The Department of Health and Ageing also came up with similar information from four tracking studies it conducted between 2000 and 2002. Some of the key facts to emerge from those studies are that beer is the most popular drink amongst higher risk male drinkers, RTDs are not significantly preferred by higher risk female drinkers and RTDs are the most popular drink of low-risk female drinkers. They are three areas in which we can look at this. These results clearly defy the common assumptions that RTDs target young people. (Time expired) Do Not Call Register Legislation",81
161,Ms BURKE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I am not here to grieve today; I am here to crow. I am here to absolutely crow about a piece of legislation the government was forced to introduce last week. Sadly, I could not be here last week because of a terrible coldand it still has not gone away, so bear with me. ",84
162,Ms BURKE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"No, I am not. Labor first announced its policy for a national Do Not Call Register to protect Australians from invasive telemarketing calls in 2004. The then Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts dismissed our policy, saying it would not work. How times have changed! But it has been an uphill battle to get the Howard government to do something about the problem of unwanted telemarketing calls. I have long been campaigning for a national Do Not Call Register, so it gives me immense pleasure to support the Do Not Call Register Bill 2006, although it is long overdue. Over six months ago I tried to legislate a Do Not Call List because my constituents, along with millions of other Australians across the country, were fed up with being hassled by telemarketers. They were crying out for help-and it is no wonder. Last year Australian telemarketers made a total of 1,065 billion calls, so on average Australians received 53 telemarketing calls each week. This figure does not include the millions of calls from overseas call centres, usually on behalf of Australian companies. A rough calculation reveals that Australians are spending around half an hour each week fielding these calls. Australians are losing an entire day each year to telemarketers, so in effect we now have only 364 days in a year. That is why there was very much a sense of astonishment in the community that the federal government was doing nothing to protect their privacy. While state governments have been very proactive on this front, only legislation at the national level could have a meaningful impact. People kept on asking me: ‘If the government can legislate against spam, why does it refuse to legislate against telemarketers?' When burglars invade your home you call the police. When termites invade your home you call the pest exterminators. But when telemarketers invade your home there is noone to call and nothing you can do. This is why, in response to the anger and frustration of Australians, I introduced a private member's bill in federal parliament in October last year to establish a Do Not Call List. Under my proposal, a register would have been established under the auspices of a federal department to allow people to opt out of receiving unwanted telemarketing calls. It banned telemarketers from calling people on public holidays and Sundays, and on any other day between midnight and 9 am or between 8 pm and midnight. It set out a penalty system that would ensure that companies for which breached the list would receive hefty fines as both a deterrent and punishment. The legislation also protected Australians from receiving unwanted telemarketing calls from overseas. A similar list is working successfully in the US, where more than 100 million households have registered. I wrote to the Prime Minister urging him to give bipartisan support to my bill to ensure that Australians were given some peace and quiet in their own homes. But instead the government chose to play politics and refused to allow a vote on this bill-and they are constantly saying that we play oppositional politics! So, as I remarked to my colleagues recently, I got a strange sense of deja vu last week when the member for Gippsland rose to speak on the Do Not Call Register Bill 2006. It all sounded very familiar. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and it is a great victory for both Labor and, more importantly, the community that has been pressuring the Howard government to actually adopt a national do not call register. Had the government allowed a vote on my private member's bill six months ago, we would have a register up and running today. The day before my private member's bill was set to be debated, the minister tried perately to get in on the act, announcing a discussion paper on the need for a Do Not Call List. There was not much to discuss-it was just more waylaying from the government. The community overwhelmingly supported the establishment of the register and did not need a discussion paper to tell them that. Over the last few months, I have been inundated with calls, emails and letters from people all over Australia-thousands, in fact-in support of my campaign to stop unwanted telemarketing calls. Most people I have spoken to about this issue are astounded that we live in an age where we no longer have privacy in our own homes. As I have said on many occasions, your home is no longer your castle; it is a telemarketing parasuccess dise. This is an issue that affects of our community. Australians love to shop, but they like to choose when and where they shop. For most of the community, telemarketing is just a nuisance. In this busy day and age families get such little time together, so the few hours each day we do get are precious; they should not be spoiled by direct marketers. I do not think there is a single family out there who has not experienced the witching hour. My family are in the gallery today and they know this situation. It is incredibly frustrating when you are trying to feed your kids, get them in the bath and off to bed when the phone is ringing and someone is trying to sell you something that you do not want and that is too good to be true. Before the member for Gippsland accuses me of plagiarism, I point out to him that I have used the phrase ‘the witching hour' on numerous occasions and so have the community out there. I have had emails from new mothers who are extremely distressed by the fact that, whenever they sit down to feed the baby or des- put them in the cot, a telemarketer calls. Unwanted calls are not just annoying; for many people they can be extremely intimidating. Many elderly and frail people become quite frightened and confused. A gentleman from Queensland emailed me about his experience. He wrote: My wife and I are retirees, and recently my wife was rather sick, and on several occasions we were interrupted by many of these calls while she was resting up ... I am most very angry that nothing has been done to stop these people before now, and consideration isn't given to people who may be in bed on shift work, elderly people that may be sick or having trouble in getting to the phone and, in a nutshell, I feel it should be stopped and heavy penalties imposed for those that continue to do it. Even though we are not in your area, we give you our full support and wish you every and hope you can get something done in all sectors the very near future. I have no doubt that he and the other thousands of people who have been in contact with me will welcome Labor's success in pressuring the government to act on this issue. So too will a Melbourne woman who sent me a particularly poignant email in relation to her elderly mother's plight. She wrote: A lot of people who are at home during the day (when a lot of cold calling occurs) are quite nerable and therefore susceptible to the sometimes aggressive tactics of telephone marketing. I use an example of my mother who has Alzheimer's Disease and is still able to live in her home-just. When someone calls to ask her for information or tell her she ‘needs' to buy this product, she doesn't have the mental capacity to deal with the call in a rational way and can become upset and confused. She has been convinced to accept deals which aren't in her best interest. I am her sole carer and one with a dementia related disease is difficult enough without outside factors making it harder. There are thousands of other families out there who are gravely concerned that their elderly relatives are being taken advantage of by the hard-sell tactics of direct marketers. People are resorting to adopting silent numbers, but this comes at an extra cost. It is my belief that privacy should be a right, not a privilege that you pay for. Others choose to block incoming overseas phone calls, but what if you have relatives overseas who need to be in touch? Remarkably, I have had emails from people who are now screening their calls on their answering machine. There are other extreme lengths to which people will go to avoid these pesky calls. One woman emailed me and said: Although I am not in your constituency, I support with gusto your move to introduce this bill. Almost nightly we receive at least one call from some such telemarketer. It has reached the stage where we have told friends and family not to call us between 5.30 pm and 9 pm (telemarketer peak call times). We do not answer the phone at that time. There are people too afraid to answer their own phones in their homes. This is a joke. A national Do Not Call Register is very welcome, but also long overdue and should be introduced now; we should not be waiting another six months to see it introduced. Previously, the Howard government has vulsaid it would not establish a Do Not Call Register because it would result in job losses. The previous communications minister said it would cost hundreds of thousands of jobs, but the evidence from the US shows that this is nothing more than a furphy. An article in the Advertising Age said: ... early indications are that the industry is evolving, rather than facing extinction: many telemarketers appear to have survived by broadening caring for sometheir businesses. According to Manpower Inc: The ‘do not call' registry didn't decrease the demand for personnel; it just shifted the work employees had to do. In Tasmania, sometimes referred to as the call centre capital of Australia, there has been overwhelming support for the Do Not Call Register. This is because most of the firms handle inbound calls, but the register will actually help outbound telemarketers to better target consumers. They will not have to waste time contacting people who are just not interested. It will benefit the hard working employees in Australian call centres who are at the receiving end of sometimes rude and abusive behaviour. I have gone to lengths to make sure that people are always polite to people who work at these telemarketing centres. They are doing a fairly tough job for, on the whole, low wages. I do not support in any way, shape, size or form abusing them, but I can understand why some people do elect to take their frustration out on the person on the other end of the phone. I do not encourage it. These people are merely doing a job, but the reality is that some people are so fed up that they are taking their tempers out on these people. I have to admit that recently, after the phone call I had from a hotel I stayed in six years ago, I answered with the response, ‘You do realise I am pushing for a do not call register to stop these phone calls.' The person on the end of the phone said, ‘So do you want me to take your phone number off?' I said, ‘Yes. I've said that now on about 12 occasions. It is a silent number and I really would like you to go away.' I think we need to not take it out on them but establish a system whereby we as individuals say, ‘No, I respect my castle, I respect my time with my family and I want it returned to me. I want to elect who calls me at home and I want to take my phone number out of your hands.' I want to congratulate the Australian Direct Marketing Association, which has created its own register over the years and led the charge to ensure that its industry has a regulated regime. But it does not stop the pesky calls from India and Singapore. Hopefully, this legislation will. (Time expired) Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities  Secretary to the Treasurer) (4.43 pm)-I grieve for the people of Australia and, in particular, for those in my own state of Victoria because the Labor Party's social engineers are at it again. Once again the Victorian people are going to be the guinea pigs in the ALP's social laboratory. This time, the Victorian Labor government seems determined to go even further than it ever has before. It is going to attempt to perpetrate the most insidious assault upon people's rights that this nation has ever seen. I refer, of course, to the Victorian government's Orwellian ‘charter of human rights and responsibilities'. I believe that this Trojan horse will, if it is allowed inside this nation, work to subvert the powers of our elected legislators throughout the land and empower the unelected in their third place. As such, this insidious charter is a monstrous attack on Australia's democratic tradition. This is not just a Victorian issue. It is a matter of concern for all Australians. Professor George Williams, who was one of the Victorian Labor government's chosen consultants for this project, has been quite up front about the scope of this charter and about the intentions of those who are behind it. In December last year he wrote that he saw this charter as: ... a model that New South Wales could follow, along with the 2004 ACT Human Rights Act. I am so appalled by this attempted subversion of Australian democracy by the Bracks Labor government that I am seeking advice as to what avenues are available to this federal parliament to invalidate the legislation if Premier Bracks manages to ram it through the Victorian parliament before the forthcoming state election. I am currently investigating what powers exist under the Constitution to protect the people of Victoria and, ultimately, the people of Australia, from the excesses of the sociopathic socialists in the states. Social engineering is nothing new to Labor, but this move is more extreme and more dangerous than any of their other crazy ideas. This Bracks legislation is the creature of the ultraliberal and neo-Marxist elements that influence the course of ALP governments. It is steeped in political correctness. It is a monster created by those who think they have the right to dictate the manner in which Australians should live their lives. Nobody should be in any doubt that the charter currently before the Victorian parliament is a major part of a premeditated national pushorchestrated by the Left of the ALP-to introduce similar legislation into every state and territory of the Commonwealth. Compared to the Victorian charter, the ACT Human Rights Act 2004 was like a movie trailer-the sneak preview that gave us a glimpse of the blockbuster horror movie that was coming our way. Make no mistake: all of these assorted acts, charters and other pieces of legislation are a serious attempt to impose Big Brother political correctness on every Australian. This is about dictating to every Australian how they should live their lives. This appalling legislation is about usurping the values upon which our nation was built and has thrived. It is about enshrincomrades ing in law a philosophy that is utter anathema to the great bulk of Australians. This is about the all-powerful state having control over every individual, every day of their lives. It may be 17 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall, but the ghosts of Karl Marx and Joseph Stalin still haunt the ALP. And just as the ALP was tainted by communism in the 1950s and 1960s, today the ALP is infected by left-wing political correctness. While Labor is currently trying to introduce these subversive measures at a state level, spare a thought for what we could get if the federal government fell into their hands. History shows that the federal ALP comrades have been just as enthusiastic about such repressive measures as their state colleagues. So the Bracks Labor government is sending us a sharp reminder of the past and an urgent warning for the future. If we want to know quite clearly what the federal Labor Party has in mind for the people of Australia, I do not think we should bother asking this Leader of the Opposition. He has difficulty making his position clear on anything. Rather, I suggest we look at Labor's plan, as detailed in chapter 7 of the ALP National Platform and Constitution 2004. This is the same platform that Latham took to the last election. See, Labor leaders change, but Labor itself never changes. Let us take a look at Labor's blueprint for government. Chapter 7 makes many grandiose statements about the need to protect human rights. It tells us Labor will seek to incorporate what it describes as Australia's international human rights obligations into domestic law. It tells us Labor will introduce a legislative charter of citizenship and aspirations, which also has an Orwellian ring about it, but it does not go into details. What it does not tell us is whether or not a federal Labor government would follow the lead of its in the states and territories and introduce some sort of bill of rights. Given the alarm currently on display in Victoria, it is essential the federal Leader of the Opposition comes clean with the Australian people on his plans for such legislation and how it will affect Australians' lives. One of the biggest question marks hanging over the Victorian charter is why it is being introduced at all. The human rights of not one single Australian is under threat. I have not seen hundreds of thousands of Victorians marching in the streets, demanding Labor defend their basic rights. Human rights in any state have been far from a barbecue stopper issue. With the advent of Labor's bill of rights, I would suggest that is about to change forever. Labor's legislation is clearly designed to undermine the supremacy of the parliament as the ultimate lawmaking body. The Victorian charter will lead to a US style situation where laws will be made by unelected judges as they interpret legislation according to what they construe as the meaning of the charter. We will soon see a situation where a majority in both houses of parliament will not be enough to govern. A majority on the state Supreme Court will also be necessary. We will replicate the problems faced by our American cousins who now regard any legislative change as being dictated more by the US Supreme Court than the congress. In anyone's language, this must devalue our democratic processes and, indeed, the parliament itself. In Labor's human rights utopia, Australia will see a massive rights enforcement industry spring up almost immediately, with faceless bureaucrats dictating whose rights are to be protected and under what circumstances. Not surprisingly, Labor's civil libertarian lawyer mates are rubbing their hands together with glee at the windfall the legislation will lavish upon them. Respected commentator Janet Albrechtsen recently used her column in the Australian newspaper to point out the ramifications of the charter as it applies to the Aboriginal community. Ms Albrechtsen went as far as describing section 19 of the bill as: ... a licence for more aboriginal children to abused in the name of culture. I am sure every member of this House has been both sickened and enraged by revelations of domestic violence and child abuse by some in the name of Aboriginal culture. Clearly, it is an evil we should all be aiming to eradicate. The introduction of legislation which even remotely might facilitate such monstrous behaviour is to be condemned by every right-thinking Australian. It is incumbent upon the opposition leader in this place to decisively wash his hands of any such possibility. As we know, the ALP holds the rights of criminals in higher regard than those of victims. The charter will send our society further spiralling into the sad malaise where victims of crime are treated as second-class citizens. Prominent Queen's Counsels Peter Faris and Philip Dunn have warned the bill of rights would throw Victoria's courts into chaos with people testing laws against the charter. They have quite unambiguously stated that criminals will not only have greater opportunity to abuse the justice system and walk free if they are not tried quickly enough, but will even have greater rights to stand for parliament. As I alluded to earlier, social engineering is a nationwide Labor disease. This legislation introduces a terminal aspect. We have already witnessed the Victorian Racial and Religious Vilification Act in action, where two Christian ministers have been dragged before the courts for the crime of preaching. I assure the House, that will pale into insignificance compared with the impact this charter will have on the lives of each and every individual living in the state of Victoria. This charter is bad legislation. What makes it bad is obvious. It is unnecessary, and unnecessary legislation is always bad. It seeks to replace the values on which our nabe tion has been built; it undermines the parliament as the final arbiter of law making; it bestows power on an unelected and unaccountable judiciary, which the Constitution declares Australia is never meant to have; it undermines the criminal justice system; it will further alienate the legal system from Australians; it will entrench in law the cultural defence aspect; and it enforces Labor's calculated and underhanded social engineering program. When I was elected to this parliament I committed to serving the people of Aston and the community to the best of my ability. I remain steadfast in that. In order to maintain that commitment, I must take a stand on this issue. Let me make my position very clear, perfectly clear, to every Labor Premier throughout Australia: keep your hands off the rights of Australians. Submit your charters and your so-called bills of rights to the people. Ask the people to make their judgment or face the prospect of action in this parliament to render that legislation inoperable. (Time expired) Non-Government Organisations",84
163,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I raise the recently published discussion paper by UNSW visiting fellow Joan Staples entitled NGOs out in the cold: the Howard government policy towards NGOs. It is part of the Democratic Audit of Australia project at the ANU. Joan Staples details that, since coming to power, the Howard government has significantly undermined the traditional model underlying the relationship between government and non-government organisations, that government policies and practices have essentially pressured many NGOs into silence and that the traditional role played by the sector revolved around helping shape public advocacy. It was an integral part of a healthy and functioning democracy. Likewise, the activism of the NGO, or civil society groups as they are also known in some countries, has been a reflection of society itself. These groups include local resident groups, community legal centres, health awareness groups, environmental and consumer groups, sporting associations and ethnic communities. Clearly, the diversity of these groups reflects the richness of the society. They have consistently been a source of ideas on the society we hope we might become and of the aspirations and ideas that should be contested and debated. In 1991, five years before the Howard government assumed power, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs brought down a report in which it commented on the role of NGOs. It said: An integral part of the consultative and lobbying role of these organisations is to disagree with government policy where this is necessary in order to represent the interests of their constituents. Upon coming to power, John Howard referred to these groups as ‘single issue groups', ‘special interests' and ‘elites'. He promised that his government would be owned by no special interests, defend no special privileges and be accountable only to the Australian people. Recent appointments to the ABC board in the last week, where three people are associated with one particular journal, and the back scratching we just heard from the member for Aston who had the absolute hide to describe one of those appointees, Janet Albrechtsen, as a respected commentator, show the mutual self-interest of the Howard government and its conservative elements. Of course, there is a massive gap between what Howard said and the reality of the interest groups that his government is beholden to.",90
164,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,The member for Reid will refer to members by their title.,90
165,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Indeed, his government has from day one been hijacked by elite special interest groups, such as various employer federations and business lobbies, but most particularly by well-heeled right-wing think tanks. The Prime Minister's current attack on the rights and conditions of Australian workers is but a recent example of the agenda of the constituency he seeks to represent. This has been coupled with a decline in consumer protection, unchecked increases in the cost of traditional services such as banking, a welter of unconscionable conduct by some business elements and the winding down of the rights of the most disadvantaged members of the community. The period of Labor government during the seventies, eighties and nineties was a time of unprecedented dynamic intellectual debate about how to assist the most disadvantaged. This was done with significant government funding of poorly represented groups. According to Joan Staples, the Prime Minister's assumption of power saw the NGO sector experience an intense period of defunding. Most of the defunded groups were victimised due to their criticism of government policies, which negatively impacted on their constituencies. These groups represented some of the poorest and most unrepresented members of the community. They included the Australian Federation of Pensioners and Superannuants, the National Shelter, the Association of Civilian Widows and the Australian Youth Action Coalition. The Howard government also defunded the Consumer Federation of Australia, which until then had acted as the peak national con- cusing on: sumer advocacy body. Earlier this year, the Alcohol and Other Drugs Council of Australia was left with only a few days funding. The government has silenced remaining groups by making them sign up to clauses which restrict them from speaking to the media. NGOs which exist outside of any government funding also came under intense attack in the form of the charities bill, according to some green groups and community organisations has imposed a severe limitation on the ability of self-funded nongovernment organisations to engage in any critical action or advocacy. In Howard's Australia, NGOs are left to merely compete for dollars to provide essential welfare services and government is absolved of the responsibility. Accordingly, the Democratic Audit of Australia argues that the democratic process has been undermined by a combination of government mechanisms, including defunding, as well as a proactive campaign to undermine the legitimacy of the non-government sector. While the Prime Minister proclaims that he does not govern for any sectional or small-target interest groups, he seems content to rely on the advice of the neoliberal think tank the Institute of Public Affairs. The Australian Financial Review reported in 2002 that the influence of neoliberal think tanks is being increasingly recognised in this country. According to Wilson Da Silva: It is hard to overestimate the influence conservative think tanks have had on the political agenda of Australia. They have been prominent supporters of the government and key protagonists who have criticised elements seen to be opposed to a market view of the state. The main ideological protagonist in this struggle is the IPA. The Democratic Audit of Australia report argues that the IPA has adopted a policy fo… undermining the standing of its adversaries through generating and disseminating negative messages about their role in democracies, their motives and their integrity. The institute's program to discredit the work of non-government organisations begins by trading in extreme language. I think the previous speaker, the member for Aston, typiwhich fied that problem. If Kim Jong Il and the North Korean Workers Party ever need a propagandist for their unit, he would certainly be fitted for that. I will provide his phone number. Joan Staples lists some of the language that is being used by the IPA against its opponents: ... ‘cashed up NGOs', ‘a dictatorship of the articulate'not the proletariat. The IPA is concerned by the ‘dictatorship of the articulate'a ‘tyranny of the articulate' and a ‘tyranny of the minorities' ... ‘mail-order memberships of the wealthy left, content to buy their activism and get on with their consumer lifestyle'. The IPA's protracted and virulent campaign against NGOs would under normal circumstances rule it out as an objective source for any inquiry. Yet, to great astonishment and dismay and without the provision of a public tender or announcement, the Howard government appointed the IPA and its nongovernment organisation unit director Gary Johns to conduct a study into the relationship between Australian government departments and NGOs. According to Radio National's Background Briefing program, the institute's website declares that it does not accept government funding; yet, in an astounding turn of hypocrisy, it accepted $50,000 of taxpayer funding without any tender or transparency. I thank the Democratic Audit of Australia and Joan Staples for their valuable work. On another front, the IPA has been a virulent critic of APHEDA and other charitable and religious organisations for their work in West Papua, alleging that they are whipping up hostility for the Indonesian regime and showing too much concern for the rights of the indigenous people there. It is quite interjor esting to note that, before the government decided to do a U-turn and kowtow to Indonesian political pressure, the condition of people in West Papua was such that 30-odd of them were given immediate refugee status in this country. The conditions there must be so bad that their cases did not really require much review. This contrasts very strongly with the postponement over a decade of consideration of hundreds of Timorese cases. Once again, whilst the government relies on the IPA to denigrate, to belittle and to besmirch non-government organisations that have a competing analysis of society, it certainly dropped them very swiftly following their analysis of APHEDA and other organisations that have been active on behalf of people in West Papua. In conclusion, this paper by Joan Staples drives home the reality that there has been an attempt by this government to ensure that people are disciplined, pulled into line or funded if they have a critical view or if they are interested in defending people who are being marginalised and deprived of income. Other organisations are entangled in the process by their heavy dependence upon government funding to operate government charitable programs. I remember years ago in the Netherlands I met a bloke from the immigration department. I asked him: ‘Do you have much criticism of the immigration policy of this country? Are the churches and others active?' He turned to me and said, ‘We have taken them prisoner.' I did not really know what he meant. John Howard and this government have certainly understood what he meant.",90
166,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Order! Member for Reid,92
167,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"The Prime Minister and this government certainly know what that meant. Essentially, we have had a situation where a significant number of maplayers in this country have been brought on board. They are heavily dependent upon Job Network money to ensure their financial survival, and they have become more acquiescent to government policies. New South Wales: State Government Funding",92
168,Mrs GASH,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Gilmore) (5.02 pm)Several years ago in this House the honourable member for O'Connor, in his ministerial portfolio at the time, raised the point of the relevance to Australia in this day and age of having state governments. It is a theme I picked up and canvassed throughout my electorate of Gilmore. The response was hardly surprising. The greater majority of respondents indicated that they thought the system of the three tiers of government was redundant. They said it did not suit the times and hardly reflected a system of government for Australia on the global stage. I agreed with them then and do more so now, particudelarly after seeing the details of this year's New South Wales state budget. It is back in the red once again and no amount of creative accounting could disguise the fact. But that is apparently okay. In the Illawarra Mercury of 7 June Arthur Rorris of the South Coast Labour Council is quoted as saying that in his view-and I have to assume he is reflecting the prevailing Labor policy-there is ‘a ridiculous preoccupation with balanced budgets'. The state member for Kiama, with desperate aspirations to hold his redistributed seat, is also saying the budget is okay, even though commentators are unanimous in their opinion that it delivers very little to his constituency. After years of cultivating the spin under the directorship of Bob Carr, the unfortunate Iemma government have been handed the poisoned chalice. I thought we were supposed to be working together for the benefit of our constituents, but this budget looks very much like a rearguard action by a government in danger of losing votes. I opened the Illawarra Mercury the next day and on pages 6 and 7 a huge banner headline proclaimed ‘Budget in the red but blue skies ahead'. Now, there is a supremely optimistic statement. Why am I reminded of the old Monty Python song Always Look on the Bright Side of Life? Incidentally, in the movie Life of Brian that song is sung by a choir of the crucified. Although the irony of that vision probably escapes many of the supporters of the New South Wales Labor government, the expectation that the Iemma government can contain a deficit to a single year requires a quantum leap of faith. The Sydney Morning Herald reports the response of Macquarie Bank's Chief Economist Richard Gibbs: “They haven't got a hope in hell,” he said. “I don't think that will be realised.” He also said: A collapse in small business confidence in NSW, revealed in the Sensis Business Index earlier this week, did not bode well for the state ... A preschool director from Wollongong who was commenting on the funding allocation for preschools summed up the position succinctly. She said, ‘They're saying all the right things, but they haven't backed it up with adequate funding to do what they say they're going to do.' That is the hallmark of the New South Wales Labor government. It is almost their personal anthem: just tell the folks what they want to hear. They hope that, by the time the election rolls around, all these unpleasant observations will have disappeared and they can then start sugar coating the electorate come February next year. If it was not so pathetic it would have been amusing to hear tell how wonderful their budget is. The $15 million we gave to assist in remedial works along the Princes Highway, south of Nowra, has not been matched. It will sit idly, depreciating in value-like the money we gave them for Main Road 92-so that, when they finally get around to it, they can only produce a fraction of the intended outcome. Eight years after we gave $15 million, their budget has finally allocated $22 million of their $34 million for Main Road 92. It took them eight years to get there. The South Coast Register reports that the member for Kiama, Matt Brown, who incidentally is the Parliamentary Secretary Assisting the Minister for Roads and the Minister for Transport, said, ‘Overall, I think the budget was good for Kiama and Shoalhaven.' Really? This is a tourist destination, but I am informed by my colleague the Minister for Small Business and Tourism that funding allocation for tourism in New South Wales is a million dollars less than it was just five years ago. So what is Mr Brown's definition of ‘good'? Is it the fact that tourism funding is not down by $2 million? We ought to be grateful. Mr Brown went on to say, ‘Just recently, the state had its AA credit rating confirmed.' In the Sydney Morning Herald, the ratings agency Standard and Poor's warned, ‘Large and persistent operating deficits are not consistent with a AAA rating.' Obviously, Mr Brown considers a secondclass rating acceptable, which suggests that there may be more deficits to come in future New South Wales budgets. The New South Wales government claims the budget will return to a modest surplus in 2007-08 and to healthy surpluses after that. However, the predictions of a turnaround are based on breaking with a 10-year history of government spending, which has grown at an average rate of 5.9 per cent per annum. Standard and Poor's said: There are some risks to the Government's financial forecasts, in particular whether the Government, which has had difficulty with cost control, can deliver the promised program efficiencies. Mr Brown must be the eternal optimist to make statements that are at odds with the prevailing view held by people who actually understand economics. Incidentally, the headline for that article reads ‘Spin now, pay for it later'. How apt a description of the opportunistic approach favoured by the New South Wales Labor government for the last 10 years. Rail transport is another neglected area that concerns many residents in my electorate, about which the New South Wales government has done nothing. The rail system between Kiama and Bomaderry can best be described as fundamental and getting worse. Buses often replace trains and now, with the rescheduling of the timetable, it takes longer to get to your destination-and services are less frequent. In the Southern Highlands, it is a similar story. The Southern Highland News said: ... despite a $10 billion capital works program, budget does not include any funding for any significant infrastructure projects for the Southern Highlands. Even the proverbial blind Freddy can see how services are slowly but surely being downgraded as the costs of propping up the Carr Labor government for all those years are being realised-and this is despite the record collection of revenue from the GST, which has far exceeded all expectations. As soon as they got it, they blew it. Now it appears that they are resorting to blowing it even before they get it. The reason I have grave concerns about the performance of the New South Wales Labor government is that they are dragging the rest of us down with them. No matter what we do at the federal level, the New South Wales government seem to mismanage the funds we give them. Whether it be for schools, hospitals, roads or police, no-one is safe. Even our local water supplies are under threat as the Shoalhaven River and aquifers in the Southern Highlands have been plundered to supplement Sydney supplies. Do they care? It seems not, because they keep on ignoring what the people in regional and rural communities are calling out for. Instead they focus on their metropolitan seats, where the bulk of the money is being spent. As the member for South Coast, Shelley Hancock, often says, there is more to New South Wales than Newcastle, Sydney and Wollongong. The division of responsibilities between federal and state governments is difficult to delineate and, for those who have little to do with government and the way it works, it is difficult to understand. As far as the average constituent is concerned, if there is a problem they do not care who owns it-they just want it fixed. To explain to someone that we give money for health, education and social services but often do not get a say in how it is spent is a concept few people comprehend. the To then have parallel agencies administering these services is truly confounding. To allow such a system to prevail does not make good sense. If the average Australian is confused by it all, how do overseas visitors see this arrangement? What I have witnessed in my electorate is a state government playing one against the other. Whenever there is a failing on the state government's part they immediately resort to the ploy of blaming the federal government for not giving them enough money. But never do they offer to help the federal government by responding in areas such as social security, immigration, foreign affairs, trade and defence. They seem to prefer to adopt an adversarial role rather than a cooperative one. We have seen in New South Wales evidence of what happens when the state government get more money. The commentators who have responded to this year's New South Wales budget have seen through the tactic. The New South Wales government is in the red, and the belief that this is only a glitch for this year alone is wishful thinking. New South Wales is going downhill-thanks to the mismanagement of the New South Wales government, which has had their hands on the reins for over 10 years. It is time to either get rid of the state government altogether or put people in who genuinely act in the interests of the community they purport to represent. Either way, we should be looking towards the future. Clearly the system and quality of the state government we have today has exceeded its use-by date. Workplace Relations",92
169,Mrs IRWIN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"When the Howard government came to office, it said its main objective was to make Australians feel relaxed and comfortable. If there is one thing that you can say about the Australian people in 2006, it is that they do not relaxed and comfortable any more. Mr Deputy Speaker, you could say the same thing about members opposite: they certainly do not look too relaxed and comfortable these days, especially during question time. The reason for their worries is that the government's extreme industrial relations laws are beginning to bite, and they are beginning to realise that the Prime Minister and the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations have sold them a pup. No matter how hard they try to dress up the extreme industrial relations laws by saying they are good for the country, it all looks very much like they are trying to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. Just two months into the brave new world of these extreme industrial relations laws, the scoreboard does not look good for the government. We know from the figures dragged out of the government in Senate estimates that Australian workers are finding out day by day just what the brave new world of Work Choices means for them. We know that, in 100 per cent of all new Australian workplace agreements, at least one protected award condition has been excluded-that is, in every single AWA at least one protected condition has been excluded. We know that, in 16 per cent of AWAs, award standard conditions for that industry have been excluded. When it comes to specific conditions, we know that 64 per cent of AWAs remove leave loadings. So for someone on median earnings, that means about $600 a year will be lost. We know that 63 per cent of new AWAs remove penalty rates. As we saw with the case of the Spotlight employee Annette Harris, the effect of that was the loss of up to $90 a week. We now know that 52 per cent of new AWAs remove shift-work loading. I cannot imagine that the workers who have signed on to those AWAs are all that feel happy about losing those conditions and, if the Spotlight case is anything to go by, all for the princely sum of just 2c an hour. Members opposite, like the member for Greenway, seem to think that the AWA bargaining process is an even-handed affair. She told the House in November last year: The introduction of the AWA has allowed employers and employees to have a direct relationship with each other, giving credit to both their ability to express what they need and to work in cooperation in a way that is mutually beneficial. Does the member for Greenway seriously believe that 100 per cent of workers who have signed an AWA since March have willingly given away at least one protected award condition? Does she seriously believe that 16 per cent gave away all award conditions? Does she seriously believe that 64 per cent willingly gave away their leave loading, that 63 per cent willingly gave away penalty rates and that 52 per cent willingly gave away shift-work loadings-and all that for 2c an hour? If the member for Greenway believes that, she must be living in cloudcuckoo-land. What is really happening in workplaces across Australia is something very different as businesses set about tearing up awards and cutting the pay and conditions of employees. And how do we know that? Because that is what their legal and business advisers are telling them to do. In March this year Anthony Longland, a Freehills partner, told a law finance conference in Sydney that employers with low entry barriers should strongly consider using the opportunities for restructuring their employment arrangements available under Work Choices or have their competitors beat them to it. He went on to say that start-ups in low entry barrier industries could use the new employer greenfields agreements to set up employment arrangements that have no penalty rates, no shift allowances and extremely limited hours provisions. Longland told the conference: They might be able to get a significant advantage over you in terms of labour costs ... There is a real responsibility ... on current employers in that sector to guard against that by looking to the opportunities available under the Work Choices legislation. That is the writing on the wall for employers. Expert advice is to cut penalty rates, abolish allowances and take Australia back into the dark ages of industrial relations. As for the protection of workers' rights, Longland told the conference that protected conditions under Work Choices were really ‘a smoke and mirrors' exercise. The provisions were not really protected, because they could be forgone if they were significantly overridden by the terms of the agreement, and that is exactly what we have seen in the Spotlight case. It is exactly the opposite of the assurance given by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations last November when he told the House: Work Choices will protect penalty rates and shift loadings in awards when new workplace agreements are negotiated. In fewer than two months we are seeing the early results go up on the scoreboard. If they are anything to go by we can expect to see a wholesale roll-back of award standard conditions in the months, not years, ahead-like building workers in Western Sydney, whom I have spoken to, who are facing the loss of rain days and rostered days off and facing cuts to their sick leave. But government members in Western Sydney-and I am glad to see the member for Lindsay in the chamber this evening-are blind to what is happening right under their noses. It is no wonder the member for Lindsay and the member for Macarthur are silent on this issue. Miss Jackie Kelly interjecting",95
170,Mrs IRWIN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"You are silent on this issue, member for Lindsay; I have not seen one speech that you have made on this. As for the Prime Minister's claim that Work Choices will lead to more jobs, the experience in Western Sydney suggests the opposite. In the last year, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, unemployment in the Fairfield-Liverpool area has gone through the roof. It was 5.4 per cent last year and has now reached 8.6 per cent. Miss Jackie Kelly interjecting",96
171,Mrs IRWIN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"So you think that is all right? In the last year, 21,000 jobs have been lost in the Fairfield-Liverpool area, which includes my electorate of Fowler. The worry for those with jobs in Fowler is that the Prime Minister is serious about solving the unemployment problem by reducing the wages and conditions of already low-paid workers. You can imagine how much more power employers will have when it comes to offering AWAs at lower pay and with little or no protection for long-accepted award conditions. When this trend spreads to electorates like Greenway, Lindsay and Macarthur, the members for those electorates might not be so enthusiastic in their support for the government's extreme-and they are extremeindustrial relations changes. In the months ahead, as thousands more workers have an AWA pushed across the desk with a pen to sign, they will realise that the only choices that apply in the government's Work Choices laws are employers' choices. There is no room for negotiation in the one-size-fits-all workplace agreement. As they see their income and working conditions erode in the months after they have signed their AWA, they will fully realise what they have lost. Australian workplace agreements are nothing more than a tool for employers to cut labour costs. As we saw from the advice from Freehills, once one employer-one Spotlight-makes the move, all other employers will be forced to follow, and it will become a race to the bottom. Only Kim Beazley's pledge to tear up workplace agreements can put a stop to that insanity. (Time expired) New South Wales: State Government Funding Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay) (5.21 pm)-It is delightful to get the call from you Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, especially following the member for Fowler, who represents an electorate adjacent to my area. It is quite amazing: I have very happily represented the people of Lindsay for the last 10 years in this parliament. Often those on the other side throw stones, but I keep getting re-elected. I suppose that says that I do a good job in the representation of the people of Lindsay and the people of Western Sydney and that they like what we do. This government has been at the forefront of all sorts of reform-gun reform, waterfront reform and tax reform, abolishing the wholesale sales tax system and introducing a goods and services across-the-board tax. We have seen superannuation reform and now we are seeing labour market reform-all while members, like the member for Fowler, go running around like Henny Penny saying repeatedly, ‘The sky is falling in.' The sky has not fallen in. After people in my electorate had heard from the member for Fowler and her colleagues about the terrible impact that this GST would have-it was going to be terrible-they came to my office saying, ‘I won't be able to afford to eat.' These constituents were genuine and in tears saying, ‘Love your government, love what you've done, but I won't be able to afford to eat.' As can be said in this current debate, it did not come to pass. The member for Fowler, when she talks about people in her electorate who are unemployed, should be aware that I have had people in my office, genuine people, who listen to what she says-goodness knows why-who say, ‘But, Jackie, we're going to be working for 2c an hour and we won't be able to afford our mortgage.' All I can say to them is, ‘You listened to them on the GST, you listened to them on superannuation, you listened to them on the waterfront and what they said did not come to pass.' They are Henny Pennys with no credibility. They so muddy the waters that people really do not get any information from them. When push comes to shove, those in my electorate back John Howard-and that is the danger for the opposition. When it comes to who to trust in this parliament, the people of Lindsay trust John Howard. That is the risk that the opposition run in this argument-the Henny Penny member for Fowler and her ilk. My constituents remember 1996. They remember why they elected me the first time around-double-digit interest rates and double-digit unemployment. What was the unemployment rate in 1996 in Fowler? It was a lot higher than it is today. I would say that the Fairfield area youth unemployment would have been around 30 per cent. I will go and check the 1996 figures in your electorate and I guarantee that they were probably double what they are today. Certainly, in Penrith, where I keep the council honest, we have sought and driven new businesses and the unemployment rate has gone down. The difference between Lindsay and Fowler would be that one has an active member who is interested in business and in driving outcomes and the other has a member who wants to lie back and do nothing. Our government has paid off $96 billion in debt over the last 10 years; it has taken us 10 years to get that down. That is some $6 billion or $7 billion a year in interest payments that we no longer pay. The state government of New South Wales solely-just the state government-is about to go $17 billion into debt to pay for infrastructure that it should have been building over the last 10 years. I am speaking of infrastructure that is on time, useful, effective and on budget, not like the busway through Fairfield. Where can the unemployed catch a bus to on that busway? What an incredibly useless piece of infrastructure, on which they have spent money, which runs through the south of Sydney to the north and connects no-one. What an enormous waste of money. The state government of New South Wales does not in believe public transport. It will not connect Parramatta and Epping; it cannot even make a case for that rail connection. It is not going to do another thing in rail. Bus services have continued to degenerate. The rail services are even further apart, even later and more costly. People in my electorate have two cars; they cannot rely on public transport. The New South Wales government blathers on about public transport, but the people in my electorate catch the car. Let us say that the people in my electorin ate, which has about 45,000 homes, spend on average $100 a week-especially now-on fuel. On average, about $15 of that goes to the state in GST and excise. That is $15 a week from all of my 45,000 residences, which equals $33 million a year, that goes out of my electorate, out of my constituents' pay cheques, to the state government in fuel taxes. Do they see it being spent on the roads in Lindsay? Not a chance. The only thing that happens on the roads in Lindsay is the federal government's black spot funding. We have not seen $33 million worth of state government funding on our roads. The state government will not even upgrade some serious road connections, such as the flood evacuation route at Windsor. When the state government reneged on the Warragamba Dam and said, ‘It's too much to strengthen it and raise the wall; we'll take the cheap option and build a spillway,' it promised us a flood evacuation route. It said, ‘In order to save Sydney's water supply, all you guys in Lindsay will get flooded, but you'll be right; we'll build this road to get you out.' It has not even built the road. Luckily for the state government, we have an extraordinary drought happening at the moment. But the state government's only solution to that drought is to pray for rain. It is not even a religious bunch. At least, if its members were in the National Party or Fred Nile's party, I could believe that their prayers would have some effect. But that is the state government's sole water policy-to pray for rain. The state government has done nothing about any of the dams; it has welshed on those. It went for a desalination plant and then welshed on that. Now it is drilling around my electorate for aquifers that are somehow going to meet our needs. It has also welshed on the Warragamba Dam in deciding to put suction pumps lower down underneath the dam in order to get more water at the dam's bottom that was not utilised previously. None of these things has come to fruition. If you read the papers over the weekend, you will have seen that the state government has blown $1.8 billion in cost overruns on projects and some 230 projects have been delayed. These are roads, schools, hospitals, dam remediation, community health centres and security on ports. Security on ports? What about security on Warragamba Dam? Any old tradesman can drive up in a ute and get access to that dam. There is no security for one of our major drinking supplies. For the Penrith railway station, the state government gave us the cheap option. There have been no upgrades on rail. The state government saved an enormous amount by putting in some shoddy half-station for Penrith. Instead of moving the ticketing booth to the top of the platform, it has left it down on the far side so that those on the north side have to travel all the way to the south side to get a ticket and then go back to board their train. An increase in the number of beds at the Nepean Hospital has been pushed back three years. We have had an explosion in the number of people in our area, but we get one-half of the expenditure per capita that the inner city gets. The inner city gets twice as much for its hospital beds as Western Sydney gets. What is the member for Fowler doing about that? Is she saying to her state Labor colleagues, ‘Give us our fair share out in Western Sydney?' No, she is saying: ‘Go on into the Royal North Shore. Go on into St Vincent's, Concord and the Royal Women's.' Under Labor, 3,500 beds have gone from our hospital system, and the state Labor government does nothing about it. It promises on the never never, saying: ‘Yes, Nepean, we'll give you a few extra beds for the population explosion you have had, but that will be in the next three years or in 2010. They are coming.' Are you going to believe that? It is the same for Westmead's bone marrow ward. Westmead is the key hospital that we all have to go to. From Katoomba to Bathurst, we come to Westmead, yet the state government has done nothing about reallocating resources to where half the population of Sydney live, and that is west of Westmead. We need some of those hospital resources. The member for Fowler says that she represents the people of Fairfield but does nothing about it. It would not be a Jackie Kelly speech without a mention of child care. Peter Debnam gave a wonderful policy statement about what the state opposition would do on child care, and straight away the state government tried to match it by saying, ‘We'll now do something for child care.' For 10 years they have let preschools wallow. A couple of the other states have done a good job in child care in preschools and have a robust preschool system. But coming into an election-again on the never never, on money he does not have- Mr Iemma has promised preschools. The New South Wales state government is not a government to be believed. At the end of the day, when push comes to shove, I urge the people of Lindsay to take their vote seriously and back whom they trust. (Time expired)",97

177,Mr SNOWDON,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"Lingiari) (5.47 pm)We have just seen another travesty of democracy in this place with the government gagging the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 2006. I know that Aboriginal people who are my constituents in the Northern Territory will be shocked and amazed that this government would not allow a proper debate for this very important piece of legislation-a historical debate, as it will be. I will move a second reading amendment at the end of this speech. A week or so ago, I visited a number of Indigenous communities across the Top End of the Northern Territory. In each of these communities, I held meetings with traditional owners, council members and other individuals. Those meetings were held right through Arnhem Land. At those meetings, people expressed their frustration, their anguish, their concern and their hurt at the way the Commonwealth government has imposed its agenda for change without any reference to them and at the way they have been demonised by the media, largely at the behest of the government and without any opportunity to properly respond or have their voices heard. They are deeply concerned that the government feels absolutely no compulsion to sit down and talk with them, let alone to consult or negotiate with them; that the government shows them no compassion; that it shows no knowledge or understanding of their cultural values or priorities; and that it shows no knowledge or understanding of the cultural differences that exist across Indigenous Australia and of the different historical experiences that different communities have suffered. David Martin, a fellow of the Centre for Aboriginal Economic Policy Research at the Australian National University, has spoken about the ‘new direction' in federal Indigenous affairs policy. This is quite a lengthy extract, but I think it gives a very good description of where we are in the context of debating Indigenous affairs policies in this country at the moment. He argued: Much of the support for the new policies is predicated on the ... assumption that Indigenous people naturally desire the lifestyle and values which correlate with economic integration, or that if they don't, a carrot and stick approach can be used to achieve it. However, the evidence shows that while many ... do indeed seek to take advantage of better economic opportunities, and while cultural change is a feature of all societies ... there is a widespread resistance amongst Indigenous people to what they see as attempts to assimilate them into the dominant societyeconomically and socially. He went on to say: ... my unease is because the debate is conducted with such a vitriolic and unnecessary demonisation of what has gone before ... with a complete disregard for what I would see as the lessons of history in Aboriginal affairs; and most importantly with an all too common disregard for the diverse views, values, and aspirations of the Aboriginal people at whom the new policy apparatus and its ideological underpinnings are directed. Except when the latest instance of horrific dysfunctionality in the Aboriginal world is brought forward to illustrate the need for profound change, or when the views of the new Aboriginal political elite are given prominence in the legitimating discourse around proposed policy directions, Aboriginal people themselves are conspicuously absent from the discussion ... the new policy frameworks ... are essentially empty vessels, if rather chipped and cracked ones, into which the new array of more socially functional values is to be poured - Preserving and strengthening all Aboriginal From my own observations and experience I think that is a very apposite and fair comment on where we are currently, and it expresses the frustration felt by so many I have spoken to. It is important that there is an appreciation of this backdrop as we debate proposals to amend the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976, which has now been operating for 30 years. The land rights act flowed as a direct result of the Woodward royal commission, initiated by the Whitlam government in 1973 to inquire and report into ‘the appropriate means to recognise and establish the traditional rights and interests of the Aborigines in and in relation to Land and to satisfy in other ways the reasonable aspirations of the Aborigines' rights in or in relation to Land.' It is worth reflecting for a moment on five things that Justice Woodward identified as the aims of recognising Aboriginal land rights. He said: - The doing of simple justice to a people who have been deprived of their land without their consent and without compensation. - The promotion of social harmony and stability within the wider Australian community by removing, as far as possible, the legitimate causes of complaint of an important minority group within that community. - The provision of land holdings as a first essential for people who are economically depressed and who have at present no real opportunity of achieving a normal Australian standard of living. - The preservation, where possible, of the spiritual link with his own land which gives each Aboriginal his sense of identity and which lies at the heart of his spiritual beliefs. - The maintenance and, perhaps, improvement of Australia's standing among the nations of the world by demonstrably fair treatment of an ethnic minority. Justice Woodward said further: These aims could be best achieved by: interests in land and rights over land which exist today, particularly all those having spiritual importance. - Ensuring that none of these interests or rights are further whittled away without consent, except in those cases where the national interest positively demands it-and then only on terms of just compensation. - The provision of some basic compensation in the form of land for those Aborigines who have been irrevocably deprived of the rights and interests which they would otherwise have inherited from their ancestors, and who have obtained no sufficient compensating benefits from white society. - The further provision of land, to the limit which the wider community can afford, in those places where it will do most good, particularly in economic terms, to the largest number of Aborigines. The Whitlam government drafted the land rights legislation, based on Justice Woodward's report. The legislation was ultimately passed by the Fraser government after only marginal change. Today this act still reflects the values described by Woodward, despite the fact that it was reviewed by Justice Toohey in 1983 and substantially amended as a result. The Howard government commissioned a further review of the act in 1997 by John Reeves QC. The Reeves review was referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs in December 1998 for consideration and report. The standing committee reported in 1999, after extensive consultation and after considering written submissions. The committee overwhelmingly rejected the recommendations of the Reeves review. It is worth noting, however, that the Commonwealth government is yet to respond substantively to the standing committee's report entitled Unlocking the Future. Significantly, the report was supported unanimously by the committee members from both sides of the parliament. In the context of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 2006 before us it is worth noting that the first and primary recommendation of Unlocking the Future is: The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 (‘the Act') not be amended without: - traditional Aboriginal owners in the Northern Territory first understanding the nature and purpose of any amendments and as a group giving their consent; and - any Aboriginal communities or groups that may be affected having been consulted and given adequate opportunity to express their views. Today we are considering proposals to amend the act, some of which could be seen to have been agreed by Aboriginal people in the Territory through the land councils as a result of a package of proposals to amend the land rights act agreed to with the Northern Territory government. In this sense, the package could be seen to have the consent of traditional owners. This package took a number of months to negotiate. Significantly, it has the support of the mining industry, whose principal interest was with proposals to amend part IV of the act, which deals with mining. Most of the other amendments proposed have not been discussed, let alone negotiated, with traditional owners or other Aboriginal people living on Aboriginal land or their representative organisations, the land councils. The process leading to the joint position agreed by the Northern Territory government and the land councils showed how parties working together, showing mutual respect, can arrive at a negotiated outcome. Unfortunately, the Northern Territory government stepped outside of this framework in developing and submitting to the Commonwealth proposals for amendments to section 19 of the act to accommodate a proposal for the leasing of Aboriginal townships. These proposals have been quickly picked up, holus-bolus, by the Commonwealth government and are a key feature and component of the package of amendments before us. The failure of both the Northern Territory government and the Commonwealth government to seek informed consent for these and other proposals that did not form part of the package of agreed proposals is an indictment of the approach of both governments. While individual traditional owner groups or traditional owners may give their support to the proposals to amend section 19, I note that in the bill before us their consent would in any event be required for those lease proposals to proceed. However, these proposals have been put into this legislation without any discussion or understanding of them by Aboriginal people, whether or not they are traditional owners, across the Northern Territory, let alone their agreement. I note also that the federal government is already using the proposals contained in these amendments as leverage in dealing with Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory. In effect, they are making infrastructure and other resources to Indigenous communities conditional upon these communities entering into agreements, and presumably traditional owners also agreeing that they enter into lease arrangements, as envisaged by the legislation, as a condition of those resources being made available to the community. We have seen this only last weekend, with the minister announcing comprehensiveand welcome-initiatives for additional housing and other infrastructure, including the presence of a police station for Galiwinku, while clearly indicating that in order to secure investment the community will need to agree to the new land leasing proposals. Instead of a partnership based on mutual respect and trust, it is one based on the power of the purse. The Commonwealth is imposing its will as to how Indigenous people use and deal with their land in order to obtain the benefits that other Australians see as their rights as citizens: access to reasonable housing, health, education and other services. Nowhere else in the Australian community would this sort of proposition be put, nor would it be accepted. The minister may well argue that, on providing information, the traditional owners and communities accepted his proposals. This begs the question as to whether those Aboriginal Australians were given the option of considering other proposals or indeed other arguments. What the minister fails to clearly understand is the obligation of the relevant land councils to do whatever is necessary and appropriate to obtain the consent of traditional owners for any agreement to finally proceed. The minister apparently regards himself as exempt from any such requirement. What is apparent is that the proposals to amend section 19 have not been well enough thought through and may have some serious downsides which should be brought to the attention of Aboriginal people. For example, the proposal includes the proposition of capping rental payments for developments on Aboriginal land leased to an NT government entity at five per cent of the improved capital value of the land. It is arguable that imposing a cap of five per cent in this way proposed by the legislation may well be racially discriminatory. In any event, no other owners of a freehold title or its equivalent have arbitrary limits imposed on the economic rent that they can negotiate for the use or sale of that land. The proposed amendments also make provision for the surveying and administrative costs of introducing the leasing scheme to be made out of the Aboriginals Benefit Account-the mining royalty equivalents coming out of consolidated revenue for the use and benefit of Aboriginal Territorians. The Commonwealth government has earmarked $15 million from the ABA for the costs of surveying townships and administrative expenses. The Northern Territory government has estimated that the task of surveying one township alone will be $1 million, and up to $100 million in total. This amount of money could not be taken from the ABA without undermining its viability. However, beyond the Commonwealth's failure to do the maths on this is the fact that the ABA is effectively being used to pay the rent and costs of the Northern Territory government on Aboriginal land. It is also true that the ABA is now being used as a slush fund for the Commonwealth minister's own priorities-not necessarily the priorities of Indigenous Territorians who are supposed to be the ones making decisions about how this money will be spent. Not only is this inherently unfair but also it raises the significant question of the NT and Commonwealth governments fettering the ability of Indigenous Australians from obtaining appropriate economic rent for the use of their land for residential and commercial purposes and ask them to pay full tote odds for that privilege through the ABA. Significantly, though, the fact remains that, even if you believe this is a good idea and is without flaws, there has been no extensive consultation with-and no prior consent given from-Indigenous communities or traditional owners about its impact, whatever the government might believe and whatever might be said to the minister. Notwithstanding these concerns, there is merit in developing a model which will provide Aboriginal Australians with the opportunity to purchase housing on communities. Of course, Labor is happy to support any Australian who aspires to buy their own home. However, the situation we are confronted with here is not about home purchase; it is about housing provision and the regularising of the arrangements between the housing providers and the traditional owners. We should all be aware of the chronic housing shortage faced by Indigenous Australians across the continent, but particularly by Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory. In the Northern Territory alone, there is estimated to be a $1 billion housing shortfall, and I am told that nationally the figure is approaching $3 billion. This housing shortage goes to the question of poor health outcomes, poor educational outcomes and, ultimately, the lack of employment and life opportunities. It is a great indicator of the of poverty being suffered by Aboriginal Australians in the Northern Territory and across this nation and it is an absolute indictment on successive governments at all levels. In the context of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976, there have been no attempts by the housing providers to regularise the arrangements for the provision of housing by seeking leases for the land on which the houses have been built. Historically, the Northern Territory government have relied on sections 14 and 15 of the act. These sections allow the Northern Territory government, where they have been using or occupying Aboriginal land before the enactment of the Aboriginal land rights act, to continue using that land for as long as they require. Where that use of land is for a community purpose-for housing, education or police-the use is rent free. Nor am I aware that there has been any request by any person for a lease of land to build for residential purposes. This goes to the heart of the question, which is the need for governments to accept their responsibilities to negotiate with traditional owners over lease arrangements for residential purposes and to provide sufficient resources to address the housing crisis in Indigenous communities generally across Australia. While the government's proposals for private home ownership may be attractive for a very small minority, the simple truth of the matter is that home ownership may not be an option for the bulk of Aboriginal Australians living in remote communities-if for no other reason than the fact that the average individual income for Indigenous people living in remote areas at the 2001 census was a measly $13,460. While we acknowledge the government's intention in relation to these issues, we say to them: this is not the main game and this is not the way to proceed. Nor is the main level game the leasing of whole townships to a Northern Territory entity which will then have the responsibility for all dealings in that land, including the provision of subleases for commercial and other purposes, because in the end this could have the effect of alienating the Indigenous estate from effective Indigenous control. It is also worth noting that the Northern Territory government does not need the amendments sought in this legislation to deal with Aboriginal townships not on Aboriginal land. The fact is they have the legislative authority to do this for communities such as Kalkaringi, Alpurrurulam, Apatula and others which are not on Aboriginal land yet they have not done so. You would have thought that if this move was of such significance for the feasibility of townships it would have been put in place at least as a pilot in these communities some time ago when there was no requirement for Commonwealth legislation. It is no surprise that that has not been the case. I also note that just last week the Northern Territory government proposed a ‘new way' of addressing the housing crisis on Aboriginal communities, involving community, government and private sector finance. I support that initiative. There needs to be a partnership between government, the private sector and Aboriginal communities if we are ever to address the chronic shortage of Indigenous housing. But the methods proposed by the Commonwealth government will not attain that objective. There are other models which do not require traditional owners giving up their right to control commercial development on their land and would provide ample capacity for dealing in residential property. As with the leasing arrangements, the proposals in the legislation before us which go to the question of the creation of new land councils and delegations from current land councils, as well as the proposals for the funding of new land councils, have also not been the subject of any extensive discussion, consultation, negotiation or agreement with traditional owners, other Aboriginal people or the land councils in the Northern Territory. Together, they clearly undermine the integrity of the land rights act and arguably will be an impediment to the rational, orderly development of economic opportunities on Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory. These proposals are particularly pernicious in their treatment of land councils and are clearly designed to revisit the proposals in the Reeves review to establish new land councils-rejected by the HORSCATSIA inquiry. Some of the other proposals which have not been negotiated with traditional owners but which are a major cause of concern relate to the establishment of these new land councils and the delegations. These proposals reflect another ideological obsession of the government to break down the authority of land councils and to limit their capacity to act as advocacy bodies for those Aboriginal Australians whom they have been set up to service and also represent. In many ways these proposals reflect much of what Reeves proposed and which was rejected by HORSCATSIA. They come as no surprise, and they demonstrate the inherent contradictions in the Commonwealth approach. On the one hand while, in the case of the proposals for the amendments to section 19, traditional owners' consent is required, on the other hand this is not the case for the establishment of new land councils or the delegation of land council powers. In addition, the proposals designed to create a large number of land councils or to give other bodies land councillike powers and responsibilities clearly conflict with the government's policies on representative bodies under the Native Title Act. In this case, the Commonwealth has sought to rationalise the number of such bodies in order to provide administrative efficiencies and limit the possibilities of inappropriate behaviour. How is it then that the government has determined that it ought to facilitate proposals to break up the existing land councils in the Northern Territory? The proposals have a capricious intent and are designed to limit the capacity of land councils to act as effective advocacy bodies for Aboriginal Territorians. This intent is perhaps no better demonstrated than by the changes to funding for land councils that this bill proposes. At present, the land rights act guarantees that 40 per cent of available funds in the ABA be set aside for the administrative expenses of the four land councils. This bill proposes to remove that guarantee and determine funding for land councils on the basis of estimated workload. Removing the 40 per cent floor funding undermines the guarantee of independence and viability of the land councils and their ability to pursue the interests of traditional owners. It is clear that the government's proposals in relation to land councils are a potential disaster and will inevitably be viewed with some concern by those, particularly in the mining industry, who seek to develop economic opportunities on Aboriginal land. After 30 years they have certainty and confidence in dealing with the four land councils currently in existence. They know that these organisations have the competence, experience, knowledge and expertise to deal with them in an open, transparent and orderly fashion. You can imagine what might have happened under these proposals of the Northern Territory and federal governments to create new land councils if they had had to negotiate the Darwin to Alice Springs railway. These mining businesses would be concerned by the prospect of dealing with a larger number of bodies who, apart from lacking competence, would be without the corporate knowledge, economies of scale or professional expertise that prevail under the rent arrangements. There was no forewarning of these proposals by the Commonwealth government and I note that these proposals were not supported by the Northern Territory government. Again, given the strength of the recommendations of HORSCATSIA, it is of grave concern that the government has chosen to follow this course. The issue of land council delegations reflects a similar story. The joint submission the Northern Territory government and the land councils proposed amendments to section 28 of the current act. The submission proposed a certain level of delegation of power to allow some functions to be performed at a regional level rather than at land council meetings. The Commonwealth government have taken the delegation power much further in the arrangements they propose under this legislation. Core land council functions with respect to mining and leasing on Aboriginal land may now be delegated. There is a possibility that the powers of a land council, the body representing traditional owners, could be delegated such that a body including non-Aboriginal people would be exercising these core land council functions. These proposed amendments will also allow the Commonwealth minister for Indigenous affairs to make decisions about delegation of a land council's powers even if the land council does not agree. The minister's power to delegate these powers, as well as the types of bodies that land council powers can be delegated to, disfranchise traditional owners of the rights accorded to them under the original legislation. While there is much to be concerned about in this bill, Labor does support a good number of the measures within it. The bill proposes a new section 12AAB to make an immediate grant of land to the Anindilyakwa Land Trust of land in the area of the Ancurindilyakwa Land Council included in any Arnhem land type 1 deed. This is land inappropriately granted to the Northern Land Council. Labor supports an immediate grant of that land to the Anindilyakwa Land Trust so it becomes the responsibility of the Anindilyakwa Land Council. I note with some concern comments made this morning by the minister in relation to the changes which he proposes. He referred with great ignorance to of the way in which Indigenous Australians deal with their land and to their relationships with each other. He had the temerity, and indeed the audacity, to say this as he described the way in which Aboriginal people live on their land: … We're saying to people … that you've been living on what is for all intents and purposes little communist enclaves, which means that there's no opportunity for business to flourish, there's access to a market economy. I have never heard in this place such benign stupidity and rubbish. This minister is clearly ignorant of how Indigenous people see their land and how they relate to one another. I point the minister to the words of Justice Woodward and suggest to him that he bring himself to read the two reports of the Woodward royal commission and the subsequent reports and commentary which have been written about the land rights act. He would soon come to understand that his view of the world is not only wrong but also so far off the mark of where Indigenous Australians see themselves that it defies description. I say to him that I do not know any Indigenous people who are not concerned about involving themselves in the market economy in some way or another. I do not know any Indigenous Australians who do not want a roof over their head or the right for their children to attend school and have a healthy outcome-that is, to have education and health services and access to work opportunities. I do not know any Indigenous Australians who do not want any of those things, just like every other Australian. What I know is that this pogrom, which has been undertaken in different guises by the federal government but in this case it is by attacking the land rights act, is all about disempowering Indigenous Australians. It is all about getting their agenda run and the wedge put in about how ignorant these poor buggers are. Well, they are not! They are not ignorant and they understand what you are doing. When you sit down and talk to these people, as this government should do, you understand what is required-that is, their need to give prior informed consent, as Justice Woodward commented upon in his royal commission report and as HORSCATSIA commented upon in its very first recommendation. The banal attitude of this government no defies description. My time has concluded, and I move: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst welcoming many measures contained in the bill including the mining and exploration provisions, the House is of the opinion that some other provisions of this bill: (1) undermine the integrity of the Principal Act by eroding the rights of traditional owners and the independence of land councils; (2) are a recipe for uncertainty for development on Aboriginal land; (3) should be withdrawn and redrafted to provide a more balanced approach that ensures: (a) the informed consent of traditional owners to major changes; (b) that traditional owners as land owners are not unfairly constrained in optimising their financial and other benefits under the 99 year lease; (c) the better promotion and facilitation of economic development on Aboriginal land including home ownership opportunities for Aboriginal people; (d) the protection of traditional owners' rights to control access and development on their own land; and (e) the maintenance of the independence and viability of land councils to defend and pursue the interests of traditional owners and other Aboriginal people living on Aboriginal land.”",103
178,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,Is the motion seconded? Mr Garrett-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,110
179,Mr TOLLNER,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"It is indeed a pleasure to be standing here talking about the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 2006 and the changes it will bring to the land rights act which, in the main, has not changed at all in the last 30 years. The member for Lingiari summed up a few things when he talked about the Woodward royal commission. It is important to understand where things have come from and how they have eventuated. It is important in this context to understand the political climate of time in relation to land rights and how we got to where we are now. Back in the sixties and the seventies, the world was discovering that it had rights. South Pacific nations shook off their colonial oppressors. MGM stopped making films featuring white Americans gunning down red Indians. The cult heroes were Che Guevara, Martin Luther King and Malcolm X. In Australia, Charlie Perkins was boarding freedom buses in the Northern Territory. The Aboriginal stockmen of Newcastle Waters and Wave Hill had walked off the job, demanding equal pay. A strike that became symbolic of Aboriginal dispossession was when the Gurindji people at Wave Hill turned the pay dispute into a demand for the return of their land. In 1967, the national referendum giving the Commonwealth responsibility for Aboriginal welfare received 90 per cent support, and the Aboriginal tent embassy was established on the lawns of Parliament House, just as Prime Minister Whitlam was moving into his office, brimming with reformist zeal. The Gurindji strike lasted for seven years. In 1975, the year before the Aboriginal land rights act, Gough Whitlam symbolically poured red sand into the hands of Vincent Lingiari-my colleague the member for Lingiari on the other side represents the electorCanaan'. ate named after him-and handed over the lease of 1,250 square miles of Vestey's land, with a promise to further redress the injustice-an impression that has long been the lot of black Australians. My point is that the Aboriginal land rights act is a rights act, not a lands act. It was about putting things right and about appeasing a national conscience and international opinion in the only place that the Commonwealth could-the Northern Territory. It was not about good land management or land administration. It was not about planning for the the future exploitation and productivity of the land. The act does not concern itself with how the landowners are going to make a buck-quite the opposite. It is about the protection of land as a right, the preservation of culture, the locking of the gates and defending Aboriginal people and their land from the intrusions of outsiders-the miners, pastoralists, tourists or anyone without a permit for that matter, even the Northern Territory government. It was thought that Aborigines would be able to return to hunting and foraging on their newly acquired land. Why would they need to make a dollar? Justice Woodward penned those intentions, writing of preserving ‘the spiritual link' with land providing an Aboriginal sense of identity and allowing ‘Aborigines to be free to choose their own manner of living'. The Aboriginal affairs minister at the time, Ian Viner, picked up on the theme while introducing the legislation. He waxed lyrical about the Aboriginal spiritual connection with the land and the Dreamtime. He said that ‘ancestors left in each “country” certain vital powers' that ‘make that country fruitful and ensure a good life for people forever'. ‘An Aboriginal's country', he said, ‘no matter how stricken a wilderness it may seem to others is, to him, a He stated his belief that there had been ‘a fundamental change in social thinking in Australia, recognising that within our community there are some people, the Aborigines, who live by a unique and distinct system of customary law'. Thus we can see the intent of the land rights act-to establish rights to protect the country and its inhabitants from the intruders, to create inalienable title in perpetuity for people who live differently and thereby ensure a good life for people forever. The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act was established to establish a sanctuary, a preserve of living prehistory within modern Australia. Spurring on this mood was the Commonwealth's deep suspicions about the intentions of the then embryonic Territory government, the Legislative Council. To defend Aboriginal Territorians from their future government, the act stipulates that the Territory parliament could not acquire Aboriginal land for public purposes. At that time, Canberra genuinely believed that, given half a chance, the Territory council would repossess Aboriginal land en masse and Viner felt compelled to tell the Commonwealth parliament that he had assurances that the Territory Legislative Assembly was prepared to cooperate. In fact, there was uncertainty, resentment and division in the Territory. It was not so much about Aboriginal land ownership; it had more to do with the way the rights act was imposed exclusively on the Territory from on high. It seemed hypocritical-and it was-to impose upon a territory a land regime that is applauded by the same people who would not have a bar of it in their home states. Mr Viner had some sense of the impact his legislation might have on the Territory. Alarmed by what he feared was a white backlash, he wrote articles and pamphlets in the Territory in 1978 assuring Territorians that rumours that Aborigines would get 50 per cent of the land were untrue and downright dangerous to racial harmony. Today of course 50 per cent of the Territory is under Aboriginal title and that is the 50 per cent that Mr Viner said would never happen. He simply did not anticipate the real outcome of his legislation. His stated desire for an end the divisiveness was not backed by his actions. He left the Territory a legacy that has soured relations between the Northern Territory government and land councils ever since. That legacy was his scant regard for the public interest in his plan to effect the biggest land transfer of crown and pastoral land to new, select communal ownerships since Captain Cook arrived. The Commonwealth act prohibits any compulsory acquisition of land under the Aboriginal land rights act by the Territory government. The vast tracts of land were handed over to select communal ownership. The Territory government was forced into the land claims courtroom to represent and argue the public interest. It cannot be argued that the Territory government should not have done this. Governments are required to represent public interest, to plan for future services, provide water from catchment areas, provide pasture for cattle on the move, pipelines, powerlines, public parks and access for the enjoyment of beaches and rivers. To ignore such future considerations would have been a dereliction of public duty. But the adversarial nature of the courtroom inevitably leads to acrimony. Today most Aboriginal Territorians believe that the Territory government has opposed every land claim. They have been told that by land councils and the Labor Party finds polarisation of Aboriginal people and the previous CLP government relations politically convenient. John Reeves QC, in his review, said: The provisions preventing the Territory government from compulsory acquiring land meant that the land claims process was the only chance the Territory government had to present possible matters of detriment. He went on: If the Territory government could acquire land in the future in certain limited circumstances, it would not be necessary for matters of detriment to to be predicted way into the future and thus occupy so much court time and argument. Today there is no real answer at all as to who owns the schools, the health centres and other community facilities on Aboriginal land. The land councils count such assets as having zero value, as they are not their asset. Taxpayers, through their government, also have no propriety interest, as the buildings do not stand on public land. So it was Mr Viner, consciously or unconsciously, who set up the dispute between the Territory government and the land councils. The late author Shiva Naipaul visited the Northern Territory in the mid-eighties. He was appalled by what he described as the ‘confining of the Aborigine in his aboriginality-the escape into an adventure playground of timelessness, of goannas and kangaroos and red earth. The running off into a world of unalterable Aboriginal essences is a condescending and profoundly flawed prescription for regeneration.' This was followed up with the challenge: ‘Either the Aborigine is or is not a citizen of Australia. If he is-which he is-he must face the consequences.' Bob Beadman, in the spring 2004 issue of Policy wrote an article called ‘A future for Indigenous youth?' in which he said: The problem now, however, is that the title is now stitched up so tightly that it is worthless as of security for commercial borrowings, and home ownership is unknown for the high proportion of Aboriginal residents of the Northern Territory who live on Aboriginal land. It is a cliché now, but the people are land rich but dirt poor. The form of entry controls (which date back many decades prior to land rights, to when the land was first reserved for Aborigines), whilst very effective in providing a buffer from the worse aspects of the encroaching migration of the frontier, also blocked the migration of businesses, right through to the present time. Now, the Land Rights Act creates additional barriers to people pulling themselves up out of the quagmire of welfare dependency. In a country with one of the highest levels of home ownership in the world, we construct a form of title for remote Aborigines that denies them the opportunity to fulfil what for others is the Great Australian Dream. Collectivism has failed around the world, and the evidence is before our eyes that it hasn't worked here either. Communal home ownership dictated by the Land Rights Act is just another manifestation of the removal of individual responsibility. I'll bet if people were enabled to own their home repairs and maintenance costs would plummet. Isn't that something! If you owned your own home, maintenance costs would plummet. You do not have to be Einstein or the member for Lingiari to know that when you travel around community after community on Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory nowhere do you see a market garden that grows fresh vegetables; nowhere do you see a butcher shop or a small abattoir; nowhere do you see bakeries. You do not see hairdressers; you do not see clothing stores-let alone a MCDonald's or an Irish theme pub. The reason none of that exists is that it is impossible to get those businesses up and running unless there is the incentive for people to make that investment in those communities. I think the great changes being proposed today will go some way towards changing a form that. The normalisation of townships and the creation of long-term leases on towns will enable Aboriginal people and others to buy land and build houses in Aboriginal communities. It will allow businesses to set up. Some may not flourish-some may go broke-but that is business. It will allow people to set up market gardens and have an entrepreneurial attitude. It will allow for butcher shops, bakeries, hairdressers and clothing stores and present a whole range of other opportunities to Indigenous people. In an article in the Australian of 15 August last year called ‘Hope lies in the great Australian dream', the National President of the Labor Party, Warren Mundine, was reported as saying: My parents owned a house and I own a house with my wife and my son now owns a house and my daughter is getting a house as well. … … … Owning a home changes people's lives. You have got an asset that you use yourself and that you can pass on to future generations. He went on to say that home ownership ‘makes a total difference for people': For one thing you don't have a ‘cargo cult' mentality. The article says: Mr Mundine told the story of visiting an Aboriginal community where there was a broken sewer pipe. ‘I said: “You can fix that-we'll just get a hessian bag and some concrete-otherwise you're going to have sewage going everywhere.” ‘I was told, “That's not our job, that's ATSIC's job”.' The article continues: Owning a home changed all that. ‘If the house is yours you look after it. The other thing is, own a house you have to be employed. You can't willy-nilly wander in and out of jobs, you have to make a go of it. … … … ‘If the boss is on your back you have to grin and bear it, you can't just say “I'm out of here”.' That is how you change people's lives. That is how you allow them to get ahead-you create some incentive for them to work and an ability to own something. The member for Lingiari laughs when the minister talks about mini communist societies in Australia. It is true. It is almost impossible for Indigenous people on Aboriginal land to get ahead or to own anything. I challenge the member for Lingiari to point out one single person who owns a private asset on any Indigenous land in the Territory. Hernando de Soto wrote in The Mystery of Capital: By making assets ... capable of being divided, combined or mobilized to suit any transactionby attaching owners to assets, assets to addresses, and ownership to enforcement, and by making information on the history of assets and owners easily accessible, formal property systems converted the systems of Western capitalist society into a network of individually identifiable and accountable business agents. That is exactly what we are trying to do in transforming Indigenous economic development and what these changes to the land rights legislation will mean. I think it goes without saying that the changes being proposed are not going to be the panacea for every ill in Aboriginal communities. More must be done. This legislation does not remove the permit system, for instance. It does not patriate this act to the Northern Territory government. I have said several times in this place that the act should be patriated to the rightful place, namely the Northern Territory. The permit system is anif you other way of stopping Indigenous Territorians from accessing economic opportunities. A previous federal Labor MP, John Reeves QC, who conducted the Reeves review, sent me an email recently where he says: I think the permit system should be scrapped and replaced with a system that more closely approximates that of all land owners-ie, the right to prevent trespass. By contrast, the permit system is essentially a passport system. Whilst the NT government presently has the power to make legislation to give effect to the permit system, the federal government has the ultimate control over the issue because it can withdraw that power just by amending the Aboriginal Land Rights Act. He says that this should be done immediately. I am running out of time, but I think the last word should be left to Noel Pearson: Many of the conventional ideas and policies in Aboriginal affairs-ideas and policies which are considered to be ‘progressive'-in fact are destructive. He said Aboriginal affairs is dominated by journalists, academics, politicised clergy, politically active medical doctors, party careerists, writers, musicians, actors, cartoonists and ‘other inner city dwellers with socially suitable left-liberal opinions about everything'. I and my people have suffered the intellectual cultural hegemony of the progressive scribes for decades. I think he is right. When I look at the members from the other side of the House who are due to speak on the debate, I see the members for Lingiari, Kingsford Smith, Fremantle, Reid, Banks, Fraser, Hotham, Werriwa, Chifley, Shortland and Melbourne. I rest my case. They are trying to do it all over again. They just restrict Aboriginal people and try to keep them in their place. There is nothing like having a good obedient blackfella around. We on this side of the House want to see them do well. We believe in the individual and giving them all a fair go. (Time expired)",110
180,Mr GARRETT,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"It is a real shame that the government has chosen to apply the guillotine to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 2006, and in so doing frustrate the legitimate rights that members of this parliament have, particularly in the opposition, to get up and speak to this bill. I cannot help but note that the Senate has also expressed concern about the speed with which this legislation is passing through the parliament. This has been a feature of the Howard government's approach to legislation in the recent session, but giving a full and comprehensive consideration to an issue as significant as this is a primary responsibility of this parliament. That is what we have been elected to do. The member for Lingiari's electorate incorporates the lands to which this proposed bill specifically applies. I would have thought it self-evident that not only he but any other member who wished to speak to this legislation should be given the opportunity. So it is a very great shame that the government has chosen to gag debate on a bill as important as this one. I am struck, having heard the comments of the member for Solomon, by the difficulties and that we sometimes have in this House in relation to political debate about Aboriginal issues. It is very difficult, it seems, for people to strip out their biases and their ideological fixations and come to a more constructive place as we seek to determine legislation, its merits and the kinds of policies that will be needed to be adopted by this House-and, hopefully, in time agreed to by both sides of politics-to help Aboriginal people overcome the accumulated disadvantage that they suffer. In the House today we have had two interesting, hot-button occurrences. The first was a forum in the House, very well attended, detailing and concerning itself with issues of Indigenous violence, something which all of us both deplore and have great concern about. In that particular forum on Indigenous violence, speaker after speaker made the point that one of the most significant and important aspects of consideration of Indigenous violence is to recognise that both strong culture and the identification and protection of rights, particularly rights of the child, are absolutely essential predeterminants of having a debate and developing policy on this issue. Yet at the same time, both in the House and in the media, we have a concerted attack on notions of culture and on notions of rights. Who is right? Those Aboriginal people who work in communities, who experience physical abuse, who experience disadvantage day in and day out? Those Aboriginal people charged with the responsibility of running organisations dealing with health, truancy and kids who are petrol sniffing? Organisations concerned with the delivery of social services, with the health of Aboriginal families, who get up in this place and say that it is about strong culture, it is about ognition and identification of rights? Are they the ones who are correct on this issue? Or is it the plethora of pundits, opinion makers and ideologues who jump in and out of this debate as they see fit and when they see an issue that they can hang onto? The other hot-button issue that was on display in this House today was the motion brought by the member for Stirling, Mr Keenan, calling upon the House to affirm the primacy of Australian law and asserting in effect that cultural considerations should not predominate over Australian law. With these kinds of contributions from members opposite in this debate is it little wonder that riginal people get frustrated at the way in which politicians respond to the very considerable difficulties that they have? Finally, I cannot help but refer to the contribution of the previous member when he looks forward longingly to the day when Aboriginal communities have ‘Irish theme pubs' as evidence of their economic and cultural vitality. What a joke. Labor opposes this bill, as there are aspects of it which are wrong and make it deficient. We come to the bill recognising that there is a need for reform of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act, particularly in relation to prudential arrangements between and including royalty associations, which receive royalties from land councils, and also in relation to mining exploration and development activities. I think it is particularly significant is on the issue of part IV of the act, which relates to mining, that we can see the most sensible and prudent aspects of this act. It is in that particular area that we have seen the most significant advance in the way in which mining companies in particular have changed their attitudes to negotiations with Aboriginal people, both for access to land and for the recterms of development on Aboriginal land. I think, and I am sure members present would agree, that there has been a substantial change in attitude over the last decade from the mining industry in general in the way in which it has conducted itself, particularly in the Northern Territory, and in the way in which it has come to negotiations with a respect for culture and a willingness to sit down and spend the time necessary to negotiate. The result has been ongoing economic development for Indigenous people where the mining companies and Indigenous people have struck those agreements. So it is appropriate that these muchAbochanged attitudes and approaches, and the necessity for us to have better processes in relation to mining and royalty accountability, be reflected in any amendments to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. But, as the member for Lingiari, who has just spoken, noted, these amendments also undermine the integrity of the principal act by eroding the rights of traditional owners. They are a recipe for uncertainty for development on Aboriginal land. The informed consent of traditional owners to major changes is not a part of these amendments. Traditional owners, as landowners, are unfairly constrained in optimising their financial prospects under the 99-year lease. There needs to be a better promotion and facilitation of economic development on Aboriginal land than is put forward by this amendment. And the protection of traditional owners' traditional rights to control access and development on their that it own land is not present. The member for Lingiari noted that these changes have come virtually out of the blue and that for a number of Indigenous communities across the Top End there has been little or no discussion or negotiation about these changes. Additionally, there is no evidence that the government understands the cultural values that attach to changes of this kind or the way in which those issues would play out at a future point in time. There is a diversity of situations that Indigenous people face and there are manifestly different conditions and challenges that present themselves to particular communities. The comments made in the House today by Minister Brough, the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, to the extent that Aboriginal people live in communist enclaves I think is an example of the need for the government to reconsider and to examine more thoroughly what is actually going on in Aboriginal communities. These are not helpful and not accurate comments. There is a danger that this debate is one where we hear only the loud voices and where the underlying and historically based issues are not properly and thoroughly explored, nor the points of view of the communities themselves. I will just reprise briefly the history that has brought us to this point. The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 was a product of the Woodward royal commission. It has been in operation for some 30 years. Justice Woodward's basic premise was ‘the doing of simple justice to a people who have been deprived of their land without their consent and without compensation,' and, further, that it was essential to both proresult. vide land and preserve the spiritual links to land that give Aboriginal people a sense of identity. While Woodward recognised the important need for Aboriginal people to be provided with land that would do most good in economic terms, as we do in this House and as Labor does, he also viewed the holding of land as a form of trusteeship rather than a transfer of rights. There is some irony, I would have to say, in the position that the government takes where it wants to attack the rights of Indigenous people but in this very instance, when in fact they were not granted a certain kind of right, it takes opposition to that as well. The Aboriginal land rights act has subsequently been reviewed twice, most recently by John Reeves QC in 1997. That review was then referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs in December 1998. The House of Representatives committee did not accept Reeves's major recommendations and it took wide views from many people and took written submissions. Its report, Unlocking the future, had as its primary recommendation that: The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 … not be amended without: - traditional Aboriginal owners in the Northern Territory first understanding the nature and purpose of any amendments and as a group giving their consentand that is extremely important-and that: - any Aboriginal communities or groups that may be affected having been consulted and given adequate opportunity to express their views. That is the background: a process of review and of understanding an act of some 30 years standing, an extensive investigation by the House of Representatives committee and two primary recommendations that emerge as a It is on that that our opposition to the bill as it has come before this House is based. It is the case that some of these proposed amendments, including proposed amendments before us which have been agreed to at least through the Northern Territory and through the land councils, are a result of an agreement on a package of proposals with the Northern Territory government. But it is our task as Labor members of this House to come to our view about the merits of the bill as it comes before us. That package took some time to negotiate-in particular, part IV of the act, which deals with mining and which, as I have said, has the support of the mining industry. But a number of the other proposed amendments have been neither sufficiently discussed nor negotiated with traditional owners or other Aboriginal people living on Aboriginal lands, nor even the land councils. That is the necessary precursor for a bill like this to come into law. Whilst the need for traditional owner consent remains, I am worried that the federal government is already using the proposal in the amendments to negotiate with Indigenous communities. The cart is being put before the horse. It is important to identify that it is no means axiomatic that individual home ownership capacity in and of itself will bring about economic independence or success for Indigenous people in facing the considerable challenges and disadvantage that does fall upon them. Tom Calma, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, has pointed out a number of overseas experiences that demonstrate that point.",115
181,Mr SLIPPER,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,Not many.,118
182,Mr GARRETT,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"That has been countered by others-it is true-who speak in the debate, and I am reminded of a paper by Warin and Hughes of last year which saw fit to compare the work that was done in Aboriginal communities with that done in communist China. That is probably why we heard the minister's comments in the House today. But that paper was singularly ill informed and did not understand that in fact there were a number of healthy, vibrant and economically active Aboriginal communities, including communities existing as outstations throughout Arnhem Land and in other parts. There are a number of other issues that are problematic and have been referred to by the member for Lingiari. These include the proposal to cap rental payments on land leased to a Northern Territory government entity at five per cent of the improved capital value of the land as well as making payments out of the Aboriginal benefits account, with that account being made available for rental payments. I just make the simple point that to cap a rental payment at five per cent, even of improved value, in an act of parliament like this I think is unacceptable. It is unacceptable in a commercial sense to Indigenous people and it is unacceptable given the terms of these leases and the periods of time for which they run. It is extraordinary to me that a figure of this kind should be included in a by bill of this nature. I would certainly ask the minister to readdress that particular issue. Again, the additional proposals that deal with creating new land councils are also of concern, not having been subject to sufficient negotiations or consultation. It seems that the government has taken those aspects of the Reeves report it agreed to and dispensed with the House of Representatives recommendations that it did not agree to. More importantly, though, is the question about housing itself and the arguments advanced by government members that this bill will be a magic bullet to the extent that it will automatically provide for people to have home ownership and that their social conditions will improve as a matter of course. It is true that, in some communities and some instances, home ownership, which we support, would have that effect, but it would be by no means the rule. For those people living in the Northern Territory in remote communities where their average income is around $13,500, it is hard to see how home ownership in and of itself is even reachable or accessible. The amount that has been identified as necessary for investment in housing in the Northern Territory alone-and that is maintenance and construction-runs to the billions. If the government were truly serious about home ownership or the provision of housing for Aboriginal people-Indigenous people who particularly face extremely challenging social situations on account of the fact that there is a perilous shortage of houscould ing-that is what we should be hearing from the government. I draw the House's attention to the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute paper, Indigenous housing: assessing the long term costs and the optimal balance between recurrent and capital expenditure, released earlier this year. It considered this issue in detail. Its recommendations, most of which go to the best way governments can properly provide for housing, were simple. Governments must provide a financially viable and stable Indigenous community housing sector by ensuring concurrent support for recurrent maintenance and housing management and funding models. The research institute identifies, amongst other things, the of data and good information that governments have about what actually happens in Aboriginal communities where housing is in crisis and about the shortage that is there. The challenges faced by Indigenous community housing organisations, both in obtaining housing grants and in ensuring that housing is well maintained into the longer term, are profound. The institute suggests that, amongst other things, the Australian government could request Indigenous community housing organisations to agree to assist in providing responses to relevant surveys of the housing management and stock condition and, upon receipt of these agreements, a suitably revised version of the questionnaire could be pursued. There could be a quantity surveyor driven analysis of the condition of the housing stock of ICHOs throughout Australia with priority focused on those organisations not receiving grants and the government could establish and fund a national Indigenous housing, training and development centre. This centre, drawing on and developing relevant existing courses, could be attached to an appropriate university and its courses have tertiary diploma status. Finally, the centre could focus on delivering both longer and shorter courses in Indigenous housing management, drawing heavily on existing Indigenous housing managers. It seems to me that the government should consider-and, I hope, respond positively to the policy recommendations identified in the work that the institute has done. There is a lot more to housing than coming into the House and supporting legislation of this kind without considering the issues in their wider context. There are additionally some other aspects of this bill which we find have merit. I refer particularly to those provisions of the bill that refer to royalty associations. Those relack forms contemplated are in sync with the House of Representatives Standing Committee on ATSIA proposals. There is absolutely no doubt that, in some instances, there is a need for a form of that kind with royalty associations, particularly to give confidence to both those who are receiving the royalties and those who are distributing them that it is done in a prudential and an acceptable fashion. We accept the need for reform, but this bill is flawed. We need to have good law which delivers good results-law which understands the history both of dispossession and acquisition of rights by Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory and which understands fundamentally the necessity for proper consultation and identification of any or all of those obstacles that may stand in the way of these people being able to deal with their housing problems in a constructive and real manner. This is something the bill does not do.",118
183,Mr SLIPPER,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"When one listens to the honourable member for Kingsford Smith, his speech sounds reasonable and rational in some respects, but as a nation we really have to confront the fact that over 200 years of European settlement we have a situation where Indigenous Australians have an entirely unsatisfactory position in life. We find that they live for 20 years less than non-Indigenous males, we find that there is an infant mortality situation which a First World country ought not to be proud of and we find that successive governments over the years have endeavoured to salve the nation's collective conscience by throwing money at the problem. I am more than happy to spend whatever money we as a government and as a nation need to redress Indigenous disadvantage, and in 2006 it is very important that Indigenous Australians also share in the prosperity of modern Australia. The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 2006 is designed to have a major positive impact on the lives of Indigenous Australians. The amendments set out in the bill have arisen as a result of three separate reports into the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. Three reports have been conducted over a period of almost a decade, and all three made recommendations for changes that will help to streamline and update the provisions in the act to ensure improved outcomes for both Australia's Indigenous people and those relevant stakeholders who play a large and important part in their lives. I think there been an excessive focus in recent years on self-determination and an insufficient emphasis on accountability and outcomes. It really is important that, as a nation, we look at what we can do to improve the situation of Indigenous Australians. I just think that so often the Labor Party the past-like the Labor Party today-has remained some distance from reality. It is all about slogans, tokens and talking up what can be done, but this government is determined to bring about practical reconciliation. We are determined to make sure that there is the same level of accountability for Indigenous organisations as there is for other organisations in the general community. We need, in my view, to convince the Australian people that there are the appropriate levels of accountability with respect to Indigenous spending and, if the government is able to convince the people of Australia that this has at last been brought about, we will find that the government will be able to obtain the political support necessary to spend the additional dollars which are undoubtedly necessary for future expenditure in the area of Indigenous assistance. The underlying objectives of the amendment in the bill being debated here today are to improve access to Aboriginal land for the purpose of development, specifically mining; to introduce an improved decision-making framework for Aboriginal people for land use; and to encourage improvements in the living conditions in both economic and social terms for Aboriginals living in the Northern Territory. The three reports which fed into the legislation include the Reeves report, which found that Aboriginal people are not benefiting economically as much as could be possible if administration and licensing of Aboriginal land were streamlined. John Reeves-and the member for Lingiari would has well know John Reeves, who was a former distinguished member of this place-is someone who does not look at the Indigenous situation through ideological perspectives; he looks at it as someone who wants to bring about real, meaningful, substantial, important and positive change for Indigenous in Australians. The reports which fed into the legislation suggested changes to the act to enable greater ease in negotiating agreements for development, especially mining on Aboriginal land. The Reeves report noted that an inalienable freehold title to over 40 per cent of the Northern Territory land has brought insignificant benefits to the Aboriginal residents of the Northern Territory. I think that most honourable members would agree that this is indisputably a fact. We find that, Indigenous residents in the Northern Territory have received the dollars, they certainly have not received the outcomes. Anyone who can defend the failed process we have seen over the last 200 years in dealing with Indigenous matters, in my view, has very little credibility at all. The Reeves report also noted that changes to the act could make things better. It recommended that 18 regional land councils be formed under the umbrella of a single peak body to be known as the Northern Territory Aboriginal Council as well as a modified administration system for exploration and mining on Aboriginal land that has reduced regulations. Personally, I believe that the current structure of legislation for land rights in the Northern Territory is fatally flawed. I do not believe the 1976 legislation was appropriate and, while it may have made some people have a warm, inner glow and feel good, ultimately the people the legislation was intended to benefit-namely, the Indigenous people of the Northern Territoryhave simply been sold short. A second report released by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs suggested that the recommendations of the Reeves report were perhaps too aggressive and suggested incremental changes. Thirdly, the Manning report recommended changes to the time allowable for the negotiation of exploration and mining leases. A change suggested by the report was a period slightly longer than two years, which takes into account the weather patterns in the Top End. Further time extensions were also allowable under the Manning report suggestions. While there are differences in the recommendations of the three reports, there are also similarities, the main one being the general consensus that the act in its present form can be improved and that these improvements could while have a positive impact financially and socially on the Indigenous people of the Northern Territory. I am somewhat attracted to the recommendations made by John Reeves QC. He is someone who has put aside his former political mantra and is prepared to basically cut out the verbiage, to sit down and say, ‘We have tried it every other way. We have tried tokenism, we have tried symbolism, we have tried to make people feel warm and gooey inside but ultimately as a nation, as a government and as a people we really have a responsibility to address Indigenous disadvantage and all the previous systems we have adopted have comprehensively failed.' On the issue of exploration and mining on Aboriginal lands, the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 2006 includes provisions that will increase core negotiation periods for licences from 12 months to 24 months, while also giving the Northern Territory government the power to end negotiations if it is of the opinion that a company's intentions in the negotiations are not genuine. It will also enable the Northern Territory to act as observer to any negotiations-previously, this was a role carried out by the Australian government. It will retain the provision that allows the traditional landowners to have the power to withhold consent for mining companies to begin exploration. In the views of the drafters of the legislation, this enables the Aboriginal people to safeguard their own interests. Those exploration proposals that are vetoed by the owners will be subject to a one-year moratorium instead of the current five-year moratorium. This will give the Indigenous landowners greater opportunity to explore more quickly renewed avenues to secure benefits for their people. When the Northern Territory ultimately becomes a state, I think it is really important that the land rights act be repatriated to the Northern Territory. I suppose the member for Lingiari and I-who do not really agree on very much-might well agree that, if the Northern Territory is to take its place as a state within the Commonwealth of Australia, the Northern Territory ought to be treated in this area in the same way as all other Australian states. On other proposals for economic developments, the bill includes provisions that will give Indigenous people greater control over the issues by which they are quintessentially the most affected. These include the increase to the threshold of the contracts which need ministerial approval from the current $100,000 to $1,000,000-that makes a lot of logical, sound common sense; allowing leases to include provisions allowing future transfers; and increasing the lease term that requires ministerial approval from the current 10 years to 40 years. It really is important that issues involving mining and exploration leases, and the negotiations that are a detailed and important factor in finalisIndigenous ing these leases, are as streamlined and as workable as possible to ensure that the Indigenous people of Australia receive the greatest benefits, yet it is also important to retain the legislative protections that ensure the integrity of the act. Further changes proposed by the bill include allowing land councils to delegate certain decision-making permissions to regional groups and clarifying the procedures required to establish new land councils. Currently, the act rather peculiarly states that there must be a ‘substantial majority' to be favour. This will be changed to a 55 per cent majority. Changes in the bill also include that future funding to land councils be based on the amount of work that they do and the results that they get, rather than simply on the number of people they represent. This will help to reduce the possibility of excessive funding going to any stagnant bodies. I said earlier that if we can ensure that we have the same level of accountability in the area of Indigenous affairs then it will be so much easier for a government to get the political support of the Australian people to make the economic and social investment necessary to redress Indigenous disadvantage. I think that most Australians have a view that much of the money spent on Indigenous affairs is simply frittered away, wasted or stolen. All of us know of the horrendous reports we have seen in the media about mismanagement in Indigenous organisations, the historic lack of accountability and the way in which many people use the assets of Indigenous organisations as though they are their own assets. What happens of course is that that leaves a vacuum for the Pauline Hansons of this world to come in. They are able to make these wide pronouncements. People are concerned about wastage of government money, whether it be wastage in the area of affairs or wastage in the area of non-Indigenous affairs, but because there is this suspicion that could build up in the Australian community about the fact that money spent in the area of Aboriginal affairs is wasted it makes it very difficult for the government of the day, regardless of political colour, with the best intentions to get the support of the Australian people to redress the very obvious ongoing issues of Indigenous disadvantage. The bill currently before the chamber includes provisions to ensure transparency in in land council cost recovery measures as well as giving power to the Commonwealth Office of Evaluation and Audit to investigate land councils. I know that whenever an amendment is proposed to any law there is a range of views. Indigenous affairs is an area which excites a great deal of interest not only in the community but on both sides of the House. I would be prepared to admit that everyone in the House wants to see Indigenous outcomes improved, but I think it is really important to take the rose-coloured glasses off and to look at what needs to be done in a practical sense to ensure sensible, practical outcomes. Regrettably, I suspect the Australian Labor Party is still locked into the tired, old, failed-however well-meaning-policies of the past. This government has been prepared to look beyond the square. We have been prepared in a range of areas to take innovative initiatives. In recent times there have been a number of suggestions which have gained the support of many Indigenous people. So, while the opposition might well oppose this legislation, it really ought not to denigrate the fact that this government is trying to sweep away the lack of achievement in the interests of improving Indigenous outcomes. The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 2006 is designed to assist the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory to see a greater benefit from the immense amounts of land that we do have in the Northern Territory. I do not see this bill as being an absolute panacea, I do see it as being a very positive and important step forward. I am very pleased to be able to stand in the House today to support it and I formally commend the bill to the chamber.",119
184,Mr MELHAM,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"I rise to oppose the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 2006 and to support the amendment moved by the member for Lingiari which is in the following terms: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst welcoming many measures contained in the Bill including the mining and exploration provisions, the House is of the opinion that some other provisions of this Bill: (1) undermine the integrity of the Principal Act by eroding the rights of traditional owners and the independence of land councils; (2) are a recipe for uncertainty for development on Aboriginal land; (3) should be withdrawn and redrafted to provide a more balanced approach that ensures: (a) the informed consent of traditional owners to major changes; (b) that traditional owners as land owners are not unfairly constrained in optimising their financial and other benefits under the 99 year lease; (c) the better promotion and facilitation of economic development on Aboriginal land including home ownership opportunities for Aboriginal people; (d) the protection of traditional owners' rights to control access and development on their own land; and (e) the maintenance of the independence and viability of land councils to defend and pursue the interests of traditional owners and other Aboriginal people living on Aboriginal land”. That amendment encompasses most of the objections that I have to this legislation, albut though it does not cover all of them. At the outset of my contribution, I point out that I, together with other members of this House, was involved in an inquiry by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, for which the report was called Unlocking the future: the report of the inquiry into the Reeves Review of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. That report was tabled in August 1999. I notice that it is referred to in the explanatory memorandum to this bill. The honourable member for Lingiari, who is at the table, was a member of that committee. The significant thing about that committee is that the Native Title Act was all the rage at the time, with many arguments about it, and the issue of land rights was well and truly on the agenda. A committee of this House, chaired by the Hon. Lou Lieberman MP, as he then was, with a majority of government members, managed to produce a unanimous report to this parliament, and right up front was recommendation 1, on page 8, which says: The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 (‘the Act') not be amended without: - traditional Aboriginal owners in the Northern Territory first understanding the nature and purpose of any amendments and as a group giving their consent; and - any Aboriginal communities or groups that may be affected having been consulted and given adequate opportunity to express their views. I repeat that it was a unanimous report with a government majority, and the bill before the House today does not meet that basic test of proper consultation and informed consent of traditional Aboriginal owners in the Northern Territory. The bill that is before us was added to by this government as against the bill that was proposed some months ago, and I believe it is all done in the hysterical climate that is being generated by the current Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, who is a bit hairy chested and out there in a big way. He obviously sees this as an issue in which he can impress some of his colleagues and maybe pick up some votes in a future deputy leadership ballot. That is in his mind. It has been reported on in the press. This minister has a big mouth. The problem is that some of the people he talks to report back. I do not have a problem with him having an ego. I have a problem with him breaking all the proper protocols and sensitivities on an act of parliament that was first proposed by the Whitlam government but enacted by the Fraser government and that has served Aboriginal people well. In effect, paragraph 8 of the explanatory memorandum gives it away. Under ‘Objectives', it says: The principal objectives are to improve access to Aboriginal land for development, especially mining. The National Indigenous Times of 15 June 2006 dissected the bill that is before the House. There is an analysis by Chris Graham, who says: Briefly, the government is seeking to wipe out the independence of the NT land councils-to gain control of them. The land councils' financial resources will now come under the direction of Mal Brough. He will decide the level of funding they receive (if they receive funding at all). The Minister is also proposing to give himself the power to delegate land council functions to other bodies-bodies he has created and funded. What does this mean in practical terms? It means that the land councils are dead. They will no longer do the bidding of traditional owners-they must do the bidding of the government, or they will be abolished. So what is the intent of the Howard government amendments? They are designed to increase white access to the resource rich lands of the Northern Territory. The government basically states that in its objectives on page 3 of the explanatory memorandum. From my experience of dealing with the four land councils in the Northern Territory-and I think the member for Lingiari can attest to this-the Central Land Council in particular and the Northern Land Council have served their communities well. What worries me about what the government is doing is that it is attempting to undermine those particular land councils, to break them up. In my view, that will not result in better outcomes for Indigenous people in the Northern Territory. The government openly says that the bill is about devolving decision making. In my experience, and I think the member for Lingiari would attest to this, resources are stretched with the current land councils. That is because, in the 10 years of this government, they have really been squeezed and they are suffering the death of a thousand cuts. If you further devolve the decision making of the Northern Land Council and the Central Land Council, you are not going to get a better outcome, in my view, for Indigenous people or, indeed, for miners. You need properly resourced land councils. The smaller the land councils the fewer the resources-it becomes a personnel problemand I think there is a real difficulty in proper decision making taking place. As I said, I think the National Indigenous Times has done the most comprehensive analysis of the spin of the government, and I commend it to honourable members. Here is an example of the spin. Mr Brough said: The reforms to the Land Rights Act will help create future opportunities for Aboriginal These amendments allow for 99 year leases which will make it easier for Indigenous people to own a home or establish a business in Aboriginal townships. The facts are that the government amendments will actually ensure that traditional owners will forgo their ownership of land and the associated rights to control entry onto their land. That really is what this bill is all about. Here is some more spin that I think is worth quoting: The amendments to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 will allow changes to land tenure in Aboriginal townships, streamline processes for land development and raise performance and improve accountability of Land Councils and royalty bodies. The facts are that the reforms will vastly reduce the independence of land councils and a range of activities. The only increased accountability would be to the federal minister, not to Aboriginal constituents. The amendments will also create major governance problems, with small, under-resourced land councils forced to negotiate with large government bureaucracies and cashed up mining companies. Since the government gained control of both Houses of this parliament we have seen its ideology coming through. It is attacking and cherry-picking those areas on which it has had a long-held view. The land rights act, for this Prime Minister, is one of those pieces of legislation. This is not good public policy in which the government is engaging. We need to respect the rights of our Indigenous Australians. We need to respect their right to say no and to have them properly resourced so that there is informed consent in relation to their decision making. What we should not have is a situation where the land councils have a gun held to their heads by this government and this minister basically saying, people. ‘If you don't approve development we're going to put you out of business.' That is the thrust of what this legislation is about. That is why the land councils have a problem with this legislation. There was a press release on 1 June 2006 in which the land council expressed serious concerns regarding certain amendments. Mr Fry said: Many of the amendments improve workability and are welcome, since they will remove red tape and speed up processes for mining and other developments. Let's cut to the chase here: many Indigenous people do want mining because they see it as their only way to advance themselves and their communities. They are not anti development; they just want a say over the development on their land. Mr Fry also said: The proposal that Land Councils be forced to delegate land use functions to small corporations, and prioritise scarce resources to them, is unworkable and inefficient and will promote dispute and jeopardise development outcomes. He is able to point to successful outcomes such as ‘the Alice Springs to Darwin railway, mining, pipelines, the foreshadowed Commonwealth radioactive waste facility'which they support-‘or the ENI Blacktip gas processing plant near Wadeye', which was signed off in May. These outcomes will be ‘seriously jeopardised if a myriad of underfunded, inefficient, small corporations are responsible for performing professional functions'. That is the real problem here: what the government is proposing is inefficient, unworkable organisations with scarce resources taking over development. So I commend the second reading amendment to members and I say to this government: you are going down the wrong track. You are blaming the victims. You are actually not producing decent legislation or decent policy. In part some of this bill will hinder development and create problems, and we will be revisiting this issue down the track.

185,Mr KATTER,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,Kennedy) (7.28 pm)Kennedy. Mr Martin Ferguson-How could you forget?,126
186,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,How could I forget? Mr Martin Ferguson-How'd you find your way to the chamber? You're a stranger in the House.,126
187,Mr KATTER,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"When I see how you occupy your time here it is no wonder that I am a stranger in the House. I just did some quick research before I came down to give my speech in this debate on the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 2006. I looked up how much water the Northern Territory has. The Northern Territory has 77,000 megalitres of water in the annual run-off from its great rivers. I then looked up how much the Murray-Darling has. The Murray-Darling has only 22,000 megalitres. Half of the Northern Territoryand a lot of that would take at least half the water-is owned by people of Aboriginal descent, First Australians. Some 61,000 First Australians in the Northern Territory own 600,000 square kilometres-half the surface area-and they own let's say half of the water supply, some 30,000 megalitres. The Murray-Darling on 22,000 megalitres supports 54,000 farming families-that does not include the 200,000 jobs that are there-and produces some $15,000 million a year of agricultural production. I ask: why do the most land-rich people on earth have almost all of the most appalling social statistical qualifying data concerning them? Whether it be life expectancy, income, alcoholism or trauma rates-these areas could arguably be amongst the worse in the world. How can (Mr these people be so enormously rich and yet so enormously poor? When I was appointed minister in the Queensland government in 1983 I had to address that very seriously and very quickly. The education department had moved their teachers out of two schools and were threatening to move them from all of the schools in the gulf and peninsula. The police force were making similar threats and had their police removed from Pormpuraaw during mass rioting at the time. Similar threats took place at Yarrabah. They attempted to ban alcohol. They thought alcohol was the problem, as the current Queensland government does. That is what I walked into at the time. So we had to do some hard thinking. I was quite surprised to find out that Anglo races-the English, if you like-got private ownership in 1292. Quia Emptores was passed in 1292. At the time of the First World War the Anglos had nearly half of the world's industrial production and about 40 per cent of its wealth-England and America put together. Why were these people so enormously successful? They were the one race on earth that had private ownership far earlier than anyone else. The next ones would appear to be the French, and that was not until the 1800s, and then the Germans in 1850. The Japanese only really got private ownership, the way we know it, in 1946. One can see the extraordinary success story that unravelled with the coming of private ownership to Japan, and one can see the same phenomenon occurring now in China. If you are looking for a reason as to why those races got ahead of the rest of the worldthere may have been other reasons-the defining factor was that the Anglos had private ownership far faster than anyone else in the world, three or four centuries before anyone else in the world. Why is this group of people in the Northern Territory, the most land-rich people on earth by a long way, so incredibly poor in every sense of the word? They do not have any private ownership. I have been quite amazed to hear each of the opposition speakers attack the minister over his use of the word ‘communist'. He could have used the word ‘socialist' or whatever, but most certainly there is community ownership of land as opposed to an individual or a family owning this land. I did not go into the job in 1983 with ability to manoeuvre. The most successful community appeared to be Hopevale. I met with a person called Lester Rosendale, who became one of the leaders of the group that got together to change things in Queensland and who at that time was secretary to the the advisory council of the church at Hopevale. The Rosendale family were heavyweights in the church. I said, ‘What have you done with land ownership here?' He said, ‘We have private ownership; here's the map.' He had a big map of Hopevale with all the blocks drawn up on it. I said, ‘Legally it is still supposed to belong to the government with a beneficial ownership to the church.' He said, ‘No, forget about that.' I said, ‘What about tribes?' He said no and waved it off. I was looking for a reason as to why Hopevale was the shining light of success amongst all the Aboriginal communities. It was the only one that had this private ownership arrangement. We moved on. The next community I went to was Pormpuraaw. I met Jackson Shortjoe and Eddie Holroyd. I said, ‘What do you want?' One of them, Eddie Holroyd, said, ‘We want self-management.' I said: ‘That's coming. Forget about that. Move on to the next item.' Jackson Shortjoe then said, ‘I want to have a go at the cleanskins, the cattle that are running around here unbranded.' The cattle were running around on government land. At one stage they were government cattle but no-one had been able to get them in. I think some members of the community were joining their cousins in little raids on the cattle in Pormpuraaw and moving them out to their cousins' place. He thought it would be better if he was mustering them for himself. I said: ‘If you are going to do that, Jackson, you are going to have to build yards and put up fences. You will have to put out a lot of money here. I don't have government money to give you and I'm pretty certain the feds won't give you any money. Every bit of any money they have put into anything they've lost, so I doubt whether you will get anything from them. What say you take up private ownership of a block and then you get some money off the bank to do it yourself?' He said, ‘But we wouldn't be able to get the private ownership.' With a confidence that I most certainly did not feel I said: ‘I'm the boss. I make the decisions. If I decide that going to be private ownership, then you will own it and nobody else.' He said, ‘Yeah, that would be good.' Later we had discussions with Eddie Holroyd and went down the same path conversationally. Let me go back to Hopevale for one moment, because CDEP, the Work for the Dole scheme, started off with a Hopevale person called Greg. They did a 60 Minutes program on the scheme. It is the only time in the tory of 60 Minutes that they did a repeat of a program the following week, because the positive public reaction was so immense to what Greg had achieved at what was then Weipa South and is now Napranum. Hopevale went on to produce Matty Bowen-the greatest footballer in Australia at the present moment, to quote Peter Sterling; some of the selectors obviously disagree but I would agree with Sterling-Eric Deeral, the first Aboriginal person to be elected to a parliament in Australian history, and Noel Pearson, who needs no introduction to this parliament. Torres Strait Islanders, in sharp contrast, are arguably the most successful race on earth in terms of the mothering of children and life expectancy, despite being away from medical access, in terms of trauma, alcoholism and crime. I remember being on Mer Island and asking the storekeeper how often the store got broken into, because we used to average one government store a week in a lot of Aboriginal communities. The lady said, ‘What do you mean?' I had to explain to her what ‘broken into' meant and she recoiled in horror and said, ‘No, we don't have anything like that.' The Mer case or the Mabo case, as it is known now-it was really the Father Passi case, because Mabo was picked out on the second day-one of the most famous cases in Australian jurisprudential history, centred is on the fact that these people knew that they owned this area of land. It was acknowledged by everyone on the island that they owned that land. The government did not really interfere in any way with that ownership so they had continuous occupation and ownership which was universally recognised. I went on to recognise that arrangement in the legislation. If the Premier, God bless him, had listened to me and we had released the his- deeds of grant on Mer Island, there would have been no Mabo case. But he listened to $12½ million worth of lawyers' advice, which was entirely wrong. But the judges were right in saying that those people owned that land. That was the decision of the Bjelke-Petersen government and every member of that government and every member of parliament recognised that ownership and so ultimately did the High Court-and who would argue with that decision? We could argue very much over the way it has been extended, but we will leave that for another day. At Pormpuraaw we had only ever mustered 360 head of cattle. The government, which was responsible for Pormpuraaw, or Edward River as it then was, had only ever succeeded in mustering 360 head of cattle. But within three years, under Eddie Holroyd and Jackson Shortjoe, under the private ownership arrangements and the arrangements we had for the cattle, they got in 6,000 head. Under government-community ownership we got in 360 head, which was the maximum we ever got in. Then, under the control of the federal government, at the adjoining Aboriginal area, Aurukun, they started community ownership. The church had done a wonderful job there in fact. They had 12,000 head of cattle. It was turned over to community ownership and was run under community ownership, which really amounts to white outsiders coming in and doing it for you. That is really what community ownership amounts to: almost every store and cattle operation is run by outsider whitefellas, which is a dreadful situation in itself. It is demeaning for every single person of Aboriginal descent in these communities. The Aurukun cattle operation was run exclusively by whitefellas. They had inherited 12,000 head of cattle. Within six years they had no cattle at all. But under entirely black private ownership we went to 6,000 head of cattle mustered behind wire. This is an incredible success story which proves conclusively that if you move in this direction there is no reason why these people will not be just as successful as any other race of people on earth-if I may use the term ‘race'. But I was in no situation to make these decisions. I must say that at the time. I had read with very great interest the works of Konrad Lorenz, who received the Nobel Prize during that period for his work on terriSo tory and aggression, and Robert Ardrey-his magnificent books, including The Territorial Imperative. As one person remarked, it is the most important book since Das Kapital was written. If I were to reduce what Ardrey was saying in his group of books, of which The Territorial Imperative is one, to a single phrase, it would be that in Russia the year that the Communist manifesto was written was the same year that the Lincoln homestead act was propounded in the United States. Half of the United States was taken up under the Lincoln homestead act. Everyone got a mile by a mile for occupation, cultivation and production-those were the three criteria that you had to meet. You had to live on it, you had to produce something of value from it, you had to cultivate it and you had to use the land. If you did, you got a square mile for free. Remember the big land rush in the movies when they rushed to put their pegs into the ground? That land rush resulted from the Lincoln homestead act. So Ardrey said that what happened was that Russia was turned into an experiment in community ownership and the United States was turned into an example of private, family territorial ownership. He compared the performance of both states. Russia was the biggest basketcase on earth, having to import huge amounts of food from outside, yet it had a bigger area of cultivated, arable land than the United States had-much bigger in fact. Nearly 90 per cent of the food produced in the United States by agricultural production was surplus to their requirements. They were feeding themselves and nine other people for every American at the time. Let me move on and say that the question that I asked myself was: how do we move these people from where they are to where these people should be? I asked them the question first, because I actually had little say and little room in which to manoeuvre. we went out and called a public meeting in each place and we said: ‘Hey, Fellas, this reserve area is in the name of the Queensland government. We're the legal owners. You people are the beneficial owners, but the name on the ownership papers for Pormpuraaw, Kowanyama or Lockhart River is that of the Queensland government. We do not want to continue in ownership of this land. It is not right, it is not moral, it is not legal and it is not proper. We want to get out. We have to put someone's name on this bit of paper. Whose name do you want on it? Do you want your local shire council name? Do you want your land council name? Do you want the government's name to continue on it? Do you want private names to go onto this bit of paper? We will cut it up into little pieces and put private names on it. Whose name do you want to go on the bit of paper?' They asked a lot of questions about private ownership. It was a concept they were not familiar with. At the end, about 3,800 people voted and only three voted against private ownership. Do you want to own your own house, your own farm and your own cattle station or do you want the councilwhatever council or government that might be-to own it? Surprise, surprise! The vote was 3,800 to three. Nobody in this place has gone out there and asked them. Nobody has sat down and given them time. In this process that took three months, I think I was home for three nights. This process took an enormous amount of energy and commitment. There are about 100,000 hectares of flat land at Lockhart River; it has a 60-inch rainfall. The land is very suitable for grazing or farming. We decided that at least we could plough out the blady grass and put in improved pasture and that would provide about two beasts to an acre or three beasts to a hectare. That would produce $50 million in income, which would have put the 100 families that lived at Lockhart River on an income of $400,000 each. It would take a lot of money-we are maybe talking about $20 million-to move from where we were to put that fencing in, to plough out the blady grass, to plant the improved pasture, to put in waters and to set up a bit of ancillary feeding. I did not have a government that would give $20 million to the people, and I am damn sure that the federal government, the Hawke government, after the series of disasters that they had herited, were not going to put a cent in it. Clyde Holding told me that they most certainly would not. So where was the $20 million going to come from? We felt that, if we put the blocks out to private ownership, these people would own a piece of land; they would have something they could take to the bank. Mr Deputy Speaker, when you think about it, that is the only way it can ever happen. The bank has to have some security, and it is the only one with pockets big enough to be able to provide the finance. As far as the house building went, we provided them with the wherewithal to build their own homes, and 360 jobs were created. The interesting phenomenon was that, where many houses had been utterly destroyed-and Kowanyama was a classic example of this-and probably 70 per cent of the houses had been destroyed by the occupants, people who were not involved with the building program suddenly started to look after their own homes. When people started to realise they could build a home themselves, it was enablement or, to quote Noel Pearson in his very wonderful speech to the Press Club, it was ‘capability'. In retrospect what we were giving those people was the capability to move forward. I hear a lot about education. Peter HarveySutton, a schoolteacher at All Souls, is about the only person I know who has been successful. He frankly said, ‘If you want a place in the football team, you had better turn up to school and do your homework.' It was a very cogent argument. Most of the leadership of the Aboriginal communities in Queensland come from All Souls school, and it is the result of very great people like Peter HarveySutton as an educator. Finally, Bjelke-Petersen said, ‘How many families do you have, Bob, that can run these things?'-he did not think we had too many; inI think he thought I was a bit of a bleeding heart-and I said, ‘Five'. We had about 40,000 people living in these communities. He was quite staggered. I think he expected me to say hundreds or thousands. He said, ‘Only five?' and I said, ‘Well, you asked me the question!' At that point in time he realised, as everyone in this place should realise, that we must move forward. Do not worry about the past. Let us move forward into the sort of world that we can create for these people. (Time expired)",126
188,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"I must say that it is a pleasure to follow the member for Kennedy. This debate is about the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 2006, and I am trying to work out in my own mind where the Soviet Union fits into the debatebut it was a delight to listen to the member. Having said that, I think we have to front up to the fact that the centre of this debate is question of consent. It is about the rights of our own Indigenous community and whether or not we treat them with respect and are willing to support their determination to work out their problems. I think the starting point for the discussion is revisiting a government majority report of the House entitled Unlocking the future: the report of the Inquiry into the Reeves Review of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. To understand the debate, you only have to go to the very first recommendation of the report. That report simply says that, if we are going to have a look at the future of this act of parliament, we have to start thinking about the requirement to consult the traditional Aboriginal owners and their requirement to give consent to changes with respect to the very operation of the bill before the House this evening. I think that is the benchmark for our not only being able to work with traditional owners and the Indigenous community generally to achieve a proper assessment of land rights legislation but also making sure that we give them the capacity to pursue and put in place not only self-determination but also a major improvement in the social indicators that are of concern to the great majority of Australians-issues going to access to housing, the level of education attainment and problems with health and employment, just to name a few. Interestingly, the history of the act will show that it provided for the immediate transfer to Aboriginal people by freehold title of 258,000 square kilometres of land, which was formerly government reserve-land set aside for Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory. It also correctly provided for the processing of land claims, which is one of the issues that I want to address this evening, based on traditional ownership with the claims lodged by land councils to an Abothe riginal land commissioner. About 44 per cent of Northern Territory land has been granted as Aboriginal land under the existing act, with a further 10 per cent subject to claim. The legislation to date has provided for traditional owners in certain circumstances to refuse consent to mining and other developments on their land. That is not because they are against development; it is about trying to make sure that there is a balance between development and traditional rights of our Indigenous community. It has also provided for negotiations with developers and the payment of royalties to the Aboriginal beneficiaries, which is about the distribution of financial assistance to Aboriginal communities and the funding of land councils so that they meet their expenses in looking after the Indigenous community and properly representing them, with 30 per cent of those royalties being for the benefit of incorporated Aboriginal groups in the Northern Territory. That is the background of the legislation before the House this evening. Importantly, it is part of our trying to front up to the errors of our ways in days gone by. The problem is that this bill seeks to undermine the principles laid out in the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill. The intent of this legislation is to actually diminish the principle of self-determination. I personally believe that is plain wrong. Not only is that my view but it is also the view of the opposition, as reflected in a second reading amendment moved by the member for Lingiari, Mr Warren Snowdon, who knows better than anyone in this House the challenges confronting the Indigenous community. Unlike anyone else in this House, he spent the last week consulting different communities in the Northern Territory about their view on the draft legislation and how the opposition should react to it so as to ensure their voice is heard in this debate. Unfortunately, the member for Solomon, who also represents a very small part of the Northern Territory, has not taken the opportunity to consult the Indigenous community and does not properly articulate their views in this debate. As shadow minister for resources, there are some aspects of the bill that the opposition very much supports and these provisions have the support of the Indigenous community. The Indigenous community of the Northern Territory wants investment. It wants to develop resources and wants to ensure that in the development of those resources it is consulted with a view to maximising the return not just in the form of royalties to the Indigenous community but, more importantly, in social and economic development. The Indigenous community more than anyone wants economic development in the Northern Territory. It wants resource development and tourism. That is about creating opportunities locally for training, schooling, employment and enlarging the economic cake available to the Indigenous community in the Northern Territory. I think it is about time that the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs understood that he is wrong. The Indigenous community is not anti economic development. It is more pro economic development than the minister himself. It is a question of how you do it. The best way to achieve development in Australia is by sitting down and negotiating with people and taking them with you. That is the intent of the act, as it currently stands. But, unfortunately, it is not the intent of some of the changes embodied in the bill before the House because they actually diminish the capacity for land councils in the Northern Territory to properly represent and lobby on behalf of the Indigenous community. With respect to the issue of resources, following consultation over a long period, the changes embodied in the bill have the support of the Indigenous community and appropriately so. That is why the opposition also supports them because they are aimed at trying to get a decent outcome-trying to facilitate development over a shorter period and trying to shorten the negotiating period. So, in the interests of all groups, it is proposed that the negotiations covering mining access to Aboriginal lands be streamlined. That has arisen after a period of consultation. It is about consent. It includes the ability of the Northern Territory government to establish deadlines for negotiations after an appropriate period in order to encourage quicker agreements. It is about preventing protracted negotiations. It sets down a core negotiating period of approximately 30 months to provide a realistic time frame for negotiations on exploration and mining developments. We have achieved it in the past and we can do it better in the future. If you have any doubts about that, just look at the success of the negotiating process involving the upgrade and extension of the Darwin to Alice Springs rail line. That was done in consultation with and support of the Indigenous community. People put the effort into actually achieving an outcome. The Northern Territory will be able to set more realistic deadlines for people to work towards and that is what it is about-people working towards realistic outcomes so that they all know that if they achieve the necessary outcome and negotiations, everyone benefits. It also sends a message to some in the mining sector that we will no longer cop warehousing of areas. This bill aims to prevent the warehousing of areas of Aboriginal land where there is no intention by a mining company to explore in the short to medium term. That is not just about the Indigenous community's best interests; it is about the best interests of all Australians. No mining company should be able to warehouse land without properly considering exploration and development. It puts the onus on these mining companies to pursue the exploration opportunities and decide whether they are actually going to mine. It is not a challenge to mining companies with a good reputation that supports them; it is about the rogues in the industry who are not prepared to make the necessary decisions about exploration and development. It also reinforces the importance of local management by delegating decisions to the Northern Territory government. It will facilitate faster and more responsive processes in development for the resources sector. It will also facilitate as development in the Northern Territory. The problems relating to negotiations will diminish, but it also raises another serious question about how you conduct these negotiations. For an extended period now the Minerals Council of Australia has criticised the Howard government for not properly resourcing representative native title bodies to conduct these negotiations on an equal footing. These negotiations are not cheap. They extend over a long period and you need to consult anthropologists and legal representatives to ensure that Indigenous communities are properly represented. I remind the House that the Howard government is part of the review of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. It has to get serious about properly resourcing and funding the Indigenous community's representatives. Negotiations with mining companies have to be on an equal footing, because mining companies get a benefit as a result of successful negotiations. Think about what the Indigenous community wants out of resource development. They are saying, ‘We are pro resource development, but we want to be able to negotiate what is also of interest to us.' And it is bigger than the issue of royalties. It is not just about money; it goes to issues such as social outcomes, health and education and how you lock in training. For example, how do we extend beyond Comalco in Queensland and the fact that this company has given an undertaking that any Indigenous kid who finishes year 10 is guaranteed a job at Comalco in Weipa? Those are the types of models that we want to extend to the Northern Territory. But the Indigenous community has to be resourced to facilitate those outcomes, because it is about negotiating processes. The Indigenous community is prepared to manage and facilitate these processes but let's resource it. It is not just about the law of the land, Mr minerHoward; it is also about avoiding lopsided negotiations. Lopsided negotiations are not good for industry, they are not good for the Indigenous community and they are not good for Australia at large. Lopsided negotiations, be they in the workplace or in the Northern Territory with the Indigenous community, where they are not conducted on an equal footing, leave a bitter taste in the minds of the participants in those negotiations. That is not about good economic development in Australia. This is a very important bill, but I point out to the House and, importantly, to Australians listening to this debate that the Howard government is not prepared to extend the debate but is guillotining it at 8.30 this evening to limit the number of speakers. I think that is a disgrace. If it succeeds in gaining proper consent and proper consideration of negotiations, this bill will create long-term economic opportunities for Australia. Why, therefore, should the Howard government limit the opportunity for members to make a contribution to what is a very important debate for the future of Australia? Having dealt with some of the positive aspects of the bill, I want to remind the House that there are some negatives. I have serious concerns about a range of issues raised by the member for Lingiari and reflected in his second reading amendment, which I absolutely support. Let us go to the issue of land councils. Historically, they have had guaranteed funding so they can do their job. The government now suggests that guaranteed funding should be replaced by ministerial discretion. I just scratch my head. That is about Big Brother from Canberra again saying: ‘If you do what you're told when you're told, you might get funding.' That is not about cooperative negotiations and encouraging the Indigenous communities; it is about waving the big stick-‘Do what you're told when you're told or we're going to cut out your funding.' It is about politicisation; is not about a long-term commitment to economic development and the improvement of the lot of Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory. It is also about taking away the independence of the councils. If you are prepared to express opposition to a bill such as this, which is premised on consent, then it is stored in the back of the minister's mind and you will pay the price over time because you dared to question the decision-making process of government. I am totally opposed to that approach to government, which should be about a strong democracy and people being able to express whether or not they support an aspect of proposed legislation. It is wrong to give the appropriations to the minister so he can decide who the favoured sons and daughters in the Indigenous community will be if they do what the Howard government tells them. Funding is essential for the activities of the Aboriginal land councils in the Northern Territory and their capacity to facilitate negotiations with the resources sector and a whole variety of other sectors, including the tourism sector, which I have responsibility for as shadow minister. Then there is the issue of 99-year leasing. Where else in Australia would you get a bill which says that not only is an Indigenous community required to accept 99-year leasing but Big Brother in Canberra is going to determine capping at five per cent per annum of the approved capital value of the land for rental purposes? That is not about proper market considerations. Let the market play out. If there is going to be leasing for a 99year period, then let the market determine the appropriate rent. Why should politicians interfere with the operation of the market? Let's have proper economic development. Make the investment and take the market risk. But here we are told that, no matter what the economic potential of development it is on Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory, the maximum rate will be capped at five per cent. Why would the Aboriginal community bother to cooperate? There are a whole host of economic opportunities in the Northern Territory which will return a bigger rent than five per cent, but this government says you will only be entitled to five per cent. Then there is the issue of more land councils to be set up to suit the needs of the government. There is a suggestion that some of the amendments embodied in this bill might, in fact, breach the Racial Discrimination Act. It is for the Indigenous community to consider their legal options. I encourage them: while the rule of law applies in Australia, explore your available options. Unfortunately, time is limited this evening. Members are not really in a position to use all of the time normally available to members of parliament because of the guillotine of the debate. In conclusion, I say that there are aspects of this bill that, as the shadow minister for resources, I totally support. They are about facilitating economic development in the Northern Territory and, in doing so, bringing long-term benefit to Australia and, perhaps more importantly, bringing long-term economic and social improvements to the lot of the Indigenous community. Other aspects of the bill are crude, un-Australian and unacceptable. I urge members of the House to support the second reading amendment. I also urge those members on the other side of the House who supposedly have a conscience-they are talking about the rights of refugees at the moment-to think about the rights of the traditional owners of Australian land. Think about the Indigenous community. If you are prepared to talk about crossing the floor on the rights of refugees, think about crossing the floor on the rights of our own Indigenous people. Support the right to decent economic development based on consent of the Aboriginal people-home-grown Australians who want to determine their own future. It is a challenge for members with a so-called conscience to stand up on Aboriginal land rights in the Northern Territory. I commend the second reading amendment to the House. I support those aspects of the bill relating to resource development in the Northern Territory, but I indicate my total opposition to other aspects of the bill that members of the opposition have touched on in this important debate.",131
189,Mr ANDREN,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"The question that needs to be asked about the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 2006 is: how much of it has been put together with input and agreement by the people who actually own the land we are talking about? Informed advice I have received is that the claimed nine years consultation from the discredited Reeves report onwards is ‘absolute garbage'. The Northern Territory government and the Australian government, as well as the land councils, stand condemned in their failure to properly disseminate information about proposals such as these to people who may have several, indeed many, languages but English and its peculiar terms is not one of their preferred or understood tongues. Now we are having legislation rushed through yet again and, despite the minister's visit to Northern Australia at the weekend, the landowners involved in this still do not understand the concept of a lease, let alone the word. So much for the excitement we heard from the minister today about the prospect of ownership. This, after all, is Aboriginal land. Their land title is inalienable and equivalent to freehold title. It is land owned by those whose ancestors were custodians of the land for tens of thousands of years before them. Now we are about to return to the worse of paternalistic models. Through this legislation we set up a statutory body to take care of a head lease on traditional land and we ask its traditional owners to sign off for 99 years. This is at a time when many traditional owners-incidentally, ‘traditional' is a term absolutely foreign to many of the affected people-do not know after 30 years what the land rights act is in fact all about. People are the totally confused as to what a lease means. There is a massive communications problem that did not begin with this amendment; it began 150 or more years ago, and no real attempt has been made to address it in remote communities. The difference is that this land, while equivalent to freehold title, is held communally, reflecting the fluidity and communal nature of Aboriginal landownership-quite a different concept to our Western, market based individualistic world views. The current Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act provides that, unless the act or some other law determines, the consent of the traditional owners, the landowners, is always required before others may use the land. As things stand at the moment, if someone wants to use the traditional land, the relevant land council conducts negotiations with the traditional owners, with those affected by the proposal and with the proponents. The land council must respond to the views of the traditional Aboriginal owners. The councils must also use traditional or other agreed processes to allow those owners informed, collective consent. When a proposal is agreed to, the land council then directs the land trust to enter the agreement. When you consider that many traditional owners do not speak or read English, the substantial difficulties imposed by the incredible isolation of many of these people and the very different world views and concepts understood by all parties, it is clear how important and huge a task this is for the land councils. Yet the land council process is not without its serious weaknesses, which could and should have been addressed before this broad-brush and renewed paternalistic approach. I hear stories that even land council personnel cannot communicate with people in the homelands, yet their permission is sometimes obtained by dubious and highly questionable means. Is that now to be repeated many times over across northern Australia? This legislation may not technically be taking consent away from landowners, but I am advised that it will have that effect unless this process is explained far more clearly-in fact, unless it is explained full stop, which clearly has not been, from the feedback I have received from contacts throughout the Northern Territory. I understand that major banks could well have mortgages under a sublease over any land subject to these agreements. Say, for instance, the new leaseholder cannot pay. What happens? Do they sell? To whom? Could a non-Indigenous couple from Melbourne pay out the lease and secure a holiday home on the north Australian coast? Tell me why this cannot happen, Minister. Under this legislation you also do not any longer need a permit for entry to leasehold land. We could have a scenario where half the land affected by this legislation is eventually owned by whitefellas. According to the explanatory memorandum the legislation will open up Aboriginal land. Exactly. What better way to finally undermine aboriginal landownership, which is not a Torrens title type ownership but a spiritual association that goes back 40,000 years at least. The traditional owners simply do not understand the nature of these amendments, as was required under the original act. Schedule 1 of the existing act gave unalienable rights to traditional owners. It recognised clan and alliance or nation ownership. The existing act services the Aboriginals Benefit Account, which holds moneys equivalent to the royalties paid for mining. Thus, royalties are paid by mining operations to the Northern Territory government as owner of the mineralswith the exception of uranium, which goes to the Commonwealth-and the Commonwealth reimburses the equivalent amount from consolidated revenue into the ABA. These funds are then disbursed according to a formula to the land councils in order to provide for development and actions to benefit the owners of the land. However, the minister retains control over the ABA. A guaranteed 40 per cent is set aside to fund the adit ministration of all four Northern Territory land councils. It is worth noting that the ABA has net accumulated assets of $109.2 million, which are owned and controlled by the Commonwealth. This equity, from royalties and from Aboriginal land, is owned and controlled by the Commonwealth and cannot be accessed, leveraged or borrowed against by the land councils or the traditional owners. I understand that there are elements of the bill, particularly amendments to part IV of the act, regarding mining provisions, that have been negotiated and supported by the land councils, who believe they will provide greater workability of the act-and that is fine. But there are parts of this bill that have not been negotiated with the land councils, that have been agreed to by both the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory governments without the agreement of those who actually own the land and their representatives. The processes in this bill abuse the very rights and recognitions of every property owner in this country. This has inserted provisions that completely ignore and undermine right of control over your own land. It undermines and renders invalid control, and thus essentially the ownership of that land for substantial periods of time-in fact, for generations. The bill allows an association whose members are either traditional owners or residents of an area to apply to a land council to have powers delegated to it. But, if a land council refuses to delegate its powers or functions, the minister can override it. If there were provisions to ensure that a majority of non-owners could never override the objections of the traditional owners-who could otherwise then in effect lose any semblance of rights as an owner-this might not be so objectionable. However, such provisions are not included. The bill further provides that, once a delegation is made by a land council, it cannot be varied or revoked without the request of the delegate or the minister's approval. Further, if the land council does not agree with the delegation, the minister may completely override the council and delegate the powers or compel any variation to that delegation. This is all the more alarming when the land councils' functions and powers that under this bill can be delegated to another body include decisions about mining on Aboriginal land and leasing on Aboriginal land. Not only that, but that body can be made up of non-Aboriginal people and a majority of Aboriginal residents of the area, who need not be the owners of that land. It is easy to see that a non-Aboriginal group could easily gain control over what happens on land owned by Aboriginals. Currently the act allows for the creation of new land councils provided that a ‘substantial majority' of Aboriginal adults living in the area agree. The Commonwealth was asked by the land councils and the Northern Territory government to amend this section to ensure traditional owners would have to consent to any proposed new land council. This is also in line with the recommendation of this parliament made back in 1999. However, the government not only disagrees with this approach but introduces in this bill the principle that a single Aboriginal person who is resident in the area can apply for the establishment of a new council. Other bodies such as a council, an association or a company with a majority of Aboriginal members may also apply. But what of the traditional landowners? After all, the land is Aboriginal land only because these traditional landowners have fought the land claims to receive their rights under the title granted to that land. What happens in townships and communities where a large proportion of the Aboriginal population are not traditional owners? This is completely at odds with the whole process of being granted title to the land in the first place. Further, the whole movement over many years has been to remove smaller, less efficient services and to remove duplication and impediments to attracting the very best in professional staff. As the Australian National Audit Office pointed out, the informed decision making processes facilitated by the administrative arm of a land council includes the input of lawyers, mining experts, anthropologists and so on. A land council's strength is highly reliant on the professionalism that only the larger councils can attract. Or is the very reason for these changes in the bill-to undermine the larger and potentially far more professional and more independent land councils? Under the act a land trust could lease to the Northern Territory government or its entity the whole of a township or community. In return the entity would pay rent to the land trust of a fixed five per cent of the improved capital value. It must be asked: how do we work out the value of this land, particularly land in more remote areas? Not only this, but the peppercorn rent paid by the Northern Territory government to the land trust on behalf of the traditional owners is paid from the ABA, the Aboriginal Benefits Account. So the Northern Territory government is using the landowners' income to pay the landowners peppercorn rent, determined by its own VG, on their land, over which they lose control for 99 years! I know there are others who want to speak in this truncated debate-and it is deplorable that debate on such an important piece of legislation should be curtailed in such a manner-but I want to ask finally: what in this bill will attack the rudimentary health care problems that exist on a daily or weekly basis? How will they be fixed if the people suffering from illnesses can borrow money to buy a house for 99 years? They are asking today: ‘Where do we find the resources?' We are told there will be packages put in place. They are saying, ‘What if we can't afford to pay?' How will the sewers, the water in each house, the roads and the telephones be fixed? Someone mentioned here bakers and candlestick makers and all these businesses that are going to grow out of nowhere. If you take the trouble to read Richard Trudgen's book, Why warriors lie down and die, you will see that in a short space of seven years he saw the complete collapse of this many communities because their ability and their right to make decisions for themselves-in fact the very traineeships that were in place in some of these communities-had been taken over by imposed contracts from outside. So there are many other ways that we should be looking towards the benefit of these communities. It certainly is not in this particular act. This bill should be redrafted but, most importantly, it should honour the integrity of the existing legislation by applying the three vital factors missing in this process: communication, consultation and consent.",135
190,Mr MCMULLAN,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"I join with others in regretting the fact that the time available for all of us to speak on the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 2006 has been cut so short. I will not waste any of my limited time railing against that I will allow people to make judgments for themselves. One of the things that strikes me about this bill is that it illustrates an emerging feature of the Howard government: the Howard government hates agreement on issues that it might be able to exploit as wedge issues. This is an example, and a very sad example, because we have contained within this bill a significant amendment to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act supported by the government, the opposition, the Northern Territory government, the mining industry and the traditional owners and their representhat tatives on the land councils on matters ing to mining and exploration. It would have been a very significant tive achievement if we could have come into this parliament and made an amendment to the Native Title Act that would have been a significant plus for economic development with unanimous support in the parliament-I cannot speak for the Independents but, from the sound of their remarks, with the unanimous or at least the overwhelming support of the parliament-and with the support of the traditional owners, the mining industry and the Northern Territory government. That could have been achieved. Everybody knew it could have been achieved. It was clear and known but it was a totally unacceptable outcome to the Howard government because it was good for Indigenous people and it was good for the mining industry but there was not a vote in it. It did not split the community. There was no division from which a government could gain political advantage. Where there is agreement on areas that are potentially wedge issues, this government insists upon driving in the wedge, achieving the political purpose by winning some section of that community whose votes it might not otherwise get, even if it means that those matters which could have been dealt with by agreement and consensus are torn apart. We of course saw that illustrated with regard to the ACT civil unions legislation recently, where Laurie Oakes in last week's Bulletin blew the whistle and made it absolutely clear that the Attorney-General and probably others in the government had in place a process that probably-and in my view, looking at it from an ACT end, almost certainly-could have led to agreement. But the Prime Minister scuttled the arrangement and made sure that the detailed proposals could have led to an agreement were relatnever sent to the ACT government so the agreement could never be reached and the posiwedge could be inserted. That is why the first part of the second reading amendment about ‘welcoming the measures contained in the bill, including the mining and exploration provisions' is so important. They could have been major unifying features, bringing together all sections concerned about economic development on Aboriginal land in a very positive way, but it was not good enough. We could not have discussion, negotiation or consensus because major changes have been made to the rights of traditional owners and their representatives on the land council without discussion, without negotiation, without listening and without an attempt at reaching consensusin fact, with a deliberate attempt not to achieve consensus. No other landowners in this country would be treated this way. Let us remember that when we say ‘landowners' the people we are talking about-the traditional owners affected by the Native Title Act-are people who have won their title. It has been determined that the title to this land is theirs; yet, without even talking to them, we pass a law to change the way it can be dealt with. No other Australian would be dealt with in this way, yet the government does not even blush. It charges headlong down this path in a manner which it has been warned by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner risks breaching the principles of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 and is likely to have us in court. What will happen? The Howard government will say the people going to court are being divisive. Shock! They are holding up development! But they know that this is a deliberate attempt at creating that division and at undermining the bodies that have the capacity effectively to represent and negotiate on behalf of the traditional owners. And it is not as though that is a secret. I was the Deputy Chair of the then Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund, which reported on the operation of native title representative bodies. It reported to this parliament this year that, of all the mainland native title representative bodies, the two that were most effective were the Central Land Council and the Northern Land Council. In the words of the evidence presented by the Indigenous Land Corporation in talking about the difficulties it has dealing with bodies, they were ‘performing at the better end of the spectrum'. They are two of the three-the third being the Torres Strait Regional Authority, which is not relevant to this debate-that are the most effective and the best to deal with. So what do we do here? We say: ‘We'll undermine them. We will undermine them financially, and we will undermine them structurally. We will create that proliferation of small bodies which every bit of previous evidence has said fails.' Every bit of previous evidence says that, if you split up the big bodies, require them to delegate here and allow smaller split-off councils to be created there, it is less efficient. Everybody who has looked at it has found that, and it is not surprising; but every bit of evidence points to that. The government's own majority on this committee found that-properly, on the basis of evidence put before it. But the government ignored them and, in fact, did the exact opposite. We have letters from the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory expressing widespread concern about elements of this legislation, and the government does not respond. It just charges on, when we know it could have had agreement about mining and exploration provisions from all the major participants, including the Northern Territory government. We could have had that bill through and it could have been a very significant positive, enhancing the debate about Indigenous economic development because we can see a way on which agreement can be taken going forward. But that is much too harmonious! There is no division in that. There is no vote in that. There is no split in that. Let me come back to the point that no other landowner in Australia would be treated like this. I am here as a representative of the Australian Capital Territory, where everybody's land is leasehold land. Can you these imagine what would happen if we brought into this parliament a bill that sought to limit the capacity, the rent, which leaseholders in the ACT could have on their land? We will legislate a cap. These are people who lease Commonwealth land here in the ACT. Perhaps we should have a bill to say that there is a cap on how much return they can get. All my constituents would properly be outraged, and you would not dare do it to them. Mr Brough-It's not about the constituents.",138
191,Mr MCMULLAN,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"It is about their rights, and you are treating the traditional owners in the Northern Territory in a manner you would not dare treat any other Australian. It would not even occur to you to treat any other Australian like that. It is wrong, it is improper and it is also, sadly, very bad economics. It is ineffective. I strongly support some of the measures in this legislation. They would make a substantial economic contribution. I forgive you, Minister, because in your case it is ignorance, but in some parts of the government it is a deliberate attempt to be divisive. A week ago you knew nothing. Now you are an expert, and you have made the transition without gaining any knowledge. We have here a very significant piece of legislation. It has about 45 more seconds to be debated in this parliament, which is a great pity, but that is the way the world is a great lost opportunity to make a unifying step forward. We are going to have here a divisive step-a step that will almost certainly end up in court, that will almost certainly end up with traditional owners in dispute with the government, when we could have had a unifying set of progressive economic reforms which had economic literacy and political legitimacy. This has got neither political legitimacy nor economic literacy. It is very poor economics as well as being very divisive politics.",140
192,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"Order! In accordance with the resolution agreed to earlier today, I call the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs.",141
193,Mr BROUGH,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"Longman-Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Indigenous Affairs) (8.30 pm)-I thank the honourable members who have contributed to today's historic debate on the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 2006. This legislation will allow Aboriginal Australians in parts of the Northern Territory who have been denied rights for many years to be able to own their own home. I think it almost defies belief that in 2006 we are at a stage where many Australians simply do not have the right to own their own property where they desire to live and where, in many cases, generations have lived before them. This proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that the enforcement of collective rights over individual rights has been an abject failure. As the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Clare Martin, recently said, determination was the biggest mistake. Unlike those who sit opposite, their colleagues in the Northern Territory agree with the thrust of this legislation. The Northern Territory's Minister for Housing, Mr Elliott is. It MCAdam, who is of course of Indigenous descent, very much supports this and understands it is aboutMr Snowdon-He is an Indigenous person.",141
194,Mr BROUGH,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"An Indigenous personI stand corrected; you are right. He says it is all about choice and we agree with him. It defies belief that the opposition can think there is somehow a conspiracy and it is about denying people's rights. It is simply not about that all. As I said to the parliament earlier today, over the last two days, and last month, I met with the people of Wadeye, the people of the Tiwi Islands-Nguiu in particular-who have already signed a heads of agreement and also the people of Galiwinku. Many in those communities are excited about having for the first time the same rights as other Australians. This is something that we want to give them. It is something that we should not even be debating; it should just happen naturally. The reality is there has been nine years of debate on this issue-nine long years of talking to people. It is important that those who sit opposite recognise that this is not the end of the consultation. I say to the member for CanberraMr MCMullan-Fraser.",141
195,Mr BROUGH,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"Sorry-the member for Fraser. I say to him: this is not the end of the consultation. No-one is being forced to do this. What will happen from here is that those communities that wish to participate will have the right to do so and they will then negotiate. Mr MCMullan interjectingself- Mr BROUGH-The member for Fraser raises the issue of services. You know what we asked them to do? We asked the Territory Labor government to provide Indigenous people with the most basic things that they deserve: decent policing, decent education and decent health. I am negotiating on behalf of those Territorian Aboriginal people who have been denied that right by the people who sit opposite-that is an absolute disgrace-and I will continue to do that. We have a couple of amendments that we will move today. I will table amendments that provide an option for the Commonwealth entity to hold township leases and other minor amendments together with a supplementary explanatory memorandum and a minor correction to the explanatory memorandum. I have listened to the people whom I spoke with at the Northern Land Council in the last couple of days. On the five per cent cap, I inform the House that it is my intention to move a further amendment in the Senate when this is finally debated removing that five per cent. So far be it from me not to listen. We do listen to people. The reality is that that was set upon because it was a realistic rental agreement that most real estate proprietors would expect as a return on their properties. We and the Northern Territory government will negotiate fair and equitable returns with people in return for their 99-year leases. Then there will of course be a negotiation between the leaseholder of the head lease and the people who want to own their property, in the same way as currently occurs in the electorate of the member for Fraser here in the ACT-because that is the only way that people can have property rights. It will be treated identically. I think that is what Andrews, K.J. people have to understand. It has been nine long years. We now have the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, a member of the Labor Party, the housing minister of the Northern Territory, a member of the Labor Party, and the Indigenous President of the Labor Party, all agreeing that this is right. I simply askMr Snowdon-He doesn't come from the Northern Territory. He knows nothing about this stuff.",141
196,Mr BROUGH,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"We now hear the member for Lingiari saying that his party president does not come from the Northern Territory and does not know anything about this. You know what he knows about? He knows about the rights of his people. He wants them to have the same choices that you and I have and so do I. I think it is an awfully sad day when a man who represents much of the Northern Territory does not believe that the Indigenous people there have the same rights that he and I have. I feel that is a disgrace. It is a sorry day for the Labor Party and a sorry day for the member for Lingiari but a positive day in that this bill will pass and that Australian Aboriginal people will finally have the same rights, which they so richly deserve, that other Australians take for granted.

Bill read a third time. NA COLLEGES (FLEXIBILITY IN ACHIEVING AUSTRALIA'S SKILLS NEEDS) AMENDMENT BILL 2006 Second Reading Debate resumed from 15 June, on motion by Mr Hardgrave: That this bill be now read a second time. upon which Ms Macklin moved by way of amendment: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for: (1) creating a skills crisis during their ten long years in office; (2) its continued failure to provide the necessary opportunities for Australians to get the training they need to get a decent job and meet the skills needs of the economy; (3) reducing the overall percentage of the Federal Budget spent on vocational education and training, and allowing this percentage of spending to further decline over the forward estimate period; (4) its incompetent handling of the Australian Technical Colleges initiative as evidenced by only four out of twenty-five colleges being open for business, enrolling fewer than 300 students, (5) failing to be open and accountable about the operations of the Australian Technical Colleges, including details of extra student enrolments, funding levels for the individual colleges, course structures and programs. (6) denying local communities their promised Australian Technical College because of their ideological industrial relations requirements; and (7) failing to provide enough extra skills training so that Australia can meet the expected shortfall of 100,000 skilled workers by 2010”.",144
198,Ms BIRD,AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL,"I am pleased to be able to speak to this amendment. When the original bill was put before the House I was gagged from speaking on it, and the clock is probably going to get me fairly quickly tonight as well. The Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia's Skills Amendment Bill 2006 is intended to reallocate funding from the 2008-09 financial year to the 2006-07 financial year and to insert a new provision in the current act to enable the minister to redistribute program funds between particular years by regulation instead of by legislative amendment. I take the opportunity to make a few observations and also to support the amendment moved by the shadow minister for education when she spoke to the bill. The federal government announced as part of its election commitments in 2004 the establishment of Australian technical colleges throughout Australia. When I heard the announcement at that time, having a background in the TAFE sector I was a bit bemused by how the proposal would operate and what it intended to address. I understand that the government and the minister have indicated that it is to be part of the proposal to address the skills shortages. I put on the record, having been a coordinator of joint schools TAFE and Australian traineeship schemes at TAFE, that I am a great supporter of providing pathways for young people, particularly in years 11 and 12 but also potentially in years 9 and 10, to be able to study vocational courses. Debate interrupted. NA",148
199,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 9 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. New Technologies",148
200,Mr BOWEN,ADJOURNMENT,"I want to make a contribution tonight to the national debate on nuclear energy. The Prime Minister appointed a nuclear power task force in a cynical attempt to divert the negative attention he was receiving for his last overseas trip and in the hope that the Labor Party would split on the issue. The Labor Needs) Party has not split on this issue. We are against nuclear energy in Australia. The government has claimed that nuclear energy is necessary in Australia because it is clean power and makes no, or very little, contribution to greenhouse gases. On the other hand, it claims that coal is a source of dirty energy that contributes massively to the greenhouse effect. In this debate the government has completely ignored two new technologies in which Australia is making a significant contribution. The first I would like to talk about tonight is geosequestration. Geosequestration involves capturing carbon dioxide during the power generation process and storing it under the ground. Carbon capture and storage projects are already occurring throughout the world. In Sleipner in Norway carbon has been stored since 1996 to reduce the amount of carbon tax paid by a commercial scale gas exploration and processing project. At Weyburn in Canada two million tonnes of carbon dioxide have been stored each year since 1996. In addition, a zero emission power plant is under construction near Berlin which will be ready by 2006 where carbon dioxide will be injected into nearby coal seams. There are also significant projects in Poland, France and Algeria. In Australia, the Cooperative Research Centre for Greenhouse Gas Technologies, the CO²CRC, and the CSIRO are doing very good work. I would like to pay particular tribute to the work of Dr Peter Cook. I have met him and I think he is a great Australian making a significant contribution to this very important field of scientific endeavour. Sixty-six sites have been identified around Australia as potentially suitable for carbon storage. Because coal has been mined so extensively in Australia, we have lots of emptied coal seams which lend themselves to the potential of storing carbon dioxide. The CO²CRC is researching a site in Otway, Victoria, which is expected to result in the injecand tion of carbon dioxide into the ground by 2007. This is the most comprehensive geosequestration project in the world. It will be first project to actually monitor carbon dioxide before, during and after its injection into the ground. This is in addition to the Monash geosequestration project with Shell, which has a target date of 2015, and the Gorgan project in Western Australia which is aiming to reinject carbon dioxide from gas production into the ground by 2010. It is true that geosequestration technology is not currently financially viable in Australia, but there are plenty of examples of its being viable throughout the world. The consensus is that storage technology may be viable in Australia in three or four years time, and capture technology from coal fired power stations may take 10 years to fully develop and be commercially viable. The other technology is hot dry rock geothermal technology, which captures the heat of granites located three kilometres or more under the ground. The heat is extracted from them by circulating water through them in an artificial reservoir. Researchers at the ANU have been looking at hot rock technology for over 10 years, and some of the researchers have founded Geodynamics Ltd, which is currently commercially developing the process in the Cooper Basin in South Australia. I am advised that it is possible that geothermal technology may be commercially viable in Australia in the next few years. If the government were serious about dealing with the energy needs of our nation while dealing with and reducing our contribution to greenhouse gases, it would be putting technologies like geosequestration and geothermal technology onto the national agenda. These technologies have the potential to substantially reduce our greenhouse gases with none of the risks that go with nuclear power. When you compare the costs the viability of these two technologies to the costs and the ramp-up time of nuclear energy, these two technologies certainly the should not be ruled out as being viable options for Australia's energy needs into the future. They should certainly be involved in any national debate about the future of Australia's energy needs. They should certainly be the subject of federal government studies, just as much as nuclear power. (Time expired) Memorials",148
201,Mr FAWCETT,ADJOURNMENT,"Wakefield) (9.05 pm)One of the privileges of being an Australian is the way our communities remember those who have served and have sacrificed their lives-often the best part of their lives-for their country. One of the great pleasures I had as a young subaltern in the 1st Aviation Regiment was ANZAC Day, when we got to go out to the smaller country towns in south-east Queensland to lead the march and to speak and mix with the veterans. The common point was always the memorial which was in town. As you look around Australia, and particularly as I look around South Australia, you notice that there are memorials in all kinds of places. Many of these memorials capture the fact that often from one community there were many brothers or cousins from the one family, or sometimes a father and his sons, who gave their lives. The impact on those communities was large. Often we do not realise with the passing of time how some of these memorials decay or fade or, in some cases, are even removed and a part of our history is lost. I wish to tribute to Will and Jacqui Clough, who are members of the Riverton RSL in the electorate of Wakefield. After seeing that there were many memorials throughout the state which people had forgotten even existed, were never visited or were not maintained, they realised that an important role could be served by recording where these memorials were and who was on the memorial so that in years to come people who were researching family or military history would have an accurate record of these tributes to people who over the years had served their country. What they initially thought might take a matter of months or, perhaps at a stretch, even a year stretched into a three-year journey for them as they travelled literally tens of thousands of kilometres around South Australia to record some 1,000 memorials with over 3,000 photographs that detailed people from South Australia who served our nation. Jocelyn Talmage, a historical research analyst, worked with them crosschecking and making sure that there were accurate records which identified who the people were, where they enlisted and some of their service history. Having got this information, the question is: what do you do with it? If you record it on paper or in photographs, it like many other things will be forgotten or put away in some dusty place. After some consideration and discussion with the RSL's South Australian branch, Will and Jacqui decided that the best possible repository for this would be the internet so that people around South Australia, as well as people around Australia and around the world, could access this information and learn about those who have served their nation. So, with the support of the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia, the Royal Australian Air Force Association, the Royal Australian Naval Veterans Associapay tion, the Vietnam Veterans Federation and the Department of Veterans' Affairs, and with a grant from the Australian government, they were able to work with the RSL's South Australian branch to create a website with a local provider and put this information on the internet in an extremely professional manner, such that whether you are interested in a locality or a particular person you can research and find out who from South Australia has served. This excellent website is at www.tributesofhonour.info. It is an excellent addition to the military history and the history of the communities of South Australia. I believe that Will and Jacqui and those who have worked with them to gather and provide this information deserve to be recognised and congratulated for the significant effort that they have gone to and the contribution that they have made to the history of Australia in recognising those who have served. Unlawful Detention",149
202,Mr GEORGANAS,ADJOURNMENT,"I think many, if not most, of us living here in Australia would consider ourselves lucky either to have been born here or to have come and built a new life within Australia. This nation of ours is one whose citizens expect to be free, safe and peaceful. Australia has those elements that allow a person to feel secure and that they will not be targeted for unusual treatment, penalties or restrictions on one's life. Freedom is one of our defining Australian characteristics. It is what makes this place Australia and it is what our Diggers went to war and died for. Naturally, anything that undermines this freedom is an acute worry. We have heard over time of problems within the immigration system, problems that led to bizarre situations such as those resulting in the outrageous injustice inflicted on Cornelia Rau, Ms Alvarez and others. These really were breathtaking revelations. They were then, and they have not lost their punch. As such, interest in the treatment of these individuals within the community has increased, the system that caused their circumstances to fall away to such a lowly, degraded and miserable level and the political backing of the system that resulted in such offences. In support of my concerns and those of many electors within Hindmarsh, I put a question to the responsible minister last year-in fact on 1 November, to be precise-concerning wrongful detention within immigration facilities: How many incidents of wrongful immigration detention of persons legally in Australia is the Government aware? You would think that such matters would be monitored very closely by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs or the Attorney-General, but it took seven whole months for a response to be given. On 31 May 2006 I received an answer to my question. The answer, in part, is as follows: Of the 220 cases bearing the descriptor “released not unlawful”, the department has identified 26 cases involving Australian citizens. The Attorney-General also wrote that the Reconnecting People Assistance Package: ... provides for ex gratia assistance to Australian citizens and permanent residents who may have been “adversely affected by inappropriate detention”. So we have 220 cases described as ‘released not unlawful', 26 of those 220 cases being Australian citizens being detained, and the government simply tells them that they can make some sort of claim through this assistance package. The media took an interest of course but, from what I read and heard, were unsuccessful in their attempts to get a comment or quote from the minister. So I put a follow-up question on the Notice Paper last week: ... regarding the 220 persons categorised as “released not unlawful” and released from detention, how many were (a) suspected of suffering from a mental illness, (b) assessed for mental illness, (c) diagnosed as having a mental illness, and (d) detained after the release of the Palmer Report. I know from experience that I cannot realistically expect those responsible for providing an answer to want to reply this calendar year-as previously demonstrated by the last questions I put on notice-and maybe some time in the year 2007 I will get an answer. That would be most regrettable, but history shows that answers to such questions are not a priority of this government. So I also put questions to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. I asked whether the parliamentary secretary could give us a detailed report on any internal investigation the government has conducted after finding out that there were 220 cases bearing the description ‘released not unlawful'. If you want to put it another way, that description means that people were detained unlawfully. I wanted to know how the 26 Australian citizens detained under our immigration laws had come to be so detained-and we are talking about Australian citizens like all of us in this chamber. I am sure the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs has been asked these questions by the government-and if not, why not? These are the questions that have to be asked and answered. I am sure that the minister has received answers as to how the heck a government department responsible for immigration can go around locking up Australian citizens. I am also sure the minister has received numerous briefings as to how the department, the minister and the government can prevent the recurrence of such events which have caused this government a whole lot of trouble. We need to know what is being done to make sure this serial abuse of people-of Australian citizens like all of us in this chamber-does not continue to happen. I look forward to a reply to this question. I pray that it will be made available before the next election. (Time expired) Hasluck Electorate",150
203,Mr HENRY,ADJOURNMENT,"It has come to my attention that the Leader of the Opposition, in the company of Senator Sterle, made a lightning visit to my electorate of Hasluck a couple of weeks ago for a tea party. He regaled a group of nearly 25 local residents in High Wycombe with some of the most fanciful stories any of them had probably ever heard. Topics listed for discussion included the employment prospects of kids, working conditions, plus a secret plan for a nuclear plant in Hasluck. He told the local folk that the Howard government has a secret plan to put a nuclear power plant at or near the Perth airport in Hasluck. It is outrageous to think that the Leader of the Opposition can make up such unbelievable stories, indulging in blatant scaremongering, when he knows that there is no plan to put a nuclear power plant at the Perth airport. He referenced a 1997 report to cabinet, which referred to potential sites for research reactor that has since been colocated at the Lucas Heights facility outside of Sydney. He then went on to say how disadvantaged they and their kids would be under Work Choices and the government's AWAs. The Leader of the Opposition refused to do the hard work to develop policies that would keep Australia growing, lock in prosperity and ensure jobs and wages continued to grow. Instead, Labor continue to take the lazy way out by using distortions, stunts and scaremongering in place of hard work. That brings me to the Leader of the Opposition's plans for workplace relations-a back to the future scenario. Under Labor, there will be no AWAs and no worker will be worse off. Let us consider Mr Beazley's record. As Minister for Employment, Education and Training from 1991-93, unemployment peaked at 10.9 per cent in December 1992. Teenage unemployment was 34.5 per cent-an absolute disgrace. His performance as minister in this area was absolutely appalling. Between 1991-93, the number of people in apprenticeships in traditional trades fell from 151,000 to 122,600-a decline of 23 per cent. Can we trust Mr Beazley to ensure employment and apprenticeships for our kids? Surely his record speaks for itself. Under the Howard government there are now 391,200 young people in apprenticeships. The truth is that the Labor Party record on youth unemployment and vocational education and training is a damning indictment of their commitment to the future of young people in this country. Under this government, the real wages of Australian workers have increased by 16.8 per cent compared to only 1.2 per cent in 13 years under the Labor government and when Beazley was minister for employment. In 1995-1996, the Labor government a spent just $984 million on skills training in Australia. This financial year, the Howard government has spent over $2.5 billion dollars on training. Included in this is the funding for the Australian technical colleges, which will provide skills training and vocational and technical education to young people. It is a shame that Mr Beazley did not support the City of Rockingham's bid for an ATC. Although, thankfully, Phil Edman, the Liberal candidate for Mr Beazley's seat of Brand, has lobbied hard to secure a satellite campus status for Rockingham with the Perth South ATC. I see that Mr Beazley's Labor colleague in Western Australia, Premier Alan Carpenter, wants to prevent businesses who use AWAs from being awarded state government contracts. Carpenter wants to risk the prosperity of our state by discriminating in the most unjust way against the same employers who are fuelling our booming WA economy. Lets look at AWAs in WA in three key industry sectors: in accommodation, cafes and restaurants, 49.4 per cent are on AWAs; in retail, 23.6 per cent; and in mining, 43.1 per cent. wonder how all those mining industry personnel who live around High Wycombe feel about his proposal to knock off AWAs. The Howard government is working to secure the future prosperity of not just young people but all Australians. I am proud to be part of the government, and I am confident people will be much better off under Work Choices and AWAs. Mr Beazley indicated that industrial relations was a ‘blood fight'. He would contest out of principle and says that the Labor Party should be standing beside our trade union colleagues, as opposed to the working men and women of Australia.",152
204,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,I remind the honourable member for Hasluck that he should refer to members by their title or their seat. Mr David Hicks,153
205,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Tonight I speak about the continued treatment of David Hicks. In recent weeks, there has been greater criticism of US policy on Guantanamo Bay, with conservative European leaders such as Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen and Germany's Angela Merkel, a far more pro-US leader than her predecessor, speaking out against it. Lord Goldsmith, the Attorney-General of the United Kingdom, has said that the continued existence of Guantanamo Bay is undermining US credibility internationally. This elaborates on comments made by Tony Blair in February this year that Guantanamo Bay is ‘an anomaly' that sooner or later has to be dealt with. The more recent focus on Hicks has occurred following the suicide of three detainees last week. It is disheartening to read the comments of the camp's commander, RearAdmiral Harry Harris, who said of those deaths: They have no regard for life, neither ours nor their own. I believe this was not an act of desI peration, but an act of asymmetrical warfare waged against us. This was in contrast to those of US President Bush, who said that there was ‘serious concern'. The situation is such that one could well understand the desperation of these a people. David Hicks is one of 460 prisoners who have not been brought to trial. He has spent 244 days in isolation. Even now his lone contact is with the military chaplain. Recently the Guardian Weekly wrote of the situation: In one sense the three deaths change nothing: international law and opinion have already condemned Guantanamo Bay as a disgrace to a country that claims to fight its battles on behalf of freedom. In practical terms the policy of extracting suspects from around the world and holding them indefinitely without legal process has been established as a shameful failure: most of the prisoners have had minimal or no connection to terror and the US's claim to hold an al-Qaida hardcore has never been tested in court. Australia has observed Britain's success in gaining the release of its nationals. Even France, which has been so critical of US policy in Iraq, in February 2004 succeeded in gaining the release of its last national. Australia's David Hicks remains incarcerated and, as I said, he has still not faced trial. His military lawyer spoke recently of his desperation and extreme pessimism. On Lateline last week, Professor Alfred MCCoy made other broad comments of practices of the CIA in Guantanamo Bay. It is interesting to note where these criticisms are coming from. The International Red Cross, a body that I do not think we would be too critical of, has said that there is torture per se. There is no qualification, no ‘tantamount to torture' phraseology-‘torture is being practised there'. The FBI has also been highly critical of practices there. In an investigation of Guantanamo detainees, it described them as ‘huddling, quivering and with signs of extreme psychological stress'. The FBI also noted that the degree of torture in Guantanamo Bay is such that evidence gained is often unreliable because of the sheer desperation of those who seek release. Australia's inability to take on the United States over the detaining of its citizen is, say, in contrast to the actions of many Western nations. It is also in contrast to the experience of US national John Walker Lindt, who obviously had far greater contact, far greater involvement and a far greater knowledge of terrorist operations. Because of the sheer reality that he is an American, he has not been held there for four years. As I say, there is mounting international criticism of the situation there. A country which stands over Romania and other eastern European countries to avoid international justice being dispatched to American citizens itself seeks to go above the rest of the world in maintaining this place of incarceration and torture. As we all know, two British High Court judges ruled last month that there was a powerful case for the closure of Guantanamo Bay. International criticism is mounting. But in the last week we have even seen an inability of Australia to urge the United States to give access to British diplomats so that an oath can be taken. Australia will not act on it, but they are now also getting in the way of Britain formalising the rights of David Hicks. Bass Electorate: Sporting identities Mr Rod Beaumont",153
206,Mr MICHAEL FERGUSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to bring to the attention of the House the numerous sporting achievements of my constituents in Bass in Northern Tasmania of whom I am very proud. Sport, like other pursuits, plays an integral part in the lives of many in my electorate, and tonight I would like to take this opportunity to officially recognise some of our finest sporting men and women, both amateur and professional. While obviously home to Ponting and Boon, we are also proud to call Hollie Grima, Brad Green and Matthew Goss our as I own, to name a few. Yet Northern Tasmania is also the playing ground of thousands of others who enjoy the good health, friendship and lifestyle associated with sport. This year I had the pleasure of visiting numerous sporting clubs and associations around the north and north-east of the great state of Tasmania. I look forward to attending AFL games at York Park, interstate cricket at the NTCA and the Launceston Tornadoes Basketball team. I also look forward to utilising my membership of the mighty Launceston Blues Football Club, attending events hosted by local golf clubs and participating in charity basketball games, among many others. However, some of the best occasions that I have witnessed have actually been the end of season celebrations. This year I was proud to present my inaugural award: a trophy featuring, very appropriately, I think, a red kookaburra cricket ball, signed by the Prime Minister-a great cricket tragic-to a number of cricket clubs in Bass. I wanted the award to recognise those who contribute heavily to their club. I would like to congratulate once more Dean Gibbons of the George Town Cricket Club, Elizabeth MCKinnon of the Launceston Cricket Club, Michael Claxton of the Westbury Cricket Club, John Mann of Mowbray Cricket Club and Judy Burgess of the Riverside Cricket Club. Tonight I would also like to acknowledge a well-known local identity Mr Jack Hinds, a highly respected umpire in Tasmanian cricket circles with the Tasmanian cricket league, with many years of dedicated service. All of these people are the lifeblood of their individual clubs and associations and very worthy winners indeed. I plan to expand the presentation of this award in the future to other sporting clubs and community groups. I turn the attention of the House to another winner in the eyes of the Northern Tasmanian public: well-known businessman, sports lover and thespian Mr Rod Beaumont, who, unfortunately, passed away on 5 June this year. Rod Beaumont was a great family man who cared deeply for those around him. He was a big fellow with a large, generous heart and, to quote his wife, Jenny, ‘His eyes were kind.' To anybody who met him, he was a very positive man with a wonderful sense of humour. He was also the driving force behind his well-known local company, Jenerick, an icon of Northern Tasmanian business. To his everlasting credit, Rod Beaumont was involved in many aspects of community life in Bass. He was President of Launceston Jaycees; President of Launceston Players, and later a life member; President and patron of Launceston Rugby Club, where I will never forget as an aspiring politician and Liberal candidate, he bought me a beer one Saturday afternoon; an inaugural member of the Lions Club Launceston North; and, an inaugural member of Cityprom and later its president. He was also a candidate for local government, standing for the Launceston City Council, and a member of the well-renowned Beefsteak and Burgundy Club. Rod was also very much committed to the Liberal Party. During his formative years he vied for a number of various positions within the party and eventually was rewarded with the state presidency of the Tasmanian Young Liberals and, indeed, even preselection to stand for the House of Assembly seat of Bass. He was also made a life member of the Liberal Party of Australia Tasmania Division for his significant contributions. I am told he very much admired former Prime Minister, John Gorton, and was taken with a quote from his book: ‘He bucked the saddle of convention and conformity,' and he saw himself in the same light. Rod was an incredibly talented, visionary and friendly big-hearted fellow and he will be missed by many. I am sure that all members present would wish his adoring wife, Jenny, and his twins, Charles and Bridget, all the best during this difficult time. For those who love this family, we join with them and try to understand. But for now, our thoughts and prayers are with you. Rod always thought that Northern Tasmania was the best place on the planet and, of course, I completely agree with him. I thank the House. (Time expired) Question agreed to. House adjourned at 9.29 pm NA The following notices were given: Ms King to move: That this House: (1) acknowledges that the Millennium Development Goals are an important part of the global fight against poverty; (2) acknowledges that the Millennium Development Goals require Australia to make an increased contribution to the eradication of poverty, particularly in our region, which consistently ranks among the poorest in the world across the measures used by the Millennium Development Goals; and (3) notes: (a) Australia has committed to increasing its foreign aid budget to being 0.7% of GNI in 2015 in line with the UN Millennium Development Goals; (b) the Government will need to increase foreign aid allocated to future budgets in order to achieve the target 0.7% of GNI by 2015;and (c) debt relief for developing nations provides opportunities that are beneficial for the global community in allowing debt repayment funds to be re-allocated towards infrastructure development, food, health care and education funding. (Notice given 19 June 2006.) Mr Beazley to move: That this House: (1) notes that the Prime Minister has not made any contribution to the 20 Matters of Public Importance and Censure debates on the subject of industrial relations moved in the House of Representatives since October 2005; (2) notes that the Catholic Archbishop of Sydney, Cardinal Pell, has expressed dislike for the Howard Government's extreme industrial relations laws because they could be used to force down minimum wages; (3) notes that Cardinal Pell has described public debates such as the one on the Howard Government's extreme industrial relations laws proposed by the Leader of the Opposition as always, always useful; and (4) calls on the Prime Minister to agree to a full and open public debate on the impact of his extreme industrial relations laws on the lives of working men and women and their families. (Notice given 19 June 2006.) Mr Abbott to move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended to enable the following to occur during the periods set aside in standing order 34 for government business on Tuesday 20 June 2006: (1) in relation to proceedings on the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2006 at the conclusion of the second reading debate, not including a Minister speaking in reply, or at 6pm, whichever is the earlier, a Minister to be called to sum up (for a period not exceeding 5 minutes) the second reading debate and thereafter, without delay, the immediate question before the House to be put, then any question or questions necessary to complete the remaining stages of the Bill to be put without amendment or debate and any Government amendments that have been circulated for at least two hours shall be treated as if they have been moved together; and (2) in relation to proceedings on the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Subscription Television Drama and Community Broadcasting Licences) Bill 2006 at the conclusion of second reading debate, not including a Minister speaking in reply, or at 8.30pm, whichever is the earlier, a Minister to be called to sum up (for a period not exceeding 5 minutes) the second reading debate and thereafter, without delay, the immediate question before the House to be put, then any question or questions necessary to complete the remaining stages of the Bill to be put without amendment or debate; and (3) any variation to this arrangement to be made only by a motion moved by a Minister.",154
