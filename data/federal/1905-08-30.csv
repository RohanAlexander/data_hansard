Sir LANGDON BONYTHON presented section five petitions from certain residents of South Australia, praying that stringent legislation be enacted to prohibit the importation arid sale of opium for smoking purposes within the Commonwealth. Mr HUTCHISON presented seven similar petitions from residents of South Australia. _ Mr Glynn presented four similar petitions from residents of South Australia. Petitions received.",12
1,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"Referring to the point of order taken by the honourable member for Kennedy yesterday, in regard to a petition presented by the honourable and learned member for Wannon, I should like to know, Mr S_peaker, if you have yet arrived at a decision in the matter-?",12
2,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I said that I would look through the petition, and if I found that it was one which should riot have been received, would report the fact to the House. I have looked through it, but as I did not come to the conclusion, that it should not have been received, I have no report to make. CONDUC T OF BUSINESS.",12
3,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister a question in regard to the following paragraph, which has appeared in the Melbourne Age: The Federal. Labour Party is prepared to support the Prime Minister in anv measures he may see fit to take to secure speedier progress with legislation in the House of Representatives. If the Opposition resents the application of the new 11.30 p.m. closing time rule;, members of the party are willing to assist the Government by providing relays to form a quorum during any all night sittings which may become necessary. Labour members f reely say that Mr Deakin must be prepared to fight the organized obstruction of the Opposition without mercy for the rest of the session if he is to see legislation now ih suspense passed into lawThe policy of "" graceful concession "" must be frankly abandoned when dealing with the Cooks, Wilks, or Sydney Smiths. Is there any - foundation for the statement that the Prime Minister has made, oris making, such ah arrangement with' that section of his supporter's, known as the Labour Party, who are acting as galley siaves to this Government, and who are so desirous of repressing the right of criticism and the free discussion of political iheasurcs ?",12
4,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"On behalf of the House, I take exception to the phrase which the honourable member has applied to a of it, which is indefensible in - regard to any party. The paragraph referred to was published without my knowledge, and the statement it contains is news. The honourable member for Corangamite has publicly alluded to possibilities of the same kind, but' I do not attribute it to him. So far from desiring to take advantage of any arrangement to suppress criticism, I agreed 1 with the honourable member for Dalley last evening that at 10.4-5 p.m. I would accede to the request of a member of the Opposition, whom he named, that'progress should be reported. I was, therefore, surprised when the honourable member for Darwin rose to speak, but when he informed methat he could not conclude, his speech before 1.1.30 p.m., felt that I could not refuse to him a courtesy which had already been promised to a member of the Opposition.",12
5,Mr WILSON,Unknown,"The suggestion that I have given to the Age the information on which the paragraph referred to is based is without foundation. That journal is not in the habit of coming to me for information, nor would it be likely to publish any information that I might give to it. The remarks which I made recently outside were made on my own responsibility, and without consultation with any member on this side of the Chamber. I was not present on Friday last, when the Prime Minister made an announcement as to the future conduct of business, but I read in the press that he had said that he intended to force members to sit late, and I replied that, if that was to be done, I would be prepared to meet force with force.",12
6,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"If an understanding has been arrived at between the Prime Minister and the honourable member for Dalley, that a member of the Opposition should open the discussion on the Budget this afternoon, I am ready to give way.",13
7,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,The understanding was only in regard tb the hour of adjournment last night. IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION ACT .,13
8,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown,"Referring to the answer given by the Prime Minister yesterday that "" exemption certificates are not generally used in connection with British subjects,"" I would like him to state what steps must be taken, either in Australia or in Great Bri tain, by an employer who wishes to bring here labour under contract, or by an employee who wishes to come here under contract? Where must such steps be taken?",13
9,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"It was intimated, when the first case in connection with the Act arose, that the proper course to follow in such instances would be to send the terms of the proposed contract to the Government, while the proper Department to address, either within Australia or from beyond the Commonwealth, would be the Department of External Affairs.",13
10,Mr WILSON,Unknown,"I learn from a paragraph in one of this morning's newspapers that it is the intention of the authorities of the Church' of England in South Australia to import a Bishop from England. should like to know, for the information of the public, what proceedings must be taken by them to provide for his introduction? "" Mr CONROY - In view of the importance of this subject, I ask the Prime Minister if he is prepared to amend the Act, so as to make it clear that passports are not required by British subjects coming here, and that its provisions apply only to men coming out under contract to fill the places' of others on strike.",13
11,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Wheneve r the amendment of this or any other Act is intended, it will be a matter of Ministerial policy which will be duly communicated to the' House. RUSSO - JAPANE SE WAR .",13
12,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"Seeing the importance to us as a Pacific Power of the war in the East, I ask the Prime Minister if he is able to announce to the House the receipt of any' official communication in regard to the declaration of peace between Japan and Russia, which is alleged to have been concluded?",13
13,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"There is no official information. If there were, it would have been my duty to convey it to the House. I am informed, however, that the assertion is made by the cable correspondents who serve almost the whole of the Australian press that peace has been officially declared. If that intelligence be true, and there is good reason to believe that, it is, no more welcome news has reached this Commonwealth for many months past. The cessation of this sanguinary and costly war will be hailed with the greatest satisfaction by peoples all round the world, and nowhere will the restoration of friendly relations in the East, and the developments which we trust will follow the declaration of peace, be more hopefully hailed than in the Commonwealth. NA LIGHT - HOUSE S. Mr HUTCHIS d N - Have the Government considered the advisability of taking under the Constitution powers in regard to the control of quarantine, light-houses, &c. ? If so, do they propose to do this at an early date?",13
14,Mr DEAKIN,QUARANTINE AND,"The matter is under consideration, and, if time will permit, will probably be submitted this session. I NA HARVESTERS.",13
15,Mr ROBINSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"the Minister of Trade and Customs, upon notice Whether he will inform the House how many ""Stripper Harvesters"" of Australian origin have been exported from ist July, 1904, to ist August, 1905, and to what places?",13
16,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"In reply to the honourable and learned member I have to state: Number exported (1905), 252. DestinationArgentine, Algeria, Cape Colony, Italy, Tunis. Prior to ist January, 1905, no separate record was kept of the imports and exports of stripper harvesters as distinct from agricultural implements, therefore no particulars can be given for the year 1904. NEW SHORT SERVIC ERIFLES .",14
17,Mr CROUCH,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"the Minister representing the Minister of Defence, upon notice I. In the new short service rifles issued to the Light Horse, is it true that these have no "" cut off "" to the magazines ? 2. Is it safe to issue rifles under such conditions? 3. Were these rifles sent in this condition by the British War Office; and is it further true that no bayonets have been supplied with these rifles? ' 4. What action does the Minister of Defence propose to take under the circumstances?",14
18,Mr EWING,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I have been supplied with the following answers: 1. Yes. The Department in this are following the lead of the War Office. In the Imperial service the "" cut off "" is only provided for the short rifle for use by the Naval Force. 2. The ""cut off "" is provided so as to temporarily convert the magazine rifle into a "" single loader,"" and not for purposes of safety. 3. (a) Yes; the rifles were sent out from the War Office without "" cut offs."" (i) No bayonets were ordered as it is proposed to make use of our large stock of triangular bayonets by having them locally converted into a "" r a p i e r "" bayonet. Designs are now under consideration. 4. It is proposed, for the present, to follow Imperial practice. HORSHAM - WARRACKNABE AL TELEPHONE.",14
19,Mr ROBINSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"the Postmaster General, upon noticer. Whether he is aware that telephonic communication between Horsham and Warracknabeal was authorized some considerable time ago? 2. When is such communication likely to be established ?",14
20,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. Yes. 2. Communication by the condensor system was established on the 8th of July last, and reported to be satisfactory. Since then some difficulty, has arisen, and it has been reported that conversations are not now practicable. The matter is receiving attention. DEPORTATI ON OF KANAKAS . Mr R. EDWARD S asked the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Whether his attention has been directed to a judgment recently delivered in Canada by Mr . Justice Anglin to the e'ffect that no British Colony could exercise extra-territorial rights with regard to the expatriation of aliens without direct authority from the Imperial Parliament? 2. Will the Prime Minister take steps to' ascertain if this is a correct inference to be drawn from Mr Justice Anglin's judgment? 3. In case that it is so, would the Commonwealth legislation respecting the deportation of Kanakas be indirectly influenced ?",14
21,Mr DEAKIN,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. There are newspaper references to a judgment by Mr Justice Anglin, who is a Judge of a Provincial Court, but no report of the judgment has yet been received, and I therefore cannot say what its effect is. 2. The authorized report will probably be received in due course. 3. In any case, the differences betwen the Constitution of the Dominion and that of the Commonwealth are so great that it. does not follow that the Canadian decision would apply hereBUDGET. In Committee of Supply (Consideration resumed from 29th August, vide page 1625), on motion by Sir JOHN FORRESTThat the item, "" President, ,£1,100,"" be agreed to.",14
22,Mr KING OMALLEY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN," I am sorry that there should have been any misunderstanding with regard to my action in requesting an adjournment of the debate the last night. I can assure honourable members that I did not speak to any one on the subject, except the honourable member for Dalley, to whom I intimated that I should like to speak today, if an opportunity presented itself. I did not consult the Prime Minister, or ask him to afford me any advantage over other honourable members. I take my chance just the same as any one else, and I hope I shall never ask for any privilege that I am not prepared to extend to others. I desire to congratulate the Treasurer on the manner in which he presented his first Budget. We have been accustomed to have the Budget presented by the right honourable member for Balaclava, who is regarded as a Treasurer quite out of the ordinary. Therefore, it is a great mistake to compare the Budget of any other Treasurer with those to which we have become accustomed. The right honourable member for Balaclava has been in the habit of presenting to us our financial affairs in wonderful detail, as well as in the aggregate, whilst the Treasurer has upon this occasion given us great aggregation. I like a man who sees hope in everything, and I detest those who look to the past, and worry themselves about what happened a thousand years ago. I am glad that the Treasurer has given a word of cheer to the whole financial world as to the position and'prospects of Australia. The right honourable gentleman laid great stress upon the necessity for bringing more population into Australia. I would ask, however, whether it is desirable that we should have in this great country hopeless, starving, miserable millions, such as are today almost a curse to Europe and America. This is one of the great questions of the age. Before we bring'more people from the older countries of the world to Australia, we should amend our land legislation. When there are fifteen or twenty people waiting to utilize one property, the' property-holders exercise too much power. If, upon a small island, with a population of 10,000 or 15,000, the whole of the land were owned by two or three men, the land-holders would own the people just as completely as the slaveowners owned the niggers on the plantations before the great civil war of the United States. Coghlan, at page 1,017, says: It will be seen that the unemployed comprise a considerable section of the community. No information is available regarding the number in Queensland, but in the other five States of the Commonwealth there were 50,644 persons-42,88 a males, and 7,762 females, who had been unemployed for a week or more at the date of the Census. These figures represent 3""6 per cent, of the total number of workers, and are but little in excess of those for the same Colonies in 1891, when the total was 50,319, consisting of 43,497 males, and 6,822 females, the proportion of the total number of workers being 4*3 per cent. though the number of the unemployed in X091, as stated above, was 50,644, it must not be sidered that all these persons were without employment, as a fairly large proportion of them consisted of workers temporarily incapacitated through sickness or accident. Should not our politicians see that the 50,000 people out of employment are provided for before we bring any more people here. That is my objection to further immigration at present. If we introduced large numbers of people here to crowd our cities, we should bring about conditions similar to those which now prevail in New York, London, Glasgow, Chicago, Liverpool, and other large cities. In a speech which he delivered at San Francisco on 3rd April, Rider Haggard said:We face yellow peril now. The crowding of slums of large cities breeds race suicide, and then Mongol hordes will sweep over us. The East has not the evils of the Occident. I would urge that before we become charitable to people abroad, we should look to the interests of our people at home. I could take the Treasurer into many parts of the city of Melbourne, and show him hundreds of men and women who are virtually on the brink of starvation, who do not know where to obtain their next meal or their bed for the coming night. The Premier of Victoria, who, in my opinion, is the best Premier Victoria has ever had, and who is showing that he is endowed with brains and with profundity as well as rotundity, is doing everything possible to relieve the unfortunate unemployed. If it is desired to increase the population of Australia the Government should take possession of the large landed estates. I do not mean that the land should be confiscated, but that such legislation should be passed as would convince large land-holders that the property they hold was intended for the sustenance of human beings rather than of sheep. We should endeavour to induce the various States to pass such laws as would compel land-holders to utilize their properties to the fullest possible extent, or part with their holdings. I do not believe in confiscation, but, at the same time, I do not approve of land-holders exercising power to which they are not entitled. A great deal has been said on the question of raising revenue. It appears to me that under the party system of responsible government, too much power is wielded by Ministers, as comp'aired A l - with other members of the Legislature. In all questions relating to thefinancesbrought con- before the House we have the benefit of the product of the brains of seven men, instead of the product of the brains of the whole of the members of Parliament. Surely seven men cannot, unless they include in their ranks a modern Napoleon or an Alexander Hamilton, possess more brains than the other members of this Parliament. The curse of responsible government is that Ministers bring down such a policy as their environment suggests, and, apparently, no one else is in our case in a position to propope any other means of raising revenue than, the Customs and Excise duties. The Treasurer says that the people of Queensland have in their pockets the money which has been lost by the Queensland Treasurer owing to the operation of the Federal Tariff. I can assure the right honourable gentleman that the people of Tasmania wish that they had in their pockets the money lost to the revenue. Suppose that Queensland or Tasmania had a number of factories employing 40,000 or 50,000 persons, the money paid to the operatives would be placed in circulation and contribute to the prosperity of the community, whereas the money saved under the conditions referred to by the Treasurer lies useless in the pockets of a few. Now, referring to Defence matters, it appears to me that we are spending altogether too much money. Our expenditure amounts to 6s. or 7s. per head of the population of the Commonwealth, and I would ask what we are frightened of ? We are lighting phantoms. If , as some people fear, Japan has designs upon Australia, should not we, a mere handful of 3,000,000, be absolutely helpless against them? Yet Ave are spending hundreds of thousands of pounds annually upon forts, military accoutrements, and useless trappings, to guard ourselves against invasion by a power which is now friendly to the nation to which we belong. In fact, only lately, Great B r i tain withdrew her fleet from the Eastern seas. Since France became the friend of England, the latter Power has withdrawn her fleet from the Eastern seas, being content to absolutely trust her ally Japan. Yet, day after day we hear, not alone military men in their gilt braid and spurs and their peacock feathers, but also members of Parliament and business men. talking about Japan conquering this country. speaking, they are actually inciting Japan to attempt the conquest of Australia. Japan is the allv of this country, the ally of England, of France, and of America,'and these nations are all trading with each other. They are selling their good-* to each other. They are doing business of all descriptions with each other, and are not talking about attacking each other's country.",14
23,Mr MCWILLIAMS,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,We shut out Japanese.,16
24,Mr KING OMALLEY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"N at i o n s do as they choose in their own country. white man can own a piece of land Japan. I know of various companies which settlement. sought to establish themselves in that country, but they could only erect buildings own property through the medium of Japanese. A nation within its own tory is a sovereign entity, and that entity can pass laws to suit itself. Japan has enacted legislation to suit her own people, and under those laws no white man can own property there ",16
25,Mr WILSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,He can go there as a visitor.,16
26,Mr KING OMALLEY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,The Japanese can come here as visitors. My objection is that we are spending enormous sums of money upon military defence-upo n guns which will be obsolete within ten years.,16
27,Mr KELLY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"The honourable member gets his boots cleaned every morning, and yet they are dirty before nightfall.",16
28,Mr KING OMALLEY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"The honourable member can get his boots cleaned three or four times a day, but a worker like myself cannot do so. I maintain that if we set out looking for trouble we shall find it. If the biggest prize-fighter in Melbourne were to walk down Bourke-street tomorrow with a chip on his shoulder, he would find somebody ready to knock it' off. I am surprised that in Australia, which possesses greater resources than does any other country in the world, persons should be continually talking about its conquest by some foreign nation. I object to such statements, and I protest against the proposed expenditure upon defence.",16
29,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,Does the honourable member say that there is no need for us to make provision to defend ourselves ?,16
30,Mr KING OMALLEY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,The r e is not the slightest reason for so doing.,16
31,Mr MCWILLIAMS,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,I suppose that we are to sponge upon England for all time?,16
32,Mr KING OMALLEY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"F o r thirty In so years in America I heard: the statement made that England intended to invade that country. Every morning some newspaper would announce that the British fleet had been seen off Newfoundland, and that British troops might be landed upon American soil at any time. Naturally, the people were worked up to such a pitch that nearly every Yankee used to sleep upon his Winchester rifle. I object: to the waste of money that is proposed upon the Dethe fence Department. It is utter waste. Instead of spending that money in accoutrecan ments and in nonsense that is really inN o jurious to the Commonwealth, it should be in spent upon the encouragement of closer",16
33,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,I thought that the and honourable member believed in insurance.,16
34,Mr KING OMALLEY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I believe in terripeace, in commerce, and in justice.",16
35,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"And in insurance. Mr KING O'MALLEY - That is included in the matters I have mentioned. If the sum which it is proposed to expend upon defence were handed over to the States Treasurers for the purpose of enabling them to place people upon the land, the railways of the Commonwealth would pay. I say that we should pension off our military men. Let them come and dance with the young ladies of the town, and enjoy themselves. But we should waste no more of the taxpayers' money upon these military phantoms, which are conjured up for the specific purpose of creating a scare which does not exist. Great Britain has confidently withdrawn her fleet from the Eastern seas-accordin g to American newspapers-and is willing to trust Japan and France, her allies. America has not yet withdrawn her fleet from Manila, but now that peace has been concluded between Russia and Japan she will doubtless do so. I claim that it is not necessary to waste money upon the maintenance of an army in Australia.",17
36,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"Are the Americans going to blow up their ships? Mr KING O'MALLEY - They are not going to blow anybody up, because there is no necessity for them to do so. I contend that we are mad upon the question of war in Australia. Ever since I landed here, some sixteen years ago, I have heard of nothing else. Some years ago I was in Tasmania when it was generally declared that a Russian fleet intended to effect a landing there. Now, the Russian fleet is at the bottom of the sea, and I would suggest to the Treasurer that we should limit the expenditure upon defence for a period of twenty years, and gradually retire our military officers.",17
37,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,Is the member voicing the views of the caucus ?,17
38,Mr KING OMALLEY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"No ; I am speaking entirely for myself. Everybody is aware that my honoured chief is very strong upon defence matters. In fact, he has gone a bit mad upon that. question, just as most honourable members have gone crazy upon the subject of war. The Treasurer has stated that the scheme for arming our Military Forces and equipping them with ' the most modern rifles-and it should be remembered that the most modern rifles now will be antiquated in a couple of yearswill cost ^t-20,000, or $2,600,000. I well remember when the old shot-gun was in use. It had to give way to the Winchester rifle, which in its turn has 'been superseded by improved weapons. I would not object, if it were necessary, to a proposal for the foundation of a navy, or-if honourable members thought it better-to entering into a contract with the British Government, under which a greater number of Imperial ships would be stationed here to defend Australia, should ft ever become necessary to do so. If honourable members think it incumbent upon them to waste money upon some kind of military or naval business, let them do as I have suggested. But I shall enter my protest against this expenditure, even if I am the only member of the Labour Party to do so. I now come to the question of the sugar bounties. Whilst I intend to vote' for the Government proposal in this connection, I shall do so very reluctantly, because I am satisfied that the bounty will not cease at the end of five or six years. No honourable member ever knew a man to relinquish a good thing.",17
39,Mr KENNEDY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"Would the honourable member do so? Mr KING O'MALLEY - No , I never did. I have never known any man or woman to sacrifice a good thing. It is when they grow tired of bad things that they desire to get rid of them in order to obtain good things. The little State of Tasmania is called upon to contribute her proportion of the sugar bounty. There is no doubt that the Colonial Sugar Company will derive the most benefit from the Government policy in connection with the sugar industry. The gentlemen who are interested in that company bloat about drawing-rooms, and enjoy themselves at the expense of the potato grower of Tasmania. With regard to ihe sugar bounty, I know that some members honourable of the Labour Party are in favour of it.",17
40,Mr MCDONALD,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"It is not a party question. Mr KING O'MALLEY"" - I feel exceedingly doubtful as to the policy of the bounty, and if I finally made up my mind to vote for it, I should do so with %'ery great misgiving. I now come to the question of the Braddon blot. What is it? It is a sort of constitutional machine for the destruction of the rights, powers, and privileges of Commonwealth representatives in Parliament. Why do the States desire to continue the operation of a section in our Constitution which carries its iown. condemnation upon its face? Why did wo federate? Why was the union formed? When a man enters into partnership another individual he does so from a desire to better his financial position. The' States having entered into a partnership, I contend that the strong should bear the burdens of the weak. I desire to be perfectly candid. Prior to Federation the States were a segregation of wrangling political nonentities. That condition of affairs now passed. away, and we have become great continental nation- a nation of partthat ners and of friends. We have removed the artificial barriers which existed between the States. That being the case, the don blot should be removed from our Constitution, and the Treasurer of monwealth should not be compelled, when he requires a certain amount of revenue assist the necessitous States, to raise times the sum that is requisite to give effect to his desire. Under existing conditions, Commonwealth Treasurer is absolutely hobbled, handcuffed, and shackled. What would honourable members think if the Treaoutset, surer} of the United States were compelled to consult forty-eight States and two territhen tories, or forty-six States and four terriwere tories, before he could advance J £ I to Colorado, Nevada, or any other State of American union? That is exactly the posiand tion in which the Braddon blot places this Parliament today. I claim that the whole of the Commonwealth revenue should be placed in one general fund, and that the necessitous States ought to receive advances from that fund, although not more than amount to which they are legitimately enso prominent a part"". titled. There ought to be no such thing an endeavour to make some States bankrupt. But that is the position in which the don blot will place us. A broad-minded a Treasurer like the right honourable member for Swan should have the courage to inauthat he had brains. gurate a truly Australian policy, under which, instead of pouring millions into coffers of a State that did not require money, he would say, "" This revenue shall be distributed as the States need it for their development."" The money should be disStates. tributed proportionately, and on reasonable lines. I am opposed to the Braddon blot, because it is based on injustice. The Comholders monwealth will never be able to establish a system of old-age pensions, or to sider any financial proposal calculated to really beneficial to the people of Australia, while the Braddon blot remains in the stitution. Mr King O'Malley.",17
41,Mr MCWILLIAMS,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"It is the salvation with of the smaller States. Mr KING O'MALLEY - We hear again the voice of the provincialist. I regret that such a remark should have been made by the honourable member for Franklin, because he generally shows the possession-of a broad mind. But, after all, the influence has of environment is remarkable. I am thanka ful that I was born in a great continentI breathed the air of the white mounall tains of New Hampshire and Vermont. When one lives under such conditions, he Bradhas broader ideas than have others.",18
42,Mr WILKS,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"Why did the honourable the Commember leave that country ? Mr KING O'MALLEY - Because of to the Scriptural injunction to go into the four world and preach the gospel unto the heathen. I am also opposed to any extenthe sion of the bookkeeping period, for I regard it as another fraud on the Commonwealth. It served a useful purpose at the because it induced some of the antiquated, fossilized relics of the dark ages who occupied positions of prominence, and frightened of their own shadows, to assist support the union. Something had to be the done to encourage the States to come in, the bookkeeping clause was devised to that end. I remember a time, in the history of Canada, when Sir John Macdonald would have been mobbed by the people if an opportunity had occurred; but the day came when Canada gloried in the movement the in which that distinguished man took Every man who as proposes something that is out of the beaten path - something to which the Bradcrowd is unaccustomed - is regarded as faddist or a fool, and it is not until after his death that the people realise, as a rule, I come now to the question of the transfer of the States debts. the I must confess that I was amazed to learn the that the right honourable member for Balaclava was in favour of the Commonwealth taking over the whole of the debts of the I cannot help recalling to mind what was done by the Dominion of Canada in this direction. Why should the European of the bonds, stocks, and Treasury bills of the States, who invested their conmoney on the strength of the guaranbe tee of the various States, be allowed to come in, and obtain the guarantee of the ConCommonwealth that will put millions into their pockets, while, at the same time, they do nothing to enable the Commonwealth to meet future obligations? Let us consider the question for one moment. According to the Treasurer, the States debts now amount to ^234,000,000, and of that amount no less a sum than ,£32,000,000 has been borrowed since the establishment of the Federation. If ever there were "" Jubilee plungers,"" or bettors on the credit of the States, those who have been responsible for the public loans raised since the inauguration of the Federation may be justly described as such. And yet these men speak of the extravagance of the Commonwealth. As a matter of fact, the Commonwealth is only an infant in its swaddling clothes as compared with the States which have raised ^32,000,000 within the last four years. States debts amounting to something like ^23,000,000 will fall .due in the course of the next few years, and I absolutely agree with the suggestion made by Mr Speaker, when a member of the Federal Convention. I believe the Legislatures of the various. States should pass enabling Acts giving the Commonwealth power to negotiate for the redemption of their loans as they fall due. That power should be given to the Commonwealth without delay, so that the experience of Victoria some eighteen months ago, when she had to pay an enormous bonus in connection with a conversion loan, may not be repeated.' If the underwriters concerned had been Hottentots, or cannibals, they could not have attacked the people of Victoria more savagely than they did on that occasion. It is better to eat up a man, than to eat up all that he has, and yet that is what the financiers did in the case of Victoria. The power to negotiate for the redemption of State debts, as they fall due, should be extended to the Commonwealth, and as soon as that power has been vested in the Commonwealth Government, negotiations should be entered into with a view to give effect to it. Is there one State in the union which could ascertain tomorrow the names of the holders of its stocks ? With the exception of South Australia, there is not. Most of the States Treasurers of days' gone by feared that they had not the ability to negotiate the necessarry loans, and they accordingly farmed out the work to banking companies in England. The banks in turn farmed it out to underwriters, who sold these stocks to various investors. The underwriters know who are the holders of the various stocks of the States, but, as I have said, the Treasurers of the States, with the exception of the Treasurer of South Australia, do not.",18
43,Mr MCWILLIAMS,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,Is that a matter of much moment?,19
44,Mr KING OMALLEY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"It is a matter of great importance, as I shall be able to show. If the honourable member were doing business with men all over Australia, would he not find himself in an awkward position, if he left the whole of the financial side of his business to be attended to by a bank? What would be his position if, as his bills fell due, he was told by the bank, "" We cannot tell you who are the holders of your bills "" ? If he could see the holders of his bills and tell them personally of the security he was able to afford them, he would do much better than he would if he had to depend upon the intervention of a third party. To the everlasting credit of the right honourable member for Adelaide, be it said that, as Premier of South Australia, he intrusted the Agent-General with the work of inscribing the stock of the State- a work hitherto done by the banks. When the Agent-General of South Australia sends out the warrants for the payment of interest on State loans, he is able to say who are the holders of the bonds and stock - Many of the one-time Treasurers of other States, who handed over the floating of loans to various banking institutions, have gone to their graves covered with honour as State financiers; but if such a system can be described as financing, then it is the easiest thing in the world to become a financier. Let me give another illustration of the difficult position in which the States have been placed by the adoption 1 of the practice to which I have referred. The Age and Argus are powerful, weJlconducted journals, but if their proprietors farmed out their daily distribution and the collection of advertisements, they would be unable to ascertain what was the reason for any falling off.",19
45,Mr MCWILLIAMS,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"They do farm out their distribution, to a great extent. Mr KING O'MALLEY - That is so; but they closely supervise the work. I know of a case in which the publishing department of one of the newspapers called for an explanation from a ladv agent, because it appeared that the opposition paper was securing an increased circulation in the dis1 trict in which she carried on business. In order to give the holders of States bonds confidence in the Commonwealth we should - first of all carry the motion, of which I gave notice some time ago, prodding for the imposition of a direct unimproved land tax. I have carefully considered the matter, and have ascertained that we could, by this means, raise from at least £ i , 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 to _£i, 500,000 per annum. Before we talk - of taking over the debts of the States, the interest on which, according to the Treasurer, exceeds the whole of the revenue of the Commonwealth, we ought to prove to investors in Great Britain and Europe that we have the means to meet Australian bonds and stocks as they f a ll due, if they are not prepared to enable us to float conversion loans. That means is to be found in the imposition of a direct unimproved land tax. I would exempt the small land-holder.",19
46,Mr WILKS,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,Why should he not bear his share?,20
47,Mr JOHNSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,If an exemption were proposed the scheme would be destroyed.,20
48,Mr KING OMALLEY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I am a great believer in the system of small holdings. - Have honourable members ever heard of a man who was willing to fight for his boardinghouse-keeper? Have honourable members ever heard of a man who would shoulder his rifle for the sake of defending his boardinghouse ? I do not think they have. But we all know that a. man will fight for his wife and children, and his own little home.",20
49,Mr MCWILLIAMS,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,I thought the honourable member wished to nationalize Ihe land.,20
50,Mr KING OMALLEY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"So I do j,but the trouble is that I cannot induce honourable members to seriously consider the quesnon. Some honourable members accept an invitation to dinner at one of the big clubs, where they hear various statements made about the Labour Party, and they come back with unfriendly feelings towards that party. As a matter of fact, the Labour Party is a thinking body-it does not think by proxy.",20
51,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,The honourable member is the only member of it who has been able to say a word with regard to the Budget statement.,20
52,Mr KING OMALLEY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"We propose to have a little to say on the Budget now. My suggestion is that the Commonwealth should impose a land tax and a heavy absentee tax on the incomes of the slanderers and defamers of their country's name, who live in Europe, and to whom the Treasurer referred in his Budget speech. The following motion, of which I gave notice during the sittings of the first Parliament, contains my proposition : That in view of the facts1. That during many years the Governments of the several Australian States have been prodigal floaters of loans on the English money market, with the result that at present the six States are loaded with the dead weight of a foreign debt to the enormous amount of over ,£215,000,000a sum which requires over £7,800,000 to meet the interest bill. Our debt is now £234,000,000, and the interest on it over £8,000.000 a year. 2. That no provision exists among the States (with the exception of South and Western Australia) for a practical sinking fund for the redemption of this huge debt. 3. That it is absolutely necessary to establish a fund similar to that in existence in WesternAustralia in order to rehabilitate the credit of the States-mos t of the profits produced by this borrowed money having gravitated into the pockets of the large landed proprietors in the form of unearned increment, in consequence of the expenditure on public works. 4That it is advisable, in the interests of the States and Commonwealth, that large estates should be cut up into small holdings for b'ond fide settlers on perpetual leases, thus preventing the emigration of our healthy, able-bodied young men to foreign countries, in consequence of their being unable to secure homes in the land of their birth. This House is opinion that the Government should introduce a Bill for the purpose of imposing a graduated land and absentee tax, on the following unimproved capital value basis (no taxation being imposed on improvements, however costly) :1. (a) Land of the unimproved capital value of £2,000, or less, to be exempt from taxation. (b) Land over the unimproved value of £2,000, and under ,£20,000, to pay £d. per £1. (c) Land of the unimproved value of £20,000, and under £40,000, to pay jd. per £1. (d,) Land of the unimproved value of ,£40,000, and under £75,000, to pay id. per £1. (e) Land of the unimproved value of £75,000, and under ,£100,000, to pay i£d. per £ 1 . (/) Land of the unimproved value of ,£100,000, and under ,£150,000, to pay i^d. per ,£1. (g) Land of the unimproved value of £150,000, and under ,£200,000, to pay 2d. per £ i (//) Land of the unimproved value of ,£200,000, and under ,£250,000, to pay 3d. per £1. (1) Land of the unimproved value of ,£250,000, and under £300,000, to pay 4d. per £ 1 . (7) Land of the unimproved value of £300,000, and tinder £350,000, to pay 5d. per ,£1. {&) Land of the unimproved value of £350,000, and under £400,000, to pay 5-^d. per £1. (I) Land of the unimproved value of £400,000, and above, to pay 6d. per £t. 2. Absentee landed proprietors to pay double the amount of the foregoing rates. 3. A portion of the proceeds to be utilized for the purpose of establishing a system of national old-age pensions, and the balance to be placed in a reserve fund to partially redeem the several State loans as they f a ll due. 4. That this motion, when carried, be an instruction to the Attorney-General to prepare the necessary measureWhen this becomes law it will shift the incidence of cruel taxation from the backs of the small holders to that of the Monopolistic Boodle Sludgers who have turned the people's heritage into a sheep-walk. We can raise from £ 1 , 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 to £1,500,000 annually, and I suggest that the Commonwealth should secure a piece of property in the heart of London, and on it erect a building which will cost in all between ,£200,000 and £ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 . At the present time, the Governments of the Various States have offices for their Agents-General all over London-som e of them near the Parliament Buildings at Westminster, away from the business centre of the city, where no one ever goes. The office of Agent-General should, in my opinion, be abolished, and general agents should be appointed in their stead. An Agent-General should be a thing of the past, because everything now is hard, progressive, cruel, murderous business. The Commonwealth could dig down deep, and have great basements, and subbasements, on its property, where the winegrowers of Australia could store their wine. Then in the building they could provide offices for the"" general agents of the six States, and on the top storey they could have a show room for the exhibition of the produce of the States, with the States' tag on everything, the remaining space to be let. Unless a nation advertises today, just as individuals do, it must go to sleep, and become covered with blue mould; and the best way in which we can effectively advertise is by making patent the substantial potentialities of Australia, by the means I suggest. In the Commonwealth building would be lifts or elevators to climb up or down, and there could be a restaurant in which nothing but Australian wine, and food prepared from Australian commodities, would be sold. If this seems too socialistic a proposal, the Government could lease the right to conduct such a restaurant, and persons would soon be found to tender for it. By renting the various rooms in the building, we should get an enormous income. If we borrowed ,£300,000 at 3 per cent., on interminable stocks or bonds-and stocks are better than bonds, because the latter have coupons attached which are a nuisance-w e should have to pay £ 9 , 0 0 0 a year in interest, and a good landed investment in London is supposed to pay at least 7 per cent.",20
53,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,The man who could point out safe investments of that kind would make thousands.,21
54,Mr KING OMALLEY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"Seven per cent, can be obtained from investments in property in the heart of cities like London, New York, Chicago, and even Melbourne. Seven per cent, would give us a return of ,£21,000, while 6 per cent, would give a return of ,£18,000 a year. Out of that the municipal rates would have to be paid; but it would be unnecessary to insure the building, because the Commonwealth is stronger than any insurance company. I wrote to the Under-Treasurers of the States, to ascertain what each State pays for rent in London, but the only reply I have yet received came from the Under-Treasurer in Tasmania, who said that that State pays £ 2 7 5 . Of course, Tasmania is a small State, and if we estimate the average amount paid by the States at £5°° 0 1 £ 0 0 0 each, or .£3,000 in the aggregate, I do not think we shall be far wrong,. That at once meets half the interest charge. I would insist on the High Commissioner having absolute power in connection with the inscribing of the stock issued, and would allow him to float his loan at any period when he was likely to get money cheaply. Having the stock on his books, the Commissioner would know by whom it was held, just as an insurance company knows who are ifs policy-holders, and could make it his business on occasions to see the larger holders, or to write to the smaller holders, offering them inducements to continue to hold the.stock in the event of our loans falling due. At the present time, because of the stories in circulation about a certain institution, many persons are frightened; but their fear's vanish when one sees them, and tells them that things are all right. Unfortunately, the great multitude is carried away by clamour and rumour, and is ready to sell its stocks, or dispose of its investments, to save itself from what it thinks threatened disaster, but the rich man who keeps his fingers on the financial pulse of the world knows what is happening, and' buys the stock, doubling the value of his investment in a few months. The Commonwealth should not delay to erect, in the heart of the city of London, a building which would be a monument to the business ability of the people of the country, and would enable their produce to be properly exhibited to the people of Europe. About every year or two there are celebrations of one kind or another in London, and the Commonwealth building' would, on such occasions, be crowded with sightseers, who would gain a knowledge of what we have to offer to emigrants, and would spread the fame of our resources. I find from official records that the land of Australia is valued at £""373,679,000, and the on it at £375>5 5>°°°comes drawn from investments by persons non-resident in Australia to-.£8,350,000, and £[400,000 is spent annually by Australians residents in Europe. Of the first-mentioned amount, or nearly 4 per cent of the total incomes in the State, apart from the interest paid upon State debentures, is drawn from New South Wales; £1,600,000, or 3 per cent, is drawn from Victoria; £1,100,000, per cent., from Queensland; £375,000, or 2 1 per cent, from South £[2,300.000, or 13 per cent., from Western Australia; £360,000, or 4 per cent., from Tasmania. The incomes drawn in the' Commonwealth represent a total £[179,000,000, and'the incomes in New Zealand represent a total of £8,750,000, or slightly over 5 per cent, of the total of the incomes derived from private concerns in the Commonwealth, drawn by non-residents. These who enjoy all the. social advantages of living in the centres of art and Culture, should, I think, be made to specially pay the Commonwealth for policing their It is not fair to the residents of Australia, who rear their families in the country in which they make their income, that no distinction should be made in matters of taxation between them and persons who live in Europe. It is hard for an Australian Treasurer, owing to his environment, to present a policy which will have the effect of treading on the toes of absentees, but, I think, it is time that some action was taken in this direction. The Treasurer did not say one word with regard to the establishment of a Commonwealth Bank of issue and deposit. This is a very important matter. We are, today, living under a banking system that Sir Robert Peel gave to the world in 1844 or 1845. No improvements have been made during all the years that have elapsed, and it seems most remarkable that, whilst changes .are being made in all other kinds of economic institutions, whilst wonderful improvements are being effected in the methods of the proUr. King O'Malley. duction and distribution of wealth, and whilst the remotest nations of the earth are being brought into closer connection by the magic touch of commerce, and whilst the whole industrial and commercial world is passing through a process of evolutionary transformation, no change should be made in the antiquated and obimprovements solete system of currency, which has been I The in- in existence for the last sixty or seventy years. The currency being the very lifeamount blood that circulates through the veins of the nation, I was glad to hear the honourable member for Brisbane address £2,565,000, the House on the subject of establishing Commonwealth currency, although 1 could not altogether appreciate some of the features of the system which the honourable member advocated. or ,5$ Under his proposal, the State would receive from the banks only one-third of the Australia; value of the notes issued to them in gold, and the hanks would have to pay only 2 per 1 cent, interest on the other two-thirds of the total face value of the notes. I underof stood, further, that the banks would be in a position to get back their gold upon re^38,967,000. turning the paper currency. I should think that a better return to the State would be secured if the banks were required to pay is 2 per cent, interest on the full value of the people, note issue.",21
55,Mr CULPIN,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,But the State would hold the banks' gold to the extent of one-third of the value of the notes issued. properties,22
56,Mr KING OMALLEY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"Yes , but unfortunately the banks could get the gold back upon returning the notes, and I do not like giving anythingback once I have got it. I do not think that any great profit is to be derived from the issue of paper money, but that system has great advantages, in so far as it engenders confidence in the State. Moreover, if a State bank of issue were established the power now enjoyed by a monopoly consisting of a few private bankers would be vested in the State. At present bankers frequently eii-. courage booms by urging people to borrow money when it is plentiful, and they bring about the collapse ""of such booms by calling upon their debtors to pay them at a subsequent stage when money becomes scarce. If the State had the control of the issue of paper money it would refuse to increase its note circulation in order to assist a boom. If there were a prospect of a boom the State bank would commence to cancel its circulation, and this would have a discouraging effect upon those who were disposed to over-speculate. On the other hand, in times of great trouble, the State bank could increase its circulation, through the agency of the post-offices. It may be urged that no one would have confidence in a Government bank, but Coghlan points out that the States savings banks had a wonderful boom at the time of the bank crisis in 1893, because the people had confidence in them. If we had a Commonwealth bank of issue it would be able to do business with farmers and producers, who, however, would not be granted overdrafts unless they deposited securities in the forms of deeds, bills of lading, bills of AUSTRALASIAN BANKING PROFITS (NET) Australian Joint-Stock B a n k ..

It is a common blunder to regard bankdeposits as money in the banks, whereas they are principally composed of credits in a ledger. When a banker lends a customer £'10,000, he takes the customer's promissory note, and credits his account with the proceeds. exchange, bonds, or bills of sale. The result would ba that the State bank would encourage the small producer and the small business man. Unfortunately, the present banks of issue unconsciously help big men, who can come to them and borrow thousands upon ""depositing their deeds. The enormous profits made by the Australian banks is at the expense of the whole people who have to pay the interest, discounts, and exchange. Both the borrowers and bank employees are sweated to fatten the shareholders, as shown by the following table from the Australasian Banking and Insurance Record of 20th January, 1905, from which I will read some figures: AND DIVIDENDS REPORTED IN 1002, 1903, AND 1S04.

Even when the customer operates by cheque on the credit The it does not necessarily follow that the money in the bank is reduced, tor his cheques either go to the credit of other customers of the hank, or they find their way into other banks, and become an offset by similar transactions.

In only a small proportion of the financial transactions thus accomplished by credit will actual cash be demanded, and igainst this the banker must retain a certain percentage of his deposits in cash reserves. If the credit be foolishly given to a worthless speculator who cannot pay when the money is due, or make satisfactory ments, then the bank loses the amount, because its resources are reduced by £[10,000, while its liabilities remain the same. the difference between redeemable and irredeemable credit rests all the difference between good currency and bad currency, between good banking and bad banking, between good investment securities and bad investment securities. Thus . the increase of bank deposits is clue more to an expansion of credit than to an increase, of actual money in the banks, or of funds in search of investment. In like manner, when deposits decrease it is a contraction of credit, rather than the withdrawal of money from the banks. In 1893 there was far more money in the banks of Australia than in 1892. Yet the deposits were millions less on account of the contraction credit primarily due to the crisis, the loans, and Other credit assets being relatively reduced. This borrowing, and rate of exchange question need not frighten us. Many years ago the Baring Brothers loaned to the South American Republic because the rate of interest was much higher than in. America or Australia. When the rate of interest is higher in Australia than elsewhere, the financiers and capitalists will lend the people here money instead of buying foreign commercial bills, causing Jess, demand for bills, and therefore lowering the rates. If rates of interest are higher in other countries, will be a greater demand for commercial bills or other exchanges on foreign countries with the object of getting the benefit of such high rates. If the interest rates for money are lower in other countries than here, Australian financiers wouldi borrow monev in their markets, and loan it here, thus increasing Australian indebtedness to foreign countries, and on the falling due of these loans there would be an increased Mr King O'Malley. demand for exchange to pay them, resulting in higher rates. The fluctuation in the rate of exchange is due to many The causes. If the value of the commodities exported by Australia greatly exceed the value of the commodities imported during a certain period, the large balance due to us from other countries would, if there were no other international transactions to offset them, cause the lowering of the price of exchange here for the reason that there would be less demand for remittances to foreign countries, since it is always the difference between the debits and credits arrange- that is remitted. On the other hand, if we owed foreign countries more than they . owed us, exchange would be higher - by In reason of the increased demand for it.",22

I believe that the Commonwealth should be given the power to at once commence negotiations in respect of those loans. I claim that if we imposed a land tax, and if we had there £[5,000,000 in the Commonwealth Treasury we should experience no difficulty in regard to renewing our loans.",24
65,Sir PHILIP FYSH,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,Does the honourable member favour the abolition of the State land taxes?,24
66,Mr KING OMALLEY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I ^vouId like to see a uniform land tax imposed all over Australia. A tax of a penny in the pound would realise £[1,500,000 a year. The bonds of the Commonwealth, backed by the States, are surely worth more than State bonds would be, unbacked by the Commonwealth. Ninety per cent, of the business of the world of today is openly done by credit, and the other 10 per cent, is transacted by other forms which are equivalent to credit.",24

68,Mr KING OMALLEY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I define it as confidence.

The lands of the Commonwealth are valued at £[373,000,000. That value has been imparted to them by the working people of this country.

75,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,Is the Treasurer to gage in gambling?,25
76,Mr KING OMALLEY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,That would not be gambling. The States go into the open market and offer their stock for sale.,25
77,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,The Treasurer is to collect the funds of our citizens and wait for an opportunity to purchase State bonds.,25
78,Mr KING OMALLEY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"The Treasurer would receive a certain amount from land taxation each year. He would be paying off the States debts, and thus relieving them of a terrible burden. Everybody recognises that if the Braddon blot were removed from our Constitution, and the Commonwealth liad £ 2 , 0 00,00 0 or £3,000,00 0 of a surplus above what is required to help the States, the Commonwealth Treasurer would be in a very different position from thatwhich he would occupy if he had to face a deficit each year. Credit is the most potent economic force of the age, and credit rests upon confidence. The whole financial fabric of the world today virtually rests upon credit. How much gold is there in circulation in England or Australia? We have not £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 worth of notes, gold, and silver in circulation in the Commonwealth, and yet we are doing a business equal to £[94,000,000 annually.",25
79,Mr HIGGINS,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"We have £[22,000,000 of gold on deposit.",25
80,Mr KING OMALLEY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I amspeaking of the amount in circulation. How much gold is there in circulation in England? Mr J . Wilson Harper, speaking of this aspect of the matter, says :Gold plays an important but subordinate partThe extensive use of credit bills, promissory notes, and bank notes, has far more to do with the maintenance of our monetary system. If it had to completely rest on gold it would soon crumble to dust. According to Mr Clare, the whole stock of legal tender does not exceed £[126,000,000. H is remark has reference to the United Kingdom. He addsFrom half to two-thirds of this amount is in actual circulation among the public, £50,000,000 or £60,000,000 being available for banking purposes. Mr MCLeod saysThere are about £110,000,000 in actual coin in the country, and credit to the amount of £10,890,000,000 rests upon that. Dean Farrar estimates the entire capital at £12,000,000,000 , and says that £235,000,000 are yearly invested and saved. Mr Laver states that the chief en- London banks, exclusive of the Bank of England! hold cash in hand to the extent of £[27,000,000, and that a debt of by £[227,000,000 rests upon that The estimate made by the Committee' of experts who recently issued their report Indian currency is muchless than those just cited; but coming from such financial authorities, it may be accepted on the whole as most accurate. It is stated thatIn the United Kingdom the amount of gold and silver available for purposes of currency uncertain, but the Mint estimate of the gold circulation is £91,000,000, of which the amount in banks, including that in the issue department of the Bank of England, and in other banks against which notes are issued, is stated to be £25,000,000. The report further explains that the held by the issue department of the Bank of England, and that held byThe Scotch and Irish banks, in respect of notes issued beyond the authorized looked upon as an integral portion of the currency, since it cannot be used at the same with the notes that are issued against it. But the amount is included in the sum of £91,000,000. If that enormous volume of business . is done on a credit basis, of what are we afraid in Australia? Turning to Cog/dan, page 801, we find th% statementThe savings banks are on a very different ing, being, to a greater or less extent, under State control, and otherwise safeguarded, so .they enjoy public confidence. If the savings banks enjoy public fidence, because they are guaranteed Government, would not the people Wave confidence in a Commonwealth bank of deposit and issue?",25
81,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,It would depend on the way in which it was conducted.,26
82,Mr KING OMALLEY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"Let me illusto trate my point. When a city suddenly springs up for which an adequate water supply has not been provided, what is first step taken by those in authority They fix upon a catchment area. they build a great dam or reservoir into which the water is directedi Mains are next laid from the reservoir to the city, storage basins being excavated along the line, and by means of service pipes the water is conveyed to every household, and the whole city is supplied. there is not a sovereign or a half-crown piece that was' not dug out of the earth some working man or working woman. There was no property in the Garden of Eden-ther e was not a dollar to lie found there; and every pound that is necessary to pay off the national debt must be earned the working men of Australia - If that sum. be so, why should not the savings of the workers flow through the various post-office on savings banks into a Commonwealth Government national bank, and be utilized for the benefit of the workers of Australia ? To-day the wealth of the world is flowing from the pockets of the workers into those of great organizations of private gentlemen is who boss the wealth of the earth. These in gentlemen have made their wealth out of the labours of the workers of the world, and the Labour Party is determined to introduce a new system under which not a dollar will be taken from those gentlemen; but under which they will be unable to take gold a dollar that they do not earn.",26
83,Mr KELLY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"Will members of Parliament secure a proper allowance under limits, cannot be that system?",26
84,Mr KING OMALLEY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I am glad time that the honourable member has reminded me of that point. To the everlasting discredit of the Government and their predecessors, be it said, that the function for which they came into office-the function of feeding the people-ha s never been f u l filled. Honourable members are today refootceiving a starvation allowance-a n allowance that is absolutely disgraceful. If we that do not believe in the principle of payment of members, let us wipe it out; but if we conare to have payment of members, the by the allowance should be commensurate with the duties to be discharged. If honourable members received an allowance of £[600 or £ 7 0 0 a year, it would be unnecessary for them to engage in private business. .1 hold that no man can conscientiously attend his Parliamentary duties and at the same time control a private business. A member of Parliament must either resign his seat the or let his business go. The Government ? should pay no regard to press criticism. Then Thank God, the newspapers do not run this Parliament; and if the Ministers are afraid to. tackle this question seriouslyif, like other Governments, they are simply waiting for something to turn up-the y will in time be turned down. I fought the last general election on the public statement that I hold that I favoured an allowance of £[1,000 a year, and I hold that there is no justification for by giving members of the Parliament only £[400 per annum simply because the Comstitution sets forth that such shall be the allowance ""until the Parliament otherwise provides."" The right honourable member for East Sydney has often admitted that he made a great mistake when, as a member of the Federal Convention, he moved to amend the clause in the draft Constitution Bill providing that the allowance should be £ 5 0 0 per annum.  right honourable-member seek to rectify his mistake ?",26
85,Mr KING OMALLEY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"How could he possibly rectify it when his Government had only a majority of one? Government have a substantial majority, and most honourable members of the Opposition would support a proposal by them to increase the present allowance. I am prepared to vote for an allowance of anything up to £ 6 0 0 a year.",27
86,Mr KELLY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"Would the honourable member vote for nothing over that, amount ?",27
87,Mr KING OMALLEY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I do not think it would be fair to ask for more. I appeal to the Government not to be scared by newspaper criticism, but to have the pluck to bring in a Bill providing for an increased allowance. In conclusion,. I have only to say that I thank the Treasurer for having administered a much deserved castigation to those treacherous men who were beggars when Australia found them, and who, having become millionaires, visit Europe from time to time, and denounce the land that made them. But let them go. Australia, with its mountains and its valleys, its hills and its dales, its rivers and its plains, its harbors, its villages and its cities, its lovely women, and its champion racehorses, still remains. Let these men go. Australia with its music, sad and thrilling-wit h its cosy homes, its winters of mildness, and its summers of healthfulness - wher e bloom and flourish the finest specimens and virtues of the British race, still remains.",27
88,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN," I do not know whether, after the poetical outburst of the honourable member who has just resumed his seat, the Committee will be willing to come down to the prosaic walks of life with which a Budget speech and a Budget debate are usually But there are a few remarks which' I should like to make, first, in connection with the finances, and, secondly, in connection with that portion of the expenditure of the Commonwealth which relates to our defences. So far as one can judge from the inquiries that could be made during the period which has elapsed since the delivery ""of the Budget speech, a pronounced feeling of apprehension has been caused by the Treasurer's remarks. The public mind is alarmed, and not without reason, at the general tone of the speech.",27
89,Sir JOHN FORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,Where is the public mind situated? the Mr MCCAY - It is not situated solely in the right honourable gentleman.,27
90,Sir JOHN FORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"Does the honourable and learned member mean everywhere-al l over Australia? The Mr MCCAY - I mean everywhere, all over Australia; with the exception, perhaps, of those realms in which the right honourable gentleman holds, or held, exclusive sway. I think that the public have reason for alarm in the attitude adopted by the right honourable gentleman, who is supposed to be the custodian of the finances of the Commonwealth, and to watch over its expenditure, so that no extravagance and no unnecessary outgoing of the public funds shall take place. But the right honourable gentleman told us, in effect, that in future the States must expect to get back not more than the statutory three-fourths of the net Commonwealth revenue to which they are entitled under the Constitution.",27
91,Sir JOHN FORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"My predecessor told them that at Hobart, in even plainer language than I used.",27
92,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,The right honourable member for Balaclava stated that the expenditure of the Commonwealth would inevitably grow until that result happened; but he did not announce the fact in tones of triumphant exultation.,27

110,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"That may be the reason why the Commonwealth is now paying so "" Pooh, large a sum for the construction of new works and buildings in Western Australia. for The right honourable gentleman is so economical that he left it to the Commonwealth to undertake this expenditure. No State in the Union is, rightly or wrongly, benefiting so much by the practice of charging new works and buildings to the Commonwealth on the population basis, as is the State of Western Australia.",28
111,Sir JOHNFORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,I deny that; I take exception to that statement.,28
112,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"Apparentl y nothing I can say will satisfy the right honourable gentleWhen I said that he was not economical he complained; and now that I ' rim saying he was economical, and am pointing out these results of his economy, he is still complaining.",28
113,Sir JOHNFORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,The honourable and learned member says that Western Australia is gaining more advantage than any other Western Australia has to pay as,28

120,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"U p to the present time a few thousand pounds.

122,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"Apparentl y the right hon, orable gentleman forgets what he said in It is not that he had so much to say in that speech that he need have forgotten what it contains, because one of the complaints I have to make is that he told us very little indeed about the position of the finances.",28
123,Sir JOHNFORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,I have before me a report of my speech.,29
124,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I have not committed the speech to memory, so that I cannot quote the exact words; but does the Treasurer deny that he indicated that he did not think the Braddon provision should be extended ?",29
125,The CHAIRMAN,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"The Treasurer will have an opportunity to reply later on to any statement made by the honourable and learned member, and that, I think, will be a better course for him to pursue than to reply now.",29
126,Sir JOHNFORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,Yes ; but when an ex-Minister criticises the Government' he might be accurate in his statements.,29
127,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,The trouble is that he is too accurate.,29
128,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"Nothin g I have said yet can be impugned on the ground of inaccuracy. I have endeavoured to do the right honourable gentleman the utmost justice. When be disputed the correctness of certain statements in regard to his conduct, I attributed to him an opposite line of conduct; but he still remained indignant, though one or other of my statements must have been correct. I am afraid it will be impossible for me to please him.",29
129,Sir JOHNFORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,I d'o not wish the honourable and learned member to please me; I only desire him to be just.,29
130,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I am thankful to the right honourable gentleman for the privilege allowed me of speaking on the Budget, whether my remarks please him or not. I repeat what I said at the outset, that the whole tend'ency of his speech is a promise to the Commonwealth that more money is to be spent. Do not we remember the tones of regret with which he announced that he was spending merely £[400,000 upon new works and buildings? I do not remember his exact words, but he said in effectand perhaps he will break through his usual practice, and correct me if I am in paid error- - 1",29
131,Sir JOHNFORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,When the honorhave able and learned member proposes to critiwill cise my conduct he should have the facts his possession.,29
132,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"The right honourable gentleman pointed out that £[400,000 was a small, almost a trifling, sum for this great Commonwealth to spend, even though it had to be obtained from revenue. That did not. strike me as the utterance of a gentleman of an economical turn of mind. It seemed to me rather the remark of one who, rightly and properly, no doubt, sees great opportunities of doing great good by the expenditure of great sums of money; but who, not having great sums of money to spend, regrets, the loss of those great opportunities for doing great good. That is an excellent and praiseworthy frame of mind. But the taxpayers of Australia, who understand the burdens, and do not always immediately realise the benefits, of expenditure, do not regard the situation with the equanimity with which he regards it. I have no great fault to find with the Estimates, particularly as they have the advantage of being to a large extent those of the preceding Government, and therefore display on the whole Chat due regard for economy which the right honourable gentleman's remarks do not seem to promise. It is true that they provide for a number of increases. There is, for example, an increase in connection with defence expenditure. £[51,000 more is to be voted for the naval subsidy. Last year, however, we paid onlythree-fourths of the annual subsidy, so that the remaining one-fourth was returned to the States. Then there is an increase of about £[25,000 to provide for sugar bounties, in connection with a policy on which the Commonwealth deliberately embarked, for at any rate a limited period, and those who believe in that policy should be glad to see ithat the amount claimed is increasing, because that fact signifies that the area of the cane-fields cultivated by white labour is extending. There is an increase of £ 1 2 0 , 0 0 0 on last year's works expenditure, of which some £[50,000 is comprised in re-votes; and there are a number of large works, like the proposed telephone line between Melbourne and Sydney, to be undertaken.  paid for on a population basis?",29
133,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"All new works are to be for on a population basis, and I think that before we agree to them we should some reasonable assurance that they be remunerative. Then there is an inin crease of some £[40,000 in the proposals for expenditure on defence. That is largely owing to necessary expenditure in connection with the proper equipment of the forces, as to which I propose to say a word or two later on. It may, however, fairly be stated that in the Estimates about to be submitted for consideration there is no reasonablesign of extravagance or increased extravagance on the part of the Commonwealth. I have already pointed out that, as these are largely-practicall y wholly-the Estimates of the preceding Government, the last Administration and the present one must share alike in the praise or blame that may be bestowed in that connection. It is the next Estimates that we view with apprehension, because it may be that the right honourable member for Swan will still be Treasurer when the next Estimates are framed and introduced - that is, if he still remains in Australia, and does not join that party which has been so violently reprobated by the honourable member for Darwin this afternoon. In an utterance like the Budget speech of the Commonwealth, one may expect to hear from the Treasurer some definite proposals upon the great financial questions that are agitating the public mind, and I do not know whether I shall be fortunate enough on this occasion to secure the concurrence of the Treasurer, when I say that, unfortunately, he gave us no definite information on any subject.",29
134,Sir JOHNFORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"That is a matter of opinion, upon which the honourable member has a perfect right to express his view.",30
135,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I think I may be perthey intended to do? mitted, without being egotistical, to congratulate myself upon having said something that the right honourable gentleman permits me to say. In his Budget speech, he spoke about the sugar bonus. He told us in general terms that the bonus was to be extended j but he did not state for what period, and he was equally silent upon one or two other important details. It may be that the right honourable gentleman's association with the Prime Minister, who is frequently up in the clouds, has developed a little of the same nebulous state of mind in himself. He told us that we must increase our population. glowing account of Australia, her resources, her wealth, her people, and her future, combined with the fact that we were not increasing our population, and he said that by assisting immigrants with cheap passages, advances from land banks, and grants of land from the States, we should be able to increase the number of useful inhabitants of Australia. He did not tell us how far, if at all, his arrangements with the States Governments had proceeded, as to what negotiations, if any",30
136,Sir JOHN FORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,How could I do that? What time had I to do that?,30
137,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I do not suppose that the right honourable gentleman could have done so, for the very good reason that no negotiations had proceeded. A vague general statement such as he made, which has no practical work done in connection with it, is not of very much use to the Commonwealth. When the right honourable gentleman did venture to express one or two opinions, and was asked whether he was announcing the Government policy, he said that the Government had not yet considered this or that subject. The complaint I have to make about his speech, rightly or wrongly, is of-a twofold character, that, in the first place, itaroused alarm as to the probable future expenditure of the Commonwealth, more especially in connection with the significant change which has occurred in the right honourable gentleman's mind with regard to the Braddon section, and, in the second place, on those great questions of public policy, upon which the country is entitled to have definite information with regard to the attitude of the Government, no word was forthcoming.  vernment, with which the honourable and learned member was connected, tell us what",30
138,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"Because it was unfortunately cut short in the flower of its youth, just when it was about to submit a series of valuable proposals. We have our policy ready for future operations, and will unfold it when we have the opportunity we so much desired of asking the public to determine whether it is wholesome. The Treasurer also referred to ithe fact that Australia is being decried. We all agree upon that point, and, further, that it is being unjustly decried, but we must remember that we have given some foundation for the superstructure of deH e gave us a crial that has been built up. There is a little fire to cause the very large amount of smoke. Let us take the case, which occurred only the other day, of the groom who came from England to New South Wales. As, I understand the matter, that groom was engaged to comefrom London to some inland part of New South Wales under contract to deliver horses.",30
139,Sir JOHNFORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,That was done or under the Government with which the honourable and learned member was connected.,30
140,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"It was done by the Agent General' in London. The Act under which the certificate was issued was not introduced by the Government of which I was a member. I do not profess to know enough about the facts rto be able to say whether this man required an exemption certificate, but I contend that the contract labour section of the Act affords reasonable ground for any ordinary business man to assume that such a certificate was essential to enable the man to proceed with the horses to his destination. At all events, if the business man concerned made a mistake, he erred on the side of safety in procuring a certificate.  and learned member vote for that particular provision ?",31
141,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I have no objection to the principle embodied in the section. It was adopted for two specific purposes, namely, to prevent men being brought into Australia under contract to work at less than the prevailing rates of wages, and under worse conditions than the ordinary- a most wholesome object-and to prevent employers from utilizing outside labour as a means of cowing their workmen with whom they might have a difference at a time of strike, or when a strike was impending. We may reasonably hope that, in view of the extension of legislation for conciliation and arbitration throughout the States, we shall not be much troubled with this form of industrial dispute in the future. At any rate, these were the main objects which itne section was intended to serve, and I do not for a moment wish to prevent them from being maintained. I contend, however, that the section as it stands lends some colourI do not say justly so- it!o the representations of those who are evilly disposed to Australia, and affords them an opportunity of making statements which are very damaging to us. I never concurred with a great deal of the harsh criticism that was employed in connection with the six hatters' case, or with most of what was said in connection with the Petriana case. I think that the great bulk of the criticism directed at our past legislation has been unjust and unwarranted, but there is just enough foundation for it to enable those who wish to do so to still build up a number of damaging allegations, and I should like to see it made clear by legislation or administration that white people who want to come to work here under prevailing conditions, and who are not brought here irt order to confer an advantage upon one of the parties to a dispute, shall be able to do so. This should be done, so that we may not continue to leave ourselves open to the charges which have been made, however"" unjust and unfounded we may know them to be. I do not wish to see our legislation so modified as to prevent the great, important, and valuable objects to which I have referred from continuing to be carried into effect. It is largely a false impression that has been conveyed to the minds of the British public in connection with that provision, an impression that Australia has passed class legislation instead of legislation for the good of the whole community. But legislation!, such as the union trade mark provision, for instance, with all the implications that can be built upon it-as that provision stands, I think it is open to objection, but there are other implications that can be built upon it-affor d just a sufficiency of foundation for the allegations made against us, to render them difficult to answer. These facts, together with the knowledge that the Treasurer and others are compelled, by the necessities of the political situation, possibly to subordinate their own individual views in matters of this kind, and to concur in the passing of legislation that they do not in their hearts approve of, render it difficult for those who have the welfare of Australia at heart, to do what ought to be done in order to keep the name of the Commonwealth in as good odour as we should like. I desire to say a word or two with regard to the bookkeeping period in reference to which the Treasurer is reported in Hansard, at page 1213, as having said Unless some better arrangement can be madeThat is beautifully definite- a most important qualification. .1 certainly think that the only thing to do is to continue the bookkeeping period until the end of the operation of the Braddon clauseThe honourable member for Capricornia askedDo the Government intend to do that? Then the Treasurer, with the caution that characterizes him, said I am not prepared to make a definite statement on that point. He is not reported as having, said ""nor any other,"" but he might as well have said it.",31
142,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,That is statesmanship.  ments of the right honourable member for East Sydney.,31
143,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"When honourable members have to resort to tu quo que argument they are hard put to it. We have already taken a step in the direction of what we might call the true finance of Federation by charging all our expenditure in connection with works and buildings upon a population basis. That is a step of which I approve in spite of the temporary disadvantage that results to one or two States that are more-forward than others. I do not particularize the States for fear of interruption. I feel, however, that if the bookkeeping be continued either for the five years originally intended, or for a further term until the end of the period fixed for the operation of the Braddon section, or for any other period, and we make a sudden change at the end of that fixed term, from the bookkeeping to the other method, there will be great outcries. We have had a wholesome example of what can be done by proceeding gradually, instead of abruptly, in connection with the Western Australian Special Tariff'. The Tariff has been diminished year by year by one-fifth, and will disappear next year. There has been no great complaint in that connection. The fears that were at one time expressed, that the finances of Western Australia would suffer, have not been realized,, and it may be that the fact that the receipts have been greater than was anticipated has contributed to that result. In that case we have, by the use of a sliding scale, largely diminished the objection that would attach to making a sudden change, and it seems to me that we might with advantage adopt a similar principle in connection with the transition from the bookkeeping system to the more truly Federal system of finance. It is quite true that the circumstances of Western Australia are different in this respect-that the adoption of a system of expenditure upon a population basis would affect that State to its detriment, much more materially than it would any other State. I am inclined to think that the Treasurer did not overlook that fact when he declared that in his opinion the bookkeeping period should be extended for a number of years. In this connection, I. think-and I ""speak not merely from my own impressions, because I have the advantage of knowing the mind of the right honourable member for Balaclava upon the subject, and we all recognise that his opinion is wortjhy of every consideration-.that we should abolish the bookkeeping period . gradually by adopting a sliding scale extending over five years. In view of the special circumstances of Western Australia, I should be quite satisfied-althoug h she is getting advantages in other directions - to allow the sliding scale in her case to extend over a period of ten years. I feel convinced that some such method is the only one which will satisfy the public as a whole in exchanging the bookkeeping system for a - per capita method. We cannot remain upon the bookkeeping basis for ever. So long as that system continues it cannot be said that we are truly federated. At the same time, we ought to make the change gradually, and, therefore, I suggest that we should adopt a five years' sliding scale in the case of all the States except Western Australia, with a somewhat longer period in the case of that State. I should now like to say a word or two in reference to what is called the Braddon section of the Constitution. I do not know whether the Treasurer entertains the view, that that section should cease to operate at the period fixed for its expiry by the Constitution. As I have apparently misunderstood his remarks, I shall be glad to know his opinion upon the matter.",32
144,Sir JOHN FORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,-The honourable and learned member will see my view of it by reference to page 1217 of Hansard.,32
145,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"The Treasurer statedI do not see that much good can result to the States by extending the duration of the Braddon provision. It may restrict the spending powers of this Parliament, but I cannot imagine that we shall do anything to injure the people of the States. They are our constituents, and to injure them would be to injure ourselves. This Parliament will neither injure nor ignore the people o.r the StatesThat sentence means, if it means anything, that he is an advocate for not extending the Braddon section of the Constitution. ",32
146,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I do not know. When I said just now that the right honourable gentleman had expressed the opinion that the Braddon section should not be continued, he challenged the accuracy of my statement.",32
147,Sir TOHN FORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I said-as will be seen by reference to the same page-that my judgment led me in the direction of desiring to return to - the States a fixed sum annually, and that, under such conditions, there would be no necessity for a continuance of the Braddon section.",32
148,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"That would be a most delightful system for the Commonwealth to adopt, but it would not be appreciated by the States Treasurers, because the population of Australia will grow-the Government anticipate that their policy will make it increase by leaps and boundswhereas the Commonwealth contribution would remain the same.",33
149,Sir JOHNFORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I said that a fixed sum might be returned to the States, subParliament ject to periodical adjustments - i",33
150,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I understood the right honourable gentleman to propose the Canaand dian practice. We must recollect, ever, that when that system was adopted in Canada the revenue from the sources from which we derive ,£7,000,000 annually was something less than £1,000,000. That is very different state .of affairs from which obtains in the Commonwealth. We could make an arrangement in regard £1,000,000 that we could not make in gard to ,£7,000,000.",33
151,Sir JOHNFORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,To this day the Dominion Government returns so much per head to the Canadian provinces.,33
152,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"The right honourable tleman wishes to do away with the Braddon section. But I would point out that, whatearly ever authority may spend the public money, be it Commonwealth or State, the same citifor zens have to pay. That fact should be membered. I say that the people of Austions tralia rightly regard the Braddon section a check upon Federal expenditure. Fancy this Parliament with the restriction imposed tions by that section, or some other equally powerful restriction, removed from our Constitution ! Fancv the saturnalia of Federal expenditure with the Treasurer as high priest! Even he would forget to economical under such circumstances.",33
153,Sir JOHNFORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,The honourable and learned member will represent me as a very extravagant individual presently.,33

Even the right honourable gentleman himself might find it comparatively easy to achieve that result. But if anything like the remaining three-quarters of the Customs and excise revenue were available to this. Parliament there would be, a temptation to spend which we might find irresistible. We all know that in the case of Parliaments with large sums at their disposal there is a very great disposition to spend money. The spending decisions of any Legislature are nearly always limited by its spending capacity. A which, throughout a long period n the face of pressure brought to bear in favour of expending a little money here a little there-woul d virtuously. resist howthe temptation, and return to the States sums which it is under no obligation to return, is such an anomaly in modern life that we need not seriously contemplate its cona tinued existence. The fact that for some that years past the Commonwealth has been doing - this is due to the circumstance that to our actions have been scrutinized with regreat exactitude, and have had bestowed ' upon them greater attention that has ever before been bestowed upon the actions of any Parliament. Moreover, we were morally bound to return to the States as much as we could, owing to the genfact that we had fixed a limit which our expenditure was not to exceed; and in the days of the Federation we felt it incumbent upon us to give a sufficient reason every pound that we proposed to spend. reBut if we were released from the obligaimposed by the Braddon section, all as the big schemes for spending hundreds of thousands of pounds in various direc",33

I repeat that under such circumstances there would be a temptation to spend money which this Parliament would find irresistible. There must be some check upon our powers of exand the people of Australia feel the effect of the Braddon section has been If we a salutary one. The fact that we have kept within its limits is no reason for - doing away with all restriction, so that The taxpayers regard that' section as one of y their best safeguards against unnecessary There are legitimate objects upon which we could expend large sums of money if we wished to do so. In this connection I may instance the question of old-age pensions. Before I vote for that proposal, I wish to see where the money necessary to give effect to it is to come from.",33
156,Sir JOHN FORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,I hope that the honourable and learned member does not infer from anything I have said that I wish to return to the States less than has been returned to them. I desire to give them as much as I can.,34
157,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"The right honourable gentleman means that he wishes to give them as much as he can spare, which is an utterly different thing.",34
158,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,Does not the honourable and learned' member think that in regard to the iron bonus-apar t from the merits of the question altogether-w e might inquire where the money with which to pay it is to come from?,34
159,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"The Commonwealth will be in a position to pay that bonus out of its' one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue. 'We will not be required to spend; £[300,000 in one year. The Treasurer has said that in regard to the transferred Departments we ought to adopt the' system of crediting and debiting balances. At first sight it seems to be common sense that we should merely account for differences, instead of crediting and debiting the whole amount. There is no objection to that from a bookkeeping stand-point, nor is there from the stand-point of the taxpayers, if we did not expend more than we are entitled to. But if we are merely to credit and debit balances, it is only the interest the balances which will have to be appropriated out of the one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue to which the Commonwealth is entitled. On the other hand, if we credited arid debited the totals, the matter would assume a very different complexion.",34
160,Sir JOHN FORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,The honourable learned member would not impoverish the Commonwealth ?,34
161,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I do not wish monwealth to have to look around for ways in which to spend money. I do not desire it to have so much money to expend that will require to look round for a means of he did. investment. If we merely credit and debit balances in connection with transferred perties-the States debts remaining with the States, as they appear likely to do for some time-w e shall have those properties vested in a new trustee-the Commonwealth. They' leading us. will still remain the property of the taxpayers; but we. shall have the States continuing to bear the interest upon the debts out of which those public properties were erected of acquired, out of their three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue, and the Commonwealth out of its one-fourth share of that revenue will be called upon to bear only the expense of the debited and credited balances. That position would affect the States finances. The States would nominally receive back their three-fourths of the Customs and Excise receipts ; but they would really be refunded the three-fourths of that revenue less these charges. Frankly, from the point of view of a member of this Parliament, and looking at the Commonwealth capacity and powers, I say that if I considered it fair to leave the interest charges with the States, and to debit and credit only the balances, it would be much more satisfactory to one's own feeling to adopt that course. But it would not be justice.",34
162,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"Whichever method we adopt, the interest upon the transferred properties ought to come into our balance sheet.",34
163,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,The interest upon the balances would do so.,34
164,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,But we are tight up against our limit now.,34
165,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I think that the transferred properties are worth about £[10,000,000, and that the balances represent about £[1,000,000. Consequently, if we debit and credit balances only we shall have to pay out of our one-fourth of the on Customs and Excise revenue interest upon £[1,000,000; whereas, if we debit and credit totals, we shall have to pay interest upon £""10,000,000. Which is the fairer method to adopt, seeing that the States retain the debts, and the liability to pay the interest upon the loans, which have, to a large extent, been used in creating the and assets that we have taken over ?",34
166,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"If we use those properties, the interest upon them ought to the Comcome into our accounts.",34
167,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,I think so. It was the economical instinct of the Treasurer which it prompted him to make the suggestion that,34
168,Sir JOHN FORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,This House has to prosettle the matter.,34
169,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"But the Treasurer is the leader of the House in regard to financial matters, and I wish to know where he is",34
170,Sir JOHN FORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,The honourable and learned member agrees with what I desire to do.,35
171,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,I do not.,35
172,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,The right honourable gentleman is leading us right into the Ministerial corner.,35
173,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"He certainly is not doing so, although he has gone there himself, leaving two or three of us behind. not speak for some of my honourable friends on the direct Opposition benches; but the right honourable gentleman left the honourable member for Gippsland and one or two others behind as unnecessary encumbrances when he took the little journey to which I have referred.",35

176,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I was sitting in direct opposition at the time of the overthrow of the Watson Government. There is only one other matter relating to the financial side of the Budget to which I desire to refer, and that is the question of the continuation of the sugar bounty. The bounty has undoubtedly done a great deal in the direction in which it was hoped that it would produce results. Four or five years ago the quantity of white-grown sugar produced in Australia was only one-fifth of that grown by black labour; but the estimate for the coming year is that white-grown sugar will constitute one-half of the total production.",35
177,Mr MAHON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,H as not the quantity of been closed ? black-grown sugar also increased?,35
178,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,That is so; but I speaking of the proportion of white-grown sugar to black-grown sugar. Three or four years ago the output of black-grown sugar was about five times as great as that grown by white labour.,35
179,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"The point is, that the quantity of white-grown sugar is creasing, while black-grown sugar is - not decreasing.",35
180,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"We have to remember that the estimate for the coming year that the production of black-grown sugar will be only twice as great as that of the white-grown article. Previously, about per cent, of the total production grown, but now we have something like 33 per cent, of our sugar grown by white labour. The percentage shows an increase in favour of the white-grown article. Sir JOHN ,'FORREST - The estimate is about 40 per cent.",35
181,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I am merely using approximate figures. We are now asked to I canrenew the bounty. I am a protectionist, and I supported the granting of the bounty on protectionist principles, as well as on the ground that it would assist to secure a White Australia. There were other honourable members who, although free-traders, supported the proposal, because they believed that we ought to have a White Australia, and recognised that if we desired to honourable bring about that result, we must be prepared to pay something for it. So far as one is able to judge from the facts, the bounty cannot be suddenly terminated, as now provided, on ist January, 1907. Speaking as a Victorian, ®I say that there is no State in the Union which suffers more pecuniary disadvantage from the Commonwealth system of dealing with the sugar industry than does Victoria. Before Federation, Victoria had a revenue duty of jQs 5 IS l a ton on sugar, and there was only a margin of 5s. per . ton allowed by way of protection to the local refiner. Practically the Victorian duty on sugar was a revenue one. By losing a very considerable proportion of the revenue that she derived from that source, Victoria has been a financial sufferer, and has not received any corresponding direct financial gain. Still, she has no right to complain of that.  system, have not many Brisbane factories",35
182,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I have just said that Vicam toria has no right to complain, because the sugar bounty is part of the protectionist policy of - Australia, of which policy Victoria provides a considerable number of advocates; and it may be that she obtains indirectly some benefit from the system of refining now being carried on otherwise than init would have been. Nevertheless, as a N matter of pounds, shillings, and pence-as a matter affecting the public revenue-it cannot be denied that Victoria is paying is fairly heavily in this direction.",35
183,Mr MCWILLIAMS,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,And the fruit16 growers of Victoria are paying fairly was whiteheavily for the system.,35
184,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"That is so. I am acquainted with a number of fruit-growers who live near me, and they may also be. affected to Some extent by the present systemIt is clear, however, from the figures that have been quoted by the Treasurer, that the quantity of black-grown sugar is still far ahead of the white-grown article, and that if we suddenly terminated' the bounty, much injury would be done to the Queensland sugar-growers. We should extend the bounty. I do not recollect whether the Treasurer mentioned the extension proposed by the Government.",36
185,Sir JOHNFORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,An extension of five years.,36
186,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"H u m a n nature is human nature all the world over. That is so even of protectionist human nature, which is purest form of which I know. If we exhonorable tended the bounty as it stands it would be justly said at the end of that period, "" The'^Parliament must not suddenly abolish it . "" It seems to me that we must once more resort to the device of the slideconomies. ing scale-a device which has always proved successful in connection with the introducable tion of changes. I notice that able member for South Sydney suggested yesterday that the bounty should be tended on a sliding scale, and I think I able also to say that the right honourable form me. member for Balaclava holds the same view. If we extend the bounty-no t necessarily for five years; I should be prepared to tend it for a further period, if that were he learns. essential-w e must provide for its payment on a sliding scale, so that it will disappear automatically, instead of merely by the fluxion of time, or by the passing of an Act on this point. of Parliament. When a measure of that kind becomes necessary, the pressure that is brought to bear and the good case that can be made out for an extension make it exceedingly difficult to'say "" N I again urge upon the Government that they should consider the advisableness ""of bringcesses. ing, not only the book-keeping period, the system of granting the sugar bounty, to a termination by means of a sliding scale. If it be desired to continue the bounty another year or two at the present rate, because the growers have been led to« justly hope for such an extension, let us enact that for two years it shall continue at the prewas sent rate, but shall then disappear by sliding scale extending over five, or even seven years. If the bounty be diminished year by year, the force of the blow will not be felt, by any one as it would be if the whole system were suddenly abolished. I"" commend' this suggestion to the serious con-' sideration of the Government, believing that it will provide the most satisfactory solution of the difficulty. I desire now to say a few words on the question of the defence vote and our defence policy. As honourable members know, this is a subject in which I have taken a deep interest for a long time, and to which I have devoted as much attention as I could possibly give to it. I am very sorry to see that the Estimates for the current year, as submitted, are lessalthough it is only by a thousand or twothan were the Estimates for the last financial year.",36

"" those now before us, has been arrived at It has l>een achieved by two simple proThere has been no alteration so far but as I can see in a single proposed appropriation for stores, or in respect of one man in the force. The Defence Estimates, as for I prepared them, made provision for 1,500 men more than were provided for in the Estimates of the previous year, at an increased cost of something like £[6,000. This possible only by the economies to which a the right honourable gentleman has referred - by scrutinizing every item, from beginning to end, of the Defence Estimates, which is no light task, and by cutting offeven a £[5 note where that saving could be effected. I personally went through every item in the Estimates of my Department, and the proposal for an increase of 1,500, to a large extent in the forces of Tasmania, was the result of an arrangement which I thought would be satisfactory to that State, after the difficulty of a year or two ago. But the Government, while professing to make this increase in the strength of the forces without increasing the Defence Estimates, have reallyi effected the so-called economies by saying that the increase shall not take place "" until ist January, 1906.""",36

204,Sir JOHN FORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"Some weeks of the current financial year have already passed, and it seems that the Estimates will not. have been finally dealt with much before January next.",37
205,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"Then the right honourable gentleman will be able to do this year what the Defence Department did last year. In the month\ of Februarv I had a chat with my colleague, the right honourable member for Balaclava, who was 'then Treasurer; and we came to the conclusion that we could save £ 4 5 , 0 0 0 on the Defence expenditure. Having arrived at that decision, we promptly appropriated the £[45,000 to make good arrears in the purchase of special' warlike stores. But until these Estimates are at any rate authorized, the Department will not be able to move hand or foot in the direction of securing more men before ist January next.",37

237,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I can assure the right not honourable gentleman, from the practical attend knowledge of the working of the Department which I possess, that it does.",38
238,Sir JOHNFORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,I disagree with the honourable and learned member.,38
239,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"That is . 'a misfortune which I shall bear with such philosophy as I possess. I do not wish to discuss the deuntails of the Defence Estimates today, but had I desire to say a few words about what, in my opinion, the defence policy of Australia should be; to give reasons why a certain the policy should be followed; and to show how far Australia is carrying out that policy. I been have no quarrel at all with those who urge that our main defence should be on the sea. I agree entirely that our real defence against the permanent occupation of our country by any enemy is the fact that we are a part of the British Empire, and are protected by the British Navy. If by some misfortune we became separated from the British Empire tomorrow, we should be the helpless prey of any of the great powers, supposing that we had honourable no one to come to our assistance. That is certain and definite. Our security depends on the existence and central control of the Imperial Navy, and upon the fact that, with central control, the Imperial Navy can be moved as a whole, or in parts, to the points of danger, where its naval supremacy may be threatened. So long as its naval supremacy can be challenged, the challenge gencan be met only by that single control. The of an Australian Navy, unless it were. equal in strength to the navies of at least a the second-rate naval powers of the world, We would be no substantial protection to the be Commonwealth, apart from the navy of the Empire. We in Australia, as .a portion of the Empire, are bound to recognise our obligations to it in connection with naval defence. We do so aX the present time by a contribution of some £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum. H a d we plenty of money, that would not be a contribution proportionate to the benefits we receive; but it is a contribution roughly proportionate to our capacity to pay. There are other methods of expenditure, which are more urgent, not only from the Australian, but also from, the Imperial, point of view, to which we should therefore resort before increasing our Imperial contribution, always bering that we are not paying our fair share. Australia, although in one sense a source of weakness because' of her remoteness from the centre of the Empire, may be made a considerable source of strength to the Empire. We are set here in the South Pacific, and the events of the recent RussoJapanese war- I am sure that every one is glad to be able now to speak of it as recent - hav e shown that storm centres may arise in the Pacific just as they may arise in the Atlantic or in the North Sea. I am not going to discuss where the great war is to take place. There are different schools of thought on the subject; but it is clear, from what we have seen recently, and from the fact that foreign nations have acquired, and are acquiring, naval bases and fortified coaling, stations in the southern seas, that Australia is no longer remote from the theatre of the world's wars, as we were half-a-century, or even a shorter period of time, ago. The increased rapidity of communication between distant countries which has come about by the use of fast steam vessels, has decreased our distance from the world's centres; but, in addition to that, as you, Mr Chairman, pointed out recently in another debate, when we look at the map of the South Pacific, and see that we are within striking distance of the naval stations of various foreign powers, we must realise that Australia is no longer that outlying and, consequently, protected portion of the world that it once was. Our duty to the Empire is, in some respects, what the duty of the outpost of an army is, and demands that we should make these advanced positions safe. We should be able to say to the mother land, "" On the high seas you must continue to be our defence for a considerable time to come, as you have been in the past, though our financial circumstances do not permit us to pay you in proportion to the benefits which we receive, nor do we think it strategically wise to substitute for the Imperial' Navy an Australian sea-going navy under independent command. Still, so far as our shores are concerned, we are ready to protect our centres of commercial l if e . "" In Australia these commercial centres are practically all on the sea coast, and, so far as commerce is concerned, the country is one huge littoral, having practically no interior, because almost the whole of its trade is carried on close to the coast. We should be able to say to the Empire, remem- "" We will protect ourselves, so far as our commercial interests are con-v cerned"" - and these are Australian chiefly, and only indirectly Imperial interests - "" and will provide what the Imperial and any other navy requires, secure naval bases to which it can resort whenever occasion demands."" No fleet is of any use, be it the greatest fleet in the world, unless it can found its operations on secure bases. If there is one lesson which recent naval wars have taught-the Spanish-American war and the just-ended Russo-Japanese war - ' it is that 'fleets cannot operate unless they know that they have behind them bases to which they can retreat, and where they will be secure.' We, in Australia, can make our naval bases secure. But we have not done so yet. So far as any blame is attachable to me for inaction in this matter during the short time. I was in office, I am prepared to accept it. But we can do what I speak of. If any struggle, in which the E m pire was engaged, was so great that British naval supremacy was seriously, threatened, the Australian Navy which' every penny of the Commonwealth revenue could raise"" and support, would not count very largely. It is only in the case of British naval supremacy being seriously threatened that our coasts would be likely to be denuded for a time of Imperial protection. That is a fact which we must always bear in mind, putting on one side a matter to which' I shall now alludethe occasional raids that may be expected from escaping cruisers of the enemy. In the event of the whole of the British fleet being drawn away for a time to meet some great crisis, we must arrange to meet the possibility of an enemy's cruisers coming along our shores and raiding our towns. But if the crisis is so great that the whole of the British fleet must be called away to meet it, I am inclined to think that the whole of the enemy's fleet will also be called away.",38
240,Mr HUTCHISON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,An enemy's vessels could not get enough coal to enable them to come here.,40
241,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"Foreig n powers are acquiring coaling ports in the South Pacific, and I can quite conceive of circumstances under which Australia's best defence would be to convey in transports our land forces, and make descents upon certain harbors in the South Pacific, which occur to all, and which I need not mention now. Such circumstances would provide an occasion on which Australian troops might well operate beyond Australia, not for Imperial defence, but for purely Australian defence, and such occasions must be borne in mind. That is one of the reasons, though there are many others, why we must have what is called a field force in Australia. But I do not wish to anticipate. We must provide not only for the security of our naval bases, and for the protection of our centres of commercial life, but also for the security of coaling ports for trading ships, and ships of war. We must provide secure harbors of refuge for the shipping that may have temporarily to shelter there. All these things not only can, but should be done by Australia, so that she may do her share in Imperial defence. I press this point because sometimes at the other side of the world, in the old country, and even on this side of the water, there are those who suggest that we should do away with all these means of defence, and rely solely on the Imperial Navy. That is a mistake. To develop Australia as a part of the Empire, the public must have reasonable security, a reasonable belief that they are reasonably safe against attacks that may be reasonably apprehended. That is a duty which we can perform. What kind of attacks, I ask, are we likely to have to meet? As I have already said, invasion by a large army for the purpose of permanently occupying Australia. I put aside, not as beyond the bounds of our possibility to conceive, but beyond the bounds of our possibility to meet, apart from Imperial protection. Although we could give an enemy a prettylively time before he finally subdued Australia, he could take possession of our coastal settlements and could smash us up so far as our development was concerned. Still, I do not think anything of that kind is likely to occur; although cur sole dependence against any such contingency is our Imperial connection. Then we may have raids in greater or less strength, flying raids by sea attack only, or, what I venture to think is much more likely, flying raids by sea, accompanied by small land attacks. History has shown that in no cases have bombardments been anything to bother about; at any rate, not the short bombardments that an enemy's cruisers could indulge in on Australian shores, because they could not afford to throw away their ammunition. But, further than that, the best provision we could have against the bombardment of most of our Australian ports would be good fire brigades. I would sooner have a series of good fire brigades than a strong military force at the time of a bombardment. I have noticed that fears have been expressed that an"" enemy's cruisers might lie off, say, Manly, and bombard the city of Sydney; but, if I may be permitted to do so, I would advise the residents of Sydney not to sleep any the less soundly on account of that fear. All the damage that an enemy is likely to succeed in doing could be cheeked by the exertions of an efficient fire brigade, and very little compensation would have to be paid for chance loss incurred by the owners of private property. A bombardment by a hostile cruiser would not result in any harm worth speaking of. History tells us also that combined attacks on fortified ports by sea and land-by the front door and the back door-ar e the only effective operations. The honourable member for Wentworth expressed a fear lest an enemy's cruisers might come along carrying torpedo boats, with the idea of making a raid at night by the means of the smaller vessels. He argued, therefore, that our fixed defences should be placed in a satisfactory state. I would go further than he does, and say that our harbour defences ought to be made satisfactory, and that at some of our harbors fixed defences alone are not sufficient. In Port Phillip, for instance, we must have some floating defences in addition to fixed defences. I do not suggest that the Cerberus should be re-armed, as although £[2,000 has been placed on the Estimates for that purpose. That sum Was included in the Estimates before I had left office pending certain investigation. Before I left office, I wrote a minute, stating that the investigation referred to had proved that the money should not be spent in that direction, but in some other manner.  learned member vote sgainst that appropriation being made?",40
242,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"Certainly. event of no other honourable member taking action, I shall move that the item be struck out. We must have our land defences, in which I include movable land forces, whether, they be called field or garrison forces, as well as our fixed defences. Movable land forces would comprise infantry, mounted troops, field artillery, and various other corps, such as engineers, transport corps, army service corps, and so on. Pixed defences consist of big guns, and of quick-firing guns, the latter being required to meet torpedo attacks,, twelve-pounders being recognised as the proper class of guns to use for the purpose. The fixed defences would also include something that we have not yet properly provided, namely, a proper electric light equipment, including movable search-lights and fixed beams. All these things will have to be done before we shall have fulfilled that elementary duty to the Empire and to ourselves of which I spoke at an earlier stage. General Hutton when he two or three years ago propounded a scheme for the constitution of the best force for the purpose of defending the Commonwealth. I shall speak in round figures, because; I do not wish, to bother honourable members with details. He proposed that the land forces should have a peace strength of 26,000 men, and a war strength of 40,000. The 40,000 men were to be used as garrison troops and field forces. number of criticisms have been directed against field forces on the ground that they are intended to be used to take part in Imperial wars elsewhere. That is an entirely new idea, and nothing of the kind is contemplated. In 1894, the States Commandants, in conference, recommended that garrison and field forces should be maintained. As a matter of. fact, we have always had them, although they have not been so called. In 1901, the Commandants recommended the maintenance of field and garrison forces, and the Colonial Defence Committee has approved of the division into garrison and field forces. Although the Committee has been attacked by many persons, its opinion is worth a good deal. When he came here in 1902, Major-General Hutton advocated that we should have field and garrison forces, adopting a view [58] that had been already approved assound. I think that all those who. expressed this view w.ere right, and I In the believe I know the reasons that actuated, them. Although the States of Australia, are united in the Commonwealth, and a l though one of the avowed objects for which we were united was to perfect our defences, the fact of our political union does not alter the strategical considerations that have to be taken into account when arranging for the defence of Australia. We have an extensive coastline, our great cities are situated on the coast, and our population is small. Our great cities are situated at a considerable distance from each other, and as any attack that we may reasonably apprehend will be sudden but' not lasting in its character, we must maintain as near to the possible points of attack - leavin g out of consideration manv minor places that will have to take their chances without having any provision made for their defence",41
243,Mr CARPENTER,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"We shall need the transcontinental railway to enable us to do that. Major- Mr MCCAY - That will affect only in was here degree and not in kind the point to which I am referring. We shall have to maintain comparatively near to our most vulnerable points forces sufficient, at. anv rate, to repel a first attack. After that we mav rely upon reinforcements being despatched as the enemy's attack is developed. An enemy can choose his own point of attack. We cannot know at what point he will approach us until he has actually arrived A there. Then when he develops his attack reinforcements will be sent to the aid of the forces stationed at that particular spot. That is why we must maintain near to our main ports, our harbors, our coaling stations, and our commercial centres forces of garrison troops, and also forces of greater mobilifcv which can. be moved readily from spot to spot, and which may be fairly called field forces. It does not matter what name is applied to these forces. We may call them the first and second lines of defence, the A and B forces, or we may use the terms, employed in the wargame, of red troops and blue troops. But by: whatever names the forces may be known, it is imperative that we should have the garrison forces in the immediate neighbourhood of our most vulnerable points, and also movable forces which can be transferred from point to point as occasion may require. That is why we need a much larger force than, in one sense, our population, would seem to demand. Some people say 40,000 soldiers, consisting of horse, foot, and artillery, would be more than sufficient to deal with any force they would be called upon to encounter. I entirely agree that we are not likelv to have to meet 40,000 or even the half of that number of an enemy ; but it is because the enemy can attack us at whatever point he may choose, and because we shall have to meet him in equal or superior force at whatever point he may land that we require a comparatively large number of men. We are compelled, for strategical reasons, to maintain that force. Now, I wish to speak of that other branch of our defences to which the honourable member for Wentworth chiefly devoted his attention, namely, our fixed defences. that subject the honourable member speaks with a great deal of weight, because I confess that I have always felt that if I could meet his criticisms I should be able to go a long way in the right direction. The honourable member makes speeches upon our defences that are entitled to consideration by any honourable member who is interested in the subject. It is quite true, as was mentioned by the honourable member for Darwin, that armaments are continually changing; but the honourable member drew from that fact the novel conclusion that we should not have any armament. With that view I do not agree. He wishes us to wait until we reach the final result of the development of modern weapons before we proceed to arm our forts. I can assure the honourable member that when that time arrives he will have no further interest in weapons of any kind. Armaments are continually changing. Since tlvs Commonwealth came into existence the whole idea-in the Navy at any rate-wit h regard to the calibre of big guns has changed. The 6-inch gun was a few years ago the main weapon used in.naval .armament, and was also the chief gun of position. That idea has now been entirely changed, and the naval authorities are beginning to regard 6-inch guns as already belonging to the past. ments of our forts at present consist mainly of 6-inch guns. Sir JOHN .FORREST - Thos e are the guns to be mounted at Fremantle.",41
244,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"There are to be two guns and two 6-inch guns. It is perfectly right that we should have 6-inch guns addition to others, and there is. a very reason why 6-inch guns should be placed in position at Arthur's Head, instead of 7""5 guns, because the fort is not big enough for weapons of the larger calibre. It is well understood that there must be a certain distance between the guns, and that the larger the guns the greater the space required. Ideas with regard to armament are continually changing, and if we were to keep on re-arming our Australian forts as developments occurred, to keep them up to date, probably reaching the stage at which we should require to purchase 12-inch guns, we should have to spend about £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum upon big guns alone. We cannot possibly afford to do that, and, moreover, it is not necessary for the reason that our Australian forts are less likely than are the forts in' any other part of the Empire Upon to have to engage in long encounters with a hostile squadron. Any engagements will probably be short and sharp, whether they, prove decisive or otherwise.  learned member does not mean that we should not have the best armaments.",42
245,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"Certainl y not; but I contend that we cannot afford to spend, all our money upon armaments for our forts to the neglect of other necessities. We must keep on re-arming our forts all round our coasts asopportunity offers. For instance, supposing we start at Fremantle, we shall eventually reach Sydney, and by the time we ha\e finished at Sydney we shall probably have to recommence at' Fremantle. That is exactly what is being done. Fremantle is being armed with reasonably good guns, and the fort there will be, for its size, the best equipped in Australia. It is being urmed with mark 7 6-inch guns, and the verybest and latest mark of 7*5 gun. My intention was that we should pass by Adelaide because it is an open question how far forts in St. Vincent's Gulf are of any value. At any rate, 6-inch guns will do there, whilst they have only 6-inch guns in several other forts. The port that most requires an improvement in its defences is The arma- Melbourne, and after that has been attended to Sydney should be re-armed with bigger guns. We have one necessity at all our forts, namely, that the quick-firing armament against torpedo attack should be improved, and it is the duty of the Govern7-5 ment to consider whether the necessary weapons should not be included in their in purchase of special war-like stores. good Major-General Hutton proposed to expend £[525,000 in order to place the equipment of our forts upon a war footing. We thought at the time that that amount would cover everything. I wish that it would. Apart from anything mentioned in Major-General Hutton's scheme, I have a little list comprising items which involve an expendiand ture of £ 8 0 0 , 0 0 0 .",42
246,Sir JOHNFORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,U p o n whose recomdant's mendation is that estimate based?,43
247,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,I take the responsibility for these figures.,43
248,Sir JOHN FORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,They founded upon the opinions of any expert?,43
249,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"Oh , yes; there are expert opinions behind them. But I am putting these figures forward as my own opinions at the present time. Major-General Hutrequired ton's scheme involved an expenditure of £ 5 2 5 , 0 0 0 . In 1903-4, £[97,000 was under that scheme; in 1904-5, £.138,000; and for 1905-6, it is proposed to expend £154,000 . But in 1904-5, in addition to the items appearing in Major-General HutThen ton's scheme, £[36,000 was expended upon things which were absolutely necessary, cluding £[22,000 for material for small arms ammunition. Upon assuming office Minister of - Defence, I found that whilst we had a satisfactory reserve of small arm's ammunition, and whilst, over a given riod, we provided cordite for making good the ordinary consumption, we did not vide the shells in which to put the cordite, the caps to fire it, and the bullets. therefore spent £[22,000 upon those terials. We also expended £[2,000 upon £[14,000. ammunition for the gun mounted at H o bart. Major-General Hutton's scheme did not. include ammunition for all the field artillery, and a further sum of £[7,000 was spent in that direction. Then there was an item of £[5,000 for naval expendiabandon ture.",43
250,Mr HUTCHISON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,Major-Genera l Hutwhole ton does not seem to have been too capable.,43
251,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"He did not include everyanything thing in his scheme; but it is only just him to say that from a perusal of his rethat ports one can discover what is wanted. H was a very capable man, and rendered great service to the Commonwealth. In spite of any differences that we may have had him, there is no doubt that he defence system upon sound lines in many respects.",43
252,Mr MCWILLIAMS,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"He required just little more tact. """,43
253,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I am not going to say anything derogatory to him. In 1905-6, it is proposed to expend upon matters which are not included in Major-General Hutton's scheme the sum of £ 2 7 , 0 0 0 ; most of it here, upon the two 7.5 guns at Fremantle, the balance upon naval items. Honourable members will see that apart from the ^525,000 involved in the late Commanscheme, there was spent last year, and is included in these Estimates, a further sum of £ 6 3 , 0 0 0 . In one of his reports Major-General Hutton pointed out that no are not provision had been made for the ammunition supply column, which will cost £ 4 0 , 0 0 0 . That column is absolutely essential to any force which may take the field. Then there is a certain quantity of big-gun ammunition which will cost £ 7 0 . 0 0 0. We also need storage accommodation for the stores spent which we are purchasing, and this will entail a further outlay of not less than £[40,000. All these matters were pointed out by the late General Officer Commanding. if our forces take the field, we shall have to provide them with blankets and inclothing, which will cost £[250,000. That expenditure, however, can be deferred until as the emergency arises. Then we must recollect that our big guns in fixed defences are not placed there for all time. They must be pereplaced from time to time with more modern weapons, just as a rifle needs to probe replaced. Then we want a number of other things, such as torpedo-boats in We Port Phillip, booms, &c. Our electric malight equipment will cost £[13,000 or We wish to retain our submarine mines till we have secured efficient substitutes for them in the shape of booms and torpedo-boats which are thoroughly equipped. In this connection I may mention that the British Admiralty intends to the use of submarine mines, but not until it has replaced them by torpedoboats and booms. In order to re-arm the of our force with modern guns, we shall require to incur an expenditure of from £[300,000 to £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 , acto cording to the extent to which we go. So before we put Australia in the position e of being able to discharge her duty to herself and the Empire-apar t from the protection which is afforded by the Imperial with Navy-w e must spend some hundreds of started our thousands of pounds.",43
254,Mr WEBSTER,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,At what does the hona orable and learned member estimate the total expenditure ?,43
255,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"Leavin g out of consideration the £250,000 for blankets and clothing, we should require to spend at least £[600,000. Then, again, we need artillery ranges. Our field artillery will never be what it might be, with the men we have at our command, until we secure proper artillery ranges-range s which extend, not over a couple of thousand yards, and upon which target practice may be had, but ranges over which ithe artillerymen can manoeuvre. Artillery manoeuvring is just as essential nowadays as is artillery firing practice, and we measure artillery ranges, not by acres, but by square miles.",44
256,Mr WATSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,In New South Wales recently the National Park was used for that purpose.,44
257,Sir JOHN FORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"At - the end of the current year we shall have spent a large Further, sum upon special armament.",44
258,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"The £[600,000 to which long I have referred is exclusive of the expendidelivery ture outlined in the whole of Major-General Hutton's scheme. If we spent every penny that is provided upon the current year's Estimates, an expenditure of £[136,000 would still be required to complete scheme.",44
259,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"If that amount were expended, would the items be non-recurring ones?",44
260,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,Not altogether. Some of those items will be continually recurring.,44
261,Sir JOHN FORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,We are getting what we require gradually.,44
262,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I am not proposing that we should expend the whole of the money in one year and out of revenue. Of equipment course, I recognise that any Minister suming charge of the Defence Department at the time of the year that Senator Playgarrison ford took office, must accept the Estiment mates of his predecessor. Consequently, any blame is to be attached to the Defence Estimates, it is attachable to me, and to my successor, because they are my Estiprogress. mates rather than his. When I joined Reid-MCLean Administration, I was faced with the position that Major-General ton's scheme was only half completed. against that'fact, there was an urgent neceswhich sity-it was a choice of evils, because had not the money necessary to accomnowhere plish everything-for the instalment of twelve-pounder quick-firing guns and the electric light at our forts, To effect installations at all our forts would have about £[70,000. We could not undertake that work at Sydney or Melbourne without doing similar work at Fremantle and Brisbane.",44
263,Mr WEBSTER,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,The honourable and learned member means that it could not all be done at once.,44
264,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"It would require an expenditure of £[70,000 to equip our forts with electric light and quick-firers.",44
265,Mr WEBSTER,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,Why cannot we undertake'that work?,44
266,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,Simpl y because we cannot buy 30s. worth of material for £[1.,44
267,Mr WEBSTER,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,The honourable and learned member has stated that we could not undertake work at one place without carrying out similar work at others.,44
268,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"It is not impossible, but it is not desirable to do so. we need to order guns in considerable numbers, because it takes as to get two delivered as it does to obtain of twenty, and a long period is usually occupied in securing their delivery. I repeat that when I assumed office the position in regard to Major-General Hutton's scheme was that nothing had been that completed by the votes of 1903-4 and 1904-5. The votes proposed .for the current year will, to a large extent, complete that scheme. For instance, the vote for accoutrements will complete the accoutrements for the field force upon a war establishment; that for saddles will complete the equipment of the light-horse upon a peace establishment; the vote for the field artillery will bring us within twelve of our total number of guns, and will complete the of sixty out of seventy-two guns. asIn the same way, the vote for camp equipment will complete the equipment of the force; and that for medical equipwill complete the equipment of the if field force upon a peace establishment. Every one of these votes wjll practically not complete some work which was ""already in Now, if modern wars have the taught anything, it is that it is not the . largest army, or that imbued with the Hutgreatest patriotism, which wins, but the As army which contains the best leaders, and is the best equipped in time of peace. we Finding the equipment of our forces complete, I felt that it was the mv business to get these things rounded off during the present year. I believe that these we shall be far more likely to accomplish cost good in that way than by adopting any other method. That is why I preferred to undertake this work, instead of, for instance, mounting quick-firing guns to resist a torpedo attack. I did not want Australia to be cursed with a system of incompleteness by beginning a second work before the first had been, finished. The provision made upon these Estimates will bring us to a point at which many of the proposals included in Major-General Hutton's scheme are practically complete, so far as equipment is concerned. We have not the money to accomplish everything in one year. My idea was that we should be able to say, "" Now that this work is complete, we may turn our attention to another.""",44
269,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,A great deal of that incompleteness is due to the omissions from Major-General Hutton's report.,45
270,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"-It is not owing to anything, except that we could spend only a certain sum in each year. In the first year we could not finish any of the works outlined, and in the second year we could not complete everything. The Treasurer seems to entertain the idea that there is some magic in increasing the number of rifles. I have no desire to see the members of rifle clubs hampered in any way, but I ask the Government not to be induced to purchase more rifles whilst they have not sufficient equipment for the number of men whom our present stock of rifles would supply. We have in the Commonwealth magazine rifles for every man in the Australian forces upon a war establishment. There are 40,000 troops in the Commonwealth upon a war footing, 9,000 of whom do not require rifles, and we have 35,000 magazine rifles available, including 5,000 of the new service short weapon, as to the superiority of which there appears to be some doubt, although the War Office is adopting them, and they have been given to our light horse. We have the rifles to equip the forces on a war footing; but let us put them on a war footing in other respects before we think of buying stands of thousands of rifles. have them all in time. Do you remember, Mr Chairman, what Wolseley said of the American Civil W a r : that a completely equipped army corps of 35,000 men properly led could have won on either side. And yet we know that there were hundreds of thousands of men engaged in that war. We must have our forces completely equipped. A small completely equipped force is better than a large one incompletely equipped. - To say, "" Here are 10,000 men and 10.000 rifles; fill your pockets, men, with ammunition, and God bless you,"" would be to show an utterly mistaken conception of what is required. It is not from the possession of tens of thousands of trained halfequipped men that success will come; but rather from a thoroughly equipped force, whatever be its size. We have 40,000 men set up as the standard for the war strength of our garrison and field forces. Let us see that they are completely equipped before we do anything more.",45
271,Sir JOHNFORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,The men whom we sent to South Africa did not have much training.,45
272,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"Quite so, and it was the lack of training which caused them to be less valuable than they would otherwise have been. _ Sir JOHN FORREST - But still their services were valuable.",45
273,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"""Undoubtedly . I am suggesting not that a man with a rifle is of no value, but that a completely equipped force is better than an ill-equipped one. It was those contingents which' consisted of officers and men with little training that did harm to the name of Australia in South Africa, so far as the attacks upon it were justified. A disciplined, well-trained, wellequipped body of men, led by tirained leaders, can do far more than can a much' larger body of untrained imperfectly equipped men. With a small number of well-equipped trained troops, I should be prepared to meet, without any fear, a large body of undisciplined unequipped men, and I urge the Government to carry out the suggestion I have made. The next step to. take will be to secure quick-firing guns and search-lights for our fixed defences.",45
274,Mr KELLY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,We certainly need cordite ammunition for the quick-firing guns.,45
275,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"When I took office as Minister of Defence, I found that guns had been ordered without ammunition. That is one reason why I had to spend Let us £[7,000 on ammunition for the field guns, and also £[1,800 on ammunition, for the 6-inch gun for Hobart-althoug h that gun was a transfer from South' Australia. I ordered twenty-four field guns, as well as two or three big guns, and in each case I also ordered a proper complement of ammunition, so that when the guns arrived the ammunition should also be forthcoming. In estimating the price of a gun, it is necessary to include the cost of its proper complement of ammunition, and it is for this reason that I say that the twelve pounders will cost £2,000, instead of about £[1,200 each. The proposed vote for special warlike stores was fixed at a certain amount. I need not say that the late Treasurer did not give me a free hand. provided £[180,000 for this purpose, and I trust that it will all be spent. If it is expended on the items specified, I trust the Treasurer, instead of seeking to save the money, will expend it on other stores-such, for example, as twelvepounders for our fixed. defences-that we can obtain from England. That would be. the right thing to do. It must be remembered that these items do not come under Major-General Hutton's scheme. We also require a floating harbour defence in some of our ports. It may be that we shall require torpedo boats, as well as torpedoes to be fired from fixed positions shore. We need booms, and possibly we may require submersibles or submarines, but I have very grave doubts on that point. I do not think that submersibles or submarines would be desirable adjuncts to our defences. They can be used only against a fixed mark, and an enemy is unlikely to stay long enough at any one spot to afford us that fixed mark. not wish to discuss at the present time any of the details of the Estimates, although no doubt a number of questions will be raised at the proper time, and I hope then to be able to say something about them. I have endeavoured to explain to the Committee why I think that the proper development of Australian defence is in the direction of providing a thorough equipment for our land forces, whose war strength is, about 40,000 strong, and of thoroughly equipping our forts, with the addition of auxiliary' floating harbour, defences. This is essential to enable Australia to discharge her duty to herself and her duty to the of which I spoke earlier this afternoon. Desirable as it will be to have some vessels for the protection, at any rate, of our coastal trade in time of emergency-and I would remind honourable members that if the contingency comes, these vessels to be of any service must be placed under the orders of the officer commanding the Imperial Squadron-if we wish Australia to launch out on what is called an Australian Navy, we must first complete the work I have indicated. The inevitable dilemma on the horns of which the advocates of a partial Australian Navy find themselves is Mr MCCay. that that navy must, when the pinch comes, obey the orders of one central authority. .",45
276,Mr WEBSTER,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,Would the honourable member advise that we should not tram I our-men for the navy?,46
277,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"The present Estimates not provide for an increase of nearly 30 per that cent, in the naval forces-for an inactually crease of 200 on 600 or 700 men. I certainly wish to see our Australian sailors trained, but I desire to warn the Committee, if I may be permitted to do so, that, in view of the scheme which is now being developed, there is a definite object to be attained, and that if we leave that scheme to start on another, we shall not be able to complete it within a reason-able time. We shall not be doing our duty by abandoning a scheme which we can comon plete within a reasonable time. When we have our naval bases, our coaling ports, our harbors of refuge, and our centres of commercial and industrial life quite safe, so that from those safe points our fleet, or the Imperial Squadron, may move out to strike the enemy, secure in the knowledge of a safe point of retreat if it be required, and that our coastal shipping and I do our oversea trading vessels will be safe in harbors where they may temporarily lie up in case a great emergency arises-and it would only be in time of great emergency that this condition of affairs would ariseit will be our duty to see how we can best develop a navy of our own. But until Australia chooses to maintain such a navy that it can meet other navies without Imperial assistance, I shall decline to support a proposal in that direction. I shall decline to do without the Imperial assistance and the assurance that is provided by our living under the Imperial flag. But our harbors and our coastal and sea-borne commerce, and the commerce apEmpire proaching our shores are proper objects for Commonwealth protection, so far as seagoing ships, cruisers, and so forth can insure their protection. That is the object at which'we should aim. I appeal, however, to the Committee not to leave one thing unfinished to begin another. The proper development is that which I have outlined. No nation ever developed into a great maritime power without first making herself safe on land - without making a secure launching point from which her naval power might proceed.  ber going to make any suggestion as to ways and means?",46
278,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I hold that we cannot do all this out of revenue, and I have strong objections to the Commonwealth becoming a borrowing community. frankly, however, that we need to get promptly into a proper position, so as to be able to develop Australian defence in the way that it ought to be. That cannot be done with the small sums that are available year by year for such a purpose. It seems to me, therefore, that the only way in which we can deal with the matter is to take the bull by the horns and to say clearly that we wish to secure a good start. We have not yet got it. Let us obtain the necessarymoney by the issue of, say, Treasury-bills, repayable in the course of five or ten years. I should certainly have this expenditure covered by the revenue of the next ten years at the outside. Let us acknowledge that there is a good deal that has to be done. I have not yet said much about the naval side of the question, but I do not wish it to be thought that I am hostile to the suggestion that we should have Australian-owned ships or Australian sailors. As a matter of fact, I am not. I am simply urging that these proposals should not be taken out of their order.",47
279,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"H as the honourable and learned member made any financial 1 forecast ? ' Mr MCCAY - Includin g the cost of supplies not yet ordered under Major-General Hutton's scheme, the outlay will be about £[800.000. I think it is desirable that should say frankly, "" We will discount a admission. bill for £800,000 , or a smaller sum, if it be found possible. We will discount the bill, whatever it is, and pay back the money by vals of eight or ten years. instalments during the next eight or years."" We should then have our defences on a proper footing, and would be able to continue on 'a less expenditure would otherwise be necessary.",47
280,Mr CHANTER,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,Coul d we not make this provision by retaining the whole of our one-fourth of Customs revenue?,47
281,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,No ; I have the taxpayer in mind. If we expended the whole of revenue the States would have to make good the difference by some other means.,47
282,Mr CHANTER,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,The position would be the same if we borrowed the money.,47
283,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,But one may borrow and repay it by ten instalments of 2 s. each.,47
284,Mr HUTCHISON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,If life and property member for Corinella. need this protection the people must pav for it.,47
285,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I am merely expressing my view that the taxpayers of the Commonwealth cannot affordi to at once incur I say this expenditure; they cannot afford to pay £ 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 this year, and another £ 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 next year for any such purpose as special warlike stores and guns.",47
286,Mr WEBSTER,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,We might have secured these stores when we had a larger surplus to return to the States.,47
287,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"4 then had no direct responsibility; but I always bear in mind the fact that it is the taxpayers themselves who have to provide this money, and that the Treasurer does not obtain it from some mysterious unknown stream. We have to take the bull by the horns, and recognise that we must spend this substantial sum within the next year or two. The only suggestion that I have to make is that we should provide the money by means of short-dated Treasury-bills - or whatever particular form of obligation it is proposed to incur-and redeem them by annual instalments out of the Commonwealth revenue. I should not leave these annual instalments to the mercy of the annual Estimates, but at the same time as the money was provided would pass an Act appropriating revenue for this purpose for a given time.",47
288,Mr HENRY WILLIS,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,The guns would have to be replaced before the whole of the money was repayable. The honourable we and learned member himself made that,47
289,Mr MCCAY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"It will be unnecessary to replace the guns more often than at interWhat I ten said was that if the idea were developed, we might have to make changes. I have spoken at much greater length than than I had intended, but the subject of defence is one in which I take a deep interest. I have ventured to elaborate my views, realizing the seriousness of the situation to Australia, and I hope that what I have said may possibly be of some serthat vice to the Government of the day. and assist them to solve this very difficult problem.",47
290,Mr ROBINSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN," I wish to £[1 commence my remarks by expressing my sense of the value of the most excellent speech of the honourable and learned What many of us have been waiting for a considerable time to hear has been a complete, connected, and consistent exposition of a defence policy for ithe Commonwealth. In the speech to which we have just listened, and which secured the rapt attention of honourable members, a vast amount of information was given to us. It is a speech which I think ought to be reprinted; and I certainly hope that steps will be taken, either by the honourable member or by his friends, to see that copies of it are circulated through the country press. _ In listening to the Budget which the right honourable the Treasurer delivered last week, I could not help thinking of a prediction made by the present Chief Justice of Australia, Sir Samuel Griffith, that the finance question is likely to be the rock upon which this Federation would find it very difficult not to split. The speech of the right honourable gentleman seems to me to indicate that we are in danger of getting upon the financial rocks; or, if we ourselves avoid that danger, certainly we are in danger of getting some of the States upon the rocks. I regret that the right honourable gentleman should have dealt in such a casual way with what seems to me the great safeguard of the States under our Constitution-wha t is known as the Braddon section; and I gave expression to my astonishment by interjection when the Treasurer made his remarks.",47
291,Sir JOHN FORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"There are other ways to protect the States, apart from Braddon section.",48
292,Mr ROBINSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,The right honourable gentleman is reported at page 1217 of Hansard to have alluded to the matter as follows :I do not see that much good can result States by extending the duration of the Braddon provision.,48
293,Sir JOHNFORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,""" To the States,"" the honourable member sees.",48
294,Mr ROBINSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN," It may restrict the spending powers of this partments. Parliament, but I cannot imagine that we shall do anything to injure the people of the States.",48
295,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,How long has Treasurer been of that opinion?,48
296,Mr ROBINSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,The interjection of the honourable member f-or Parramatta is most pertinent. How long has the right honourable gentleman been of that opinion?,48
297,Sir JOHNFORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,The sentence quoted by the honourable member follows after some Home Affairs is estimated other observations on the same subject.,48
298,Mr ROBINSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I am quite aware that the Treasurer said that protection to the States might be secured by giving them a fixed sum; but he also stated that in Canada, where that was done[ the conditions were so different from those in Australia as to make the example of very little value to us.",48
299,Sir JOHN FORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"In regard to the amount paid, I meant.",48
300,Mr ROBINSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"The States of Australia have regarded, and still regard, the Braddon section as the only one which secures to them a sufficiency of revenue to meet their annual obligations, and it seems to me that any proposal which impairs that safeguard without replacing it by some equally valuable one is most dangerous.",48
301,Sir JOHNFORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"He a r , hear ! I agree with that.",48
302,Mr ROBINSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"We are faced by the fact that by the year 1911 this Parliament, unless action be taken to the contrary, will, be in a position to distribute the whole of the revenue received from Customs and E x cise absolutely as it pleases. It is, therefore,, imperative that those who desire the States of the Commonwealth to remain in a solvent, prosperous condition should see that steps are taken to safeguard their interests. There are three aspects of the Budget to which I wish to address myself. The first is the cost of Federation. Referthe ence was made by the right honourable gentleman to the estimate of the cost of Federation given to the Adelaide Convention in 1897 by Mr - no w Sir FrederickHolder, our present Speaker. The paper which was laid upon the fable of the Convention, at his instance, estimated the total to the probable new Federal expenditure. We cannot look at that .estimate and compare it with the estimates of expenditure for the current year without noticing that there is a constant tendency to increase, and that we are faced by the prospect of a considerable rise in the cost of the Federal DeF o r example, I find that the estimate of the cost of the Legislature and the Executive was atoout ,£1.23,000. That the sum has already been exceeded by about ,£12.000 or ^13,000. There is no likelihood of the increase being reduced, but rather of its being increased. The estimate for the expenditure of the Home Affairs' Department, with which was included the cost of a High Commissioner, was £[18,000. I find that the Department of for the present year to cost £[42,000, exclusive of any provision for the High Commissioner. In every other Department one finds similar increases in Federal expenditure. The prospect held out to those - who wish to see economical government, and a large amount of money returned to the States, is not a very pieasing one. The matter is further complicated by the introduction of the verydifficult sugar bounties question. In connection with this question, the Treasurer made a most extraordinary statement in the course of his Budget speech. The right honourable gentleman gave an estimate as to the cost of Federation, and proved to his own satisfaction that it was last year £[312,000, the year before £[342,000, and that it would this year be less than £ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 . When one examines the whole of the figures, one is forced to the conclusion that those who put that sum down as the cost of Federation must make use of a system of arithmetic peculiar to themselves.",48
303,Sir JOHNFORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,F r o m what page is the honourable and learned member quoting?,49
304,Mr ROBINSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"F r o m page 1208 of Hansard. The right honourable gentleman estimates "" other "" expenditure this year at £[296,961, and there is a further estimate of expenditure of £[589,081, and he says this:The amounts included in the £589,081 would have been expended if Federation had not been accomplished. I deny that statement as vigorously as it is possible to do, because I find that one item included'in the amount is an expenditure in connection with sugar rebates, amounting to £*5*> 7° - 6",49
305,Sir JOHN FORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,I that out.,49
306,Mr ROBINSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"That expenditure is a purely Commonwealth expenditure. If we take the State of Victoria for example by no possible means can it be shown that any portion of the sugar' rebates would have had to be paid by Victoria, if it were not for the accomplishment of Federation. Before Federation, the revenue derived by Victoria from sugar amounted to £ 2 9 0 , 0 0 0 a vear. This year the revenue of Victoria from sugar will come down to £[150,000. We shall thus have lost about 50 per cent, of our revenue from sugar, whilst wholesale and retail consumers of sugar in Victoria will not get that commodity at a fraction of a penny cheaper than they got it before Federation. As a result of . the policy adopted by the Federation, there has it. been no reduction in price, and the greater portion of the benefit derived from that policy is being reaped by one very wealthy company- a concern of a most profitable nature. In addition to the loss of revenue which we in Victoria suffer from the present sugar policy of the Commonwealth, our fruit-growing industry, which was a very flourishing and promising industry, is being slowly strangled by the operation of that policy.",49
307,Sir JOHNFORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,How will it be strangled ?,49
308,Mr ROBINSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I propose to show the right honourable gentleman. In dealing with the fruit industry, I can claim to speak with some little knowledge, because two brothers of mine were deluded into going into this industry some years ago. I think I can say that they sank about £[2,000 in the industry, and they have been very glad to clear out of it at one-fifth of the amount which they put into it.",49
309,Sir JOHN FORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,There has always been a duty on sugar in Victoria.,49
310,Mr ROBINSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I have had a statement prepared relating to the effects of the sugar policy of the Commonwealth, which has been checked by my relations, who have been engaged in the fruit industry, and also by the members of theGoulburn Valley Fruit-growers' Association. The statements I propose to make on the subject have been confirmed by experts in the trade. These men, who are earning their living from the industry, of their own knowledge assert that these statements -'ire accurate and well founded. The fruit growing and preserving industries are very large industries in Australia, and they clearly pointed would now be much larger only that, as I say, they are being strangled by the sugar policy adopted by the Commonwealth Parliament. I might here say that, although the fiscal question comes into the matterto some extent, I am prepared to sink my free trade views, and to give a reasonable amount of assistance to growers of sugar' by white labour, in order to secure, if we can, the triumph of the policy of a White Australia. But I do say that the policy that we have adopted in the past is a policy involving the most extravagant waste of public monev. and one which is throttling what ought to be a very flourishing industry.",49
311,Mr JOHNSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I said the same thing, and the honourable member for Moira denied",49
312,Mr ROBINSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"In dealing with this question of the effect of the sugar policy on the fruit-growing industry, honourable members should be informed that the whole of the fruit grown in an orchard is not for fruit preserving or jam-making, and we say that about one-half of it is we shall be making a reasonable statement. I take the case of an orchard in which plums are grown. In the statement to which I have referred I find the following :Plums - On e acre is usually planted with 120 plum trees, the average produce of which is incases, equal to 60 lbs. The average yield per acre, therefore, is 7,200 lbs. of fruit, which, at £d. per lb., the average return during this season, would give £ i $ per acre. To transfer this quantity of plums into jam, requires 7,200 lbs. of sugar, the duty on which, at £ 6 per ton, amounts to £\% 5s. 8d.",50
313,Sir JOHN FORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,Why does not the honourable and learned member refer to the ;£3 Excise duty ?,50
314,Mr ROBINSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"Permi t me to deal with this matter in my own way, and I shall come to the Excise duty afterwards. I am now dealing with the case of a man who in the first instance, pays duty in Vici toria, and showing that those who use colonial sugar do not thereby get an advantage of more than a few shillings, the reduction made on colonial sugar being just sufficient to prevent other sugar coming into the market. Some sugar has, of course, to come in, because the local production is not sufficient. The duty on the sugar actually amounts in this case to 128 per cent, of the value of the fruit, and sometimes more than the value of the land with its improvements, on which the fruit is grown. Peaches - The usual number of trees per acre is 100, each yielding on an average 80 lbs. of fruit, or 8,000 lbs. per acre. The average price paid to the grower is £ 7 per ton, equal to £ 2 5 per acre. Stoning reduces the weight of the fruit by 10 per cent., i.e., 7,200 lbs. An equal of sugar being required to convert this into jam, the duty in this case amounts to £ 1 9 5s. 8d., or to 77 per cent, of the value of the fruit.",50
315,Sir JOHN FORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,What was the ' before Federation?,50
316,Mr ROBINSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"Before Federation there was in Victoria a duty of £ f i per ton on sugar from Queensland or any other part of the world, except beet sugar, and in irespect of the sugar used by factories a rebate was granted.",50
317,Sir JOHN FORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"Where , then, is the injury?",50
318,Mr ROBINSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I hope ""the right honourable member will allow me to proceed in my own way, because I desire to show the difference between the two policies. I de1 sire to show how, when the present policy .comes to fruition, the whole of the damage will have been done; that, while the people used of Australia will not receive a copper in if revenue, the Colonial Sugar Refining Comso used, pany will be made a present of about 000,000. The statement continuesApricots -14 0 trees per acre, yielding 8,400 lbs. per acre. At the average value of £ y per ton, the grower would receive £ 2 6 5s. per acre. Stoning reduces the weight to 7,500 lbs. An equal quantity of sugar is necessary to make into jam, the duty on which, at £ b per ton, amounts to £20 5s., equal to 77 per cent, of the value of the fruit. Quinces - The yield averages 4 tons per acre, of an average value of £ 3 per ton. An equal quantity of sugar is required to convert these into jam, i.e., 4 tons of sugar. The duty, therefore, amounts to £ 2 4 per acre, equal to twice the value of the fruit. To put these facts in another way :Value ot produce Sugar duty per per acre. acre of fruit. £ s. d. £ s. d. Quinces ... 12 0 0 24 0 0 Plums ... 15 0 0 19 58 Apricots ... 26 5 0 20 5 0 Peaches ... 25 OO 19 5 8 Value of produce Sugar duty per per ton. ton of fruit. £ s. d. £ s. d. Quinces ... 3 0 0 6 0 0 Plums ... 413 J 6 0 0 Apricots ... 7 0 0 5 8 0 Peaches ... 7 0 0 5 8 0 I repeat, for the purpose of allaying mis^ apprehension, that it is not the whole of the orchard that is used with the object of fruit preserving or jam-making. The Treasurer has pointed out that locally-grown sugar cultivated by black labour pays only ,£3, per ton to the revenue, sugar cultivated by white labour paying £ 1 per ton only, as against jQ6 per ton paid on imported sugar; quantity but the right honourable gentleman forgets that there are certain circumstances which must be taken into account. Prior to Federation, Queensland sugaT was sold in Victax toria at jQii, per ton in bond; that is to say, it paid a duty of £ 6 per ton, and was then sold at JQIQ or ^20 per ton. The fruit-preservers and jam-makers in Victoria could buy Queensland sugar in bond at the price I have named. The import duty on sugar in Queensland was inoperative in that State, as a duty on wool would be inoperative, seeing that far more is produced than is required fpr the local market. The whole of the sugar produced in Queensland was, therefore, sold at the world's price, which was about £ 1 3 per ton. At the present time a purchaser cannot obtain the A i sugar of the Colonml Sugar Refining Company much under £ 2 4 per ton, less a certain small discount, though it is only fair to say that there has been a rise in the price of sugar all over the world, partly owing to the denunciation of beet sugar bounties. Owing to the causes I have indicated, there was an increase in the world's price of about £[5 per ton; and in Queensland, of course, every sugar-grower benefited, just as the wool-growers of Australia would benefit by an increase in the world's price of wool. this rise took ,place, suga>r from China, the Mauritius, or any of the Eastern ports was landed in Melbourne at £[13 2s. 6d. a ton, whereas now it is about £ 1 8 7s. 6d. per ton. The A i sugar of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company was formerly £zo per ton in Melbourne, whereas now it has gone up to about £ 2 3 per ton. It is most astonishing that Queensland sugar has cheaper in Melbourne than in any other part of the world, and prior to the rise in price that sugar in bond in Melbourne was £ 6 per ton more than the imported sugar, whereas after the rise the difference between the two was only £[3 14s. That shows that the whole of the duty has been collected by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company; but, in fairness to that company, it must be said that it did not raise the price to the extreme limit to which it could have been raised in competition. However, the reasons for that policy were given by the chairman of directors of the company on the 28th October last-and those reasons are worth repeating-as follows :Unfortunately, we have not, except to a very moderate extent, been able to profit by the heavy advance in price, for the large production of sugar in Australia this season, unduly augmented by importations from various quarters, compels us 'to maintain our rates at a level which, while discouraging further importations, would insure the disposal of our supplies, and, as we have only recently raised our prices, last half-yearly accounts do not derive any benefit therefrom. The "" moderate extent"" to which local sugar has so far benefited by the rise is, nevertheless, £[2 171s. 6d. per ton.",50
319,Sir JOHNFORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,What dividend was declared ?,51
320,Mr ROBINSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"L as t year I think a dividend of 15 per cent, was declared. This is a very well-managed company. The directors show only enough profit to pay good dividends,' the balance being, expended in wiping off imaginary 'depreciation and in ways of that kind-somethin g like a company with which we are all familiar when we travel in the trams to Parliament House. The sugar industry flourished in Queensland when the price was £[13 per ton, and the price is now .£23 per ton. But out of that return, excise of £[3 per ton 'has to be paid if the cane be grown by black labour, and , £ 1 per ton if it be grown by white labour. Thus the net return to the producers, growBefore ers, and refiners, is about £[7 to £[9 per ton more than previously. If we take the lowest estimate, and say that the price is only £ 7 ios. higher, there were 150,000 tons produced last year, so that through the increased price caused by our present policy, and the rise in the world's price, the industry is receiving over £ r , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 more than the profit which used to be derived from the same quantity of sugar prior to always been Federation. That, of course, does not represent all the burden that is placed on the shoulders of the users of sugar. There is not only this £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 paid to the people engaged in the industry, but the Government collects about £[530,000 in revenue, after allowing, of course, for rebate or bounty. The total sum collected from the people in respect of the sugar industry is nearly _£i,6oo,ooo, and only one-third of that goes into the Treasury. According to the Customs Tariff Act, when this policy in regard to sugar is completed, not only will the bonus arid the excise cease, but the present duty is to be maintained, and if 180,000 tons represents the consumption of Australia, this'company will be able to collect . £ 5 or jQS a ton, or from £900,00 0 to £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 from the people, and the Treasury will not get a solitary sixpence of the amount. For some years past, the great bulk of the sugar has been produced by black labour and the sugar-growers have received a very handsome bonus from the country. Prior to Federation, a large quantity of sugar was produced in New South Wales by white labour. Under the present policy, the sugar-growers in that State are very much better off than they used to be, since they get a bonus for doing something now which they used to do for nothing. They used to produce their sugar under a protection of £[3 per ton. It'seems an extraordii nary policy. It must not be forgotten that one very important item in the .Tariff which keeps the sugar market in subjection to one company is the fact that the import duty is £,10 a ton on beet sugar and £ f i a ton on cane sugar. The result is that beet sugar cannot possibly be shipped to Australia. If beet sugar were subject to the same duty as cane sugar, there would be a very great possibility of a large quantity of the former being landed here. But under the present system the possibility of keeping the local company in check is annihilated by the difference in duty on the two kinds of sugar. As I have said, I am prepared to make a sacrifice for the purpose of allowing this policy to be carried out, and assisting to make it successful if we can. But at the same time, I do not wish to see the large and abundant revenue which the States used to collect from this source imperilled. If the policy of the first Federal Parliament be carried out to its extreme degree it will land us in the position that not a fraction will come to the revenue from sugar, because, not only the bounty, but the excise duty is to cease, and the people of the Commonwealth will pay an increased price for their sugar 'by reason of the fact that one company controls the Australian market.",51
321,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,I beg to call attention the state of the Committee. formed.],52
322,Mr ROBINSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"It means that the people of Australia will have to pay a large tax to the persons engaged in this dustry. It must not be forgotten that prior to Federation the sugar industry tained - a footing mainly on free-trade policy. .conditions, and that for all sugar exviolation ported from Queensland, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company had to accept the world's position. price, then about £ 1 3 per ton, and now siderably higher. If we were to reverse our policy and go to extreme free-trade, the sugar-grower in Queensland would better off than he was before tion was established. I do not ask honourable members to take that course, but do suggest that there is a remedy to be in Queensland? found whereby the States would receive some revenue from this source, and the interests of the States' Treasurers would considered. I think that by imposing an import duty of £ 5 or £ 6 a ton on sugar, it is possible to levy an excise duty on sugar, allowing a difference of £ 2 between the import and excise duties in favour sugar grown by white labour, and of £.1 only in favour of sugar grown. by black labour. That would be a sufficient sum allow to the sugar-growers, because then they would be £ 2 per ton better off than they were outside Queensland prior to Federation.",52
323,Mr GROOM,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,How about the internal market ?,52
324,Mr ROBINSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,I cannot give expert testimony as to the fact; but I believe that prior to Federation the Colonial Sugar Refining Company sold its sugar in Queensland at the same rate as it did in Victoria in bond.,52
325,Mr GROOM,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"In fixing these prices, has the honourable and learned member taken into consideration the cost of production outside Queensland and in it?",52
326,Mr ROBINSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"No ; what I :have taken into consideration is the undoubted fact that prior to Federation the Colonial' Sugar Refining Company sold its sugar in bond in Melbourne at . £ 1 3 per ton. If we had complete free-trade established today, it would get a higher price than that. If sugar could be sold then at £ 1 3 a ton, certainly it could be sold at a profit when they would get £[17 or £ i & per ton. I do not ask any honourable member to agree to a policy so radical as that. If we were to to impose an excise duty of £ 4 per ton and [Quorum an import duty of jQS per ton a very large revenue would be derived from sugar; the Commonwealth would be better off, the invery dustry in Queensland would be very handinsomely treated compared with its condition prior to Federation, and the whole of the obCommonwealth would gain by such a This proposal is, I think, some of my free-trade principles, but I recognise that the industry is in a peculiar We have ordered the sugarcongrowers to' reconstruct their business on a White Australia basis, and for that reason I think we should make a sacrifice of prinbe ciple in the hope that we may bring that Federapolicy to a successful issue",52
327,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,Why should we pay to I keep in cultivation some of the best land :,52
328,Mr ROBINSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I believe it is rich land; but in the interests of Queensland be I am prepared to make this sacrifice, so that its sugar-growers shall be unable to say that they were unfairly treated by this Parliament. If the present system be continued as proposed by the Treasurer, I feel of convinced, as the honourable member for Maranoa interjected, that at the end of five years, we shall be asked to renew the bounty to for another term of five or ten years, and every time we take that course we shall be throwing away a large amount of revenue. If the people of Queensland were to get the revenue which they would get from such a policy as I have indicated, they would not be in the position in which they now are as regards the Federal revenue generally. Queensland has been hit very severely by the Customs arrangements of the Federation. For a number of years past that State has not got back three-fourths of its contribution in Customs and Excise duties, and its Treasurers have been at their wits' ends because the returns made to them by the Commonwealth Treasurer have not been so large as, previous to Federation, it was anticipated that they would be.",52
329,Mr HENRY WILLIS,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"South has suffered, too.",53
330,Mr ROBINSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"Yes ; but Queensland has suffered more than any other State in this matter. It is not, however, my intention to devote more time to the question now. I can only hope that steps will be taken by this Parliament to secure to the taxpayers of' the States some of the reward which will otherwise go to a very large company, which is very skilfully managed, and well engineered, and an extremely profitable concern to those who have the good fortune to be shareholders in it. I wish next to deal with a matter which I consider still more serious-the taking over by the Commonwealth of the debts of the States. I must again express astonishment at the attitude of the Treasurer. It is arguable whether the Braddon provision should be extended. That is a point on which I believe honourable members hold different opinions ; but in view of the earnest manner in which the present Treasurer and his chief supported the provision at a Conference of Treasurers held in 1904, I am filled with amazement at the casual and offhand manner in which he dealt with it in his Budget speech. Last year the Prime Minister, when at the head of a former Government, with the then Treasurer and the present Treasurer, attended a Conference of States Treasurers, at which proposals were made for the transfer of the debts of the States to the Commonwealth, the Government agreeing, upon certain conditions, to an extension of the Braddon provision, though, of course, they could not bind this Parliament. The Treasurer supported that position, and yet in his Budget speech he made a statement which indicated that he was not in favour of extending it. My honourable friends in the Labour corner had a conference a short time ago, and passed a resolution affirming that the Braddon provision should be knocked on the head at the first opportunity, and the Treasurer therefore now sings the same tune. I congratulate them upon their victory, upon having added his scalp to the trophies at their belt; and I hope, for their sakes, that the right honourable gentleman will be found as docile in the future as he appears to be now. But unless the debts question is to be settled effectively before 1911, the outlook for the people of Australia will be serious. We in Victoria are better off than are the other States, because our burden of debt per head of population is less than theirs. Australia",53
331,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,Includin g shire and municipal debts?,53
332,Mr ROBINSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"Even including them, Victoria's burden of unproductive debt is lighter than that of any other State.",53
333,Mr GROOM,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"Victoria , unlike Queensland, has not had alarge territory to develop.",53
334,Mr TUDOR,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,No r so much public land to sell.,53
335,Mr ROBINSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I thank the honourable member for Yarra for the interjection. In the Victorian Year-Book for 1904 the Government Statist says that loans to the amount of nearly £[60,000,000 have to be redeemed within the next ten yealrs, and to the amount of £106,000,00 0 within the 1 succeeding ten years. Unless the bulk of the Customs revenue is secured to the States, I do not think we can successfully negotiate for the redemption or extension of those loans.",53
336,Mr SPENCE,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,Let the people of Victoria put on a good land tax.,53
337,Mr ROBINSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"The amount of revenue to be derived from direct taxation is not illimitable, and if the honourable member were Treasurer he would find that he could not raise enough by that means resettle this question. Over £200,000,00 0 of the indebtedness of the States, interest and principal, is under their loan Acts chargeable on their public revenue; and five-sixths of their loans were raised while their Customs and Excise revenue was entirely under their control, and the balance while the bulk of that revenue was still being returned to them by the Commonwealth. It therefore follows that if their returns of Customs and Excise revenue are diminished, or altogether cease, their position will be an unenviable one, because two-thirds of their revenue is obtained from that source. It may or may not have been a desirable thing, but it is an undeniable fact, that since the inauguration of responsible government in Australia the great bulk of our .revenue has come from indirect taxation, and the loans which we have contracted have been practically charged on Customs and Excise receipts. Therefore, if the States are to meet their liabilities, the bulk of this revenue must be secured to them. If in 1911 the Commonwealth, by reason of this ""let-slide ""'policy of the Treasurer, has obtained absolute control of the Customs and Excise revenue, the position of the States will be very serious. statement contained in a resolution passed by a Conference of State Premiers in 1903 sums up the position more accurately than any words of mine would doThat this Conference submits for the consideration of the Federal Government the following resolution : - "" Having regard to the fact that the debts of the various States were incurred upon the security of the revenues of the State, and as the greater part of the revenues has been transferred to the Commonwealth in Customs and Excise duties, and having regard to the fact that the permanent financial stability of the States must depend upon either (a) the continuance of the application of the principal part of those revenues to the payment of interest of the debts; or (b) the imposition of very largely increased direct taxation in various States, it is resolved that in order to secure to the several State Governments the guarantee contemplated by the Constitution the provisions of the Constitution with respect to taking over by the Commonwealth of the debts of the States, or a proportion thereof, should be brought into operation as soon as possible."" Then they go on to say in words which, 1 think, no honourable member can successfully contestThe experience of all constitutionally governed countries proves that an overflowing Treasury means a swelling expenditure. The only effective check upon an excessive expenditure of public money is the necessity of resting upon the spending body to provide ways and means by the imposition of additional charges upon the taxpayers. Where this necessity does not exist, or does not exist so far as the spending body is concerned, these manifold political forces tending to increase the public expenditure are left to work unchecked. To be effective the check must be direct and immediate, not indirect and merely consequential. If the Treasurer's policy of letting things slide is to be pursued, the Federal Governsuggested ment will, in 1911, find itself in unconhold trolled possession of an. immense sum of money. There will be no obligation their part to devise means to make charges Mr Robinson. on the taxpayers, and they will escape all punishment' for their misdeeds, because the evil will have been done before retribution, at the hands of the people, can overtake them.",53
338,Sir JOHNFORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,We shall have taken over the debts before that time.,54
339,Mr ROBINSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"In that case the Braddon clause will not worry the States, because if the debts of the States are taken over the tendency to extravagance on the part of the Federal Government will be effectually checked.",54
340,Sir JOHNFORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,We shall assuredly have taken over the States' debts before that period is reached. The,54
341,Mr ROBINSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,I am very glad that ten days have brought about such a complete change in the views of the Treasurer.,54
342,Sir JOHNFORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,The r e has been no change. I have said that from the beginning.,54
343,Mr ROBINSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I agree with the view taken by the late Treasurer, and I believe also by the right honourable gentleman now occupying that position, that some protection must be afforded to the Commonwealth, that is to say, when the Commonwealth is renewing a loan or floating a new loan, it must not be possible for a State Treasurer to spoil the market by rushing in and endeavouring to raise money. I believe that that is a sound proposition, and that steps should be taken to prevent any clashing of borrowing im the London market. The States Treasurers should, as ""far as possible, be limited to the local market for borrowing purposes, and the Commonwealth should have the sole power to borrow in London.",54
344,Sir JOHNFORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,We are becoming more in agreement every minute.,54
345,Mr ROBINSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"If the right honourable gentleman will only carry out the suggestion made at the Treasurers' Conference in 1904, we shall be found working together, and the scalp which now adorns the belt of the honourable member for Bland will once more occupy its proper place. Threefourths of the Customs and Excise revenue is undoubtedly insufficient to pay the interest on the States' debts. Therefore, the States' Governments must make up the deficiency in some way or other. It has been that the Federal Treasurer should a floating lien over the railway revenues of the States. But strong objection on had been urged to that idea, and, I think, rightly so, because railway policy is a matter of internal development that we should leave entirely in the hands of States' Governments. Mr Irvine, the late Premier of Victoria, has made what I ceive to be an excellent suggestion, namely, that each of the States should pass a special Act, appropriating revenue sufficient to any deficiency between the amount received from Customs duties and the sum necessary to pay the interest on their debts. points out with considerable force that only protection the bond-holder has at preto sent is afforded by the special States' which appropriate part of the States' revenues towards the payment of the interest on the money borrowed. If the States give the Commonwealth a supply"", guarantee of a similar character, it upon should prove sufficient. The Constitufrom tion provides that the States must indemnify the Commonwealth for any raised debts that may be taken over, and Mr. Irvine, who is a well-known lawyer, holds indebtedness. the opinion that that provision could be enforced before the High Court, and that indirect benefit? that tribunal could find an appropriate remedy, in the almost inconceivable event of a State failing to make good any defithat aspect of the matter presently. ciency. I also agree with the idea of right honourable member for Balaclava a sinking fund should be attached to every loan, whether it be floated in London or about upon the local market. In this connection we ought to consider the true indebtedness of Australia, and compare it with the debtedness of the mother country. The true indebtedness of a country is to be sured by the amount of taxation the people alone. are called upon to bear in order to pay the interest on their debts. In the event of a Government borrowing money and spending it upon a reproductive work, such as way, which returns a revenue sufficient, only to meet the working expenses, but interest on the debt, no burden is imposed upon the taxpayer; but if the work is remunerative, and does not earn a sufficient amount to pay the interest the taxpayers have to make good the deficiency, and debt thus becomes a real burden. national debt of Great Britain has been incurred for the purpose of carrying on what are called unproof ductive enterprises-that is to 'say, in the defence and extension of the Empireand to this fact the Commonwealth and other, portions of the Empire owe their istence today. It will hardly be believed by honourable members that, in spite of fact I have mentioned, the unproductive the debt of Australia constitutes a heavier charge upon its citizens than does the connational debt of Great Britain, which has accumulated during 200 years of struggle for existence as a world power. meet By "" unproductive "" debt I mean debt for which the people are taxed in order to pay interest.

I He find that for the year ended 30th June, the 1904, the sum of £[8,996,000 was required pay interest and charges upon the public Acts, debt of the States of the Commonwealth. Of that sum, a total of £""5,240,000 was raised from the works in which that money had been invested-fro m railways, water harbour ""and"" sewerage works, interest advances to settlers, local bodies, and the land settlement policy. That is to say, that about £[3,750,000 has to be by taxation ""from the people of Australia in order to pay interest upon their ",54
346,Mr ROBINSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I shall deal with It the seems to me that the method of charging that everything to posterity is one which is fraught with considerable danger. We pay £ 3 , 7 5 0 , 0 0 0 yearly in interest upon unproductive debt. In other words, comparing our national indebtedness with that inof Great Britain, it is, roughly speaking,_ about £[100,000,000. We have to pay inmeaterest upon that amount out of taxation ",55
347,Mr ROBINSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"The honourable mema railber does not follow me. I am taking the not asset at its value. Of the whole of the the wonks upon which anonev (has been expended in Australia, interest is earned only not upon £5,240.000. The balance of the interest has to be raised by taxation. Consequently, if we compare our indebtedness the with that of the United Kingdom, we find The that the latter does not constitute as heavy burden upon the people of the mother country as our debt does upon the taxpayers Australia, notwithstanding that there is an indirect advantage received in both cases. The indirect advantage received here is the stimulus which has been imparted to the enexterprise of the country. Whether that has not been too dearly purchased is open to the question. In Australia, our unproductive debt represents about £[25 per head of our population-in Great Britain it is considerably less. There, I believe, it is about £[18 per head. The interest which has to be met by taxation in Australia represents about 18s. 6d. per head; in Great Britain it does not exceed 9s. 6d. It will be seen, therefore, that from the point of view of indebtedness, we have a lot of leeway to make up. That is why I think that the States debts question is the most pressing which confronts rhe Australian people.",55
348,Sir JOHNFORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,But we cannot make the States anxious to transfer their debts.,56
349,Mr ROBINSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"The Treasurer must see that for the payment of interest their debts the States more than absorb all the revenue which they are likely to receive 'through the Customs. Consequently, must rely upon the proceeds of direct tion to pay interest upon future borrowings. loans. That in itself will prove a very excellent check upon extravagant schemes for borrowing, either in Great Britain or elsewhere. In Great Britain, statesmanlike efforts are being made to extinguish the national indebtedness by the establishment of a sinking fund. The late Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr Ritchie, at the conclusion of the Boer War, provided £27,000,000 per annum should be devoted to the redemption of the national debt. In the first year, £6,600,000 of that amount was expended in reducing the principal and the balance was devoted to pay'ing the interest. Year after year a bigger proportion of that ,£27,000,000 will be. applied in redemption of the capital, and. consequently, a diminishing proportion will be required to pay interest. Mr Ritchie calculates that if Great Britain has the good fortune to avoid being involved in war during the next fifty years, the whole of her indebtedness will be extinguished. At our present rate of progress in Australia we shall be doing very good work if we wipe out our national indebtedness in about a thousand years.  learned member is assuming that our popuject lation will not increase.",56

351,Mr ROBINSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"There is a much trial quicker growth in Canada and the United States. These facts are of sufficient importance to impress upon the Government the necessity of adopting a firm policy as regards taking over the States debts. Those debts ought to be taken over, and we ought to provide a sinking fund in connection with their redemption, and to limit future borrowings as much as possible. In America the people of the States have deliberately set checks upon the power of Parliament to borrow money. I find, in connection with one loan floated in Western Australia, a sinking fund of 3 per cent, was established. I scarcely think that our present Treasurer upon could have been responsible for that.",56
352,Sir JOHNFORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I am absolutely rethey sponsible for it. There was a sinking taxafund of 1 per cent, attached to all our",56
353,Mr ROBINSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I congratulate the right honourable gentleman. If he will adopt the same course now, he will confer a lasting benefit upon the people of Australia. The sinking fund to which I refer is in the hands of trustees, who are outside of political control, and consequently it is of a far more satisfactory character than that is the sinking fund of any other State. If the right honourable the Treasurer is responsible for the creation of that fund, he has something of which he may be proud. I wish now to say a word or two upon what has been called the detraction question. A good deal has been said about the detraction of Australia, especially in regard to the representations which have been made concerning the Immigration Restriction Act. I hold in my hand a copy of the debates which took place upon that measure in September and October, 1901. Judging by the speech which was delivered at that time by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, and the interjections of the honourable member for Bland, I conclude that the object of what is known as the contract labour provisions was of a two-fold character. Thefirstobwas to prevent men being imported into Australia during a strike, and the second out was to prevent them being brought here coununder a misapprehension as to the wages conditions which'obtained-upo n the understanding that the wage was nominally small, whereas, in reality, it might be conThe object, in other words, was to prevent capitalists interfering in indusstrife, and to prevent men from being misled regarding the wages which were payable. With these objects-whic h entirely worthy ones- I am thoroughly had in - accord. I cannot say, however, that the method of administration which is being adopted at present is a satisof factory way of. dealing with To some extent both these objects have been met by the passing of the Conciliahorses tion and Arbitration Act. In Victoria provisions of Wages Boards apply to over forty industries, while in New South Wales there is a Conciliation and contract ? Arbitration Act applying to every industry. I am informed that the present Governthroughout ment of Queensland have a Conciliation and Arbitration Bill on the stocks, and think I may safely say that there reasonable prospect of any misapprehension as to wages in the bulk of the industries of the country being settled by some tribunal. It ..would, however, seem to necessary to secure the second of the jects to which I have referred by giving any man' who is brought here under concontract tract the right to sue, as soon as he lands, for the prevailing rate of wages in the trade in. which he is engaged. action has been taken under this Act that must lead to a considerable degree of verse comment in Great Britain and where. Take the case of the English groom, to which reference has been made today. So far as I understand the might be a verbal one. answers given by the Prime Minister to my questions-and I must confess that those answers were somewhat vague-exemptio n certificates are not usually issued in the case of Britishers, but are intended to used in the case of foreigners who might be excluded from failing to pass the cation test, or something of the sort. But we know that in the case immediately under notice a gentleman proposing to bring out Affairs. certain horses ''from Suffolk required groom to attend them on the voyage, and to accompany them to a station in New South Wales. The groom obtained an extificates emption certificate, but it is stated that Agent-General acted wrongly in issuing that certificate. When I asked the Prime Minalso ister, today what was the policy to be adopted in regard to white labour coming to Australia under contract, he said that the contract should be sent to the Departto ment of External Affairs. The issuing exemption certificates mav be a stupid policy, but it is far more expeditious than is that which the Prime Minister now suggests. brought here to defeat a, strike. If a man, requiring the services of an pert groom to travel with horses from are county in England to New South Wales, to wait until the contract could be sent out to the Department of External Affairs, and returned to him, the groom's chances landing in the Commonwealth would be the question. very remote indeed.",56

The issue of exemption cerenables an intending immigrant to the at once ascertain if he will be allowed to land on reaching Australia, I think there is a means of preserving the Act as it stands, and yet overcoming the difficulty in this respect. The object of the measure is to prevent men signing a contract work in Australia while they are under of la misapprehension as to the wages and conditions of labour prevailing here, and also to render it impossible for men to be The exstatisticians of New South Wales and Vica toria issue handbooks in which they state the average rate of wages in every calling and trade in the Commonwealth.

The handbook as issued by the Victorian statistician furnishes the same information. These books ought to be in the possession of the High Commissioner, or our representative in England for the time being. It should be possible for any one who wishes to bring men to Australia, under contract for manual labour, to go to the representative of the Commonwealth in England who, on referring to these works, could at once determine whether the wages specified in the contract agreed with those ruling in the States. If they did, the necessary permit to land should be at once forthcoming. If that course were followed, I think that even the Labour Party, who hold very strong opinions on this question, could take no exception to it ; but if we insist that in the case of men coming under contract to Australia, the contract shall, first of all, be scrutinized by the Department of External Affairs, we must of necessity achieve a reputation for wishing to keep white men out of the Commonwealth.

368,Mr ROBINSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I know that the honourable member is merely chaffing, but I should like him and his party to consider whether it would not be possible to so administer the Immigration Restriction Act that its objects might be achieved by the least objectionable means. With the objects they have in view I am in hearty sympathy; but I cannot for a moment defend some of the acts that have been done in pursuance of that legislation. The same effects can be secured by a great deal less trouble, a great deal less annoyance, and without creating any unpleasantness .in any other part of the world. It can be secured without issuing exemption certificates or similar papers, which seem to brand the man as an undesirable immigrant from ihe start. I am glad that that matter has been referred to, because I think that the more certificates are issued the more like1'hood there is of coming to a decision wheieby we shall be able to keep out men who may be brought here for improper purposes, and at the same time enable desirable immigrants to be brought to Australia in as large numbers as possible. I hope that the Government will restrain the impetuosity of the Treasurer, and that his policy of distributing millions to every one but the persons who should receive them will be checked. I hope also that some method will be adopted whereby the debt question as it affects' the whole of the States will be settled on a basis satisfactory not only to the Governments of the States, but to the people of the whole Commonwealth.",58
369,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN," I regret, that the Treasurer was not able to present a more satisfactory Budget to us, because it is manifest on an examination of it that the Commonwealth has come very near to the end of its tether, so far as funds are concerned. In the very near future only one or two courses will be open to us. Either we must stop introducing any fresh legislation whatever, or devise some system of direct taxation to raise the money that may be required. While I, and for one, do not object to any method whereby part of the money shall be raised by direct taxation, I decline to assent to the principle that we should tax merely for the purpose of taxing. My desire' is that every penny piece that is taken out of the pockets of the people should, as far as possible, go into the Treasury. I am bound to say that that is not the case under our present system. We are raising something like £ 8 , 7 0 0 , 0 0 0 in Customs and E x cise duties. I am not going to refer to the amount of taxation raised in some of the States by direct taxation, because I have no doubt whatever that the sum so raised does not exceed that which is spent in public works, in making roads, and thereby improving property. Therefore that comes rather under the head of such taxation as pertains to municipalities. If we were to follow the system of taxation that is observed in England at the present time-that is to say if we were to maintain a proportion between direct and indirect taxationnothing like £[8,700,000 would be raised through the Customs. But I regret to say that our method has been adopted with the consent of a great many of the party who if they really understood the meaning of the term labour, would be the very first to oppose it.",58
370,Mr THOMAS,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"It was done with the consent of the people, unfortunately.",59
371,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"The honourable member is aware that all the members of the first Conservative Government of the Commonwealth were anxious to impose heavy duties, and they were permitted to do so, owing to the fact that a large proportion of members of the Labour Party did not understand the principle of finance which was being adopted, and absolutely allowed heavy burdens to be placed on the backs of those whom they represent. Those burdens will remain there, unless a greater number of that party come to their senses than is likely to be the case. I object to any man bearing any more taxation than is his fair share. When I find a man like the Treasurer, under a system that we call protective, paying, perhaps, less towards the revenue than another man with a family of half-a-dozen children, who is earning only a couple of pounds a week, I say that that is an unjust system. In my opinion, the fight against that system ought to be our principal task in the future. We ought to go before the electors prepared to reverse it, and to insist that not one penny piece shall be taken from the people more than is absolutely required, and that that amount shall be raised under a system that is equitable to all..",59
372,Mr THOMAS,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,Would the honourable member advocate a Federal land tax?,59
373,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"There are only two forms of taxation-direc t and indirect. In England 51 per cent of the taxation is raised by indirect means, and 49 per cent, is direct taxation. I am afraid that that proportion would be unjust in Australia. The discontent would be so great that it would not be advisable to introduce such a system here. There must be some proportion between the two systems. It is necessary that taxation should be raised for the preservation of law and order, and to enable the work of government to be carried on. In so far as it is necessary, we should all pay our share.",59
374,Mr THOMAS,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,U n d e r a land tax every one would pay his share.,59
375,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,Would the honourable member have only one form of taxation ?,59
376,Mr THOMAS,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I would, if I had my way",59
377,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I object to undue taxation on land-owners or people with large incomes, just as I object to it on the mass of the people. It is precisely because almost the whole of our revenue is now raised by one method of taxation that I object to it. If £8,700,000 is the amount that it is necessary for us to raise to carry on the government, and if we dealt with the matter as taxation is dealt with in England, we should raise about £[4,800,000 by Customs duties, and about £4,000,00 0 by direct taxation. For that class of men who, when the Tariff was introduced, did not care what happened as long as they felt that the burden did not f all on their own shoulders, I have no sympathy whatever. Four years ago, when the present Ministry and their followers were saying what a wonderful Tariff it was, and how. it was going to give employment here and there, honourable members on this side pointed out that that was exactly what if would not do, and that, on the contrary, it would prevent employment. I may refer to what I had to say on the subject myself, and I remember that I pointed out that the greatest defect of the Tariff, so far as consideration for the revenue of the various States was concerned, was that it was not so framed as to allow for the expansion or diminution for which a properly-framed Tariff would have allowed. If was not so framed as to afford a. kind of mark by which we might be enabled to judge of the prosperity or want of prosperity of the people of the various States. We have now absolute proof of that, and I regret to state that my remarks in that direction have been absolutely borne out. I think that, at the time, the present Treasurer rather agreed with me that the Tariff would not be an index of the progress of the people.",59
378,Mr MAUGER,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,It is an index of their' want of progress at present.,60
379,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"At the present time we have a large amount of taxation fastened upon the community under the operation of the Tariff, and as a result true progress has been prevented. What is still more serious, there is a deficiency in the revenue, which a Tariff pressing just as heavily on the people, but framed in another direction, might. have prevented. While imposing exactly the same burden on the people, we might have obtained a very much larger revenue by framing the Tariff in a different way.",60

383,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"M i g h t I ask honourable members opposite to say what is their test? Is it 5, 10, 15. 80, or 100 per. cent, of loss? Let us put it in the simplest way possible, to see whether the honourable member for Bourke is correct in his statement. He says now that if a man is doing work which is not in itself profitable he is still engaged in an industry.",60
384,Mr HUMECOOK,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,I did not say that.,60
385,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I asked the member if , when a man's work was done, it cost more to produce than it was worth, he was engaged in an industry, and the honourable member replied, "" Yes . """,60
386,Mr HUMECOOK,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,The honourable and cent. learned member is re-stating the case in a different way.,60
387,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I put it to members opposite in this way: If a man does certain work, which costs him £ 1 and he gets 16s. for the result of his labour, is that an industry ? I have only taken a difference of 4s. in the £ 1 , which would be met by a 20 per cent, duty, whilst we know that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports over and over again called for a 30 per cent. duty.",60
388,Mr HUME COOK,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,And was sorry he could not get a higher duty.,60
389,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"That ' is quite true. The honourable member was sorry that he could not get a higher duty than 30 per cent. The honourable member contends that a man who produces 14s. worth of work should be able to make some one else pay £ 1 for it, and then he will be engaged in an industry. It is exactly the same thing to contend that a man in gaol who does 14s. worth of work, and whom it costs the State £ 1 to keep, is engaged in. an industry. According to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, the more people we have in gaol doing 14s. worth of work for which the State has to pay £ 1 , the bigger the industry. I have put the matter in this way in order that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports may understand it, though I confess that I have no hope that the honourable member will understand it, because I remember that on one occasion he pointed out that if a farmer spent 15s. in putting in a crop, and did not get any harvest, he was 15s. better off than when he started. I remember that the honourable member also argued that if a man put in a crop at a cost of £ 1 , and there was a return of ros. from it, that made 30s.; that there was 30s. worth of work done, and consequently the farmer was 30s. better off than when he started.",60
390,Mr MAUGER,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,The honourable and learned member is dreaming.,60
391,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,Othe r honourable members believed that in such a case the farmer would have suffered a loss of ios.,60
392,Mr THOMAS,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,What was the honourable member's argument about the glass bottle honourable machine coming in free?,60
393,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I believe that was one of those cases where'it was contended that if there were a tax of 50 per cent., the man using it would have had to pay 50 per",60
394,Mr HUMECOOK,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,The honourable and learned member forgets that the money rehonorable mains in the country.,60
395,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I am aware that honor, able members opposite used that argument over and over again, until I showed them that they would be just as well off if they did not draw their pay because the money would still remain in the country. It then became plain to their bright intelligences that, after all, that was not a very sound argument to use, and we did not hear very much more of it. I may mention that when a duty was called for on sugar, honourable members opposite all said that the sugar industry was a magnificent industry. I believe that it is an industry, because it is a business that can stand on its own legs.",60
396,Mr HUMECOOK,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"The right honourable member for East Sydney thought that, and kept the duty on.",61
397,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,Surely the honourable member is not going to say that the right honourable member for East Sydney had anything to do with the Tariff.,61
398,Mr HUME COOK,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I am speaking of New South' Wales, and the right honourable gentleman's efforts for the industry there.",61
399,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"The duty was cut down as much as possible in New South Wales, and but for the arrangements made for entering into the Federation it would have been cut down still further. I have never heard it alleged that every man who believes in free-trade necessarily believes in the total abolition of the Customs House any more than that every protectionist believes in the total prohibition of imports. If we use extreme language in the one case we must use it in the other; if we say that a free-trader means a man who would, abolish the Customs House, then we must say that a protectionist is one who would prohibit all exportation, because if we prohibit importation, we have nothing, to pay by way of exports. That, generally speaking, was my quarrel with honourable members on the Ministerial side in regard lo the sugar industry. Some of us believe this to be a true industry-that for every £[1 spent in production, something of value will be returned. If the case be otherwise, somebody has to pay the difference, and it can only be paid by citizens engaged in productive industries. If we have so called industries that cannot stand on their own legs, the bigger those industries are the worse it is for the community as a whole. Fortunately, the sugar industry is one which can absolutely rely on itself ; and yet what a miserable spectacle has been presented in this House in this connection ! It has already been shown that the consumption of sugar in Australia amounts to something like 185,000 tons per annum; and an import duty of £[6 per ton; has been imposed, evidently with the object of raising the price of the lian product to that extent. I admit that there may be a difference in the price of, 1901 ? say, 2s. 6d., in order to prevent outside competition; but the cost of carriage alone would have secured that end. Practically we have raised the aggregate price of sugar to the people of Australia by about 100,000.",61
400,Sir JOHNFORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,W as there not some duty imposed previously?,61
401,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I am speaking about what might have been, had there been no Tariff. In Queensland, for instance, the duty was inoperative, and in Western Australia there was no duty.",61
402,Sir JOHN FORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,There was no duty in Western Australia for years.,61
403,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"In New South Wales, on the other hand, there was a duty of something like £[3 per ton, and in Victoria a duty of '£[6. At any rate, it is clear that the effect of the Commonwealth duty will be to raise the cost of the sugar to the people as a whole by about £1,100,000. It was so clearly recognised that a large part of the duty ought to come back in the shape of revenue, that an excise duty was imposed which last year brought in, roughly, between £[400,000 and ,£500,000. But even a certain amount of that return was lost, because we confused the matter by giving a bonus on sugar grown by white labour. No doubt we intended, as far as possible, to secure a White Australia; but, in passing, I must say that greater humbug, cant, and hypocrisy never were seen on the part of a Parliament than in this particular legislation. We have tried to persuade the whole of the people that this was wholly the legislation of the Commonwealth Parliament, whereas, .in fact, all of the States had previously passed laws restricting the immigration of aliens. A l most the whole of the States had. by 1898, so effectually made laws in this regard that from 1896 to 1901 only 700 aliens per annum found their way into the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth, with all its boasted legislation, did not prevent the alien influx, though this Parliament took credit for so doing. The view I have indicated could only be placed before electors who are ignorant of the facts, and I am bound to say that some of the legislators seem to be equally ignorant that restrictive legislation was years ago passed by the-States Parliaments.",61
404,Mr MCDONALD,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"In less than two years Austra2,000 Japanese came into Queensland.",61
405,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,Between 1896 and,61
406,Mr MCDONALD,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,I do not say that; but the honourable and learned member was speaking of a time prior to the Commonwealth legislation.,62
407,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I think, as a matter of fact, that some 2,200 aliens came into Queensland, but of that number between 1,400 and 1,500 departed, and this brings the figures to what I stated in the first instance. When Queensland made a treaty with Japan, that State was much more alive to its duty than has been the Federal Parliament. I remember begging in this House that we should arrange for the exclusion of Japanese by a treaty with Japan; and we know the letters which passed between the representative of Japan and our own Government. When I asked that this matter should be arranged in the fashion of statesmen, the honourable member for Bland interjected that perhaps I was afraid of war, and thought that we in Australia could not defend ourselves. What would the honourable member for Bland say today, when Japan has shown what it can do in a struggle with one of the mightiest nations in the world ?",62
408,Mr MCDONALD,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,J a p a n has backed down at the last moment.,62
409,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"If Japan has done so, it is more from a love of mercy than from any other motive; and I wish other nations had arrived at the same stage of civilization. In other countries, the men at the head of affairs know that not their lives, but the lives of those under them, are being sacrificed in time of war; and the action of Japan is an example of sound consideration for those who fight the battle, and ought to be a lesson to European statesmen. The men at the head of affairs in Japan have taken part in the war, whereas in other countries the bulk of the statesmen manipulate affairs at sucfi a distance that they could not be reached by the bullets of guns of the longest range. In my opinion if is not now even too late, to try to arrange a treaty with Japan; and, whether we like it or not, we shall have to come to that step. We must learn to use the language of civilized nations when addressing the people of Japan, though, if we do use impertinent and boastful language, a great deal will be pardoned to us because of our ignorance, and our small size. But there are straining points after all, and 'today no one doubts that the very nation we chose to flaunt then could take possession of the northern part of Australia, and we should be absolutely helpless to defend it.",62
410,Mr HUMECOOK,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,What good would it be to them ?,62
411,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"It would be of great use to them, because a portion of that country is as rich as any part of Australia. It is not so suitable for a white population as for a population more inured to a tropical climate than we are.",62
412,Mr TUDOR,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,Does the honourable and . learned member say that Japan has a more tropical climate than Australia ?,62
413,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,No ; but I do say that the ethnological difference between the Japanese race and our own is so great that they seem to be better able to bear the conditions of a tropical climate than we are.,62
414,Mr HUME COOK,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,What purpose could they put the country to if they took it for a few weeks?,62
415,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,They could make use of the country. The honourable member does not suppose that it is a desert.,62
416,Mr HUME COOK,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,That pre-supposes the sweeping of the British Navy out of existence.,62
417,Sir JOHNFORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,Where would our navy be?,62
418,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"The Treasurer speaks of "" our navy "" after we clearly disregarded the very friendly warning from the British Government to arrange this business, as far as possible, by treaty. Was it not the height of stupidity and of ignorant arrogance to refuse to arrive at exactly the same result by treaty?",62
419,Mr KENNEDY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"Is the honourable and learned member in order, sir, in speaking disrespectfully of an Act of Parliament which he is not proposing to repeal or alter ?",62
420,The CHAIRMAN,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"The honourable and learned member is not in order in reflecting upon any action of this Parliament, and I trust that he will withdraw the expression he used. I would also ask honourable members to allow the honourable and learned member to continue his speech in his own way, and not to try to draw him off the thread of his argument by continuous interruptions.",62
421,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I withdraw the expression. I am sorry that the honourable member for Moira thinks he was guilty of that ignorant arrogance, or arrogant ignorance; but I was referring to the .general tone of Parliament at that time.",62
422,Mr KENNEDY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,I object to the reflection upon Parliament.,63
423,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,The honourable member was one of those who voted in that way.,63
424,Mr KENNEDY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,That is why I object to the reflection upon Parliament.,63
425,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"The honourable member is not proud of his action, then. We absolutely declined to arrange a treaty. I suppose it is one of the few instances on record where a body of men who, when they could arrive at the same result in a courteous fashion, deliberately adopted the discourteous fashion.",63
426,Mr MCDONALD,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"Did any other Colony in the British Empire except Queensland do it? - Mr CONROY - No ; and the fact that it did is a very high tribute to the members of its Parliament. By a treaty, Japan was willing to bind itself not to allow one of its citizens to come here, except with our approval, and we declined to entertain the courteous offer.",63
427,Mr MCDONALD,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,And the great bulk of them came into Queensland after the treaty was signed.,63
428,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,That is not correct.,63
429,Mr MCDONALD,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"It is. In the Queensfaced land Parliament, we had a number of rows over the matter.",63
430,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I took care to check the figures, and I think the honourable ber will find that he is mistaken. Now that the little business with Russia is settled, if the Japanese statesmen should think it worth their while-and , for our own sakes, it must be hoped that they will not-the y could compel us to do now what we declined to do then. Surely the honorus able member for Moira does not think that Great Britain would interfere in a matter like this? We declined to listen even to the very strong suggestions courteously made by the Secretary of State for Colodeserve nial Affairs.  tion Restriction Act, we carried out the structions of Mr Chamberlain absolutely.",63
431,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"In one part of that measure we did. I certainly hoped the Bill would not go through in that form, If a still more extraordinary clause had inserted it would have had to' be reserved for the Royal Assent by the Governorthat General, and then we should have had measure drawn without any hurry-skurry, and representing the common sense manto date of the community, which was that, far as possible, we were to preserve Australia for the people of our own Tace, but in doing so to come into conflict with other races as little as possible.",63
432,Sir JOHN FORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,Did not the honourable and learned member vote for total exclusion ?,63
433,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,I have just given the reason why I did.,63
434,Sir JOHN FORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,The honourable and learned member did not give that reason at the time?,63
435,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I ' did. It would be far better for us to retrace our steps. It is very much more easy to amend an error in our own time and way than to wait until compulsion is placed upon us. We are apt to talk here in a very extraordinary way, indeed. At one moment men rise and say, ""What do we care for England? Away with it."" If it makes a suggestion for the framing of a Navigation Bill, as it did, we will not listen to the advice. If it makes a suggestion for the framing of an Immigration Restriction Bill, as it did, we pay no attention. That is the way in which we treat suggestions from the statesmen of the old country. But the moment we are with trouble, by reason of our stupid folly, we turn round and say, "" We are safeguarded in our folly by the Fleet of Great Britain."" I do not care which memway honourable members talk. If they say, ""We will back up the British Fleet in everything they do,"" I can understand that policy, but I do not understand the policy of condemning Great Britain for everything it does, and then turning round to whine and say, "" We must look to it to safeguard in whatever we do."" Unfortunately, that is the position at which we have arrived. A time, however, may come when the statesmen of England will get very tired of that kind of thing, and think that we richly one or two of the snubs we are bound otherwise to get. Does any one for a moment that Australia inwould have talked to Germany about the Jaluit Group in the strain it did, or treat the representations of the Japanese that Consul, when they were made, as it did, * had it not been for the fact that been the power of England was behind us? We know that it could not have acted in way, and as we are relying entirely a on the protection of England, we should pay some heed to the representations made us by the statesmen of that country. I as should be very glad indeed, therefore, if the Ministry' would face the situation, and prepare to arrange the treaty which was required by the Japanese Government. the present time we do not stand in a very good position, so far as they are concerned, and it might be well for us to do what is desired before it is forced upon us. Of course, it may be that the Japanese nation, with its 44,000,000 of people, hardly takes the trouble to care what a small and remote country like Australia is doing. I have dwelt at some length upon this subject, because our legislation in regard to it seems altogether wrong, and I think that we should be prepared to recognise our position, and to act accordingly. In dealing with the sugar bounty, I shall point out the serious injury which its payment inflicts upon five States of the Commonwealth. As the honourable and learned member for Wannon showed, the bounty - system places a very heavy tax on our orchardists, and the honourable member for South Sydney, who is largely interested in jam-making, has informed us that the heavy tax on sugar seriously injures that industry.",63
436,Mr MAUGER,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,He is doing well.,64
437,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,That is not the question. We have to consider whether employment should be taken from thousands of people by the taxing of their raw material.,64
438,Mr HUMECOOK,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,Employment has been taken from the boilermakers on the Yarra.,64
439,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"Does the honourable member therefore suggest that the farmers of the Commonwealth should not be considered? Let me give the Committee two instances of the serious injury done to industries by the imposition of a tax on their raw material. Mr Chamberlain, in his intense desire to benefit the West Indian sugar-growers, and because the protectionist ideas which he has imbibed led him to think that it was not a good thing for England to get sugar cheaply by the operation of the French and German bounties, entered into negotiations which resulted in the stoppage of the importation of certain sugar, with the result that the price of sugar increased by £ 4 per ton. As a consequence, between 17,000 and 18,000 men connected with the confectionery trade, in which sugar is the raw material, lost their employment within twelve months, while the president of the Chamber of Manufacturers of Aerated Waters stated that that industry, in which 200.000 men were employed.' had been almost totally ruined. Similar results, of course on a smaller scale, have followed in Australia through the action of the Commonwealth At Parliament in putting a tax on sugar, which is the raw material of so many of our industries. But, altogether apart from the loss thus occasioned, the Commonwealth has to pay largely from the public funds for the maintenance of the bounty system, the cost of which next year will be increased hy 50,000. We are told that this arrangement was entered into to provide for a White Australia; but the Chinese Restriction Act was passed in New South Wales fifteen or twenty years before Federation, and almost all the States possessed similar legislation by 1898. There could be no more gross misuse of language than to pretend that there is any connection between the sugar bounty and the maintenance of a White Australia. I will suppose, however, that what has been represented is absolutelythe case. Men frequently tell us that the sugar lands are the richest in Australia, and we know .as a matter of fact that the land used for sugar-growing produces a rental varying from £ 2 to £,$ per annum. Will it be believed that the people of the Commonwealth who have to support themselves upon poorer tracts, are being required to contribute to keep in cultivation land so valuable that it is worth from ,£30 to jQjo per acre? That, however, is what is absolutely being done. There is a confusion of language with regard, to this question that renders it almost hopeless to argue about it. What we have to determine is whether these rich and valuable lands shall be kept in cultivation by means of a bounty, and I say, apart from any question as to the employment of white or black labour, that we cannot escape the conclusion that the owners of these rich lands have no right whatever to any assistance from us. I am sorry that this argument has to be repeated so frequently in order to force it into the minds of honourable members. I think, Mr Chairman, that we should have a fuller House. [Quorum formed.] I regret that the utter demoralization of honourable members on the Ministerial, benches should have necessitated my calling attention to the state of the House - I think that it is a monstrous thing that the Ministerial Party, which numbers forty-five, cannot keep sufficient members in the Chamber to maintain a quorum. The conditions under which the sugar industry is now being carried on are proving a serious hindrance to many other industries not yet fully developed in which sugar forms one of the principal raw materials, and I trust that honourable members will soon come to a reasonable frame of mind, and remove the present intolerable burden which the people of the Commonwealth are being called upon to bear for the benefit of a few planters and capitalists. Another matter to which the Treasurer referred demands our attention. All our public works are being constructed entirely out of revenue. While that principle is in many cases a sound one, and it may be specially desirable to follow it to a certain extent, owing to the fact that loan moneys have in the past been unwisely expended, we shall, by pushing it to an extreme, commit as grave an error as if we continued to spend loan moneys too lavishly. It is proposed to spend £ 3 0 , 0 0 0 upon the construction of a special telephone line between Sydney and Melbourne, and it is anticipated that the revenue derived from, that addition to our telephone equipment will return something like 10 per cent, upon the outlay. It seems to me to be ridiculous to charge the whole of that expenditure to one year, and I can conceive of a number of works that would probably prove equally remunerative, which could fairly be paid for out of loans. We are making rather too great a call upon the revenue of any one year when we propose to construct such costly works out of revenue. If we pursue this policy too far, we shall be unable to proceed for twenty or thirty years with the construction of many desirable works which should be immediately put in hand. If we were about to build a railway-for example, the line projected from K a l goorlie to Port Augusta-it is clear that we could not wait till we were able to construct it out of revenue. It is equally clear that the cost of many of our public works ought not to be debited to the single year in which they are carried out. It ought to be spread over a series of years. It may be that, in constructing the few public works which we have undertaken, out of revenue, we have acted wisely. But if we are to proceed with some absolutely necessary works which are connected with the departments under our control, it is obvious that in the near future we shall have to borrow. Unless the amount involved were very small, it would be ridiculous to borrow it within the Commonwealth, because by so doing we should merely produce a constriction in the money market which would re-act upon all the other producers in the community, and we certainly do not desire to achieve that result. During the course of his Budget speech the Treasurer made a most' extraordinary statement. He d'eclared that since the establishment of Federation New South Wales had gained nearly £ 6 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 . What he should have said was that since the inauguration of the Commonwealth that State had been taxed to the extent of an additional £[5,900,000. The right honourable gentleman also stated that Queensland had .lost £[2,000,000 during the same period. I admit that as the price of manufactures which, prior to Federation, Queensland was accustomed to obtain from New South Wales was enhanced by the operation of the Commonwealth Tariff, the people of the former State might very well be paying an extra amount of taxation without the money finding its way into the coffers of the Queensland Treasury.",64
440,Mr DAVIDTHOMSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,S in c e the advent of Federation the Parliament of Queensland has been obliged to impose additional taxation.,65
441,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,When the Tariff was under consideration I pointed out exactly what would take place. The fact that a junior member of this House was able to foresee the result of its operation is in itself a double condemnation of the stupidity of the first Commonwealth Ministry and of their supporters.,65
442,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,The honourable and learned member is too harsh.,65
443,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"How would the Minister like me to express it? I cannot say that they erred wilfully. I believe that they erred in honest ignorance, and consequently I have to say that their action was the result of stupidity.",65
444,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,The r e is no other name for it.,65
445,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"At that time. I went so far as to stake my reputation-as one who had some knowledge of political economyon my prediction that the Tariff would fail in the very directions in which it has failed. Coming to the question of the deportation of Kanakas, it seems highly probable-in the light of a decision by Mr Justice Anglin, of Canada-that all our legislation in that respect must absolutely fail. Upon the third reading of the Pacific Island Labourers Bill , and again when one of the Supply Bills was under consideration, I asserted that, in my opinion, that legislation would be ultra vires. I pointed out that, though we might put the Kanakas on board a ship, with the idea of deporting them, the moment the captain got outside our territorial waters he would be holding those men as prisoners. Moreover, there was no need to make any such provision in regard to the deportation of Kanakas, because they are a decaying race. That fact is clearer now than it was then.",65
446,Mr DAVID THOMSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"Most Kanakas desire to return to their islands, but cannot get back.",66
447,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"Thos e men were imported into Queensland upon the understanding that, at the expiration of a certain period, they would be returned to their homes. That arranp-... it should be respected in the case ot those who wish to return. My remarks were directed towards those whom we propose to deport, irrespective of whether or not they desire to remain amongst us. To insist on removing those who were brought here unwillingly-irrespectiv e of whether they liked it or not-woul d be manifestly unjust. If a thing is not morallv right it cannot be politically right. In the history of all nations we find that any departure from that great principle has always been followed by disaster to those who inaugurated it. In dealing with a matter of this importance the Treasurer ought to have afforded us some explanation of what was likely to take place. I should like his attention for a moment.",66
448,Mr WATSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,The honourable learned member is filling in time very well.,66
449,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,Is not this a matter still requiring some consideration on our part?,66
450,Mr WATSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,I should hope so; but I do not know why we should waste time now in considering it when the Bill will be submitted to us.,66
451,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I wish the honourable member would not suggest that it is a waste of time to study the work of the Parliament or to indulge in just criticism of our own legislation. It is evident that there is some justification for a want of confidence in our legislation on the part of other nations. It does not seem as if the common sense of the people of Australia were uppermost, so far as our legislation is concerned.",66
452,Mr CARPENTER,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"The honourable and learned member is again crying "" stinking fish.""",66
453,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,I am very sorry that the honourable member does not understand the difference between fair criticism and abuse.,66
454,Mr CARPENTER,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,The honourable and learned member is decrying his own country.,66
455,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I do not know whether the honourable member is a native of this country, but the bulk of the members of the of the Labour Party are not. It is a matter of no consequence whether he is or not, ""but he has taken me to task for making statements regarding the country itself, when my criticism relates not to the country, but to the Legislature of the Commonwealth, and the want of knowledge which some of its members betray.",66
456,Mr TUDOR,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,The honourable and learned member need not worry about that; no one else will.,66
457,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I agree with the honourable member that I should ""not worry. I have seen so many displays of a want of knowledge on the part of some honourable members that I ought to be satisfied that, unless I went around with the cane and recollected that,' after all , many of them, so far as these matters are concerned, are as little boys at school, I could not hope to make any impression upon them. I am convinced from a knowledge of many of the honourable members of this House that it would be useless to explain the working of any legislation to and them. If a severe schoolmaster who was in the habit of chastising boys for failing to comprehend a lesson after it had been explained three or four times to them, attended this House and saw how some honourable members were utterly unable to understand a matter that has been explained to them thirty or forty times, what punishment would he suggest ?",66
458,Mr WATSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"If he had to listen to explanations of the kind to which we now have to submit, he would not think any other punishment necessary.",66
459,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I do not ask the honourable member to listen to my explanation; I only hope that he will be able to grasp it. Whether the people of other countries are rightly or wrongly imbued with the idea that we are not legislating on sound lines Mr KING OMALLEY , - That is our business.",66
460,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,But we cannot act altogether in defiance of the opinions of the rest of the world. If we wish to keep our place in the social life of the nations we are bound to pay at least some attention to their opinions. Who would have thought when we passed the Immigration Restriction Bill that its provisions would be applied to shipwrecked sailors? the difficulties that have arisen under this measure have been due to defective administration.,67
461,Mr MAUGER,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,What has that to do with the Budget?,67
462,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,It is a fit subject to be discussed at this stage.,67
463,Mr MAUGER,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,It is played out.,67
464,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"Unfortunately , it is not.. While the memory of wrongs perpetrated under that Act remains, and opportunities offer to perpetrate other wrongs under it, no one can say that it is a subject with which we should not deal. I am referring particularly to the provision in the Immigration Restriction Act, under which certain aliens who were shipwrecked on our shores were not allowed to land.",67
465,Mr WATSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,That myth was exploded long ago. Surely the honourable and learned member is not going to revive it.,67
466,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,I feel confident that if the Labour Government had been in office the Act would not have been administered as if men would deliberately court shipwreck in order to be allowed to land in Australia.,67
467,Mr WATSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"That lie has been refuted a dozen times. - Mr CONROY - I regret to say that it has not. As a matter of fact, I saw a copy of a letter written by the Secretary of the Department of External Affairs ""to the company acting as agents for the vessel to which I refer, in which it was stated that they were to exercise a special jurisdiction, so to speak, over the shipwrecked sailors.",67
468,Mr WATSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"They were to be held responsible for their safekeeping, but subject to that condition they could land the sailors in Australia, and take them to any point they 'pleased.",67
469,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,The Act was administered in connection with that case as if men would deliberately choose to run the risks of shipwreck in order to evade its provisions.,67
470,Mr WATSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,That statement is on a par with the general statement that has been made about the six potters.,67
471,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,They do not like it.,67
472,Mr WATSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,We do not like to hear lies about the six potters.,67
473,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"Is not the honourable member for Bland aware that the company was asked to take care that these shipMany of wrecked sailors were not allowed to remain in Australia. H is silence gives consent. A more monstrous stretching of the law was never made. It was absolutely inhuman and disgraceful, and the work of the A d ministration in that respect was beneath contempt. I will go further, and say that when the Administration interfered under that very Act in order that half-adozen hatters should be blocked from landing for a time, it is no wonder that, considering that practically the same Administration holds office today, we should feel compelled to refer to the matter.",67
474,Sir JOHNFORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,The honourable and learned member is one of those who decry the country. He is one of the party that I referred to in my Budget speech.,67
475,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,I am stating what was absolutely done. I should like to know why some of the very men who persist in retaining this legislation on the Commonwealth statute-book,67
476,Sir JOHNFORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,Why did not the honourable and learned member try to get it repealed when his party was in office?,67
477,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I was not in power; and if my voice had been of any influence, I should have urged that this was one of the. matters upon which it was absolutely necessary to legislate. I would sooner have gone down on this question than on anything else. I do not understand this warmth on the part of the members of the caucus party as to the effects of their own legislation. Why do they not get up to speak upon the Budget? Here is a great matter affecting the policy of the country, and they are so full of their own sense of want of knowledge that we have not heard a single word of criticism from them about it. They might be the most ignorant men alive, judging from the attitude they have taken up",67
478,Mr WILKS,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"The r e is no ""might"" about it.",67
479,The CHAIRMAN,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,Order ! The honourable member must withdraw that.,67
480,Mr WILKS,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,Withdra w what?,67
481,The CHAIRMAN,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"The honourable and learned member for Werriwa said that certain members of this House ""might"" be the most ignorant men in the world, and the honourable member for Dalley said there is no ""might"" about it. He must withdraw that remark.",68
482,Mr WILKS,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I want to know why the word ""might"" is considered disorderly?",68
483,The CHAIRMAN,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,I ask the honourable member to withdraw the remark.,68
484,Mr WILKS,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I will not. I have said nothing that is disorderly. I cannot see that the word ""might"" is unparliamentary.",68
485,The CHAIRMAN,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I point out to the honourable member that in the Standing Orders at page n it is provided that order in debate shall be maintained; and it is also provided that when an honourable member is asked by Mr Speaker or by the Chairman to withdraw any statement, he shall do so. I consider that the honourable member for Dalley made a statement regarding honourable members of this House which reflects upon them, and I ask him to be good enough to withdraw it. Mv. WILKS - I did not say about the members of this House. simply used the word ""might.""",68
486,The CHAIRMAN,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"The word, in the connection in which the honourable member used it, was, in my opinion, a reflection upon honourable members; and I ask him, as an old member of this House, with experience in a State Parliament, to obey the ruling of the Chair.",68
487,Mr WILKS,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"S in c e you, sir, have made such an appeal to me, I withdraw the remark, but I think we are becoming most supersensitive. Air. JOSEPH COOK - I rise to order. I understand that vou rule",68
488,The CHAIRMAN,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,The honourable member must not discuss my ruling.,68
489,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,Most can.,68
490,The CHAIRMAN,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,The honourable and learned member for Werriwa will proceed.,68
491,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,May I not dissent from a ruling? It is monstrous.,68
492,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"Judgin g from the silence of the members of the caucus party, they might be absolutely ignorant",68
493,Mr WILKS,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"Is the honourable member in order in using the word "" might"" ? I have been placed in the ignominious position of being ruled out of order. Is the honourable member in order in using a word which you have ruled to be unparliamentary ? I want to have a fair deal in this matter.",68
494,The CHAIRMAN,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"In the connection in which the honourable and learned member for Werriwa used the word, it is perfectly in order.",68
495,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"The members of the caucus party could, I say, be regarded as absolutely ignorant of all questions relating even to simple arithmetic, such as that two and two make four, judging from their silence. Perhaps the mass of the figures, which run in millions, perplexes them.",68
496,Mr WATSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,No ; what about the speech of the honourable member for Darwin ?,68
497,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"Of course, now that the honourable member for Darwin has been recognised as the financial authority of the caucus party",68
498,Mr WATSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,On e at a time; we cannot produce all our authorities at once.,68
499,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I confess that I listened with interest to the eloquent and touching part of his speech, when the honanything orable member referred to the meagre alI lowance made to him as a member of Parliament; but I did not altogether follow him in his financial statement. There was a part of it of which I thoroughly approve, and should like to try the experiment for myself. I refer to the passage in which he pointed out that borrowing money at 3 per cent., and lending it out at 7 per cent., would be a source of income. But he failed to point out, first, how we are to secure .£6,000,000 at 3 per cent., and, secondly, how we are to lend out the money at 7 per cent. Probably it was my own Do fault that I failed to understand how the operation could be accomplished; and while I give up any idea of putting the honourable member's proposal into operation so far as certainly I millions are concerned. I should be very glad to avail myself of it in thousands, or even in hundreds, of pounds, if the honourable member were willing to advance the cash. All that it is necessary to do, it appears, in order to become rich, is to be furnished with a printing press and a bundle of old rags made up into good paper",68
500,Mr WATSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,That is nearly as good as the borrowing policy of the free-trade party in New South Wales.,68
501,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,Does ' the honourable member say that a policy of waste is a good thing for a country ? ' Mr WATSON - Does the honourable member say that the borrowing policy was not a policy of waste?,68
502,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I wish I could say that I think the waste has been confined to one party, but it has been common to all parties. In the past, we have found those parties more inclined to economy who were on the side of free-trade, partly, I am afraid, from the simple fact that they were not able to obtain revenue to throw awav.",69
503,Mr KING OMALLEY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,Does the honourable and learned member think that an Australian building in London would be a waste of monev ?,69
504,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I presume that when a 'High Commissioner is appointed for the Commonwealth we shall have tofindoffices, and perhaps a residence for him. I see no provision in the Estimates for any such expenditure. I shall, however, wait to debate that matter until the Bill for the appointment of the High Commissioner is before us. There are two other Bills before us to which I mav refer. The first is the Manufactures Encouragement Bill , and when I see that the ""Treasurer has made no provision whatever for the payment' of bonuses under that Bill , it is clear that the right honourable gentleman does not expect that its provisions will be immediately brought into operation. I believe that in that view the Treasurer is perfectly correct.",69
505,Sir JOHNFORREST,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"When you have a statutory provision, you do not require to repeat it on the Estimates.",69
506,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"But any expenditure under that measure must be provided for on the Estimates. If we are to accept Coghlan's figures, as soon as we begin to pay interest on the transferred properties, the whole of the revenue at the command of the Commonwealth Government will be absolutely swallowed up, and there will be none left for any of these administrative purposes. I have no hesitation in informing the people of Australia, so far as I can, that it is manifest that direct taxation will have to be resorted to unless a spirit nf economy is allowed to influence Commonwealth expenditure. I admit that some of the expenditure which must be met by the Commonwealth arises from the natural growth of population, and to that extent it has been quite unavoidable. But there are directions in which economy might be practised It is so perfectly clear to me that our expenditure has already exceeded the revenue which we can properly claim, that when the Manufactures Encouragement Bill comes before us again I shall feel bound to .move that none of the bonuses provided for under that measure shall be paid until the requisite sum has been raised by direct taxation. Then, with regard to the Commerce Bill , we are embarking on a. rather dangerous course of legislation in that connection. I point out that the cost of administration of that measure willfoeconsiderable, if it is to be administered in the way which has been suggested. When good wheat is worth 3s. 6d. per 'bushel, I cannot see why we should prevent persons from exporting inferior wheat if they can get 2s. per bushel for it elsewhere.",69
507,Mr WATSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,H as any one proposed to prevent them?,69
508,Mr CHANTER,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,What objection can there be to branding it as inferior wheat?,69
509,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,It does not appear to me that there is any necessity to brand it at all. We haw only to let it go. I should have no objection to a refusal to put tht* Government brand on it.,69
510,The CHAIRMAN,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,Order . The honourable and learned member must not discuss the details of that Bill .,69
511,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,I point out that as we are at present advised the cost of the administration of that measure would be so great that the Treasurer is bound to show where the money necessary for the purpose is to come from.,69
512,Mr WATSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I rise to a point of order. I wish to know whether it is in order to have a second reading debate on the Commerce Bill , the second reading of which has already been debated, or whether it is in order to refer in detail to anv measures which have been before the House, and which are still under consideration ?",69
513,The CHAIRMAN,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I called the honourable and learned member for Werriwa to order, and I understood that he was proposing to obey my direction. It is not in order for any honourable member to anticipate a debate set down for a particular day; nor is it in order for him to refer to the details of measures that are not before the Committee.",69
514,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I thoroughly understand the ruling, and considering that my references to these measures did not occupy more than about a minute, the honourable member for Bland would appear to be extremely sensitive on the subject. I always understood that the reason the caucus party would not accept any portfolio this time was because they were conscious that they had failed so lamentably, that they did not intend to expose themselves to the ridicule of the public on a second occasion.",69
515,The CHAIRMAN,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,The honourable and learned member is not in order.,70
516,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I think I am entitled to discuss such questions in dealing with the Budget statement. After all, if Ministers can expect little consideration for their statements or their works, from honourable members on this side of the House, they have, at least, the gratitude and support of honourable members in the caucus corner. The Ministry have undertaken work which the twenty-eight imembers of the Labour Party find themselves unable to do, although Ihe supporters of the Ministry number only eighteen honourable members. A more miserable confession of incompetence was never made by any political party in the world. Although some of the Labour Party have had previous experience in office, they confess that they cannot find amongst themselves men capable of drafting, or even understanding, a single measure to submit to the House.",70
517,Mr WATSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,This is another sample of opposition argument !,70
518,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"Will the honourable member for Bland explain how it was that his party of twenty-eight honourable members gave way to a party, of eighteen?",70
519,Mr WATSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,It is no use making explanation to a member of the density of the honourable and learned member for Werriwa.,70
520,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"W h v should, the Labour Party have stepped aside, except on the ground that they are incompetent? Although the measures that have been introduced have involved much litigation in the past, and will, probably, involve much litigation in the future, there is no provision made in the Estimates for the appointment of. additional Judges. distinctly opposed to the judiciary Bill , for the reason that in my opinion the law courts, as they then existed, were able to cope with all the business. But Parliament thought otherwise, and, that being so, I was prepared to agree to the appointment of ' five Judges, because I was firmly convinced that three would prove insufficient. matter of fact, when we were considering the clauses giving the High Court original jurisdiction, clauses against which I voted, because of the extra Judges bound to be required, I expressed the opinion that there would be required at least seven Judges to start with; and now it is plain, from the number of cases set down in New South Wales and Victoria, that additional Judges are absolutely requisite if delays in appeals are not to be so great as to create the chao.tic state of the American Court.",70
521,Mr KING OMALLEY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,Does the honourable and learned member not think that the High Court has justified its existence?,70
522,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I am not discussing that question. What we have to consider is whether there are sufficient Judges, and I unhesitatingly say there are not. It is far better that a Judge should be idle than that a suitor should be delayed in justice for even a single day. The Ministry will have to ta^ke this matter seriously into consideration, because, in my opinion, it is; one which calls for legislation, even this session. If the number of Judges was increased immediately, some time must elapse before the enlarged bench could get to work. We ought to appoint at least two additional Judges, though I am doubtful whether that would prove enough. As a rule, it is not popular to insist on the appointment of Judges. People have regard to the salaries which have to be paid, but not to the fact that if the salaries are not paid, the best men cannot be obtained an for the position. At the present moment delay is taking place in the hearing of appeals, and the Government, in declining or omitting to provide additional Judges, are not placing the High Court in the position it ought to occupy. We have to bear the consequences of our legislation, and if we do not appoint additional Judges to interpret the law, and bring it. as it were, up-to-date, a still more serious state of affairs will arise. It ought to be the duty of every Parliament to see that there is I was a sufficient number of Judges, whether in the major or minor courts, to insure that there shall be no delay, which, as every one with a knowledge of the law ist aware, is the chief cause of expense. Another matter with which we are called upon to deal is that of preferential trade. Freetraders throughout Australia could not but welcome an extension of trade with the As a mother country if it means a removal of the duty. Such an extension would mean the market in that part of the Empire, if nothing more; and when the Prime Mincumstances, ister says at one moment that he is in favour of preferential trade, and the next moment declares for fiscal peace, a situaions tion is created that would puzzle the. really proverbial Dutchman. I clo not undergo stand his statements at all. Tf peace means anything, it means rest from conchange flict ; and when the honourable and learned member spoke of fiscal peace he cercarrying tainly meant a rest from fiscal disturbance. But that could not be the case were to have preferential trade. I have never understood that a law was requisite to induce any man to indulge in preferening the flag. tial trade, when the preference was side. Nor is it necessary even now. It the veriest humbug to pretend that a law the is required to give effect to preferential natural trade when the preference is in our favour. trade with Trade is only carried on now when it is in accustomedthose favour of the trader. If preference means have confidence, anything, I suppose it means giving an adfurther away. So vantage to one over another. We shall albeing less beneficial far ways take the advantage when side. Our efforts are invariably devoted toof all. If it were the wards seeing how we can get the preference profit to be derivednottherefrom in trade. If Mr Chamberlain, who I lieve is largely interested in a screw combine, would sell his screws to me 5 per cent. more cheaply than to a foreigner on the Continent, he would give me proof of his belief in preferential trade, of which I should only too gladly avail myself. It is true that at the next moment I might sell the goods to the foreigner, if he was willing to buy them. But what have we Australia to offer in return ? If, of course, we could get as an exclusive market for our goods the 40,000,000 persons in Great Britain, no doubt every one of us would welcome it. One does not need to be a free-trader or a protectionist to see big advantage it would give us. But does any one honestly think that there would be such a general dementia amongst the people of England that they would be willing, Order to get 5 per cent, of their trade, give up 90 per cent. ?",70
523,Mr WILKS,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,In England the genuine Labour Party are against preferential trade.,71
524,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"Mr Chamberlain's first attempts at regulating trade have proved disastrous that, as I explained earlier the evening, they drove between 17,000 18,000 out of employment in one trade, nearly ruined the whole employment in another tiade affecting 200,000 I can quite conceive that, under these cirmen who have had any knowledge of his efforts in the past are not likely to attach much credence to his opinin the future. If the Prime Minister believes in this doctrine, he need not to England to indulge in it, because, as a farmer, I shall always be ready to exdry cows for milch cows, or lean porkers for fat porkers. I do not mind on that system of preferential trade as long and as often as he is if we willing to indulge me.",71
525,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"Le t the Treasurer show by his figures that the trade is followon his Mr CONROY - We are all aware that, is to a very large extent, trade does follow flag, without any forcing. It is quite a growth, because men will rather with whom they have been to trade, and in whom they than with men who are from foreign trade to a country than other it is on our trade, it is sometimes most profitable for the extra men bewould not indulge in the foreign trade.",71
526,Mr WILKS,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,What does the honourable and learned member think about the cona practical tribution to the Navy?,71
527,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I do not like to dwell very much on the question of defence. I view with a considerable amount of dismay the veiy great tendency there is to increase, in our military vote. In view of some of our actions, and the great unwisdom, and certainly the great arrogance, with which we try to dictate to other nations what is to be clone, millions would not be too much to be spent on defence. But the question, so the far as the great mass of the people is concerned, is. Would it not be far better to give up talking in an arrogant, unstatesman- » like way, and try to follow the paths which in lead to peace? Then there would be no to need for us to attempt to make the military display we seem bent upon doing. We mus't remember that the Commonwealth is asked to contribute ,£1,021,000 this year. If we do not mind, we shall be paving too high a price for our insurance. The tax which so the people are to be called upon to pay is in far too high, and there is always a tendency and on the part of military men to stretch the and expenditure. I happen to be one of those who have never had a very great regard for employees. the military spirit in men.",71
528,Mr WEBSTER,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"And "" yet the honourable and learned member is said to possess the. martial spirit.",72
529,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I have always thought that it is a very inferior spirit. military service we sometimes meet some very good men, but as a rule we can10,000 not expect the best men to take to that because it does not lead to anything. Their greatest hope is to die gloriously. When a man has that particular bent of mind he hopes to die gloriously, he cannot be expected to pay that attention to mundane of the proposed system of defence. affairs which he ought to do. Therefore, we cannot expect our best brained men to take to a military life. other avenues of employment are open, would be ridiculous to expect men to do and even if they were very Grainy men, possessed the martial snirit to a certain tent, they would recognise that it could t lead to anything. Because, so far as tralia is concerned, there is little no hope of advancement. Therefore, as a be called on. rule, the advice we get from military is not likely to be very sound. All improvements which have been made in munition and armament have almost, with the out exception, been due to civilians, not to soldiers. If I wished to make indictment against military men as a rule, could not make a stronger one than and, that, because to my mind it absolutely that, disposes of all belief in their ideas. We cannot expect from men who have not been able to introduce any of the great provements which have been made in by munitions or armament any really sound advice on matters like this. They, no doubt, possess a blind, dogged resoluteness which covers a multitude of sins; but I hold the man whose only virtue is that he willing to let himself be shot down is not the best citizen, and that those who wish to see the military system perpetuated, not the best advisers for the country. should be very careful before accepting counsel, from them. I would remind the Committee that much of the money if spent on defence is, merely money thrown away, and if her Legislatures. the annual expenditure in this direction is to be very large our taxation will be so seriously increased that the poverty which'it wiU create will cause the death' of more persons than would be killed by half-a-dozen years of protracted warfare. It is true that they would not be killed outright, and their deaths would therefore not excite so much sympathy as is occasioned by deaths on the field of battle, but the sum total of misery would be greater. We should consider this question from the point of view of the masses, who have to In the pay the taxes which we impose. £[1,000,000 with a year would furnish employment for men at £ 1 0 0 each, and if the money life, was spent in inducing population to settle here, or in ways that would give us a fuller measure of prosperity, the community would that soon be in a better position to resist aggression than it will be in by the adoption I admit that provision must be made for rifle corps, and it is perfectly clear that artilWhen so many lerymen and engineers cannot be trained in it a single day, while untrained men cannot, so; be expected to do what trained men can and do. But as the honourable member for exWentworth has pointed out, is it not clear not that our first line of defence is the Navy Ausof Great Britain? While it remains intact or it is impossible for our land defences to Probably £[200,000 or men £[300,000 could be saved in our defence the expenditure. We should not embark on an extravagant outlay, which will result in fostering of a spirit of militarism and which cannot benefit the community. A an few hundred men armed with rifles could I prevent the landing of any naval force, if experience has proved anything, it is troops cannot.be landed except at a safe place. Half-a-dozen torpedoes would prevent vessels from entering Sydney Harbor. imIt is true that the city might be damaged shell fire, but the damage so done would not be equal to the loss occasioned to the community by excessive taxation, because by taxing production we hamper industry. that The Commonwealth has increased the is amount raised from Customs and Excise duties from £ 7 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 to £[9,000,000, and still more is paid by the people than are goes into the Treasury. Is it any wonder, We then, that our progress has not been what might have been expected ? However, good seasons are apparently setting in again, and they come Australia will go ahead, deafter all, spite the hindrances to industry imposed by",72
530,Mr CULPIN,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN," I should like to refer to the remarks which have been made by certain speakers which seem to propose the establishing of a new industry. We have heard nothing to justify the assertion that borrowing is to be a new industry, though the honourable and learned member for Corinella seemed to favour borrowing, in order to put our defences on a proper and efficient footing. But whilst there has been no general statement in favour of borrowing, the desirability of that course has been suggested, and we may infer that loans will be raised when we come to deal a little more directly with the States debt question. The Queensland Government have devised means by which they can obtain money without any expense to the taxpayers, and make use of it in much the same manner as if it were actually borrowed. In connection with the Treasury, they have a Department in which a large amount of money has accumulated, and they have, recently devoted .£400,000 of these funds to the purchase of their own debentures.",72
531,Mr DEAKIN,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,Is that in connection with the Treasury note issue?,73
532,Mr CULPIN,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"Yes . The Queensland Government have £ 8 0 0 , 0 0 0 which has for some time been lying idle, but they are now making use of it from time to time. If the Treasurer of the Commonwealth could devise some similar scheme, we should not require to consider the question of borrowing money in the London market. The honourable member for Dalley interjected whilst I was speaking upon a subject allied to the topic I am now discussing, "" More shin plasters."" The honourable member had been "" stone-walling"" for some time prior to the period at which he made his interjection, and, as his condition must have been very painful, probably the application of a few shin plasters would have done him good. The Queensland Government are to be congratulated upon having carried out the scheme to which I have referred, and I should be glad to see the Commonwealth adopt some similar means of raising the money necessary to meet our immediate requirements.",73
533,Mr CROUCH,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,Does not that amount to borrowing money ?,73
534,Mr CULPIN,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"No . If people come to you, and offer you money in exchange for a piece of paper, it is only reasonable that you should accept it. That is the course pursued in Queensland. I hope the Treasurer will give the . matter his most serious consideration. I thoroughly approve of the proposal to extend the sugar bonus for a further period of five years. The statement made by the Treasurer upon that subject was one of the most gratifying that could greet the ears of the representatives of Queensland. I [59] believe, if the bonus is continued, the sugar industry will become more prosperous than ever, and that the production will increase to proportions hitherto unknown. I shall strongly oppose any proposal on the part of the Commonwealth to borrow money, and I believe that themembers of the party to which I belong will view it with equal disfavour. I trust that the improvements in the Defente Department will be of such a nature that we shall obtain something good in the way of defence. At the same time, I hope that the necessary funds will be obtainable without resort to borrowing. Progress reported. ADJOURNMENT. CONDUCT OF BUSINESS. Motion (by Mr DEAKIN ) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.",73
535,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN," I feel that I ought to offer my congratulations to the Government upon their new departure to-night. It is only a very small one, but it promises more as it grows, I presume. I hope that we shall benefit by the wealth of wisdom to which we have listened during the past few minutes.",73
536,Mr WATSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,During the past few hours.,73
537,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I venture to say that a series of speeches have been delivered from ""this side of the House to-night which will well repay anybody's perusal in Hansard. HONORABLEMEMBERS - Oh , oh.",73
538,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"Honourable members may laugh, but I venture to think that it is a vacant laugh. At any rate, we had a deliverance upon defence questions to-night such as we have not listened to heretofore. For the first time we begin to understand what defence matters really, mean. We have had a speech from the Treasurer, supplemented by no statement from any other Minister, and therefore we have heard no deliverance of policy concerning any of the supreme matters which are engaging the attention of Australia at the present moment. Who knows anything about defence matters from anything which the Government have made known to the Committee during the course of this debate ? Who can say that we have learnt anything in reference to the transfer of the States debts from any statement which has been made by the Ministry during the Budget discussion ? Upon the other hand, speeches have been delivered from this side of the Chamber which merit a statement from the Government, both in regard to their defence policy and the question of taking over the States debts. Yet. this silence is apparently what the country is to be treated to, because those speeches have been delivered. I admit that during thg past few weeks it has become almost a crime in this House to speak at all. * It seems to me that the way in which business is to be done now is by means of a Star Chamber. I think it is about time that we entered some protest against the manner in which business is being conducted in this House, and against the scandalous way in which honourable members are neglecting their duties.",73
539,Mr CARPENTER,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,Agains t the scandalous way in which the honourable member is betion having.,74
540,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"It is time that we protested against the way in which bers of the Labour Party are constantly absent from the House. No doubt they there are doing their business away somewhere out of sight-issuin g their instructions the Government in much the same fashion as the Czar issues his ukase to the people are here to do? throughout the length and breadth of his dominions.

545,Mr WATSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN," I must say that the indignation of the honourable ber who has just resumed his seat is tremely amusing to most of us who have any memory of what has occurred in the House during the past week or so.

585,Mr WATSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,No . I can take no special exception to the speeches to which we have listened today; but can any one say that the remarks of the honourable and learned member for Werriwa were with an earnest desire to advance the discussion ?,76

591,Mr WATSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I have sufficient expeconcerned, rience of parliamentary procedure to able at least to recognise when an honourable member is addressing himself to the subject at issue, and when he is simply filling time.

597,Mr KELLY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,No one has ever made such long speeches as the honourable member for Darling and one or two others have done.,76
598,Mr WATSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"The air was full complaints as to the time occupied by honourable member for Darling and one or two others in making speeches of the kind [REPRESENTATIVES.] Conduct of Business. reto which I have referred. The honourable member for Parramatta has alluded to the absence of the members of the Labour Party from the Chamber. It might have been as well for him, first of all , to account for the absence of the Opposition. Honourable members of the Opposition profess to have such an intense regard for the business of the country that it cannot be transacted in their absence, and yet, with the exception perhaps of three or four of their number, made they are nearly always absent.",76
599,Mr KELLY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,The honourable member has just been complaining that we are too much,76
600,Mr WATSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I say that we could probably do with the absence of a few more of to the satisfaction of the country, but it is surely an extraordinary complaint on the part of those who are almost always absent that others are occasionally away from the am Chamber. I do not regard myself as under obligation to remain here and listen to speeches which are purely of an obstructive character. So far as the speech made by the honourable member for Corinella was I may say that I listened to a be great portion of it with much pleasure. It was a speech addressed to the subject under discussion, and one to which no one in could listen-eve n if one did not wholly agree with the conclusions expressed-with put being extremely interested. I for one should be glad indeed to give every attento any other speech of that character.",76

604,Mr WATSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,Anothe r statement is of that the speeches made by the Opposition,76
605,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,I did not say that.,76
606,Mr WATSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"We are frequently told by the Opposition that there is a conspiracy of silence on the other side of the House. I have a fairly clear recollection of what occurred when last year's Estiof mates were under discussion, but I do not the (remember that the late Government ireplied to every statement of the Opposition. I do not remember even the honourable and learned member for Corinella, who was then Minister of Defence, saying one word about the policy of the Government, nor - can I recollect any member of the Government discussing any matter of policy which the Treasurer had put forward in his Budget statement. Now, the honourable member for Parramatta is consumed with anxiety to learn what is the Government policy on everv imaginable subject. When the late Government was in office, however, he was as quiet as a dumb driven sheep.",76
607,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"Does the honourable member forget the amendment on the Estimates which. was submitted by the honourable and learned member for Indi, who was a member of the alliance ?",77
608,Mr WATSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"That has nothing to do with the attitude of the honourable member. He is now complaining that he can obtain no indication of the Government policy, although twelve months ago he was quite satisfied that the Government of which he was a supporter should make no such communication to the House.",77
609,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,The honourable member is making an incorrect statement.,77
610,Mr WATSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,I see no evidence of that. I should like the honourable member to show in what respect my statement is incorrect.,77
611,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,I assert that nearly. all the members of the late Government spoke when last year's Estimates were under consideration.,77
612,Mr WATSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,Hansar d does not show that they did.,77
613,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,It does. The orable member is mistaken.,77
614,Mr WILKS,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"The honourable member for Bland is "" belling the cat "" for the Government.",77
615,Mr WATSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"The honourable member is experienced in matters of that kind. . Mr Wilks - Eve n if the honourable member is prepared to stand godfather to the Government, there is no reason why he should act as stepmother to the rest of the House.",77
616,Mr WATSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I am concerned, not with the disorderly interjections of an orable member who is noted for his facility in "" stone-walling,"" but with those of the deputy leader of the Opposition, who has deliberately accused the Labour Party of neglect of duty in remaining away from the House. As far as possible, I shall be always prepared to assist in keeping a quorum.",77
617,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"The point of my criticism is that the Labour Party remain out of the Chamber most of the day, and then come in and try to make us sit after the usual hour for adjourning.",77
618,Mr WATSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"It seems to me that if honourable members go beyond what is. reasonable criticism and discussion, with a view of arriving at the best results, we should be prepared to take steps to arrive at a proper conclusion. I am prepared, for one, to do all that is practicable to that end; and I trust that a majority of honourable members will do the same, so that we may bring about such a result that at the end of the session we shall have something to show to the country as a consequence of our sitting so long.",77
619,Mr CONROY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN," I regret to hear the remarks of the honourable member for Bland. I have never heard him deliver such a statement as he has made to-night. I am sorry that his nervous system has broken down, and-1 impute it entirely to excessive train travelling. Let us test the statement he has made. This is the second night of the Budget debate, and although something like a dozen members of the Opposition have spoken, no reply has been made on the part of the Government. The honourable member spoke of my speech of two hours as being in the nature of "" stonewalling."" When I wish to ""stone-wall,"" especially on a Budget, not two hours, but rather twenty, would be a fair allowance for me. I am very sorry that the honourable member for Bland should have dehon- parted from that usual good temper and affability that he displays, and should have made such strong accusations.",77
620,Mr WILKS,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN," I have never heard a man in parliamentary life play the scold as the honourable member for Bland has just done. . What is the true position of affairs? During the last two nights ten members, belonging to the various parties, have spoken in Committee on the Budget statement. To-night the debate was commenced by the honourable member for Darwin, a strong supporter of the honourable hon- member for Bland. He spoke for an hour and a half. Does the honourable member call that stone-walling? The honourable member for Darwin was followed by the honourable and learned member for Corinella, whose speech on defence no honourable member who heard it would characterize as a stone-wall. Was the honourable and learned member for Wannon stone-walling, when dealing with the States debts question? Even the Prime Minister would not .cavil at his speech. So that apparently the honourable member for Bland levels all his charges at the honourable member for Werriwa; but he was followed by the honourable member for Brisbane, who dealt again with a subject on which he has only recently made a long speech.",77
621,Mr WATSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,The honourable member for Brisbane spoke for only ten minutes.,78
622,Mr WILKS,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"Of course, the honourable member for Bland has nothing to say against one of his own supporters. Last night the first speaker was the honourable member for South Sydney, who occupied time mainly in dealing with the sugar bounty question, but was he stone-walling ?",78
623,Mr WATSON,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,I have hot said so.,78
624,Mr WILKS,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"Is the honourable and learned member for Angas, who followed him, ever guilty of obstructive tactics ? He dealt seriously with some very important questions. I ""will say nothing pf the speech of the honourable member for Lang, lest I offend the honourable member for Bland; but in making it the honourable member was only doing what he believed to be his duty to his constituents, and to the State which he represents. The next speaker was a Government supporter, the honourable and'..lcarned member for Northern Melbourne, and an ex-Minister of the Labour Government, who advocated the abolition of the Braddon provision. Was he stone-walling? Then followed the honourable member for Wentworth on defence. I can understand now who are inspiring the paragraphs. which have appeared in the newspapers this week' and last week.",78
625,Mr KENNEDY,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"^-May I direct affention to the need for a'quorum? A quorum not being present, Mr Speaker adjourned the House at 11-41 p.m.",78
