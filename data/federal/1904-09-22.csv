Motion (by Mr Reid) agreed toThat questions and general poned until after the conclusion of the debate upon the motion of want of confidence in the Government. PRINTI NG COMMITTEE . Report (No. 6) presented by Mr FOWLER, read by the Clerk, and agreed to. PERSONA LEXPLANATION S.",12
1,Mr MAH ON,Unknown," Yesterday , while the honourable and learned member for Corio was speaking, the Postmaster General, in reply to an interjection, suggested that I had not the courage, when occupying the office which he now fills, to deal with certain tenders giving preference to local manufacturers over foreign competitors. I do not think that it was right for him to charge me with want of courage in the matter. - Mr SYDNEY SMITH - The member ought to relate what led up to my remark.",12
2,Mr MAHON,Unknown,- I have said that the Postmaster-General made the suggestion in reply to an interjection.,12
3,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,An interjection made by the honourable member himself.,12
4,Mr MAHON,Unknown,Yes . Surely the Postmaster-General does not expect me to repeat every detail of the proceedings. I do not wish to occupy the time of the House unduly. I find also a very sarcastic reference to me in the policy speech of the Prime Minister.,12
5,Mr REID,Unknown,Surely sarcastic references should not be the subject of personal explanations.,12
6,Mr MAHON,Unknown,Perhaps the right honourable gentleman will allow me to make my explanation. I do not wish to refer either to him or to the Postmaster-General unnecessarily. This precious pair of political hypocrites may be left to the vengeance of their betrayed and outraged constituents.,12
7,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I ask the honourable member to withdraw the expression "" political hypocrites."" 1004. Mr Reid - Regula r Fenian language that.  order in calling the honourable member for Coolgardie a Fenian ?",12
8,Mr REID,Unknown,I said that his language was Fenian language,12
9,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"If the right honourable gentleman used that expression, I ask business be posthim to withdraw it.",12
10,Mr REID,Unknown,Certainly .,12
11,Mr MAHON,Unknown,I desiie to apologise if I have said anything unparliamentary; but I sat so long behind the right honourable gentleman when he was on this side of the Chamber that perhaps I am to some extent imitating the bad example which he then set.,12
12,Mr REID,Unknown,"The honourable member's head is sore all the time. He should never have taken office. It has been too much for him. . Mr Mahon - I do not feel sore. I hope that the right honourable gentleman will feel his coming doom as little as I felt mine. However, I should like to proceed with my personal explanation. The Postmaster-General charged me with want of courage in connection with the matter to which he referred. He, a professing freehonorable trader, has, since he took office, given, in addition to the Tariff protection, as much as 15 per cent, preference to local manufacturers ; but in charging me with want of courage in the matter he was evidently in ignorance of a question which I answered in this House as far back as the 13th July. On that date I was asked by the honourable member for BourkeWhether fresh tenders are to be called for the supply of telegraph insulators? Whether, other things being equal, or nearly equal, the Postmaster-General will be prepared to give a preference to the Australian-made insulator ? If he will also be prepared to give a preference under similar conditions to Australian made insulator fittings? The Department prepared a reply giving an affirmative answer to all three questions; but when the paper came into my possession, I changed the answers, and I replied to No. 1 ""Yes,"" while in reply to Nos. 2 and 3 I saidThe quality and price being equal, I should be prepared 10 give preference to any article produced in Australia.",12
13,Mr REID,Unknown,That is a shady sort of preference. There is not much in that.,13
14,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"The present Postmaster-General has stated that he is willing give local manufacturers preference to the extent of 15 per cent, in addition to the Tariff protection.",13
15,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,He only says that he did so in certain instances. He does not sav that he is going to do so.,13
16,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"He has done so. He has given them 15 per cent, preference in addition to the protection which they obtain from the Tariff, which he has pronounced to be.a robbery of the people.",13
17,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Is the honourable member now making a personal explanation ?,13
18,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I am attempting to unravel the tangle in which these honourable gentlemen have sought to place my action. I would point out further that, when I declined to deal with those tenders, the Government were on the point of going out of office, and I had no opportunity to bring the matter before the Cabinet. Speaking from memory, when I refused to accept tenders giving a preference to local manufacturers, the matter had not been considered by the Cabinet, and there had been no opportunity to place it before my colleagues. In giving the answer which I did, I acted entirely upon my own initiative, and I think, as I said in the beginning, that the charge of want of courage is not merely unfounded, but comes with very bad grace from a gentleman like the Postmaster-General.",13
19,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,Macquarie) Mr Speaker,13
20,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Does the honourable member propose to discuss the personal explanation just made by the honourable member for Coolgardie?,13
21,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,I wish to make a personal explanation.,13
22,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"It is quite impossible for me to allow debates to take place upon personal explanations. If I permitted a personal explanation made by one honourable member to be replied to by another, there would be nothing to prevent every member of the House from entering into a debate under the cover of a personal explanation. The honourable member for Macquarie has not yet spoken to the motion of want of fidence, and it will be competent for him when he does so to deal with the matter to which reference has been made by the honourable member for Coolgardie. I do not think that' I should allow him to discuss the personal explanation made by the honourable member for Coolgardie. If he wishes to to explain anything in regard to which he has been misunderstood, without discussing the personal explanation just made, the House will be pleased to hear him; but I cannot allow anything in the shape of a discussion of the personal explanation made by the honourable member for Coolgardie.",13
23,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"In regard to the explanation which I think it right to offer, I may state that my honourable friend, in making his explanation just now, omitted to say what led up to and gave reason for my interjection. He interjected something to enable an honourable member who was speaking' from that side of the House to cast a reflection upon me, and I then interjected that he had not the courage to give a decision on this very important matter.",13
24,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,What decision has the honourable member given?,13
25,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"I will tell the honourable member presently. This matter came under my notice when I entered office, as a legacy left me by the honourable member for Coolgardie. I have not the papers before me, but I think that they were submitted to him on the 6th August, with a recommendation that he should accept certain tenders. The honourable member, not when the motion of censure debate was on, but on the 8th August",13
26,Mr GROOM,Unknown,To what motion of censure debate does the Postmaster-General refer?,13
27,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"I mean the debate on the clause in the Arbitration Bill which the Watson Government took as a censure debate. On the 8th August the honourable member for Coolgardie did not deal with the whole of the tenders, but made a minute to the effect that tenders where no preference is involved, "" are approved,"" leaving the more important matter undealt with.",13
28,Mr MAHON,Unknown,Yes ; for Cabinet consideration.,13
29,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,The honourable member did not say for Cabinet consideration.,13
30,Mr MAHON,Unknown,It is not necessary to put down everything. I say it now.,13
31,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,It is no. doubt very convenient to say it now. The honorconable gentleman said just now that the reason why the matter was delayed was because a question affecting the fate of the Government was before Parliament. But the action to which I refer was taken on the 8th August; before that matter was before the House.,13
32,Mr WATSON,Unknown,That ' was not bring it before the Cabinet.,14
33,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Why bring a matter like that before the Cabinet?,14
34,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,I did not submit the matter for the approval of the Cabinet in the! way suggested by the honourable member for Bland.,14
35,Mr MAHON,Unknown,It was brought before the Barton Cabinet.,14
36,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"The honourable member has made his explanation. When this matter was submitted to me, I referred the papers back for information as to the practice of the Department at the time that the tenders were invited, and I received a report from any Under-Secretarv to the effect that the practice of the Department, under the administration of Senator Drake and the honourable member for Denison, was to give a preference not exceeding 15 per cent.  ists.",14
37,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"This decision was communicated by order to the various Deputy Postmasters-General on the 22nd August, 1903.",14
38,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,It was'a bad thing to do. The honourable member should have done better.,14
39,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"I am not going into that now. When the matter was submitted to me, I wrote this minuteThe practice in force under Ministerial decisions at the time of calling for tenders to be followed.",14
40,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"He a r , hear ! The honourable member did the right thinsr.",14
41,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"I merely carried out the Ministerial decision which was in force at the time when tenders were invited, which had been communicated to the various Deputy Postmasters-General on the 22 nd August, .1903, and, I understand, made known to some of the contractors. The honourable member for Bourke, when I was referring to this matter, showed that he had learned all about it, either from the late Postmaster-General or from some one else, because he interjected, ""Was not the decision of the Postmaster-General to be considered private and confidential ?"" The honourable member must have seen the papers, or known all about the matter at the time the decision was given.",14
42,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"It appears to me that these remarks are not of the nature of a personal explanation, but that the honourable member is debating the question. I ask why he did him not to continue his present line of argument. should he Mr SYDNEY SMITH - I have nothing more to say.",14
43,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"Northern Melboune) I must crave the indulgence of the House to make a personal explanation of a very different character. In a speech which I delivered yesterday I stated that I was strongly in favour of the alliance between the Liberal and the Labour Parties. In the report of that speech, which appears in the Argus this morning, I find' that I am credited with having stated the very opposite at a meeting which was held in the Fitzroy Town H all at the end of A u gust last. That newspaper says that I warned the Labour Party against "" entangling alliances,"" and placed those words between inverted commas in order to make it appear that they were an accurate extract from my speech. I have merely to say that I did not warn the Labour Party against alliances of any sort. I did not use the expression ""entangling alliances."" I actually encouraged that party to form an alliance, and' in the very fair report of my utterances which, appeared in the Same newspaper upon the following morning, I am represented as having done so. The exact words of that report are as follow : In conclusion, he said an honourable alliance of the Labour Party or any other party would no doubt be suitable, but he warned that party never to allow itself to be incorporated in any other. In such an extreme case I feel justified in occupying the time of the House to make this explanation.",14
44,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown," I also desire to make a brief personal explanation. In referring to the position of members of the Labour Party during the course of my speech yesterday afternoon, I stated that no matter how ardently they might believe either in free-trade or protection, if a majority of the caucus decided against them, they must bow to the will of that majority. At the time. I - made that statement. I was under the impression that it was perfectly correct._ Subsequently, however, the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne read a copy of the labour pledge, from which it appears that I was mistaken. As I have no wish to say what is untrue, or intentionally to misstate facts, I avail myself of this early opportunity of making the correction. NA Debate resumed from 21st September (vide page 4822), on motion by Mr. WATSONThat the present Administration does not possess the confidence of this House.",14
45,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"New England) When I closed my remarks last evening, I had decided not to deal further with the financial matters to which I had directed attention. I wish, however, to recapitulate the position which I then took up in regard to the Prime Minister's financial administration in New South Wales. As honourable members are aware, a charge of maladministration has been levelled against the right honourable gentleman by those newspapers which are opposed to the present coalition Government, and .has been repeated in this House. Briefly, I wish to state that, prior to his assumption of the office of Treasurer in New South Wales, Sir John See had declared in his financial statement that there was a deficiency of £1,200,000, which he intended to cover by the issue of Treasury bills. Shortly afterwards the Dibbs Government went to the country and was defeated, and in consequence of that defeat the present Prime Minister came into power. In his Budget speech the right honourable gentleman also reported that there was a deficiency of £1,200,000, which he intended ; - lik e his predecessors-to cover by the issue of Treasury-bills. That operation was carried out by the present Prime Minister, and as a result these charges of maladministration have been made. Formerly it was possible to deceive Parliament and the country as to the actual financial position. The right honourable gentleman, however, initiated a cash system of keeping the public accounts; but, of course, the amounts which had been voted for. works in previous years had to be paid. In order that his cash system should receive a fair start, the right honourable gentleman resolved to cover all the pavments for previous years by the issue of Treasury-bills Effect was given to that proposal by the New South Wales Parliament, the members of which knew perfectly well what they were doing. Out of that operation, which was supported by the Labour Party, these charges of maladministration have originated, notwithstanding that everything was done openly and above' board. of the right honourable gentleman's administration having been a failure, it was exactly the reverse. As a matter of fact MOTION. he reduced the taxation of New South Wales by £800,000, and succeeded in carrying on the government of the country without creating a deficiency such as had been the case in previous years. If we look at the revenue derived during his tenure of office we shall see that it was lower than that which had been collected in New South Wales for many years. After the right honourable gentleman vacated office, New South Wales collected a much larger revenue through the Customs, owing to the increased duties imposed by this Parliament. Last year the Government of that State received £2,000,000 more than was collected when the present Prime Minister held office there, and yet it was unable to carry on without a deficit. The right honourable gentleman also very considerably reduced the loan expenditure of New South Wales, which, however, since his retirement from State politics, has again increased. If there is any man to whom New South Wales should feel grateful for having reduced its expenditure and conducted all its operations upon aneconomical scale, it is the Prime Minister.",15
46,Mr FISHER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,What has Tasmania done that the honourable member should threaten it in this way ?,15
47,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I do not think that I have said anything about Tasmania; if so, I apologise to that State. I was referring to the charges which have been levelled against the Prime Minister. The honourable member for Wide Bay may be a little facetious if he chooses, but that will not prevent me from saying what I desire to say.",15
48,Mr FRAZER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,Does the honourable member think that it is possible to get away from old political squabbles in New South Wales ?,15
49,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"It is only honourable members opposite who wish to revive those squabbles. Certain charges have been made against the Piime Minister, and I have P perfect right to make clear the character of his administration whilst occupying Ministerial office in New South Wales. Those charges have been made merely for the purpose of damaging the Government. MT. FRAZER - Does not the honourable member think that the Prime Minister is capable of defending himself?",15
50,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I know all the circumstances of the case, and I should be Instead recreant to every principle of honour if I allowed charges of maladministration to.be made for which there is not the slightest justification. I have no desire to labour this question. I merely wish to put honourable members in possession of accurate information so that if these charges are repeated it must be with a full knowledge of the facts.",15
51,Mr THOMAS,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,Is the honourable member a financial expert ?,16
52,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I am as good a finanBUI cial expert as is the honourable member, and I hope that he will cease his insane ejaculations. Concerning the explanation which has been made by the honourable member for Coolgardie, I desire to say that I have every sympathy with the position taken up by him. As a free-trader I insist that no preference should be given to any manufacturer. No administrative act should be in the direction of altering the policy of the country.' That should be altered by Parliament alone. The position taken up by the honourable member for Coolgardie is the correct one, and I am fair enough to commend him for it. During the course of this debate the statement has been the policy of the present Government is a colourless one. From what we have been told it appears that honourable members opposite are the men to save the country. They are going to uplift the masses, better their conditions, and give them larger opportunities for improving themselves. But when we come to analyse their proposals we find that these claims cannot be sustained. They declare that the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill in its present form is a fraud, and should not have been passed by this House. Yet they were prepared to forward that measure to the Senate despite all its alleged blemishes. They were ready to transmit it to the other Chamber without making it what they wished that it should be. What is the difference between the Bill in its present form and that in which honourable members opposite desired it ? They were anxious that clause 48 should provide that if any union substantially represented those engaged in a particular industry it should be competent for the President of the Arbitration Court to grant a preference to unionists, whereas the Bill provides that such a preference shall be extended only when a union contains a majority of the workers engaged in the industry directly concerned. The distinction really lies between what constituted a "" majority "" and "" substantial representation.""  all.",16
53,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I may not have quoted the exact provision in the clause,but what I have stated constitutes the sole difference between us. I claim that that difference is a very slight one. The honourable member for Bland admitted that the Court would expect a substantial representation to include a majority, and if that be so, there was no difference in the as sentup to the Senate by the present Ministerial party, and as it would have been sent up by the party which has recently retired from office.  honourable members opposite vote against the proposal of - the late Ministry ?",16
54,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"S i m p l y because we determined that the reference to a majorityshould remain in the Bill. In order that the Court might not have any difference of opinion or difficulty in the matter, we proposed to declare in the Bill that there must be a majority in order to secure preference. I say that we'were justified in determining made that that the provision should remain in that form. We are told that honourable members opposite now represent a Liberal Protectionist Alliance. I do not know how they define ""Liberalism""; but it sounds strange to me to call men "" Liberals "" who are prepared to put restrictions upon people in every direction. If honourable members opposite, instead of calling themselves "" Liberal Protectionists,"" were to call themselves ""Liberal Restrictionists,"" I could understand it.",16
55,Mr WATSON,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,That is one for some honourable members on the Government side.',16
56,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I do not care whom it hits; I stand here in support of the principles I have advocated. If I support the present Ministerial party, it is because I think there is less danger to what I believe to be right to be expected from this side than from honourable members opposite, and because I-think we are more likely to get good legislation in the interests of the whole of the people from this side, than from honourable members opposite. I am here to defend my own personal views, and I shall not allow any one to control me in that direction. I should not be surprised if honourable members opposite called themselves ""Libera l Restrictionists,"" although I cannot understand how a "" restrictionist"" can in any circumstances be called a "" Liberal."" The terms are opposed to each other. I believe in giving men freedom.",16
57,Mr WATSON,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,Is factory legislation restriction ?,17
58,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"Yes , it is, to some extent.",17
59,Mr WATSON,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,We know that the Liberals in England were in favour of that.,17
60,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I believe in giving eveiy man the fullest freedom compatible with the freedom of every other man. refuse to be a party to restricting a man doing what does no injury to other men. I believe in giving every man the fullest individual freedom it is possible to give him. The nation to which we belong has been developed by following those lines. The honourable member for Perth, ing last night referred to Socialism as being the best thing for the community. If J understand the honourable member aright, what he believes in is that public utilities shall be controlled by the public.",17
61,Mr FOWLER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"Hear , hear; that is cialism.",17
62,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"If that is all the honourable member's Socialism amounts to, I am prepared to go so far with him. am a Socialist to that extent. I wish to make my position perfectly clear. I befers free. lieve in public utilities being controlled by the public. And I believe that as does any honourable member of this House. But I do not believe in the towrong. bacco industry being controlled by the public.",17
63,Mr WATSON,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,The honourable member quiries. is not a smoker.,17
64,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"At all events. I am member is wrong. not a Socialist of that brand. I believe in the Melbourne trams belonging to the Melbourne people, if honourable members please. But the honourable member for Bland, speaking at Wagga, and also in this House, I will not say misrepresented, but did not put this matter quite correctly.",17
65,Mr WATSON,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I believe I put it quite correctly. I saw the honourable member's lettrams ter, and it was absolutely incorrect.",17
66,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I propose to put the case as I have it. In order to show the difline. ference between public control and Socialism, the honourable member made the statement that the fare on the Melbourne trams was 3d., whilst the fare on the Sydney trams was id. That was correct .t went, but it was still a misrepresentation of the facts, because if you pay a fare of 3d. at one end of a line here in Meljourney with a ticket. bourne, you can go right through for that fare.",17
67,Mr SPEAKER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,I ask the honourable member whether he believes that the subject of fares upon the Melbourne tramways has anything to do with the motion?,17
68,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I may point out that the late Prime Minister, as a proof that Socialism was better than private enterprise, gave this illustration of the. tram systems I in Sydney and Melbourne. I believe that in the honourable member did not state the i l lustration correctly. If he was in order in making the statement to which I refer, I am surely in order in making a reply to it.",17
69,Mr SPEAKER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,Does the honourable member propose to connect the matter with in speakthe question under discussion ?,17
70,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I propose to connect my remarks on the subject with the motion under discussion, in the way I have stated. 1 desire to show that the illustration, as stated by the ex-Prime Minister, Sowas not correct. If you pay a 3d. fare at the Spencer-street station, it will run you through to the terminus of a line, and if you desire it, you can get a transfer which I will carry you beyond the terminus.",17
71,Mr TUDOR,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,You cannot get those trans,17
72,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,If you pay 3d. you as strongly can get a transfer.,17
73,Mr TUDOR,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,The honourable member is,17
74,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I know that you can get a transfer, because I have made in",17
75,Mr TUDOR,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,I am sure the honourable,17
76,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"The honourable member can speak in reply. I have made inquiries on the subject, and though I cannot speak from actual experience, as I have not received a transfer, I am told that transfers are given. I know that, entering a tram at Spencer-street, you can go to the end of your journey for 3d., whilst on the Sydney you pay for one' section, on any road, id. Again, under the Melbourne system, you can buy six tickets for is., which will take you right through the journey on each",17
77,Mr TUDOR,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,No .,17
78,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,It will take you from the Spencer-street station to the end so far as of the Fitzroy terminus.,17
79,Mr FOWLER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,No .,17
80,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,I have travelled the,17
81,Mr FOWLER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"The honourable member has "" had "" the company.",17
82,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"It is half-an-hour's ride. You can also get eight tickets for is., which will carry you within the city.",18
83,Mr WATSON,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,That is only for a mile.,18
84,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,It does not matter what the distance is ; I am simply showing that the honourable member's contention is not borne out by facts. It should be in that way. remembered also that at the end of twelve years from now the Melbourne Tramway Company must hand over the whole of the property with the exception of the cars carriages.,18
85,Mr WATSON,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,But the road was built for them. They did not have to pay for trol. the road.,18
86,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I do not know what they paid for. The business in the way in which I have stated, that does not bear out the illustration, as the ex-Prime Minister stated it. orable members at once that I am. not in favour of public utilities being controlled by private enterprise. I have held, and advocated these views for years. I suppose in the past. that there are but very few men to be found in the States who do not hold public utilities should be controlled by the public. But there is a vast difference tween the opinion of those holding that view and the opinion of men who advocate Commissioners. that all implements, materials, and methods of production shall be controlled people.",18
87,Mr THOMAS,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,It is only a question of time.,18
88,Mr BATCHELOR,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"The honourable would be called a wild, raging Socialist in Adelaide at the present time.",18
89,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"The honourable member for Perth pointed out that under the system of Socialism in lieves, there would be differences in the reward of labour; that in the case of a public tramway system, for instance, the manager would get a larger payment than a gripman. The honourable member admitted that there would be these gradations' of payment, but I do not know how he squares his views with those of the honourable member for Barrier, who does not believe in wages at all. When I speaking the otfxer night, the honourable tried covert influence with Ministers. member interjected that what we wanted was to get rid of the wage system; and I Commissioners, what is? suppose the honourable member's idea is we should all receive a dole from some Government office. The Socialism taught to people outside is a Socialism which is going to improve the position every man, and give him greater advantages than he enjoys at present. It is strange that we should not have this Socialism ih connection with our railways. In the past, we got rid of State control, because it was found that it was not in the interests of the public to carry on the railway systems",18
90,Mr WATSON,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,When did we get rid of State control of the railways?,18
91,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,We got rid of State and control by putting them under Commissioners.,18
92,Mr WATSON,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,That is still State con,18
93,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,I understand that; I know just what I am talking about; and is done I know that the Labour Party would like and to get rid of the Commissioners.,18
94,Mr WATSON,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"No , they would not; I tell honthat is a misstatement.",18
95,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"They would like to get control of the whole thing, so that they might crowd the service as it was crowded",18
96,Mr WATSON,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,Who supported the Pubthe view that l i c Service Act?,18
97,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,I know that it is be the desird of the men at the head of the Labour Party to get rid of the Railway,18
98,Mr WATSON,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,That is not true; I say by the that it is incorrect.,18
99,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,It is true.,18
100,Mr SPEAKER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,Order . I must ask the honourable member for Bland to withmember draw that statement.,18
101,Mr WATSON,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I withdraw any apparent reflection upon the honourable member's personal veracity. But I must be allowed to say that the honourable member's, statement which he beis absolutely incorrect. An HONORABLEMEMBER - The honourable member knows it.",18
102,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,I do not know it.,18
103,Mr WATSON,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,Then it is time the honourable member did.,18
104,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"W h i l e I was a member of the State Parliament of New South Wales, the Labour Party time after time was attacked the Railways Commissioners, and If that is not trying to get rid of the Railways What is the that good of Railways Commissioners, if vou exert upon the Ministers behind them all the being force of political power, in order to secure anything that is desired ? That is only anof other way of getting rid of them. That is what has been done time after time, and the honourable member for Bland knows it.",18
105,Mr WATSON,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,I know nothing of the sort. Mr LONSDALE ' - The very fact that we have had to put all these institutions under Commissioners shows distinctly that they cannot be controlled where political influence is allowed to come in.,19
106,Mr WATSON,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"He a r , hear; I am with the honourable member in that.",19
107,Mr KELLY,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"If honourable members opposite are satisfied with the Railways Commissioners, why did they propose to put the Commissioners' employees under the Arbitration Court?",19
108,Mr WATSON,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"Because the Commissioners, in the same way as every one else, should be subject to the law. Mr LONSDALE "" - The members of a railway league in my district, wrote to me, asking me to vote for the inclusion of railway servants in the Arbitration Bill ; but I wrote back and told them that I should do nothing of the kind. In their own interests, as well as in the interests of the State, I refused to be a party to putting them under the control of the Federal Arbitration Court. That is the attitude which I have taken up on that matter. Honourable members on the other side say .that they are going to help the masses; but what are they going to do? They are going to have a national tobaccomonopoly. going to give better conditions to the poor of Melbourne and all the States by a national tobacco monopoly. honourable member on the other side tell me what this national tobacco monopoly is going to do for the poor people of the State? Is it going to increase their wages ?",19
109,Mr FOWLER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"It will put £ 6 0 0 , per annum into the public purse.",19
110,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"It will do nothing of the kind, unless we increase the price of tobacco.",19
111,Mr FOWLER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,No ; we shall lower it.,19
112,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"The late Prime Minister told us that the people would not get a cheaper smoke as a result of the nationalization of the industry. They were not to have even that advantage, because tobacco would continue to be sold at the same prices.",19
113,Mr WATSON,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,I said it would make no difference in that respect.,19
114,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"This proposal for a national tobacco monopoly is only a farce. Though honourable members opposite stand upon platforms outside and speak of-these things as in the interests of the people, they know that they will have but little effect upon the condition of the masses.",19
115,Mr FOWLER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"If the honourable member will but ask the retail tobacconists, he will find that the monopoly in force is a very real thing at the present time.",19
116,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"That may be, but if the industry is put under State control the conditions will be very much worse than they are today.",19
117,Mr FRAZER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,It will be under Commonwealth control.,19
118,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"It is the control of the nation to which I refer. The members of the Labour Party object to borrowing money, but they wish to have a forced loan from the banks. Like myself, I suppose they would like to get it on the cheap. They do not object to a loan, but they object to paying interest upon it, and they propose,' in accordance with their Socialistic ideas, to take gold from the banks and give them paper in place of it. They will have to be a little smart to do that, because the gold would not be left long in the banks of Australia if they got an inkling that that was going to be carried out. We should find that it would soon be making its way over to New Zealand.",19
119,Mr HIGGINS,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"Why New Zealand? They are Mr WATSON - The honourable member knows a .lot about it when he talks like that. Will any Mr LONSDALE - So far as the note issue in Canada is concerned, the position is altogether different. When they carried this kind of legislation, they had a larger note issue in Canada than we have in Australia, and so far as token money 0 0 0 is concerned, it was very scarce. Honourable members will also find that in Canada the banks issue the larger notes, and the Government issue the smaller notes. I do not think that we should be able to force small notes upon people here to take the place of our token money.",19
120,Mr WILKS,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,Is the alliance in favour of that proposal ?,19
121,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I do not know; but I feel that no' good would result from the adoption of it. The community would not be helped by any system of enforced loans. What little benefit we should derive from its adoption would be represented in the saving of a certain amount of interest; but if the State took up the whole note issue the note tax would be lost, so that the Commonwealth would not gain any material advantage. The alliance opposite has been formed on a very peculiar basis. One party to it has been actuated by a desire, we are told, to secure a greater measure of protection, and I have extracted from the alliance programme all that bears upon that question. The programme provides forLegislation (including Tariff legislation) shown to be necessary :(1) To develop Australian resources. (2) To preserve, encourage, and benefit Australian industries, primary and secondary. (3) To secure fair conditions of labour all engaged in every form of industrial enterprise, and to advance their and well-being without distinction class or social status. That looks very well oh paper; but these proposals are not in themselves sufficient to that. for the combination. They have had to introduce three additional paragraphs, setting forth thatAs to any regulation arising under this graph only any member of either party may, to any specific proposal(a) Agree with the members of his own to be bound by their joint determination; or(i) Decide for himself how far the particular . circumstances prove necessity, or tent to which the proposal should ried. Ia other words, any member of the alliance may either agree to be bound by the sion of his party, or exercise his own individual opinion, and vote as he pleases regard to Tariff legislation. That is practisubmit cally the meaning of this proposal, and it has been placed before the protectionists of Victoria as an indication that if this ance comes into power they will secure revival of protection. The whole thing farce.",19
122,Mr MAUGER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,Why should the honourable member grumble about it?,20
123,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I am simply showing output. that these proposals are mere humbug. The two paragraphs which I have just read are marked "" a "" and "" b,"" and if that those letters stand for ""asinine humbug "" we fairly estimate their value. The members of the alliance have not for moment anticipated that anything in the shape of a protectionist revival will result to nails. from the combination.",20
124,Mr MAUGER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,Why should the member object to that?,20
125,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I wish the public know the real facts of the position. are not always told the truth these matters, and it is time that it was put before them. We are told that increased protection is needed by Victorian industries, which have been protected almost for ages. Notwithstanding that they had had a large measure of protection for many years, the moment a slight reduction in the Tariff was made they cried out that they could not exist.",20
126,Mr MAUGER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"Does the honourable member call a reduction of 100 per cent, a slight one?",20
127,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"A reduction of a duty of 25 per cent, to 12 per cent, is a 1 for very fair one. I am in favour of the appointment of a Tariff Commission, but it interests must be based on fair lines. It should be of fairly representative of both the protectionist and free-trade party.",20
128,Mr HUME COOK,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,We have no objection,20
129,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"Thos e who are agitating for the appointment of a Tariff Commission will find, if it be appointed, that paraits investigations will not bear out their asas sertion. They willshow a different state party of things from that which the protectionists opposite suggest. I am informed, that ""the Denton Hat Mills Company, of Melbourne, has refused orders, on the ground that they the exhave already booked so far ahead that they be carwould not be able to carry them out.",20
130,Mr MAUGER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"That is not correct. I was at the mills this morning, and I know decithat business there is very dull",20
131,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"If the honourable with member challenges my statement, I shall to him letters received in Sydney yet that bear out my assertion. I can place my hands on documentary proof of my allistatement. I have been promised those leta ters, which show that the Denton Hat Mills is a Company has refused orders, on the ground that it could not carry them out. We are told that a Victorian nail factory is being ruined, but, in July last, it had its record",20
132,Mr HUME COOK,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,For barbed wire.,20
133,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,The factory had a we assume record output in that month,20
134,Mr HUME COOK,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,But not in nails.,20
135,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"It was the factory's one record output in respect of manufactured goods, but I cannot say whether it related",20
136,Mr MAUGER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,The honourable member honourable has not made any inquiries.,20
137,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"We are also told that to the glass bottle works in this State need They greater protection, but I know that they in regard to have been doing well.",20
138,Mr MAUGER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,Have they?,21
139,Mr HUME COOK,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"T w o nail factories .""have been closed since Tariff.",21
140,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"In 1903 Victoria's port of manufactured goods was £1,000.00 0 in excess of that which she exported in 1900. That increase took placeunder Federal Tariff.",21
141,Mr MAUGER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,But what did she import,21
142,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,Facts like prove that the assertions of the Protectionist Party about the state of trade utterly absurd.,21
143,Mr HUMECOOK,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,The increase to which the honourable member refers was not manufactures.,21
144,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"It was in goods Victorian manufacture. in the press recently setting forththat increase had occurred, and on inquiry the office of the Government Statist I learned that it was correct.",21
145,Mr MAUGER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,In what newspaper was this statement published ?,21
146,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"In a commercial journal. I do not put such statements fore the House without first making inhad, quiries, and it was. for this reason went to the Government Statist's office. I wished to verify the report.",21
147,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,Did not Trenwith say much the same thing?,21
148,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,I do not know what he said.,21
149,Mr MAUGER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,We have lost a very large proportion of Victorian trade.,21
150,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I am dealing only with the attempt to bring about a propromised tectionist revival. If a Tariff sion be appointed, I am satisfied that investigations will prove that local manuwith facturers have been benefited, rather injured by the Federal Tariff.",21
151,Mr MAUGER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,There are hundreds of men out of work in Victoria.,21
152,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"The r e were hunthat dreds of men out of work in this State, even when the protectionist Tariff was its highest.",21
153,Mr MAUGER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,But they were not lowing the trades to which I refer.,21
154,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"Protectio n has been a curse to Victoria. I am here, play anv game, but to tell the truth. the workingmen of this State would only open their eyes they would see that protecpose tion has been a curse, rather than fit to Victoria, and that they have been fooled by the men who call themselves the passing of the their leaders.",21
155,Mr WATSON,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,Is the honourable member exspeaking for the Ministry?,21
156,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,I ' a m not.,21
157,Mr SPEAKER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I desire to call the the attention of the honourable member to the fact that he is turning round, and addres-. ? sing the galleries, andi that he ought to these address himself to the Chair.",21
158,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I was addressing are honourable members in the Opposition corner, who feel so keenly on this question.",21
159,Mr SPEAKER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,The honourable memin ber will please address the Chair.,21
160,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I wish to impress of upon these honourable members the truths I saw a statement that I am uttering. I desire them to look this back at the position of Victoria at a time at when the protectionist Tariff of this State was at its highest-to see for themselves how the working men have suffered under that . policy, and to exercise their intelligence in determining where the real trouble lies. 'Instead of seeking to bring about a protectionist revival, which would be only a begreater curse to Victoria than it has ever they should support a policy that will that I improve the condition of the people.  should address these remarks to the MinSenator ister of Trade and Customs.",21
161,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I have nothing to do with the Minister. I am a supporter of the Government, but am opposed to any revival of protection. If the Minister of Trade and Customs attempts to revive that' policy he will find in me a bitter opponent. We are a Federal system of old-age penCommissions. Honourable members opposite sneer its at the proposal of the Ministry to confer the States Governments in regard to than this question. But we know that without the co-operation of the States such a system is impossible.",21
162,Mr MAUGER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,Nonsense .,21
163,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"We know full well it is impossible for us to provide for a Federal system of old-age pensions by at means of a tax on land values. When honourable members opposite tell the people that folit can be provided for by a tax on land values they know that they are talking of something which is really impossible. The not to only way in which it is possible to secure If Federal old-age pensions is by the Commonwealth Government conferring, as they proto do, with the Governments of the a beneSlates, and inducing them to agree ",21
164,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"No ; but to make provision for the payment of old-age pensions out of the Customs revenue. If a Federal system cost £1,500,000 per annum, it would be necessary, under our Constitution, to raise £6,000,000 in order to pay for it, so that we must make some arrangement with the States to utilize Customs revenue in that direction. If the Labour Party are so strongly in favour of old age pensions, how is it that the Queensland Labour Government has not introduced the system there?",22
165,Mr FRAZER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,They will do so.,22
166,Mr MCCAY,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,Thei r programme does not include such a proposal.,22
167,Mr LONSDALE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"Why does not the Labour Government in Western Australia do the same thing? I am opposed to the position taken up by the Labour Party, but I do not wish it to be understood for one moment that I am hostile to the cause of labour. Labour has my deepest sympathy, and I am prepared to assist in passing any legislation in its interests. But to attempt by means of a Conciliation and Arbitration Act to help the masses, is just as useless as it is to seek to quench a fire by spitting on it. No good would result from the passing of such a measure. How is it possible to keep up the standard of wages in a falling market? I have been opposed to conciliation and arbitration legislation, because at best it can be only a palliative. It cannot prevent the recurrence of such disputes and difficulties as have arisen in the past. I shall certainly do all I can in opposition to the passing of any restrictive legislation. I believe in developing the freedom of every individual, and in giving every man the fullest opportunity to use the powers with which he is endowed. By working in that direction alone shall, we secure the salvation of the people. We cannot hope to help them by restricting the use of individual power. We have seen the Conciliation and Arbitration Act of New South Wales working in such a way that, as the result of the section dealing with the limitation of apprentices, many lads have been prevented from obtaining work, and have been sent out into the streets. Instead of giving every man the fullest opportunity to do the best he can for himself, it is having the posite effect. I am not one of those who believe that every worker should be paid the same wage. All men differ. Their capacity varies, and each man ought to receive only that which he himself earns. I feel that no man, whether engaged in manufacturing or other pursuits, should by law receive any special privilege over the rest of the people. If our States were to adopt a different system-if we were to make use of our unoccupied lands, under an intelligent land policy-the trouble' and difficulty which exist today in the Commonwealth would soon disappear, and instead of the poverty and misery which we see about us, we should have happy homes and much brighter conditions. But these attempts to establish a tobacco monopoly, and other proposals of that nature, tp help the community, are silly and absurd, and so far as I am concerned will receive no assistance.",22
168,Mr HUGHES,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"The honourable member for Parramatta yesterday made a number of statements which may be left to look after themselves; but there is one thing that he said which I shall take this opportunity to correct. He said-o r is reported to have said- I am now quoting from the Age of to-dayHe knew that Mr Hughes had gone to the Orange Association and asked to be put on the Orange bunch. I wish' to say that that is not correct; that I have never, either at the last election, or any other election, gone to the officials, or to any person connected however remotely with the Orange institution or the Protestant Defence Association, or any religious body in New South Wales, or in Australia",22
169,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,O r any one connected with them?,22
170,Mr HUGHES,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"O r any one connected with them, and asked them to put me in the bunch, or asked to 'be included as a nominee of theirs. I have asked to be taken out of their list, and that is the only communication I have ever made to them. I have always endeavoured to deprecate the introduction of sectarianism into politics; I .have never been indebted in any way to such institutions for my return; and I hope that I shall not be so indebted in the future.",22
171,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I desire to make a personal explanation in view of what has just fallen from the honourable and learned op- member for West Sydney. I wish to say, in reference to some remarks that were made yesterday, that I did not speak without having what I believed to be full warranty for my statement. I have proof here which satisfies me, and which, I believe, justified me in the statement which I made. Here is  the Watchman, in Sydney. He saysHughes called on me at officethat is definite enoughduring last Federal campaign in great concern. Said Roman ticket being used for al l it was for Warren against himself, and asked me to what I couid through Watchman, and privately, to stir up Protestant vote. He also gave me some tit-bits to use against Warren in paragraphs. Never asked to have name withdrawn from list. Said, left it to my judgment whether I would withdraw it or not, though he hoped to get Roman votes unless they became alarmed. There is justification for the statement made yesterday.",22
172,Mr HUGHES,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,I desire again,23
173,Mr SPEAKER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"Order ! It is not me to determine finally-it is for the to do that-bu t it does appear to me that the express prohibition of debate upon any personal explanation,' precludes explanation after explanation being made, first of all, by way of attack, and then by way of reply. If the honourable and learned member detion sires to explain any matter, which will lead to a further explanation in the way debate, I shall be pleased to hear him._ I will ask him not to say anything in the nature of debate.",23
174,Mr HUGHES,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,There is not one word of truth in what the honourable member for Parramatta has read. What I asked Packer on the only occasion when I called on him was to be good enough to take me out of their list.,23
175,Mr WATSON,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,The honourable and pledged learned member told me that months ago.,23
176,Mr HUGHES,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"Bu the said that he had put my name there with a view of doing me a good turn. I had known him as a member of the Daily Telegraph staff, on which he was a reporter. I told him that was the reverse of what he was doing, and asked him to be good enough to publish a letter of mine to that effect. He said, will simply knock the name out, and there will be an end of it.""",23
177,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,My statement can be further corroborated.,23
178,Mr FRAZER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE," We can to now, I presume, get back to the subthe ject under discussion. I have gathered from the remarks of the honourable member for New England that the Ministerialists at the present time have a serious objection to raise against the methods of the Opposiinstance, tion, whom they accuse of having resorted to unfair tactics. Coming as it does from the lips of those who have lately been enof gaged in actions which have won for them the unenviable distinction of being called "" a gang of political sand-baggers,"" I think that if the honourable member was speaking on behalf of honourable members opposite - worth his remarks might be described as similar do to "" Satan sermonizing on sin."" I wish for a few moments to contrast the position of the members of the Opposition and the attitude they have adopted in this Parliament with those that have been adopted by those some who are sitting on the Ministerial side of the House. The leader of the Opposition I in expressing his dissatisfaction with the present Administration, did not resort to the methods that were adopted by the present for Prime Minister when he was seeking House office. The leader of the Opposition has come down with a definite want of confidence motion, and has given every honourable member an opportunity to express his orjinions clearly, distinctly, and fully, so that there may be no doubt about the posiin which we all stand. But what was not the course adopted by the Prime Minister? of He came to the House in March, when the But Deakin Government was in office, and said that they were in a minority, and were depending for their political existence on the votes of those who were then sitting on the corner benches. There was a serious difof ference of opinion with regard to the inclusion ih the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill of the public servants. The honourable and learned member for Ballarat was aware that the party to which I belong were to the inclusion of those persons. Being defeated upon that question, he relinquished office. At that time the present Prime Minister voted with the Deakin Government. But from statements, which were made by him to the press, we were led to believe that he was very glad that the honourable and learned member for Ballarat had retired from office. Certainly, a number of "" I his present supporters voted against the Deakin Government. When asked why he did not get his supporters to save the Deakin Government, the) Prime Minister stated, in justification, that he did not wish coerce the votes of those who believed in inclusion of the public servants in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. No one would ask him to do that. But what about the conduct of those gentlemen who have been proclaimed as wreckers? What, for about the honourable member for New England, the honourable member for Lang, and the honourable member for Wilmot? What influence did he use upon those members of his party ?",23
179,Mr KELLY,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,The present Prime Ministei used no influence in that direction.,24
180,Mr FRAZER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"Absolutel y none ! But there is reason to believe that the right honourable member was very well pleased at the defeat of the Deakin Administration. The Watson Government then assumed the responsibilities of office. At that time there was a serious difference of opinion between honourable members opposite. The honourable and learned member for Ballarat, leading one section of the Opposition, said that it was necessary that a majority should be secured. That was satisfactory. No one could find fault with his position. But the Prime Minister, speaking subsequently, said that if it were a question of majority rule, the Labour Party had as much right to sit upon the Government benches as had the Deakin Government during the previous three years. It is fair to assume from that remark that the right honourable gentleman was anticipating a time when he might be sitting upon the Ministerial benches without having a majority. Subsequently the honourable and learned member for Ballarat stated that one thing which must be considered in .the matter of an agreement between two parties was that the members of those parties must not be found flying at each other's throats at the next election. We heard quite a different expression of opinion from the .right honourable member for East Sydney, He stated that to make compacts with another party when an election was imminent was legitimate, but that a compact made now as to what was to happen at the next election merited the strongest condemnation. Consequently, the actions of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat at that time, in the opinion of the light honourable gentleman at the head of the Government, merited the strongest condemnation. Now, it is necessary to deal for a brief time with a few of the opinions which members of the two groups on the Government side of the House have held concerning one another at different periods during their political career. I do not wish to go back to ancient history, or to deal with what the Prime Minister did or said ten years ago in the New South Wales Parliament. I am prepared to content myself with his actions since he has been a member of this Parliament. Speaking at the Town Hall, Melbourne, on 30th October, concerning the Deakin Administration, the right honourable gentleman used these woidsThe Government introducedthe Electoral B i U in the Senate, with a provision for minority representation.. That was the main provision of the measure. The Senate knocked it out. Then the Senate put in a provision against plumping. The other House removed it, and the changes were running between the two Houses, in which several Ministers voted in several ways during the several stages of the Bill . Mr Deakin said last night that that B i ll gave manhood and womanhood suffrage to Australia. I say that this Government, to serve its political interests, robbed hundreds and thousands of electors of their just rights I wonder how honourable members opposite like to have those matters brought under their notice at this particular time, when they are clasping one another to their bosoms, and think neither can do any wrong. The right honourable gentleman went on to sayThis nefarious act in the interests of one political party may be committed in the interests of another.",24
181,Mr WILKS,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,Why re-open those old sores ?,24
182,Mr FRAZER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"This is a sore which immediately concerns the present position in Parliament, and does not concern the position of certain gentlemen in New South Wales about ten years ago. With the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, I am heartily sick of hearing about those old squabbles in New South Wales. Any stranger coming into the galleries of this House would believe that the Commonwealth consisted of New South Wales, and New South Wales only.",24
183,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,Why did the honourable member not make a protest when the subject was raised?,24
184,Mr FRAZER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I am making my protest now when I am in order, but the honourable member in interjecting is out of order. The speech, from which I am quoting, proceededLet us, while we stand on the brink of the momentous developments of this Australian nation, try to keep it from the political corruption we see in other great democracies. My strongest charge against this Government is that - they have broken their duty to the people, and broken the laws of the country for a selfish motive, and they have defiled and debased the ballot-box of Australia. I wonder how the head of the' present Government, who, with his equal in all things, occupies the front Ministerial benches, feels now when he finds himself a partner with those who took a prominent part in debasing and defiling the ballot-box of Australia? A similar question might be asked as to the right honourable and learned member for Balaclava. I wonder if that gentleman feels at peace with the head of the Government, by whom he was slandered on the public platform, and who has ridden on his back into prominence in this Parliament. We find, however, that, despite those serious differences of opinion- I am safe, I think, in thus referring to the position-the present Government, and their supporters have agreed on one point, viz., that the Labour Party of this country must be checked and "" downed."" One of the first reasons which honourable members opposite advance for their present stand is that we on this side obtain our political positions by the assistance of a machine which they intend to remove. I should like for a moment to refer to this so-called political machine, which honourable members on the other side take a particular delight in denouncing. The mode in which all honourable members on this side enter this Chamber may not be altogether the same, but is very nearly the same in all portions of Australia. Before a man is permitted to be a candidate under our flag he. must be a member of a trade union or a labour league; and in that matter there are no restrictions. There is no member in this House who, if he desires to join the leagues, may not do so. There is no clique; the party is not reserved for a few, but is open to all who desire to enter. When it is agreed that a labour man shall be nominated for a certain constituency, the candidate must possess the goodwill of a majority of those who know him best, and he must subscribe to the platform. But what is the course adopted by the Free-trade Party? As an illustration, I might point to my interjecting friend the honourable member for Wentworth. If he had not had the good grace of the honourable and learned member for East Sydney, and had not been placed on the free-trade ticket, what chance would he have had of being a member of this Parliament ? If the honourable member had not had behind him the influence of the great Sydney newspapers",24
185,Mr KELLY,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,I never met the honourable and learned member for East Sydney before I announced myself as a candidate.,25
186,Mr FRAZER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"That is a vastly different matter. What chance would the honourable member have had had his name not appeared on the free-trade ticket? As I say, our candidates have to submit themselves to the goodwill of those who know them best. On the other side, the particular gentleman who is at the head of the free-trade organization obtains the assistance of the great daily newspapers, in Sydney, for instance, for certain candidates, with the result that these gentlemen are entirely at his mercy. As an illustration of the method adopted by the Labour Party, I may take the case' of Senator de Largie in Western Australia. That gentleman was nominated by the Labour Party for the Senate, and a plebiscite was taken of trade unionists and members of labour organizations generally in Western Australia, with the result that at the preliminary poll Senator de Largie was selected as the candidate by about 8,500 votes. I ask the right honourable member for Swan, who selected the protectionist candidate's for the Senate in Western Australia ? Mr KING O'MALLEY - The right honourable member himself.",25
187,Mr FRAZER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"The protectionist candidates were selected by the right honourable member for Swan and Dr Hackett, the head of the West Australian newspaper.",25
188,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,Dr Hackett had .nothing to do with the selection.,25
189,Mr FRAZER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"Did the right honourable .member not select the candidates, if Dr Hackett did not do so?",25
190,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,I supported the candidates.,25
191,Mr FRAZER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"On the one hand, we see that 8,500 electors, who knew Senator de Largie intimately, selected him as their candidate, while, on the other hand, candidates were selected by one man, and foisted on the electors.",25
192,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,I did not select the candidates.,25
193,Mr FRAZER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"We find that the democracy of Western Australia on that occasion, by an immense majority, returned labour senators at the head of the poll. It is said that the Labour Party are class representatives; but I do not think that a more striking exhibition of class representation could be witnessed than that afforded us by the honourable and learned member for Wannon last night. From start tofinishthe one question in that honourable and learned member's mind was-""How is this going to affect the farmer? How are my constituents going to get on ?""",25
194,Mr KELLY,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,Is it not his duty to consider his constituents?,25
195,Mr FRAZER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"Yes , but not at the ex' pense of other portions of the Commonwealth, not when it means an injustice to thousands of others who do not happen to live in the constituency of Wannon. As to the Arbitration Bill and the inclusion of agricultural labourers, who are the vocates in this Chamber? The object of the Labour Party is to make that Bill apply to the industries of the country as a whole, and we are met with the cry, ""Oh, save the poor farmer and the poor fruit-grower!"" The other day we had from the Minister of Trade and Customs a statement that the policy of the Labour Party is to tax the ducer off the land. Am I correctly representing what the Minister said?",26
196,Mr MCLEAN,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,The honourable member is quite right.,26
197,Mr FRAZER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"If the Minister of Trade and Customs seriously entertains that opinion he is suffering from an unpardonable lack of knowledge as to the intentions of honourable members on this side. The policy that the party with which I am associated intend to adopt is one of the utmost consideration for the men who are producing wealth from the soil. The man we want to tax is he who is not producing, but is keeping the land locked up from those who want to produce. A few months ago it was Stated in the Tocsin, and the statement has not been disputed, because it disputable, that there are 2,560,000 acres of the most fertile land in Victoria which are locked up by great landlords, and which support only 7869 persons. That is the sort of thing we desire to stop. We desire that those men shall be compelled to hand the land over to those who, under present conditions, are forced to go elsewhere in order to settle.",26
198,Mr KENNEDY,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,Does the honourable member propose that the land shall be paid for ?,26
199,Mr FRAZER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"Of course; our policy is not a policy of confiscation in regard to land or any other property. But when the welfare of the people is being seriously jeopardized owing to the fact that a few men have millions of acres locked up, it is time for State interference, in order to make them part with that land, whether they like to do so or not.",26
200,Mr KELLY,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,How is the money to be raised for the purchase?,26
201,Mr FRAZER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,I shall tell the honourable member about the financial proposals pi esently.,26
202,Mr KENNEDY,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"The present Minister of Tiade and Customs was the first, as a State Minister, to encourage settlement on a large scale in Victoria.",26
203,Mr FRAZER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"Then it is a wonder that the honourable gentleman, at that time, allowed his gaze to miss this awful exhibition of a few people holding millions of class ad- acres of fertile land locked up.",26
204,Mr MCLEAN,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"The State Government, of which I was the head, resumed and distributed amongst the people nearly all the estates that have been resumed for settlement in Victoria.",26
205,Mr FRAZER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"If that be so, and I have no reason to doubt the honourable pro- gentleman's word, I can only say that he was on the right track, and that it is a pity he was not allowed to stay in the State Parliament and continue the good work. T should like to lay before honourable members the opinions which were expressed by the present head of the Government in regard to the farmers at a particular time. The right honourable gentleman, at Warragul and Kyneton, delivered brilliant addresses and aroused his audiences to a high pitch of enthusiasm. It would appear that of late his one mission in life is to remove any ill feeling which may have existed between the residents of Victoria and the residents of New South Wales, and to that end he is going to clasp the farmers to his bosom, At the present juncture, it is interesting to is innote-and I should like his understudy in the House to listen to this-wha the said in the Melbourne Town Hall in December, 1899. On that occasion he saidThat door which was open in the mother colony always was going to be open in all Australia. How does that suit the Minister of Trade and Customs? With all these barriers down, the stock f atteners and wheat farmers would feel the cold southerly wind of a world's competition.",26
206,Mr KENNEDY,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,The right honourable gentleman is of the same opinion still.,26
207,Mr FRAZER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"If that be so, the right honourable gentleman is disguising or keeping that opinion in the background. When addressing them of late, he has not promised them "" cold, southerly winds,"" but the warmth of his own bosom. Honourable members opposite denounce the political machine as a serious evil, when it is used by our party; but they intend to bring into existence another machine. I do not say that the members of the Ministry. are sending organizers around, but their supporters, and also the merchants, and members of. the Employers' Federation-thos e who are responsible for sweating young girls in Melbourne, by paying them 2s. 6d. per week, and then deducting 2$d. for insurance-ar e organizing leagues throughout Victoria and the other States. They intend to go to extremes in their endeavour to defeat the Labour Party at the next election ; and, peculiarly enough, they are calling in the assistance of the ladies. At the Masonic Hall, Collins-street, Melbourne, the other night, at a fullypacked meeting ready to cheer the Prime Minister when he cracked some of his familiar jokes, that gentleman when he had delivered his vigorous denunciation of the Labour Party, said :"" In this hall, there must be no society distinctions. The ' missus ' must grasp toher bosom the ' Mary ' that works the gridiron."" To the women of the Commonwealth he looked to save the country from the extremes of labour legislation. But if the right honourable gentleman had so much consideration for the interests of the females of this country, if he was so anxious that they should exercise the franchise, and should make their influence felt upon the policv of the Commonwealth, how it is that, during the five years that he was in office in New South Wales, he refused to give the women of that State the right to vote ?",26
208,Mr KENNEDY,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,Is not the fact equally a reflection upon the party by which he was kept in power?,27
209,Mr FRAZER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"The right honourable member for Swan, who is another of those who are foremost now in addressing meetings of females, was at the head of a Ministry for ten years without giving them a vote. I believe that the honourable member for GiDpsland stands in a similar position.",27
210,Mr MCLEAN,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,I advocated woman's sufthose frage before the honourable member was born. . Mr MALONEY - Ye t the honourable member left me in want of a seconder when I first proposed it.,27
211,Mr FRAZER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"The honourable membei for Gippsland may have stated on the hustings his belief in woman's franchise, but, although he was Premier of Victoria for a considerable time, he did not introduce a Bill to give effect to that belief.",27
212,Mr MCLEAN,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"It was one of the prinunions, cipal planks in our platform.",27
213,Mr FRAZER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"Then the honourable gentleman ought to have placed it upon the statute-book. It has been in the platform of the Labour Party as long as I remember, arid if it had not been continually advocated by that party, the ladies of Australia would never have obtained the right to vote. When honourable members opposite are addressing meetings of ladies, their auditors know that it is the Labour Party whom they have to thank for their right to vote, and I believe that their gratitude will cause them not to forget us when the time to vote comes. Another statement of the Prime Minister of which notice must be taken, because of the high position which he occupies, though it may be only temporarily, was that the Labour Party wish for the creation of an Arbitration Court in order to starve the wives and children of non-unionists. That is one of the greatest misrepresentations of our desires that has been put before the people of Australia.",27
214,Mr WEBSTER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,It is a slander.,27
215,Mr FRAZER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"Yes . Our experience of existing arbitration legislation has enabled us to gauge pretty accurately what is required to make a Commonwealth arbitration measure successful. Arbitration Acts are in force in two of the States, but it has been found in Western Australia that a provision giving preference to unionists is necessary, and the Government of that State propose to amend the Act by the insertion of such a provision. We have always maintained that for the successful administration of an Arbitration Act, and to secure the industrial peace of Australia, it is necessary that those who are banded together in organizations should have some interest in supporting that legislation; that some return should be made to them for their action in foregoing the right to strike when dissatisfied with their conditions, and for undertaking the expense of conducting cases before the Arbitration Courts. We say that who belong to unions should be placed in as good a position as those who ,are not members of unions, who are put to no expense, who do not give evidence before the Arbitration Courts, and yet who benefit by all their awards. To speak of "" preference v to unionists "" is a misnomer. What we desire should be termed "" security to unionists."" It is the bitter experience of unionists in all parts of Australia that those who have taken a prominent part in conducting the affairs of either by appearing before Courts of Arbitration, or in other ways, have often afterwards found that their positions have been filled by others, although they had hitherto done their work with entire satisfaction to their employers. We know that blackballing exists in connection with the employers' unions of Australia, and it is therefore necessary that there should be some legislation - which will give security to those who are responsible for the conduct of the affairs of the Labour organizations. It is a slander we wish to starve the wives and children of non-unionists. On the contrary, the Labour Party has, from its inception to the present time, consistently tried to bring about better conditions for the people of Australia. Our reputation, however, is such that we need not fear such slanders. Incidentally, I would point out that during the present debate we have had the expression of the views of only one-half of the head of the Goveinment. Apparently, the Ministry are reserving themselves for a final rush before the division bell rings; but probably the result will be like what is happening to the Japanese at Port Arthur, that when they make it, they will suffer very severely. The final objection of the Prime Minister to the Labour Party is that we are a pack of extremists. Honourable members opposite refer to themselves as a combination of - moderates, and I am very pleased to obtain from their own lips a name by which I mav refer to them. They are certainly very moderate in their attendance in this Chamber at the present time. I should like to know how far their moderation will carry them. Is the moderation of the honourable member for Gippsland the same thing as that of the honotrable member for Kooyong, of the honourable member for New England, and of the honourable member for Lang? Are the other members of the party prepared to go as far as the Prime Minister wishes to go, and to remove from the Immigration Restriction Act the provision relating contract labour, and from the Post and Telegraph Act the provision relating to the employment of black labour on mail boats ? I think that their moderation is likely to carry them backwards in more senses than one. Not only will they be retrogressive in their legislation, but their policy will carry them back to this side of the Chamber with which they are more familiar. The Prime Minister was elected as a free trader, but he declared, when speaking on the Address-in-Reply, that, so far as the fiscal situation was concerned, there was an armed truce. How long is that armed truce to last? Will it continue as long as the presentcoalition remains in office ? Is it not rather a truce for the burial of the dead? Has not the right honourable member now got rid of the obstacle which for so long prevented him from obtaining office? There is nothing very contentious in the programme of the Government. Their chief plank is to get into recess as to say that soon as possible.",27
216,Mr KENNEDY,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,Does the honourable member blame them ?,28
217,Mr FRAZER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"No ; because it is their only hope of remaining in office. I would blame honourable members' on this side, however, if they did not take the first opportunity to toss them out of office. Although honourable members opposite differ on many things; but they are in absolute agreement upon the first plank of their platform.",28
218,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,And the honourable member's party are in agreement upon a second plank-that the Ministry shall not get into recess.,28
219,Mr FRAZER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"Q u it e so. To show why they should not get into recess, I will refer to a few remarks which we have heard from them on other occasions, and to the methods which they adopted for obtaining office. Both the' Prime Minister and his better-half declared that it would be unconstitutional to bring the public servants of the States and of the Commonwealth under the Arbitration Bill . If it were not unconstitutional, they declared that it was inexpedient - that it would cause considerable dissatisfaction amongst the State's, and that it involved a veiy serious encroachment upon State rights. Indeed, the'honourable and learned member for Ballarat affirmed that it was the first step towards wrecking the Federation. But the present Government, since their advent to office, practically say, ""We to are quite prepared to ignore! the inclusion of the public servants of the States within the scope of the Bill , and to disregard the injury which will be done to State rights if we can only get into recess ."" 1",28
220,Mr KENNEDY,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,C o u l d honourable members go back upon their votes?,28
221,Mr FRAZER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"The Government could have declared, as did the honourable member for Bland, that they were prepared to adopt the Bill in a certain form, and that if the House declined to allow them to do so, they would relinquish office. Instead of taking up that attitude, they stand convicted of having passed a measure with which they absolutely disagree. Mr KENNEDY,-No . Mr Frazer , - I maintain that that is .so. Let me briefly traverse i i few of the items which are contained in what the G SfcT The «policy. t shall direct attention is the K a l g o o S to Port Augusta Railway Survey representative of Western Australia.

The policy of the Government, however, is, to continue to allow our legislation to he misunderstood by people abroad. In regard to the Manufactures Encouragement Bill , the Government propose; to pursue the good old policy of regarding nothing in it as vital.",29
224,Mr KENNEDY,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,Did the Watson Government imake it vital?,30
225,Mr FRAZER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"No , because it was not included in the platform upon which we were elected. It is a very significant circumstance that, in making his declaration of policy, the Prime Minister entirely forgot to mention the matter of old-age pensions. The desire to alleviate the sufferings of our aged poor was of such vital concern to him that he completely overlooked - the question. From a second instalment of the Ministerial policy, delivered at a subsequent sitting, we. learned that he proposes to consult the States Governments in regard to it. I admit that it is desirable that the Commonwealth should work amicably with the States, but when the Prime Minister proposes ' to make the comfort of the declining years of the aged poor dependent upon the decision of the States Governments, I must cross swords with him. A vast majority of honourable members are pledged to old-age pensions, and must accept responsibility fot imposing any extra taxation which the carrying out of such a scheme may render necessary. So far as the electors represented by the Labour Party are concerned, we are prepared to pledge them to that additional taxation, in order to bring about an improvement in the condition of our aged poor. I, for one, will never sanction the welfare of these persons being intrusted, say, to the decision of the Premier of Victoria-to give a specific instance.",30
226,Mr KENNEDY,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,What does the alliance say upon that question ?,30
227,Mr FRAZER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"It says that it will introduce a measure providing for old-age pensions, as soon as possible.",30
228,Mr MCCAY,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"The alliance does not say that, but it might mean it.",30
229,Mr FRAZER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I beg the Minister's pardon. The alliance programme contains the following plank:-""Old-ag e pensions, on a basis fair and equitable to the States."" Do honourable members opposite anticipate that we are prepared to enact legislation which is not fair and equitable? Do they imagine that we are willing to sanction a scheme which will starve one man and feed another? The difference between the programme of the alliance and that of honourable members opposite is, that whilst we are determined to place upon the statute-book a measure providing f o i the payment of old age pensions, they wish to shelve the question.",30
230,Mr GROOM,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,They will promise it.,30
231,Mr FRAZER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,They would promise anything to enable them to get into recess. We have been urged by some honourable members to state our objections to the present Administration and the present Prime Minister.,30
232,Sir JOHNFORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"He a r , hear.",30
233,Mr FRAZER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,I think that if the right honourable member for Swan had been here he would not have urged that upon me. I have stated my reasons as emphatically as I know how. The reason I do not like the present Prime Minister of Australia is because I do not trust him politically.,30
234,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,What is the difference between politically and privately; if the honourable member does not trust a man politically I suppose he would not trust him privately ? An HONORABLEMEMBER - The right honourable member for Swan would not trust the Prime Minister politically a little time ago.,30
235,Mr FRAZER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"- I should not like to say that I think the Prime Minister would try to steal anything from my pocket. I certainly do not wish to convey that impression to any one. but I do say that, politically, in the administration of the public departments, and in a position of responsibility for the preparation of legislation for the welfare of the people of the country I have no trust whatever in the right honourable gentleman. There are specific reasons why we can have no trust in him. The right honourable gentleman has said, "" When I get into a position to do so I shall remove from the Immigration Restriction Act that obnoxious clause which prevents the introduction of contract labour to Australia.""",30
236,Sir JOHNFORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,Is it not much better that a man should say straightforwardly what he will do?,30
237,Mr FRAZER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"-Quite so. It is infinitely better that a man should say what he proposes to do when he gets into a position of power, but in the case of the Prime Minister we find that, instead of endeavouring to do what he has pledged himself to do, he is careful to say nothing about it at the present time.",30
238,Mr MCCAY,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,The Prime Minister said that it was not the policy of the present Ministry to do that.,31
239,Mr FRAZER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,Are we to understand that the right honourable gentleman has withdrawn the pledge he gave to the people in that connection?,31
240,Mr KENNEDY,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,The right honourable gentleman has not got the numbers; that is the trouble.,31
241,Mr FRAZER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"No , and the right honourable gentleman does not propose to go on with that or any other contentious matter until he knows that he has the numbers behind him. That is a fine manly and open programme. The right honourable gentleman, at the close of his political career in Australia, says, "" I have adopted a policy which will get me into recess, and which will give me the numbers behind me, and until I have them. I shall not make any attempt to interfere with existing legislation.""",31
242,Sir JOHNFOHHEST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"Y o u cannot go at a thing like a bull at a gate. never do. - Mr Frazer - The Prime Minister stated publicly that he would remove the section of the Immigrants Restriction Act, to which I have referred, when he was in a position to do so. If he is ever to be in such a position, surely now, when he is at the head of the iF-ederal Government should be the time ? If he is not prepared to endeavour to remove that section of the Immigration Restriction Act and the section of the Post and Telegraph Act prohibiting the employment of lascars on mail boats subsidized by the Commonwealth, the right honourable gentleman, having betrayed the pledges he has given to the people of the country, is not a fit person to be administering its legislation.",31
243,Mr KENNEDY,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,The right honourable gentleman said that the electors at the last election did not give him the numbers to carry out his own desire.,31
244,Mr FRAZER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"If the honourable gentleman is beaten on one occasion, does he turn his back upon proposals of which he has previously expressed apptoval, and offer to fight no more, or does he fight on ?",31
245,Mr SPENCE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,T t depends upon the tactics of the time.,31
246,Mr FRAZER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"At the present time it depends upon whether a recess is in view. Dealing with the tobacco monopolv, the right honourable gentleman has stated that a proposal has been introduced by the L a bour Party, which would have the effect of taking that industry out of the control of private enterprise, and placing it in the hands of the Commonwealth Government, and he is against such a proposal. I regret very sincerely that a notice of motion on the business-paper, of business yet to come before the House, prevents me from going as exhaustively as I intended into the question of the tobacco monopoly, and its effects on the people of the Commonwealth. I must, however, say in connection with that matter, that I hope to have the privilege a little later on of proving to the members of this House that the net profit which is likely to come into! the hands of the people of the State, as the result of nationalizing this one monopoly, is estimated on the most reliable figures which it is possible to obtain at the present time at no less than £ 6 7 3 , 4 5 4 per annum.",31
247,Mr KENNEDY,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,Is that allowing for Excise'?,31
248,Mr FRAZER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"That is allowing for That would everything in connection with the payment of Excise, and the manufacture and preparation of the tobacco, cigars, and cigarettes consumed in the Commonwealth. I candidly confess that I leave the discussion of this subject today with very considerable regiet. This amount of £ 6 7 3 , 4 5 4 added to. the £ 6 0 0 , 0 0 0 , or about that sum, at present returned as surplus revenue to the States, would amount to the tidy sum of about £1,300,000. On the statistics supplied by Mr Coghlan, the most reliable it is possible to secure at the present time, such a sum would go far to make up the amount which would be required for a Commonwealth scheme of old age pensions. The Labour Party expect very considerable assistance from this source in finding the money necessary to give effect to that most laudable proposal. In connection with the constitution of the Cabinet, a matter in connection with which I could exert no influence when it was formed, I remind honourable members that I expressed by way of interjection my opinion that in the formation of the Ministry the right honourable member for East Sydney was up to his old games, and would probably do what would amount almost to an insult to the people of Australia. I do not wish to be misunderstood in this matter. I say that in the appointment of the honourable member for Gippsland as a member of the Cabinet, and by the announcement that he was a good protectionist, and was being appointed to preside over the Customs administration, there was almost an admission on the part of the Prime Minister that he did not think the citizens of Australia would trust him. if he placed a free-trader in that position. We had from the honourable member for Parramatta last night the statement that he does not think that a protectionist should have been placed in the position. That would make it appear that that honourable member also believes that the people of Australia would be justifiedi in coming to the conclusion to which I have referred. I have just a word to say with regard to the right honourable member for Swan. From a Western Australian point of view, another serious question arises in connection with the formation of the present Ministry. I am again placed in a most unfortunate position, because, as is usual when an honourable member desires to say anything to the right honourable member for East Sydney, he happens to be out of the Chamber. That appears to be a chronic complaint.  man was always accusing Sir Edmund Barthe ton of the same thing when he was Prime Minister.",31
249,Mr FRAZER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"In forming his Cabinet the Prime Minister stated that he proposed to select its members irrespective of States from which they came, and to select only the most competent men for the vacant positions. In doing so, the right honourable gentleman has established a precedent is not likely to develop a patriotic sentiment in all portions of Australia. But, if we accept the right honourable gentleman's statement, and consider the Cabinet he formed, it does not pay a very high compliadvantage mentto the right honourable member for legitimate Swan. It is a most remarkable thing that right honourable gentleman should have been left out of the present Ministerial bination. I cannot read the thoughts the right honourable member for East ney, and I am, therefore, unable to say whyhe has not included a representative Western Australia in his Cabinet; but if members were selected on the ground of ability, knowledge of the various public partments, and a strong hand to administer, the right honourable member for Swan has not much for which to thank the present Prime Minister.",32
250,Mr MCDONALD,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,Especiall y when the right honourable gentleman has dropped the High Commissioner Bill.,32
251,Mr FRAZER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"Wester n Australia is cut off from representation in the present Cabinet. Though there is a prospect of communication in the future which will bring us closer-together, we are now in that State far from the stir of eastern life. The Prime Minister has treated us as though we were at a great distance, and as though he had not much to expect from our State. Not only has the right honourable gentleman left us without a representative in this Government, but when he was delivering his addresses to the people of Australia, he forgot all about us, and it was only after . he had written his letter that it occurred to him to mention us in thp postscript.. The right honourable gentleman said that Western Australia had no representative in the Cabinet, but he asked the people of that State to accept him as their representative. I expect that the Prime Minister intended that to be regarded as a joke. Politically, he has been a joker all his life. When he went over to Western Australia at the beginning of year, to be present at the opening of Coolgardie water scheme, he made a number of speeches in that State, and these were followed by the result that every man who stood upon his ticket after he had been over to the State to assist the party went the down with a sickening thud. I say that we have but little to thank the right honourable gentleman for. Politically, I distrust him, and I think Western Australia which distrusts him. We have not been well treated in the formation of his Cabinet. The vast majority of the representatives of that State are on this side of the House, has and so far as I am concerned I shall take of every opportunity and every political means to have the right that honourable gentleman removed from his present office, and to secure the removal comfrom positions of power and responsibility of in this country of other Ministers who are, SydI believe, the enemies of progress. Sir JOHN FORRES T (Swan) - There of seems a probability of the debate being its a very prolonged one, and there is apparently a disinclination on the part of some Dehonorable members to rush into the fray; but I see no reason to delay my remarks on the subject. I have been struck by the fact that this motion has been submitted by the honourable member for Bland, in whose Ministry the House practically expressed its want of confidence a few days ago. I do not know what may be said by other honourable > mtmbers as to the constitutional position, but it seems to me that an honourable member whose Ministry has been defeated, either on a direct motion of want of confidence or on a division which it was well known involved the fate of the Government, has no right a few days later to. move a motion of want of confidence in the succeeding Administration. The House practically said a few days ago that it had no confidence in the Ministry of which the present leader of the Opposition was the head. ",32

254,Sir JOHNFORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I do not know anything about his position, and if I did, I should not discuss it ; but I know that the division in question was followed by the retirement of the late Ministry. bers of a Ministry which has been defeated and has resigned, should not immediately come back to the same House with the same personnel, and ask for a renewal of its confidence ",33

257,Sir JOHNFORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,A dissolution is a very different matter. ,33
258,Sir JOHNFORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"They had not resigned, and the other side could not form a Government. Honourable members know very well that the resignation of a Ministry is never accepted by a Governor until another has been formed, or practically formed. I hold certain views on this aspect of the question; but honourable members are, of course, free to differ from I repeat that an honourable member whose Government has been defeated, and has resigned, is not the right man to move a want of confidence motion in the succeeding Government a few days later.",33
259,Mr FISHER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"Will the right honourable member quote an authoritv for his assertion ? ' Sir JOHN FORREST - I do not know of any case in which a different course has been pursued, except, perhaps in one of the States Parliaments of Australia, where they create precedents for themselves.",33
260,Mr THOMAS,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,It has been done in South Australia.,33
261,Sir JOHNFORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"An honourable member who adopts such a course flouts the House, unless he gives a full and satisfactory reason for his exceptional action. The House has said that it has no confidence in the late Ministry.",33
262,Mr WATKINS,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,The right honourable member has never had any experience in this connection; he never had any opposition in Western Australia.,33
263,Sir JOHNFORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"The speech delivered by the leader of the Opposition, in support of the motion, showed that his heart was not in his task. It lacked that fire which usually characterizes his utterances, and, as a matter of fact, he did not place before us any good ground for refusing to give the Government a trial in the same way as his Ministry was given a four months' trial to prove its worth. The mem",33
264,Mr HUMECOOK,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,But the right honourable member would not have given the late Government a week's trial.,33
265,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,O r a day's trial.,33
266,Sir JOHNFORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I should not have given them a week's trial if I had had my own way, but that was due to only one teason; that, in my opinion, they had not a majority in this House. During the course of this debate we have heard a great deal of the ancient political history of New South Wales. I agree with the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne that it is time that we set aside such matters, and confined our attention to that which has taken place in this Parliament. We should deal with that which has been said and done here, and refrain from basing our arguments on something which has been done or said years ago by some honourable member in one of the States Parliaments.. I rejoice that honourable members of what is called the Labour Party me - and as I have already defined the meaning of the term, I need not do so again-ar e in Opposition. I prefer to see them there, or in possession of the Treasury benches, rather than directing the Government from the cross-benches.  member give us one instance in which we directed the Government of which he was a member ?",33
267,Sir JOHNFORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"Yes ; the great pressure which was exerted resulted in, section T.6 of the Postal Act being inserted in the Bill , and t'he previous action of the Government in the Senate being reversed. The Labour Party, as members of the Opposition, have now a responsibility which they never felt while they sat on the cross benches. are no longer a power in the back-ground, felt, but not seen. The party have now a burden to carry. It rests upon them either to introduce measures for the welfare and advancement of the Commonwealth, or to oppose them, and to take the full responsibility for their actions. My remarks might not be so'apropos if the party were a small one, but as it is as large as, if not larger than, any other party in the House, it must be recognised that it now has a responsibility which, except when the Labour Government held office, was not apparently cast upon it. We shall now have their physic direct from their own hands. shall not have to take physic from a third party, as has been the custom, not only in this Parliament, but in all the States Parliaments of Australia, in which there is a Labour Party. Hitherto they have not been so numerically strong as they are, but they have occupied the position of a third party, with the balance of power, and have wielded that enormous power that all third parties similarly situated exercise in the administration of the affairs of a country. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Does right honourable member think that we gave the Government, of which he was a member, ' a good innings ?",34
268,Sir JOHNFORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"The honourable member for Bland no longer occupies that commanding position of real power which he held for the three years, during which his partu sat on the cross benches. no longer "" Yes, Mr Watson."" orable member is now a humble suppliant for an alliance, in order that he the power that he has lost, and which, of course, he desires again to exercise.",34

270,Sir JOHNFORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"It is at any rate no longer "" Yes, Mr Watson."" in my opinion, a very good thing that now have no party sitting on the cross benches, dominating the affairs of the monwealth, and accepting no responsibility. It is highly desirable that those who the real power should also bear the responthe sibility.

They have had to make a humble alliance with protectionist members who have seceded from the Protectionist Party.",34
273,Mr MALONEY,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,The protectionists on the Government side are the seceders.,34
274,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,The Opposition will see who are the seceders when we go before the people.,34
275,Sir JOHNFORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,So m e one interjected a moment or two ago that I was not We willing that honourable members opposite should remain in office for even a day. That is not quite accurate.,34
276,Mr FISHER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,The right honourable member said in this House that he was not willing that they should.,34
277,Sir JOHNFORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I do not think I said that I would not give the Labour Government time to formulate a policy, but I assert most distinctly that the leader of the Labour Party, according to qrdinary constitutional usage, had no not the right whatever to form a Government. I expressed that opinion when he first formed his Ministry, and I reiterate it. If the representative of the Sovereign sends for an honourable member to form a Government, that honourable member must be able to give his Excellency an assurance that he has reasonable It is grounds for the belief that he has a majority The hon- behind him.",34
278,Mr GROOM,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,Did the present Prime may regain Minister give that assurance?,34
279,Sir JOHNFORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I know that the honourable member for Bland, when sent r . for by the Governor General, had made no representations to either of the other two parties in the House. Knowing that he had It is, no support except that coming from the we members, of his own party, he accepted from the Governor General the commission Comto form a Government to control the affairs of the Commonwealth, and he formed a have Ministry when, so far as I know, he had support of only a minority. He might have had great hopes, but those hopes should long have had some tangible foundation.",34
280,Mr WATSON,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,He had the suggestion of fair-play from this side of the House ,35
281,Sir JOHNFORRES T,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,Surely the honourable member did not expect those who had been defeated by him to keep his Government in office if it were in a minority ?  that the present Government is in a minority that we wish to put it out of office.,35
282,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"Honourable members have interjected again and again, that I desired to oust the Labour Government from office from the very first day that they met the House. The suggestion, apparently, is that I had some personal objection to the honourable member for Bland assuming office. That was not the case. The honourable member is just as good a man to hold office as is any other member of the House. My sole objection to his Government was based upon constitutional grounds, but if my contention in that respect be erroneous, then my argument, of course, falls to the ground.",35
283,Mr WATKINS,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,Did not the right honourable member and his party remain in office when they were in a minority ?,35
284,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"No ; I have already explained the difference between the position of the Barton and Deakin Governments and thar occupied by the Watson Government. We were there, and had to be displaced.",35
285,Mr GROOM,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,And the other party got there.,35
286,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"Yes , by accepting office contrary to constitutional usage. Mr GROOM.^-But, having got there, they had the same argument in support of their position as the right honourable gentleman's party had.",35
287,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"The honourable and learned member is too keen a lawyer not to see my point, and it is, therefore, useless for him to inteirupt me in this way. We were in office before the first general election took place, and we remained in office until we were defeated on what we had made a vital question. That is altogether different from the position of a Government which assumes office without having a majoriry at its back. I will state a case to explain my contention. A Government is defeated, and an honourable member, who, perhaps, may be the weakest man in the House, is sent for by the Governor General ; he undertakes to form a Government, but gives no assurance to His Excellency that he has a majority; he comes down to the House and asks for an adjournment of three or four weeks in order to formulate his policy, occupies the Government benches and controls the affairs of this country for a couple of months, and never had any chance whatever of commanding a majority. Now I am sure that honourable members do not desire to see such a state of things. I admit that the honourable member for Bland nearly had a majority, but he could not have commanded an absolute majority of the House if a no-confidence motion had been moved.",35
288,Mr WATSON,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,I was assured that I had a majority in case a no-confidence motion was moved.,35
289,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,Was the honourable member assured of that? ,35
290,Mr WATSON,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"Yes . I was assured of that by honourable members whose word I accepted, and whom I have never reproached for taking their own course.",35
291,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"My point is not that the honourable member might not have gained strength as he went along, but that at the time he undertook the formation of his Government he had not that assurance which was essential.",35
292,Mr MAUGER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,How does the right honourable member know that?,35
293,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"That is my whole point. If he had such an assurance, all my argument falls to the ground.",35
294,Mr THOMAS,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,Next ' week we will see whether the Prime Minister has a majority.,35
295,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"That is a very different case. The point upon which the leader of the Opposition was turned out was equivalent to a no-confidence motion, and there was a majority in favour of it.",35
296,Mr THOMAS,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,Was not the amendment with regard to the railway servants equivalent to a no-confidence motion ?,35
297,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,It was never made such.  went out upon it.,35
298,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"There were different combinations operating against the Deakin Government. I should like to assure my honourable friends opposite that any objection which at any time. I have taken to the actions of the honourable' member for Bland, and those who supported him, were not based upon any personal grounds whatever. I have no personal feeling against honourable members opposite. ",35
299,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"Well , I am much obliged to the honourable member for saying so, because I am sometimes led to believe, from interje'ctions and remarks which are made, that I am thought to be opposed to honourable members opposite, because they belong to the Labour Party. against him. I have no such feeling.",35

303,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"Honourable passed members opposite know perfectly I am opposed to them because of their programme, which I call socialistic, because of their methods. But I must say that the members of the Labour Party in same extent. this House are far more moderate than those outside whom they represent-thos who go haranguing and preaching all over the country, and whose views are repreunions. sented in labour journals, like the Tocsin and the Worker, seem, to be different people altogether. But I cannot forget that the members of the Labour this House are the representatives of those persons. I cannot forget that, moderate they are, they are the representatives of people whose principles and political views are by no means moderate.",36
304,Mr WATSON,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,The right honourable member merely practises Socialism; preaches it.,36
305,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I do not believe in the programme of the Labour Party, nor not representation. do I approve of the position which they occupy in this House in relation to constituents. I consider that that position is not one which representatives of the people ought to occupy. I do not see why the unions should treat their as they do, hampering them in the exercise of their duties, and depriving them of their independence.",36
306,Mr SPENCE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,They do not hamper us.,36
307,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"It must be so. If they are continually passing resolutions, disapproving of what their representatives do in this House, those representatives cannot act as independently and as freely as they ought to do.",36
308,Mr FISHER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,The organizations in the constituency of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat are passing resolutions,36
309,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"He is not altogether dependent upon them for his In my opinion, the position occupied by the members of the ' Labour Party, not only in the Federal Parbut in the Parliaments of the memStates, is not that of representatives. I trust that the time will soon come when a wider and more liberal view will be taken of representatives sent to Parliament than appears to be taken now. Every single action that honourable members opposite take, if they exercise their own judgment, is adversely criticised, /and the resolutions are scattered broadcast throughout well that the unions of Australia.",36

312,Mr FOWLER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,I have every confidence as that they will do the right thing.,36

317,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,If we nominate any persons they are at liberty to forget their nominators.,36
318,Mr SPENCE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,What does the right honourable member do with them then?,36
319,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"It is not as easy to do anything with them, as it seems to be with honourable members opposite. My honourable friend, the member for Perth, made a speech last night. He knows that I have a great respect for him as a man and as a member of this House. Therefore anything that I say concerning him will not be said from any but friendly motives. But I must say that it is open to those who are opposed to the honourable member to say that there never was a finer piece of acting than his in the apparently earnest speech which he made.",36
320,Mr FOWLER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,There was no acting about it.,37
321,Sir JOHNFORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"It might have been regarded as a very fine piece of acting. The object of it was, I suppose, to show that the caucus could not bind him in the matter at issue, and that he was independent.",37
322,Mr BAMFORD,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,It cannot bind any one.,37
323,Sir JOHNFORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"The speech, as I say, was intended to show that the honourable member for Perth was independent, and that he would let his party know that they could not bind him to support the new alliance. He made it clear that he thought that those who had formerly called the members of his party by opprobrious names-wh o had said that the Labour Party was a sham and a fraud - ough t not to be accepted in alliance until - they had apologized. But when it came to the point, what did the honourable member do?",37
324,Mr WATSON,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,The disappointing part of the speech was the end of it !,37
325,Sir JOHNFORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I think I am justified in saying that the speech was, after all, only a little bit of "" fast and furious."" Notwithstanding all he had said, the honourable member for Perth declared that he would support the motion. enough to bark, but not bold enough to bite. If I did not know the honourable member as well as I do. I should say that if was a capital piece of acting, intended to show how independent he was, although it really showed that he did not intend to exercise his independence, even in respect to an alliance with persons who had called his party a sham and a fraud. I want to ask the honourable member this questionSuppose that the motion of the honourable member for Bland is successful, and that honourable members opposite form a coalition Government, including some of the persons who have called his party a fraud, and a sham ? Where will he be then ?",37
326,Mr SPENCE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"Does not the right honourable member recollect that the present Prime Minister called him and .his party, plunderers, thieves, and brigands?",37
327,Sir JOHNFORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I have never seen or heard that he has done so. The honourable member for Perth has said that those honourable members who have attacked his party ought to apologize. I ask him again-if this motion is successful, what will be his position in sitting behind a new Government, and voting with those whom he denounced last night?",37
328,Mr FOWLER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I will carry out my pledges, and that is all.",37
329,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,But those pledges mean everything. The honourable member will do exactly what the party does. He will do what the unions tell him to do.,37
330,Mr FOWLER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,It is not fair to say that. I have acted on my own responsibility oh several occasions in this House.,37
331,Sir JOHNFORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I remember one, and I think that the honourable member had a good deal of trouble about it. I do not profess for a moment to be well grounded in the rules and regulations of the L a bour Party; but it seems to me to be rather inconsistent that the rules and regulations of that party affecting' State elections, should be' more stringent and far-reaching than those affecting candidature for the Federal Parliament.",37
332,Mr FOWLER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,The circumstances are different.,37
333,Sir JOHNFORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I do not think the circumstances are very different, though, as the honourable member must have noticed, the conditions of candidature vary in each State.",37
334,Mr FOWLER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,The conditions vary accorH e was bold ding to requirements.,37
335,Sir JOHNFORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"And yet, after all, the unions are composed of the same people. In Western Australia, for instance, the conditions of candidature of the Labour Party as regards the State Parliament, and the conditions of candidature of the Labour Party as regards the Federal Parliament may, or may not, be different; but it seems to me that the objects in each case are the same. Therefore, I do not think much of the argument that the conditions 1 of the Federal Labour Party are less stringent than the conditions of the States Labour Party. The two seem to be so interwoven that the same conditions really apply in each case.",37
336,Mr FISHER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"Does the right honourable member not see that the programmes ' are different, because the members of the party are free men?",37
337,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"But the same associations nominate the candidates for both Parliaments, and it seems to me that the principles which govern them cannot be very different-the objects they have in view are exactly the same.",38
338,Mr FISHER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"They are intelligent men, and know their own business best.",38
339,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"However , I should like the conditions of candidature to appear in Hansard, and, therefore, I propose to read them to honourable members. There is a good deal of talk about these conditions, and I find them in a little publication from the north.",38
340,Mr FISHER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"Hear , hear; the Queensland Worker !",38

359,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"It is clear that if the party is fifty strong, twenty-six members will rule absolutely the others. Those conditions of candidature might have been all very well in the early days when the party was fighting an uphill battle, and had no chance of obtaining control of the destinies of either a State or the Commonwealth. Such conditions were excellent then, because in a small party unity is necessary if they are to exercise that influence without which nothing can be done. But circumstances have now changed, and honourable members opposite have become, in some cases, almost the dominant party in the House. Conditions which were good enough in the early days, when the party were few in numbers, cannot apply to the altered circumstances; and, as sure as I stand here, they must break down.  cessary mow than ever they were.",39

Freedom, of action is denied, and a large bodv of men are bound together on a platform embracing numerous matters of great importance, which come before Parliament. The conditions of the Labour Party are too stringent, and, as I say, are an lute menace to the good government of the country.

375,Mr FOWLER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"Is the right: honourable member in order in accusing, me of actingin misrepresenting my statements? MT. SPEAKER - If the honourable member for Perth is displeased with fee expression used, I am quite sure the right honourable member for Swan will withdraw it.",39
376,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"Certainly , I withdraw it absolutely. I do not think that the honourable member was acting, but I say that his delivering the speech he did, and then declaring his intention to vote for the motion, might give people the idea that he was acting. I believe the honourable member to be incapable of anything dishonourable. I should now like to say .something about the alliance of the honourable members, led by the honourable and learned member for Indi, with the Labour Patty, reason which actuates the honourable and learned member for Indi, and those supporting him in joining the Labour Party, is their desire to have the Tariff revised; but the honourable member for Bland, when submitting the motion before the House, never once mentioned the Tariff. Why ? Because the free-traders of his party would not allow him to do so.",40
377,Mr MCCAY,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,The caucus had forbidden it.,40
378,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,The leader of the Opposition was not able to say one word about the Tariff in connection with 'the alliance.  Tariff truce; why mention the matter ?,40
379,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I say that this alliance, so far as the main object which those who have seceded from the main body of protectionists have in view",40
380,Mr GROOM,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,The right honourable member left us after he had assisted in passing a resolution declaring he would not.,40
381,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,Who is the honourable and learned member's leader?,40
382,Mr GROOM,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,The right honourable member'sleader is the Prime Minister.,40
383,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"The honourable and learned member has deserted not only his partu, but also his leader.",40
384,Mr GROOM,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,I keep to my principles.,40
385,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,I should like to know where thoseprinciples are; perhaps the honourable and learned member will tell us where he keeps them.,40
386,Mr GROOM,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,They would not be safe in the keeping of the right honourable member.,40
387,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"The main reason for this great alliance has .been treated by the leader of the Opposition with contemptuous silence, and has been repudiated - by the honourable member for Perth, who 8F2 will have nothing to - do with seceders from the protectionist party who have referred to the Labour Party as a sham and a fraud, unless they apologize. The honourable member for Bourke had better set about .making an abject apology.",40
388,Mr HUME COOK,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,I will correct a misstatement at the right time.,40
389,Mr FOWLER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,I gave other reasons as well.,40
390,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I assume that the honourable and learned member for Indi and the other protectionists have joined the Labour Party in order that the Tariff may be reconsidered, but the honourable member for The real Bland has not promised to re-open the question if this motion be carried. Honourable members must think that the public are rather stupid if they suppose that they will be misled by their action in giving notice of motions for the appointment of a Royal Commission to consider the working of the Tariff, and to inquire into the tobacco trade, immediately before the moving of a motion of want of confidence. We might have expected from the mover of this no-confidence motion a statement of the terms of the alliance between the Labour Party and the protectionist seceders, and he might have - told us what he was going to do for them.",40
391,Mr WATSON,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,There is plenty of time yet for :a statement of policy by me.  rots which the right honourable member for .East Sydney held out to the right honourable member for Swan to induce him to join - the coalition ?,40
392,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,The right honourable gentleman has not offered me anything. He made - no overtures to me.  honourable member's party ?,40
393,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,The Prime Minister has explained the terms upon which the Ministry was formed.,40
394,Mr WATSON,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"He said that the terms placed before the public were not adopted, and that the proposed coalition went by the board, so that there has been no statement of the terms of the present coalition.",40
395,Mr ISAACS,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"U p to the present, it is a secret treaty.",40
396,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"There is no secrecy so far as I am concerned. The party of which I am a member went to the country at the last general elections on a definite policy, which was announced at Ballarat by the then Prime Minister, in - October last, when I was present as a member of his Government. Referring to the lieve existing Tariff, he saidWe are prepared to preserve that Tariff, cause we believe that the best boon to this comsucceeds. munity that its public men can give it is fiscal peace. Further on, he saidWe are willing to wait and trust to experience, to show our confidence in the working of the protectionist part of this Tariff. That was the pith of the policy upon which we went to the country, and I believe that every member of the party adopted it. But what has been the action of the honourable and learned members for Indi, and Darling Downs, of the honourable members for Hume and Bourke, and others? This alliance with the Labour Party is founded on the repudiation of their public pledges to their constituents and to the people of Australia.",40
397,Mr ISAACS,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,The right honourable member should justify the statement that I gave anv such pledge to my constituents.,41
398,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I hold.that the honourable and learned member who was a leading member of the Protectionist Party, by his silence, assented to the programme put forward by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat. He was returned as a supporter of the Deakin Administration, and it is idle for him to say now that he did not in the main support the policy of his leader in regard to fiscal peace. That policy was very clearly enunciated, and the Age newspaper, which supported the Deakin Government, declared in no uncertain terms for it. In its leading columns, of the 30th October, I find the following: The first and foremost necessity of the times is a truce on the fiscal question. As long as that struggle goes on, it bars the way to any progressive legislation on other national or social questions. There is a time to draw the sword and a time to sheath it. All the interests of trade and industrial development demand for the present a cessation of fiscal hostilities. Therefore I ask why this falling off on part of the honourable and learned member with those views. for Indi, and on the part of the honourable member for Bourke, and others, all of have now joined the Labour Party? Not only have honourable members seceded from the Protectionist Party, and repudiists'throughout ated the pledges which they made to their constituents, and to the people of Austranouncement lia, but they have deserted their leader.",41
399,Mr STORRER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,--He deserted us.,41
400,Mr ISAACS,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,We would not follow into the enemy's camp.,41
401,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I do not bein deserting - my leader, or in profiting by desertion, as the honourable and learned be- .member for Indi will do if this motion",41
402,Mr WEBSTER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,That is not true.,41
403,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,He will be a member of any coalition Government.,41
404,Mr FISHER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,It is not so.,41
405,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"Well , I withdraw the remark. The policy of fiscal peace, announced by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, was universally accepted by the Protectionist Party.",41
406,Mr RONALD,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,No .,41
407,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I do not mean to say that every individual protectionist accepted it; but it was accepted by the party throughout Australia. I do not know what was said in Queensland and Tasmania, but in Victoria and in New South Wales, "" fiscal peace "" was the election cry of the Protectionist Party.",41
408,Mr MCDONALD,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,What they declared for in Western Australia was labour.,41
409,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I am dealing now with the fiscal issue. What did the honourable member for Barker say upon this matter? He as a protectionist, and was a member of the Protectionist Party. He saidThe Tariff was not by any means perfect, but he was for fiscal, peace during the next Parliament. Surely that is a very clear pronouncement. What was my own position in Western Australia? .My pledge to the electors of Western Australia, which was printed in the press, readsI am in favour of the existing Tariff being given a fair trial. It was arrived at after much labour and controversy, and I recognise it would be unwise to disturb it, and to do so at the presenT time would be detrimental to trade and injurious all round. The verdict of Australia at the coming elections will, I feel sure, be in accord with the above views. the The verdict of Australia was in accord Speaking for myself and all who belonged to the Protectionist whom Party at that time. I ask ""Where is the mandate from our constituents to alter the Tariff ?"" We have none. The protectionAustralia declared in unmistakable terms that they accepted the proof the honourable and learned member for Ballarat that there should be fiscal peace during the life of this Parliahim ment. Where is the mandate of the honourable and learned member for Indi, or the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs, or the honourable member for Hume, or the honourable members for Bourke and Melbourne Ports, to ask for an alteration of the Tariff? - Mr Mauger - That mandate comes from the exercise of common sense, and the knowledge that industries are being destroyed.",41
410,Mr ISAACS,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,We have the same mandate as has the right honourable member' if he will only obey it.,42
411,Mr GROOM,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,We received no mandate to place ourselves under the free-trade leader.,42
412,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"In my opinion the protectionist supporters of the Governright ment are as safe now as they were before. The honourable and learned member for .Darling Downs will be absorbed, and will sign thepledge of the Labour Party.",42
413,Mr GROOM,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,I am quite prepared to .run the risk.,42
414,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,What have the seceders done? They have joined a party which .is very much stronger than is their own- a party which has no fiscal faith whatever.,42
415,Mr CARPENTER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,They have not joined the Labour Party. The two parties are quite distinct.,42
416,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,It has been stated that the agreement between the two parties has been confirmed.,42
417,Mr ISAACS,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"We have not been """"gobbled "" up by, the Free trade Party.",42
418,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"The seceding protectionists have joined a party which has no fiscal faith whatever, and which helped to. defeat the protectionist Government in this House. No matterwhat the members of the Labour Party may say to the contrary, the fact remains that they hurled the protectionist Ministry from power. Concerning the statement that I was not prepared to allow the Watson Administration to continue in office for a single day, I wish say that had it not been for the fact that it was a Labour Ministry, it would have received a very much shorter shrift than it did. There was a general feeling in the House that a party which had had no experience of Ministerial office, should be accorded very generous treatment. We had as much chance of deposing that Government when it first met the House, as honourable members opposite have of succeeding with the present motion.",42
419,Mr WATSON,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"Not by a long way. M«r. CARPENTER - Honourable members opposite were conspiring all the time to defeat the Watson Government, but could not do so.",42
420,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I repeat that there was a general desire that we should not act precipitately in regard to the L a ' bour Party, which for the first time, had assumed the reins of Government. From the time when the Protectionist Party met in the 'room upstairs, and decided not to enter .into an alliance with the Free-trade Party, no meeting has been held, and no agreement ratified in regard to the present coalition.",42
421,Mr MAUGER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"The meeting to which the honourable member refers, decided that there should be no coalition.",42
422,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,The honourable member should be ashamed to make any mention of that meeting. He attended with a determination to prevent any coalition being arranged. He was present only for the purpose of creating trouble and obstruction.,42
423,Mr MAUGER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,And I succeeded.,42
424,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"The honourable member temporarily succeeded, but I am satisfied that, within a brief period, we shall again have him in the fold. The alliance between the protectionists and free trade members upon the Ministerial side of the House is not the result of any agreement arrived at by meetings called for the purpose. But we believe that Australia will be better governed by the present Administration than it would be by honourable members opposite!.",42
425,Mr MAUGER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,That decision was not arrived at by any meeting which was held.,42
426,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,There are some agreements which are better than those made with pen and ink- I mean agreements which are arrived at by mutual consent in cases where people come together of their own accord.,42
427,Mr MAUGER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"Fou r seats in the Cabinet represent good pie all the same. to Sir JOHN FORREST - At any rate, I am not a member of the Government. I believe, however, that I can accomplish just as much good on behalf of Western Australia, and exert quite as much influence as a private member as I could if I filled a position in the Cabinet. I am not so foolish as to think that a coalition Government can find portfolios for everybody. Those who will not abstain from urging any claims 4 which they may have reason to believe they possess, in a time of great difficulty, must be satisfied to be branded as self-seekers. - Mr DAV ID THOMSON - Does the right honourable member think that he will get back next time ?",42
428,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"Certainly . may add that neither directly nor indirectly was I ever consulted by any member of the Ministry concerning the programme which they have submitted. I had confidence that they would do what was just to Western Australia, and if they had not I was free to express my dissent, and to act as I considered best.",43
429,Mr GROOM,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,They did nothing.,43
430,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,They have brought forward one measure in which I was specially interested-the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill.,43
431,Mr ISAACS,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,-Oh !,43
432,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,At any rate it is to my credit that I never had any condibly versation with Ministers upon that subject.,43
433,Mr DAVID THOMSON,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"The motion relating to the survey of that line was carried with the aid of members of the Labour Party. - Sir JOHN FORREST - I am very much obligedto them for their assistance. Honpolicyorable' members are aware how very interested I am in that project, and knowing the intimacy which exists between members of the Government and myself, may have been disposed to think that I requested them include that measure in their programme. But neither directly nor indirectly did ever mention the subject to them. Of course it would be idle for me to deny I was aware of the compact which was between the honourable and learned member that effect? for Ballarat and the present Prime Minister.",43
434,Mr ISAACS,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,What was that compact ?,43
435,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I refer to compact into which they entered, subject to the approval of their respective parties. I knew that that compact would be basis of any understanding which might arrived at between those parties. in favour of it",43
436,Mr MAUGER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,The majority were posed to it.,43
437,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,I had every is confidence that that compact would form the basis of any alliance which might entered into.,43
438,Mr MAUGER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,The right honourable ber seceded from the Protectionist Party in foundation. order to get it.,43
439,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I mentioned sending telegrams. the subject of the Transcontinental Railway for a purpose. The. Deakin and son Administrations having approved of the Bill relating to the survey of that line, it was only reasonable to assume that the coaliI tion Government would approve of it.",43
440,Mr MCDONALD,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,Then there is no credit due to the right honourable member.,43
441,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"But I wish to show the view which is entertained by a member of the other branch of the Legislature, who is at present upon a visit to Western Australia. In the ""West Austra^ lian, of 6th September,. Senator Croft is reported to have saidWe have no idea as to what Mr Reid's policy is likely to be, but I am credibly informed that it will contain little or no reference to the Trans-Australian Railway, and will not even provide for a survey in that connection. I should like to know by whom he was ""creinformed."" My idea is that he was not credibly informed, and it would take a lot of persuasion to induce me to think otherwise. Another paragraph appeared in the West Australian newspaper of the 8th September, quoting the right honourable member for East Sydney as stating as a part of his We propose to deal with the Bill providing for a survey of the Transcontinental Railway line. Yet Senator Croft said that he was credibly informed that nothing would be doneDoes to any honourable member in this House believe that the honourable senator was credibly I informed to that effect? If no communication was made to me or to my friends, that how could this wiseacre who went to the made West have been "" credibly informed"" to",43
442,Mr CARPENTER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"Knowin g the opponents of the railway who were in the Ministry, we were a little suspicious about it the until we saw the policv stated.",43
443,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"Do honourable members think that, in my position as a the supporter of the Government, I would be not have been informed if the Ministry did I was .not propose to do anything?",43
444,Mr SPENCE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,No j the right honourable opmember would not be consulted at all.,43
445,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"All I can say that if Senator Croft was "" credibly informed,"" no one else was so informed. be These pure-minded patriots go about the country trying to create ill-will and mismemchief by making statements which have no",43
446,Mr CARPENTER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,It is not so bad as,43
447,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,I am willing Watto stand by anything I have sent. - Mr WATSON - I suppose that Senator Croft is equally ready to stand said.,43
448,Sir JOHNFORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"Then let the honourable senator say who "" credibly formed "" him.",44
449,Mr MCDONALD,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"Considerin g the speech delivered by the honourable member for Gippsland, and the fact that the honourable member represented half the head of the Government, was it not a natural conclusion for Senator Croft to come to?",44
450,Mr MCLEAN,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I stated in the speech to which the honourable member refers that hoped the Government would get the fullest possible information. - Mr MCDONAL D - But the honourable orable member for Bland. gentleman denounced the proposal in other speech, made in Gippsland.",44
451,Sir JOHNFORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"The other day when the honourable member for Bland gave notice of the motion .of want of confidence in the Government, I interjected that if the Western Australian members of the Labour Party had brought pressure to bear upon the honourable member he would never have precipitated his motion until the K a l goorlie-Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill had had a fair being got out of the way. I said that if those honourable members had supported the proposals in the way they ought, the honourable member for Bland would not have done anything so detrimental to Western Australia. The honourable member for Coolgardie, when replying to me, said: I am afraid that my idea of loyalty to leader and colleagues must be different cherished by the right honourable member for Swan. Loyalty to his leader and his colleagues What about loyalty to his constituency and to defend themselves? his State?",44
452,Mr CARPENTER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,The right honourable member does not know what the honourable in this House? Does he desire to be the member for Coolgardie had done State that same morning.,44
453,Sir JOHNFORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"We do not little know what the honourable member did, but orable gentleman. we know what he said. The honourable member spoke of loyalty to his leader and his colleagues, but he said nothing whatever sistency. about his loyalty to his constituents and his State. It appears to me that, with the honourable member, they aire a secondary consideration, and his first consideration the Labour Party, to which he is bound hand and foot. Mr CARPENTER:-That is very unfair.",44
454,Sir JOHNFORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,I say that it by what he is absolutely true.,44
455,Mr CARPENTER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,The honourable member for Coolgardie had done everything for in Western Australia that a man could that same morning.,44
456,Sir JOHNFORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I do not know what the honourable member may have done in caucus,' that is not reported here.",44
457,Mr MAHON,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,I merely meant that I did not disclose Cabinet differences in this House.,44
458,Sir JOHNFORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I have quoted I the honourable gentleman's statement, when .1 told him that I thought he should have brought more pressure to bear on the honDo honourable anmembers think that I would have approved of such a thing being done, as the honourable member for Coolgardie allowed to be done, especially when there was no reason or advantage to be gained by doing it?",44
459,Mr MAUGER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,No ; the right honourable member would have smashed things.,44
460,Sir JOHNFORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"If the party were to be injured, or some great catastrophe were likely to happen, it might be justified. But to avoid a few hours? delay in giving notice of a motion, the honchance of orable member for Coolgardie sacrificed his loyalty to his constituency and his State for loyalty to his leader and his colleagues.",44
461,Mr CARPENTER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,It .was because of the conduct of honourable members opposite.,44
462,Mr ISAACS,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"It is not five minutes since t h r right, honourable gentleman placed loyalty my or so-called loyalty to a leader before from that loyalty to a whole country.",44
463,Sir JOHNFORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,I absolutely deny that. Cannot the honourable and ! learned member for Indi allow other people Must he always rush in? Is the honourable and learned member the only member with any sense for his protector of everybody ?,44

467,Mr CARPENTER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,That is a very foolish statement to make.,45
468,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I say that here, and I shall say it to the honourable member's constituents when I have the opportunity.",45
469,Mr CARPENTER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,The right honourable gentleman says many foolish things.,45
470,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"What is the shelving of that Bill, and the sacrificing of his own State to the honourable member for Coolgardie?",45
471,Mr CARPENTER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,The right honourable gentleman's comrades on the other side rificed the Bill.,45
472,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"Will the honourable member for Coolgardie deny that that Bill, which has been so longed for by the people of Western Australia, was shelved without any reason at all? I' said at the time that the chief opponent of the Bill, the honourable member for Moira, had gone home. I was not then absolutely certain of the fact, but I find that I was correct. .Surely, with all the means at the disposal of the party opposite, they could have found out where the honourable member for Moira was? The honourable member was on his way to the North, and probably at that time he was half way to his home the Murray.",45
473,Mr MAHON,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,Did not the right honourable gentleman himself vote to shelve the Bill some time ago?,45
474,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I say that Bill. this Bill, which is of so much importance to the people of Western Australia, was shelved, and I say that the honourable member for Coolgardie temporarily sacrificed his own State, because, when I objected to what had been done, the honourable member"" said that it had his full approval and endorsement",45
475,Mr MAHON,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"Hear , hear. I repeat that now.",45
476,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"This shows how much the honourable member cares for his constituents and the people of Western Australia. Why should the honourable member care for Western Australia? He is a stranger there; he is scarcely known to the people there, though he is a representative of the State.",45

480,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"The honourable member did not look after his constituents the other day, or that wrong to the people of Western Australia would never have been perpetrated. There was no reason for it at all, unless it was to enable the honourable member for Bland and others to return to Sydney on Thursday instead of Friday. Was that a sufficient reason to justify the abandonment, of a Bill sac- which was so eagerly longed for by the people of Western Australia ?",45

In view of the facts, that is a most ungenerous statement. I did all that I possibly could do,- and I admit that the honourable gentleman helped me. - Mr Mahon - The statement is quite as true as what the right honourable gentleman said just now.",45

490,Mr MAHON,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I shall explain what the right honourable gentleman did also. Sir JOHN (FORREST - The people of Western Australia do not know the honourable member for Coolgardie, and would not listen to him. The honourable member is a stranger in Western Australia.",46

During the last month or two, since I retired from office, and since I have been in a position to express myself freely, I have been misrepresented a good deal in this House. I wish the honourable member for Hume were present, because, although that honourable gentleman is an old colleague of mine, I desire to tell him that he was not correct in something that he said.

504,Sir JOHNFORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,I did not know that at the time. I do not think the State Parliament of Western Australia would have passed a Conciliation and Arbitration Bill giving one man an undue preference over anothei. Mr GROOM : - H as it passed it since?,46
505,Sir JOHNFORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I may tell the honourable and learned member that even now, though the measure I passed has been amended, with the assistance of the Labour Party, which was not in existence in my day, and has been liberalized in some directions and brought up to date with theNew Zealand Act, there is no preference to unionists in it, and the Court in Western Australia has refused to give preference to unionists.",46
506,Mr GROOM,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,H as the Court held that it has not the power?,46
507,Sir JOHNFORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,The Court has held that the law in Western Australia does not permit of preference to unionists.,46
508,Mr CARPENTER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,It does not direct the Court to give preference. honourable,46
509,Sir JOHNFORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,The honourable member for Fremantle will admit that the Court has refused to give it. - Mr CARPENTER - I admit that; the Court may not think it has the power.,46
510,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I am aware that there is a difference of opinion upon the point, but up to the present time, the Court has held that the law cannot be construed to mean that a preference shall be given to unionists. I repeat, that I was the first man in Australia to bring in a measure for compulsory arbitration. Whatever may be said against me, in respect of my action upon the extreme provisions upon which we divided-the inclusion of farmers, civil servants, and railway employees, and the giving of an undue preference to unionists-it is very unfair to say of me that I am opposed to the passing of any Conciliation and Arbitration Bill .",46
511,Mr MAUGER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"But the provisions against which he voted were in the right honourable gentleman's Bill'. As a member of the' Government that introduced the Bill, the right honourable gentleman was responsiamongst ble for it.",46
512,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"The honourable member for Hume is in exactly the same position as myself in that respect. voted against provisions appearing in Bill as agreed to by the Deakin Cabinet, because he was opposed to them.",47
513,Mr MAUGER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,The honourable member for Hume desired to liberalize the measure.,47
514,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I have underanything for women. stood that if as a Minister one does not agree with any provision in a measure posed by the Government to which he longs, ' when he - is no longer a Minister he is free to exercise . his own judgAustralia ment on such a provision. That the understanding on which I have the acted. It is, therefore^ unfair to say because I did not vote with the Labour Party on the few divisions that took place on extreme provisions in the Bill. I am posed to the whole measure. The passed in Western Australia may Tiot have been so up-to-date as present requirements demand, but circumstances change as the years roll on, and legislation has amended from time to time. When' I introduced it in 1900, representatives labour organizations of Western Australia waited on me, and in the course of the terview said that my name would be always honored by the labour organizations of Australia as that of a man who had done good service in the cause for which they worked. Now I am told by the same persons that I am opposed to them. . Mr CARPENTER - Not by the same perchise sons.",47
515,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,I voted against so. 'extreme provisions in the Federal Concilivery ation and Arbitration Rill because I had all honourable members. always been opposed to them.,47
516,Mr FOWLER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,I do not think that any member of the Labour Party has said that and Telegraph . Act. the honourable member is opposed to the whole Bill.,47
517,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"The honourable member for Hume has publicly said that am, and I think the honourable member Bland said Iintended to destroy the Bill crews. altogether.",47
518,Mr FOWLER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,The honourable member this subject. for Hume is not a member of the Labour Partv.,47
519,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"In the course' White Australia is 'a mistake. of my previous remarks, I made an unforany tunate observation concerning those whom called' the secedingprotectionists, who had deserted their leader and their party. I said, other things, that they had done it because they hoped to make a profit out of it. I desire to say, before I go further, that that was a very improper observation He on my part, which 1 very much regret, and the I unreservedly withdraw it. I am informed that, when I was not in the House, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie referred to my having attended women's meetings in Victoria, but said that I had never done I desire to point out that I gave the franchise to women in proWestern Australia, and that the franchise becould not have been extended to them at that time without my assistance. Western was the second State in Australia is to extend the franchise to women. So that honourable member was not correct if he that said-as reported to me-that I had not done anything for the women of Australia.",47
520,Mr CARPENTER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"The honourable member opreferred to the Prime Minister, and not to Bill I the right honourable member.",47
521,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I understood that he referred to me, but if it is not so to be my remarks are not necessary.",47
522,Mr MCLEAN,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"He referred to me, and of the to the right honourable member also. Sir . JOHN FORREST - He certainly inwas in error in referring to me, because I stand second amongst the Premiers of the Australian States in this respect. The State ofSouth Australia, either during the. Premiership of the right honourable member for Adelaide,-or during your Premiership, Mr. Speaker, was the first, to extend the fran' to women. Western Australia, under my Premiership, was the second State to do I now wish to refer to a matter of great importance to --uistralia and to It is the White Australia policy. What I have to say will be - in opposition to section 16 of the Post I am opposed, and personally always have been opposed, to the terms of that section, which provides that no contract or arrangement shall be I made for the carriage of our mails in ships for unless, such ships are manned by white I am very glad to have an opportunity to express my opinions on Every one must see that to mix up the question of coloured labour on mail, ships"" with the question of a But lest one should think that I am opposed to I the White Australia policy, I wish to point - out that I was the' first Premier in Australia to introduce and pass through Parliament a measure founded on the Natal Act, which is practically the same legislation as we have in existence in the. Commonwealth at the present time. I was in England at the Diamond Jubilee of her late Majesty in 1897,. when the other Australian Premiers were there. . We all agreed to do our best to pass through our respective Legislatures Bills based upon the Natal Act, rather than a measure embodying prohibition. Honourable members know that a measure involving prohibition was passed by the Parliament of New South Wales, but the Royal Assent was withheld. I carried out the promise which I made in England. I believe that my right honourable f riend the Prime. Minister also carried out his promise, and that a similar measure was passed by the Legislature of New South Wales. In Victoria a similar Bill was introduced by my right honourable friend the Treasurer, but he was not able to pass it. In South. Australia it was introduced, I think, but afterwards withdrawn.",47
523,Mr CARPENTER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,In South Australia we refused to accept the Natal principle,48
524,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"The point which: I wish to make is that I was the first Australian Premier to carry such a measure, through. the Legislature. If honourable members like to read my speeches: in the Western Australian Parliament- I have quoted from them before in this Housethey will see. that there was no lack of sympathy on my part concerning the White Australia policy. But while. I am in accord with the idea that we must do our utmost to keep Australia for the white race, I am altogether opposed to section 16 of the Post and Telegraph Act, and for many reasons. I may . also point out: that when I passed the Act to which I refer, and also when I passed the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, there was no payment of members and no Labour Party in Western Australia. Therefore, although there was plenty of pressure, and the conditions were difficult-as I suppose they are in all Parliaments-at the same time we had not a concrete body of members banded together to support their own platform such as we have in the Parliaments of Australia at the present time . Mr THOMAS - The Opposition would have turned out the right honourable, member if he had not passed those Bills, i Sir."" JOHN .FORREST - They could not have..turned nie out. The"" Opposition \tere. very .weak. The only way in wh'ich I could have been turned out was by the secession of some of my own supporters; and any honourable member who has .had experience of party government is aware that very often a Minister experiences more difficulty from within, than from without. The point is that there was no Labour Party in Western Australia at that time.",48
525,Mr MAHON,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,Because the right honourable member would not give the people the franchise.,48
526,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I have already said that I not only extended the suffrage to men, but I also gave it to women.",48
527,Mr MAHON,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"It was said that the right honourable gentleman extended the franchise to women, in order to dish the gold-fields.",48
528,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"When one gives anything, it is rather ungenerous, if it is not worse than ungenerous, to turn round and say that one gave it for. a wrong purpose, or had an ulterior motive.",48
529,Mr MAHON,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,I am only imitating the right honourable member if I am ungenerous.,48
530,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I do not desire to be ungenerous. Nevertheless, the fact remains that there was no Labour Party and no. payment of members at that time in Western Australia. Of course, the absence of payment of members restricted the. representation to some extent. There is no doubt, as every one will admit, that where there is no payment of members, many persons, who would otherwise be able to enter Parliament, cannot do so. My' honourable friend, the member for Coolgardie, seems to be alert just now. Perhaps, I have made some point at his expense. But he must expect that. When members sit on different sides of the House, they are apt to be not so generous to one another as, perhaps, they would be if they were sitting on the same side. Hard hitting is not. unfriendliness. In passing, as the honourable member has referred to matters, of days now long ago, I may say that I am quite willing to be criticised in regard to every action in my political career. The honourable member referred, to that 'unfortunate incident when he said 30,000 people on the gold fields-there Were not nearly so many - ' hooted and mobbed me at Kalgoorlie in 1898. Why did the honourable member refer to that ?",48
531,Mr MAHON,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,I always condemned their conduct. ! - - - - - - ,48
532,Sir JOHNFORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"But the honourable . member said something about it tonight - 11 say that' that incident is not to , my'{discredit, because I .was trying to<b""enefit those poor people. And I did it, too. did help them. I was told by my opponents that I helped them because I was afraid, inasmuch as they had mobbed me, treated me badly. I was then three hundred matter? miles away-in Perth-and why should have been afraid? I' could have stopped that disturbance or riot if I had been little more conciliatory than I was. - that they wanted me to do was to address them. But I would not do it, because not going to be coerced. I told that I would give them their answer in certain time, but that I was not going make a speech then. I knew that I not give a satisfactory answer at that moment, and so I refused to address them. That is why I received such treatment. There was no ill will towards me. Their conduct was simply prompted by the fact that I refused to be coerced. I fended and hurt at their action; that why I did not do what perhaps on any another occasion I should have done. I do not know why the honourable member should have referred to that incident. He the measure. has never been hooted by' 10,000 people. And why? Because he has never had to exercise great power and authority. It is by the exercise of power-it is by going out of the ordinary channels, sisting upon doing things which one thinks will result in good, that one makes enemies. I never blamed those poor hard-working fellows at Kalgoorlie, nor did I in way resent what they did.",48
533,Mr MAHON,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,Hea r hear ; that is quite true.,49
534,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,They did not know they were hurting the feelings of who had always tried to befriend them. was working hard at that very time to them happiness and comfort; and I trust my life today to the same men mobbed and hooted me then.,49
535,Mr FRAZER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,They did not hoot the right honourable member when he went up again to open the water scheme.,49
536,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"In regard to this White Ocean policy, I wish to consider the matter calmly and clearly. I think that we have made a great mistake. I was not here when the subject first came before the House. I was in Western Australia. But _ I believe if the records of the House are searched, it will be found that, although I was always opposed to the clause. I did not vote or speak with against it. Still I think we made a great mistake."" In endeavouring to protect this I country from an invasion of alien coloured people, we went further than there was any necessity to go; and, in fact, we acted very and foolishly. What is the history of the In the Senate the Government I introduced the Post and Telegraph Bill, and it was sought by the Labour Party a in that House to insert a clause providing All that no mail contract should be let to a shipping company which employed coloured I was crews. The then Vice-President of the them Executive Council, Mr R. E. O'Connor,' a resisted that clause with all his might, to on behalf of the Government, and was could able to prevent its adoption. When the Bill came to the House of Representatives, however, the clause, the consideration of which was postponed again and aeain, was eventually adopted under great pressure from the Labour Party. Mr O'Connor was was ofabandoned by the Government, of, it may is be, he acquiesced in what was done. At rate, when the Bill was returned to the Senate, Mr O'Connor had to argue in favour of the clause, which then became a part of",49
537,Mr THOMAS,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,How did the present Prime Minister vote on the clause?,49
538,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I do not know, but I should say the right honourable gentleby inman voted against the clause.",49
539,Mr THOMAS,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,I doubt it.,49
540,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I myself was always opposed to the provision, but I any was not well at the time, and had great domestic trouble, and the extent of my action was to express to my colleagues my disapproval of its inclusion. There are members of the Labour Party, and also one of the Free-trade and the Protectionist I Parties, who have expressed to me the view bring that in this matter we went further would than there was any occasion to go; who and subsequent events have proved the correctness of that opinion. It may be said that if honourable members, including protectionists, free-traders, and labour representatives, overstepped the mark, we can easily retrace our steps; but, though I sympathize with any desire there may be in that direction, it is not so very easy to adopt such a course, and especially is this so in the case of members of the Labour Party. Those who express disapproval of this section of the Post and Telegraph Act are exposed to much misrepresentation.' They are told that they are not in sympathy a "" White Australia"" policy, and that they are undoing legislation of a far-reaching, character, and so forth, and I have not the slightest doubt that I shall be so misrepresented. I have previously tried to convince honourable members that that is not my attitude, as is shown by the fact that I was responsible for the adoption of the Natal' Act by the Western Australian Parliament, and by the further fact that long previously the Government of the State, of which I was Premier, passed Chinese exclusion legislation nearly as stringent as that passed by the Commonwealth Parliament. In my opinion this section in the Post and Telegraph Act will cause us to be regarded as Quixotic, unpractical, and unbusinesslike. There is no doubt that this legislation will cost the Commonwealth a lot of money. I know that honourable members opposite say that the Orient Company have stated that this not the main reason for the increase in the amount of their tender. years ago, both the Peninsular and Oriental and Orient Companies- I do not know whether this has been made public;, but it happened so long ago that I think I may state the fact to honourable membersthrough the Secretary of State for the Colonies, expressed their willingness to extend the present contract for two years, on the same terms - In the opinion of the Government, though not in my opinion, it was thought better to have a new contract under different conditions.",49
541,Mr CARPENTER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,That does not touch the question the right honourable member is discussing.,50
542,Sir JOHNFORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"But the fact that the companies were willing to extend the contract on the same terms a couple of years ago, indicates that to a large extent the increased prices may be attributed to the new conditions, among which are the restrictions under section 16 of the Post and Telegraph Act.",50
543,Mr CARPENTER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,The company say,50
544,Sir JOHNFORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"That is so in regard to the Orient Company; but the Peninsular and Oriental Company has refused to tender at all. As I have said, this section will cost us a great deal of money, and that is a consideration we should not altogether disregard. In my opinion,"" the provision will retard our progress, seeing that it will interfere to some extent with our means of communication, and, altogether, the mea.sure, so far from being practical, seems to be very foolish. If we have passed legislation which is found to be adverse to our interests, financially and generally, the onlycourse for us is to repeal' it. The words used in the Act are ""no contract or arrangement shall be made."" I appeal to honourable members who are accustomed toread plain English, to say what the meaning of those words is. The lawyers have been at work in order to find some way out of the difficulty, and their conclusion is that if we send our mails, and pay by poundage, we do not enter into an ""arrangement ""-that it is not an arrangement to send by the pound and pay by the pound. If that be so, it is very fortunate, because otherwise the section would prove much more injurious. To my mind, however, a "" contract or arrangement "" means any contract or arrangement under which we pay for the carrying of our provision is mails; and that I believe would be the definition arrived at by any ordinary man. A couple of Such a construction, however, would never suit us, because it would debar our sending mails by the Peninsular and - Oriental' steamers, and by the steamers running to Japan, China, Singapore, and elsewhere. There would be no communication by post with those places, and we should be in a very difficult position. However, as I say, the legal mind has come to our rescue, and we are told that "" arrangement"" does not include paying for the carriage of our mails by the pound. The Peninsular and Oriental Company, under arrangement with the British Government, will bring the English letters out in ships, probably to some extent manned by coloured crews, and will carry our letters back to Europe, the latter, however, under the poundage system. Under such a method there would be no arrangement as to time-table, as to where the vessel should call, or how quickly they should travel, or where! they would land the mails. We should simply put our mails on board, and allow the companies to carry them over the ocean when and how they liked. Money would be paid out of not. the Treasury for the carriage of the mails in ships manned by coloured crews. If we are to send letters, let us send them in the most expeditious way. To take the step to which it appears we may be forced, appears to be hypocritical, and not honest. If we were to say that we would not use any steamers with coloured crews for the carriage of mails, either under contract or by poundage, we might be acting foolishly, or Quixotically ; but we should, at any rate, be acting like honest people, who were determined to adhere to their principles. The other plan means to deny an arrangement when, in my opinion, we have made an arrangement. wonder we use the tea the. coloured man grows; there is no doubt we pay the coloured man, though we may not do so in the first instance, for all the services he renders. I wonder that, farmers use the sacks, or squatters use the wool bales, which the people of India make, and for which we have to pay with the produce of. the country. In desiring that the British, or,, at any rate, the white race shall, as far as is possible, inhabit Australia, we. are. on safe ground. But when we say that we will not use the coloured man to make particular articles, or to assist in conveying our mails under an arrangement, we are on unsafe ground, and become hypocrites. know why we should tilt at windmills in this way, and act differently from any other communitv in the world. No other country can afford to say that its mails shall not be carried out under a "" contract or arrangement,"" except by a certain class of people. We must remember there is not much difference between the Government paying for the service and a private person paying for it. The. Government, in the first place, get the money from the people, and then pay it, while in the other case, the people, pay for themselves. should we not also say that no ship carrying a coloured crew shall convey our produce and general merchandize? Why should we not prohibit every one from making a contract under which cargo may be carried in ships manned by coloured crews ? Whether the Government or private persons pay, the money has to come out of the soil-Australia has to pay. What we desire is to have our mails carried expeditiously and safely. If we were to say that we would clear the ocean, and the world, of all coloured people, that would be consistent, impracticable.. We remember, that we are not so large in number as are the coloured races, and therefore such an idea is not entertained. We subsidize the Pacific Cable, but I feel sure that .the board hpa good many coloured people in its employment at Fanning Island and other places in the tropics. Similarly we subsidize mail services for the encouragement of trade with places like the New Hebrides and New Guinea, which are inhabited, by people of coloured races. Why is this done? Because we have to do it. It is a matter, not of inclination, but of necessity. . I think that we have acted very foolishly, therefore, in saying that we will not make a "" contract or arrangement"" with the English mail lines which 'employ Sir John Forrest. I coloured crews on their steamers. But although we say that we will not enter into contracts or arrangements with such companies, we have had to twist the Act in order to allow the service of carrying our mails to be performed, and we have, had to decide that, to pay poundage is not an evasion of the law. If we have no contract with the companies, and simply pay so much per lb. for the carriage of our mails backwards and forwards, their vessels will not be compelled to call at Fremantle or at Adelaide; and will probably come on direct to Melbourne and Sydney. That would be a. great injury to WesternAustralia, and to South Australia. I do not Mr CARPENTEE - The present English mail contract binds the vessels of the Peninsular and Oriental Company to call at Fremantle.",50
545,Sir JOHNFORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"So much the better for us. But are they bound to call at Fremantle on their way home? My that point is that we shall be better off if we have definite contracts with the mail companies, stipulating where and when their steamers shall call, than if we have no contract and pay a poundage, which, in my opinion, is an unbusinesslike and foolish Why arrangement.",51
546,Mr CARPENTER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"B y paying a poundage we get the same, service as before, but at a lower rate.",51
547,Sir JOHNFORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"We cannot obtain a regular service unless we have contracts with the companies concerned. Without contracts, their boats will not be bound to call regularly, according to a time-table, and might even be taken off for a week, or two. Of course, if we can getas good a service for less money-by paying poundage than by paying a subsidy, the former though arrangement is the better one; but I do not however, think\ve can. I do not think that the companies will give us as good a service without a contract. If I were a director .of one of these companies, I would take good care that I did not give as much for lower rates as I gave when I was being paid a reasonable sum. It is essential to this country that we should have quick and regular ocean transit for our people, our produce, and our mails, and anything which interferes with that is prejudicial to' our 'interests. The whole thing requires exposure, because at present the public are being deluded into' the belief, that what' is' being done is ' necessary to prevent Australia from ' being' overrun by coloured people.'",51
548,Mr WILKINSON,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,Is there not a patriotic as well as .a commercial aspect ?,52
549,Sir JOHNFORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"We are not the centre of the Empire. We are a handful of people on the outskirts of the Empire, requiring, above all things, speedy and regular transit. Surely the forty or fifty millions of people in the old country can safely be trusted to look after the main interests of the Empire. At the present time we are doing ourselves injury, and gaining no compensating advantage. We are made to appear as out of sympathy with the mother country in her difficulties in dealing with the various problems of the Empire. I am sure that Ave are all glad to help her; but at the present time we are made to look as though we are unmindful of her obligations and her difficulties. we are doing resultedin great material advantage, we might say to the mother country, "" We cannot afford to do otherwise "" ; but at the present time Ave are gaining nothing, and are exhibiting ourselves before the people of the Empire as arrogant, unbusinesslike faddists. MI . FISHER - Is it not a good thing to train up British seamen? "" Sir JOHN FORREST-Yes ; that is a matter which can be Avell left to the mother country, and in which, at any rate, she might lead the way.",52
550,Mr FISHER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"As Ave pay for the carriage of our mails, Ave are surely at liberty to take advantage of the opportunity to enfoice a principle.",52
551,Sir JOHNFORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"But although Ave do not enter into contracts Will the mail companies which employ coloured labour, Ave support them by paying poundage for the carriage of OUT letters, and by employing them for the transport of our wool, wheat, and other produce. I should like to see the matter reconsidered. seems popular noAV-a-days to suggest the submission of questions like these to Royal Commissions, and it would certainly be a reasonable thing to have this question so investigated. The present law has done us a lot of harm. It has cost us a great deal of money, without doing us any good, materially or othenvise. less to think that we can prevent the employment of coloured persons upon the ocean. Would any one suggest that Ave should not export our wool, our meat, our Avheat, or our apples to the mother country in A'essels employing coloured crews?",52
552,Mr FISHER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,No one has proposed it.,52
553,Sir JOHNFORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"Then , is it not foolish to make an exception in connection with the carriage of our mails? Most of us are so afraid of being .'misrepresented in the matter, that we dare not express our real opinions; but I, for my part, am willing to run the risk. I commenced by saying that I am for a "" White Australia,"" and no one can urge that my remarks to-night have been directed against the policy of preserving Australia for a white race, so far as Ave reasonably and properly can. It is legislation like this which makes. people afraid of the Labour Party. I wish noAv to refer to another matter. It has' been said that we, on this side of the 'Chamber, have adopted a certain attitude in regard to honourable members opposite, If what because they are members of the Labour Party, as though the Labour Party was something Will a bad brand on it. At one time the members of. the Labour Party Avere persons engaged in - manuai toil; but its membership has gradually grcwn until now any one can become a member of it. No doubt I could join it tomorrow if I were willing to sign the pledge. No other party offers such prospects of quick politi1 cal advancement. On this side of but the House a member must be in politics a long time, and make himself either very agreeable or very disagreeable, before he can obtain a portfolio. Then his position' will probably be at the tail-end of a Ministry and he will haA'e to Avork up from one office to another until perhaps at last he may become Prime Minister. Seven members of the Labour Party, the other day, however, reached the Treasury bench Will a hop, skip, and a jump, none of Avhom had practically held Ministerial office before. Therefore,, the temptation from a mere selfish point of vieAv AA'ould seem to be to join the Labour Party rather It than to oppose them. I am supporting the present Government, because I believe that they are capable of doing useful and necessary Avork.",52
554,Mr WEBSTER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"The late Government Avere also capable of doing good work, but the right honourable member Would not' let them do it. It is use- Sir JOHN FORREST - The programme and methods of this Government are more in accord with my view than were the programme and methods of the late Government. Some honourable members opposite, having tasted the sweets of office, disliked relinquishing them. By the phrase "" sweets of office"" let me explain that I - do not mean the emoluments of office; but rather the power, authority, and honour which attach to the management of public affairs. Some persons seem to think that there is only one sweet-the pay. That not so. As one who has enjoyed a long term of office, I say that it is the desire to tion Act? exercise control, to satisfy one's ambitions, and to do good for the community the chief incentive to office with good politicians.",52
555,Mr FISHER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,I am sure that the right honourable member never profited by being in office.,53
556,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I sometimes lost money by being in office. But I certainly no ground for complaint, and tried to do my best while there.",53
557,Mr WEBSTER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,Why did the right orable member's party charge the late vernment with wishing for another day's pav?,53
558,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I did not make any such statement, and I regret it if made. The honourable member, when tryprevent ing to prevent the defeat of the Watson cause for complaint. Government, urged that they had clone work, and that there was no fault found with their Administration. Do these arguments apply now?",53
559,Mr WEBSTER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,I asked for fair play.,53
560,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I , too, ask for purposes. fair play on behalf of the Reid-MCLean Administration. It is composed of experiwhich enced men, who are capable of doing good work. It is impossible for any Ministry to do very much in a short space of time. When Ministers take office, their first is to obtain a grasp of the questions which are awaiting their attention. The indivito dual who, upon taking charge of a Departwho ment, immediately rushes matters, after fashion of a bull at a gate, will not be likely to be successful. I do not blame the Government for not having accomplished much, because they had not the opportunity to do so. They had to attend to their liamentary duties, and consequentlv had Corio. very little chance to do anything of great importance. The same remark is appliclegal able to the present Administration.

Yet they were willing to forget that, and simply because they had given a pledge in regard to another matter not nearly so important, perty and which will prove to be unconstitutional, they deserted their leader and protection, and allied themselves with the enemies the Government.

Personally, T feel convinced that if the Government is given a fair trial they will be able to do those things which will be found to be in the interests of Federation, and calculated to cement the various States more closelv together. I believe, too, that they will bring forward measures which will be of permanent advantage to the people of Australia.",55
589,Mr SPENCE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE," I am sure that the members of the Labour Party have listened with a great deal of interest to the right honourable member for Swan. I have no doubt that they will take into their careful consideration the hints which he has given them, so that they may be able to make their organization so perfect that the right honourable gentleman will himself be prepared to join it. Judging by his address I can see that he is uncomfortable in his present company, and already feels that the Labour Party is the party he ought to join. He has told us of a number of democratic measures which he has passed in the great State of the west, and I always like to give the right honourable gentleman credit for what he has done. If the measures he has carried are not as perfect as they might be, he shouild not be censured or blamed fOT that. I am very hopeful that he will shortly see his way to join the Labour Part)'. He has been studying the pledge and rules of the party, and all we ask of honourable members generally is that they should study them a little.more. We have been glad to hear that some of them have commenced to read the Tocsin and the Worker. I suppose that until quite recently they knew nothing of those intelligently-conducted literary organs. Their education, political and social, has in consequence been very much neglected. Now that they have started to read that literature, they have no doubt learnt a great many things they were not aware of previously, and a continuance of the study will dissipate some of the foolish notions and prejudices that are, at all times, associated! with a lack of knowledge. The speech of the right honourable member for Swan was the usual straightforward, manly, breezy utterance which we all admire. There was some evidence in it of the influence of his present environment, because there was a good deal of "" yes-no ' about it. In criticising our J methods, the right honourable gentleman found fauk with them as being too stringent, and expressed the opinion that they would break down. He does not believe in the Labour Party, and he hopes that its organization will break down. We were not aware that the right honourable gentleman was a prophet, but he said tonight that he was going to prophesy, and he did prophesy that the organization of the Labour Party would break down inevitably. If that be so, the danger he fears from the return of the party to power is non-existent. Why, therefore, should the right honourable gentleman be alarmed about, the advance of the labour movement ? Why should there be a gathering together of organizations outside, and a great fight put up, if within the Labour Party itself there, is such a condition of, affairs existing that it must break down of its own weight, owing to lack of efficiency ? From the attention which he gave to the subject, I think that the right honourable gentleman realizes, on the contrary, that there is a very great probability of labour politics and the Labour Party very shortly dominating Federal and State politics together. The methods which they have adopted, and which they understand,, and. which, the right: honourable man, and those whospeak in opposition to them do not yet understand, have hitherto proved successful. I do not quarrel' with the right honourable gentleman's criticism, or with the statement he makes with regard to the changed conditions which the control of parliamentary affairs brings with it. It is self-evident that some changes will be made in the methods of working in the L a bour Party, and labour organizations. I have said that there seemed to be a good deal of "" yes-no "" about the right honourable gentleman's address. He found fault with the constitutional position. He said that a Government ought to be able to give the representatives of the Sovereign an assurance that they had a working majority. It was interjected that the Government of which the right honourable gentleman was a member had no such majority. He replied by saying, "" But we were there, and remained there until we were shifted,"" as if that was a reply. If a Government is constitutionally bound to have a working majority, and otherwise should not continue to hold office, the right honourable gentleman stands selfcondemned, because he was a member of a Government that continued to hold office without a majority. He said, in reply to an interjection, that the Government of which he was a member were there, and remained there until they were shifted, but that might be said of any Government, and was no answer. Then the right honourable gentleman admitted that it was the support of the - Labour Party which, because of its policy, gave the. Government of which he was a member, a working majority. That statement was quite correct, and exactly described the- 'position. I shall not dwell upon the changeof Government; we' have heard of it sufficiently often to be familiar, with the-f acts.. But. there was an assumption 8f> 7 on. the part of the right honourable member for Swan that the Watson Government did not have a majority. Honourable members need only look at the division list on the question on which they took office, to see that they had every reasonable assurance from the division and from the speeches of honourable members who took part in it, that they had a very substantial majority - a much bigger majority than the present Government secured by a catch vote. The honourable member for Bland, therefore, had ample authority for assuring the representative of the Sovereign, that he had a working, majority.. It was only when the measure on which the division gentletook place came to be submitted to the House, in Committee that the steady pressure of the conservative elements outside and inside this House whittled away the majority. It was then fourid that our party had been deceived. Those, who professed to be in. favour of the Arbitration Bill , failed to carry out their pledges and promises, when an opportunity was given them to place the measure, on the statute book. They doas all conservatives do when they do not desire that it should appear to the people that they are opposed to a measure-the y give something which is ineffective and worse than useless. In this case certain honourable members adopted that policy exactly. Speaking of the constitutional aspect, the Watson Goveihment was really the only constitutional Government that this Federal Parliament has vet had.. It has yet. to be decided whether the present Government have a majority. . The right honourable member for Swan asserted that the Watson Government had not a majority, but we all know quite well that if the present Prime Minister considered that there was a majority against the Watson Government he would at once have moved the motion of censure, which he contented himself with talking about every day, in order to keep interest in the matter alive, and to find an excuse for asking honourable members to come with him. As leader of the Opposition the present. Prime Minister gave the Governor General his personal assurance that he had a working majority, but we know that the very moment this eager office-seeker got his opportunity he would take it. If he. had had a majority behind him he would have taken advantage of the opportunity before he did.",55
590,Mr WILSON,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"-Are there' noeager officeseekers'on the honourable member's side - - Mr SPENCE - Not that I am aware of. I do not know of one office-seeker on this side of the House. Let me say here that a most unfair remark was made to-night insinuating that one member of the alliance on this side is there for self-seeking reasons. There is absolutely no foundation for that statement. There has been no indication of anything of the kind. The right honourable member for Swan has put this matter very fairly. He does not tell honourable members that it would be unreasonable for any of them to desire to acquire office. There can be no blame attaching to any one who secures office fairly. But when office is secured unfairly and by peculiar tactics, as it has been secured by the head of the present Government, the action taken is open to criticism. A good deal has been said about our methods and the labour pledges. I do not propose to deal extensively with those matters tonight. A short time ago I delivered a speech in which I made some very emphatic statements of my views regarding the Ministerial programme, and the reasons why, in my opinion, the present Government should be put out. I do not propose to repeat those statements. I ask the House to take them as read, and to assume that I still stand by them, only more so. Some reference, however, may be made to the way in which the Labour Party is pledged, as the matter is always being brought up. I remind honourable members that any man who desires to join the Conservative Party in England, must sign the platform of that party. A party pledge is, therefore, no new thing, and there is nothing uncommon and nothing wrong about it. The pledge of the Labour Party is complained of because our platform is so good and our aims so high and noble that the only objections which can be brought forward are in respect of little matters which will not bear consideration. I cannot refrain from saying a word or two in reply to the criticism of the alliance by the right honourable member for Swan. The alliance is a perfectly natural and fair one. When the Watson Government took office, certain honourable members who do not belong to the Labour Party, but hold liberal and democratic views, and have no other object to serve than that of securing the passing of good measures, openly announced, without any request from the Ministry, that they intended to support it. There was no scheming on the part of the Government to secure) that support. During the course of this debate, not many honourable members have spoken, but the insinuation has been made more than once that there is a secret understanding among members of the alliance. These insinuations sugge'st that honourable members opposite are familiar with such practices, but the Opposition do not know of anything of the kind.",56
591,Mr WILKS,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,If the Opposition did they would not mention it.,57
592,Mr SPENCE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"The basis of our alliance was put in black and white; but we cannot obtain any information as to the terms of the coalition. As soon as the Watson Government took office, they openly declared the relations between the Labour Party and those members of the Liberal Party who were supporting them, and, as the basis of the alliance, we have simply' placed in black and white the agreement which was then publicly announced. The suggestion that there is some secret understanding between us, comes only from men who are naturally suspicious. We have sufficient common-sense . to know that the alliance could not succeed by crooked methods. It must succeed on its merits, or it will fail. If the Labour Party had been so foolish as to adopt the tactics attributed to us by our opponents, we should not have made that progress which has characterized the labour movement. Everyday we are gaining ground. The right honourable member for Swan has twitted honourable members of the Liberal Party with having deserted their leader, and while I know that they are well able to take care of themselves, I feel disposed, as one of those associated with them, to reply to his taunts. The right honourable member spoke of the lack of loyalty shown by these honourable members to their former leader. I confess that I have an admiration for loyalty, but it is not so much a question of loyalty to a leader as it is loyalty to the principles which bind a party. Nothing 'can be said against the man who stands by his principles. The right honourable member for Swan has charged honourable members of the Opposition corner with deserting their leader. What is his position? Who is his leader? Has he not deserted his true leader, the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, T5y placing himself under the leadership of the Prime Minister ? If he has not accepted the Prime Minister as his leader, what is his position? I' think that we are justified in asking for further information as to whether there is any arrarigement between the two parties now supporting the Government.",57
593,Mr KENNEDY,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,No arrangement ,58
594,Mr SPENCE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"So far we have not learned Of any. The Government whipthe honourable member for Dalley-ha s said that the Prime Minister is the "" star performer ' ' of the company Opposite, and I would add that the organizer is the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, who brought about the present situation. The company has . submitted such a poor programme that it will not have any attraction for the public. I feel satisfied that the people will demand something much better. The performers may be every good, and I am willing to admit that the company boasts of a star performer, but we wish to learn from the organizer himself what relation he, and those who speak of him constantly as their leader, bear to the rest of the company. We desire to know what he has secured for them by bringing about the peculiar comis bination which confronts us. Mr KENNEDY . , - He has not handcuffed us, and handed us over to another leader.",58
595,Mr SPENCE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"He has ceased to lead his old followers, and has made them bers of a scratch team.

I am. prepared back the solid team on this side against scratch team that has been raked up on the the coalition. Government, side. The members of that team cannot play together, and never will. Mr WILSON , - H as the honourable member ever attended our weekly caucus?",58
596,Mr SPENCE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"It is useless for the orable member to talk about caucus meetparty. ings, in view of the fact that members of the utterances. old Deakin party have been charging each other with disloyalty to the decision of their caucus. When proposals were made some time ago for a coalition.of the followers of the honourable and learned member for Balfore, larat. and those of the right honourable member for East Sydney, the proposed agreebour. ment was submitted to the caucus of the Liberal Party, but was rejected, the memvative bers of that party declining to support coalition of which the honoiable and learned member for Ballarat was not the leader. We wish to know what honourable members declare opposite have now to say in regard to that decision. A charge of disloyalty comes with a very ill-grace from an honourable member who has not respected the decision of the caucus, . ,",58
597,Mr KENNEDY,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,To whom does the honoiable member refer?,58
598,Mr SPENCE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"To the right honourable member for Swan. It seems to me that those honourable members of the Liberal Party, who are now in alliance with us, are the only ones who have been loyal to the decision to which I have referred. There is an ominous silence on the part of the Ministry - We have heard from the star performer, and it is time that we had a speech from one of the stars of lesser magnitude. I am inclined to think that, as the result of the exposure of their manifold political sins, the Government feel their position so keenly that they are about to tender their resignation, and therefoie do not think it worthwhile to put up a fight. Perhaps they propose to resign without going to a division on this motion.",58

The masses are the best judges, arid they have declared against the conservatives, who put forward that cry,, by returning special representatives, so to speak, to do that which men who professed to be their friends failed to do. Honourable members on this side of the House were returned tq Parliament, because those who professed tq be the friends of labour had neglected its interests.",59

Mr Mauger - Where are the members of the Ministry ? - Mr SPENCE - Perhaps they are holding a Cabinet meeting, to consider whether they should not recognise the. situation, and gracefully retire. Mr KENNEDY. - Who m should we put in their places?",59
614,Mr SPENCE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"There would be no' difficultv in.filling their places by men ""who would do' the work of the country much better than they are likely to da When the honourable member for Parramatta-wh o has a. faculty for interjecting, and drawing, speakers away from the thread of their discourse-interrupte d me,, I was about to point out that some of the secrets of the coalition would yet leak'out. Perhaps, after all, I am mistaken in supposing that the Cabinet are considering the wisdom of retiring - It maybe'that the leader of'the Government has imposed silence on his colleagues, lest they should, tell too much. One or two secrets have already been disclosed.. We have learned something about the way in which nominations are made by the Conservative Party; we have learned that it indulges in practices for which the Labour Party has been denounced. We have heard something about the Sydney Morning Herald fixing up the free trade bunch. We have also heard that in Western Australia the light honourable member for Swan, together with a newspaper editor, fixed up a bunch for election purposes. The lack of wisdom of those who fixed up those bundles was shown by the fact that the persons selected did not stand true to their parties. The right honourable member for Swan is evidently not a good hand at choosing candidates. I interjected while he was speaking that those he selected did not stand true, and the right honourable member admitted that he could not keep them true. We have only to look at the present situation in this Parliament, in regard to the 'Free trade Party, to see that their method of selection does not keep honourable members opposite to their pledges. Many of them, it is true, tried to be loyal, but when they could not get enough of their own way they gave, up the fight. That is not the way to win - The way to win in politics is to keep on fighting. If we on this side of the House are beaten in connection with our social reform and trade union movements we come again. We adopt some other tactics,, and keep on fighting. The right honourable gentlemanat the head of the Government has never tested the question of free-trade in this House. He does not even know the fiscal opinions of a number of the Queensland members.",59
615,Mr WILKS,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,He does not know the honourable member's opinions.,59
616,Mr SPENCE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"If the right honourable gentleman had any faith in his own views he would certainly have taken an opportunity to test the question. The method of selection by - newspaper proprietors, or by a great leader like the right honourable member for Swan, has been proved to be a failure. If honourable members opposite wish for the success of their; principles, they had better copy the methods of the only successful part)'-the Labour Party.' Instead of doing that, they twit us with not knowing how to manage our own business.. It seems r to me that the evidence is all the other way. I say emphatically that we ought to hear from the Government something more about their policy. The discussion hitherto centred around the policy of the present position. If my theory be correct, the Government intend to resign, or they know that if they go to the country, they will return as a Government. the tactics adopted by honourable members opposite are intended to save time, and that they think it expedient to discuss the policy of the party that will be in power after appeal to the country. If that be it is just as well that we should understand it ; and we can regard the present debate as a discussion of the policy of the incoming to be replied to. Government, rather than as a criticism of lack of policy of the present Government. We cannot, of course, discuss something which is non-existent. 'It would hardly interesting enough to discuss nothing. As this matter. the Government have no policy except to information. get into recesSj they cannot give us the slightest indication of what they propose to do. When they get into recess, will evolve a policy which they will be able to present to Parliament when we meet again. That in itself is enough to condemn them. It is only a fair thing that example set by the Watson Government to be regarded merely as postscripts. have upon its programme something more than is sufficient for one session,should be listen to the representations followed by the present Government. But two they criticise that as a foolish course to mind pursue. They have such a peculiar bination behind them that they find it possible to evolve a policy.

That is a question that ought If any member of the the Government has the courage to speak, or if their master, the honourable and learned member for-Ballarat intends to speak, we. be ought to have an explanation in regard to It is not fair to deny us",60
623,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,H as the honourable member read what the Premier of New they South Wales said on the subject?,60
624,Mr SPENCE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"He is only one. There are six States in this Federation, although the present Government appears to the recognise only two. The others appear to The policy of the Government seems to be to of the larger States, and not to the others. The right honcomorable member for' Swan has criticised a importion of the White Australia policy, as laid down by the first Parliament of the is Commonwealth-upo n which I need hardly say that I hold strong opinions-and has the asked that it should be altered. But the Prime Minister appears to be afraid to deal the contract section of the Post and He Telegraph Act, because some of the supthe porters of the coalition would decline to was assist him in that direction. That seems to indicate that there is a kind of understanding on that matter. If there is such an understanding, we ought to know it. Whilst I am a member of a party that has always been prepared to support any Government that gave us the measures.which we desired, at the same time we intend to maintain has what we have secured. We are naturally suspicious of those who are declared opponents of those measures that we believe in, and who, at the same time, refuse to give us questhe measures for which we ask-such , for instance, as the Conciliation arid ArbitraiEey intion Bill , in an effective form.",60
625,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,The section to which the honourable member has referred has nothing to do with the White Australia policy.,60
626,Mr SPENCE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"The right honourable member at the head of the Government previously said that he would alter that section; but he,cannot alter it because of the coalition. The right honourable member for Swan is a part of that coalition.",61
627,Sir JOHN FORREST,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,I will vote for doing away with that section if I have the chance.,61
628,Mr SPENCE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I believe? that the right honourable member will. But we want to know whether his leader has pledged him, amongst others, to support the maintenance of that section. The supporters of the Government appear to lack any cohesion of any kind, and to be without any sort of policy. How can a Government be sure of a majority when its supporters have no bond to hold them together? The subject of old-age pensions has been dealt with by other speakers. The Government have no definite policy on that question. I remember an occasion when the right honourable gentleman at the head of the Government, speaking in the Sydney Town Hall, said that any Treasurer would be foolish- I forget his exact words-if he raised all the money required by the Commonwealth from Customs. He said that the Treasurer could raise a portion of the revenue by the direct taxation of land values. When the Barton Government introduced its programme, which contained a proposal for old-age pensions, we heard the right honourable gentleman stating that that proposal was simply a sham, which could not be carried out. But it is now to be found in his own programme. Does he still hold the same view as he held when he - said that it was impossible to carry it out?",61
629,Mr WILKS,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,He is going to try to carry it out by an arrangement with the States.,61
630,Mr SPENCE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"Yes , he is going to consult with the States. But suppose that the States will not do anything?",61
631,Mr WILKS,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,Then he can do nothing; he admits that.,61
632,Mr SPENCE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"The Government whip, who I presume! is the mouthpiece of the Ministry, and appears to be the only one who knows anything about their policy, tells us that if the States decline to agree as to the matter of old-age pensions, the Government will not do anything. If they decline to do anything in relation to the High Commissionership, the Government will do nothing. Those unfortunate pioneers of Australia, whose hardihood and whose grand work the Prime Minister and his followers praise so highly who have .been enterprising enough to live in more .than one State, may continue to starve, simply because we have not a Government with the necessary courage, ability, and energy, to pass the necessary legislation. Why did we have Federation? Are Ave to be governed by the States - to have a reversal of the Constitution? The Government, as I have said, is Aveak in every quarter-Avea k in its follOAving, and Aveak in its alleged policy.",61
633,Mr WILKS,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"During the four years of the CommonAvealth, this is the first time the Labour Party have spoken of this question, and for three years, they supported a Government Avho did not intend to do any1 think in the matter.",61
634,Mr SPENCE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"The honourable member, Avho is the Government whip, knows that Parliament has Avorked very hard since the inauguration of the Commonwealth. It Avas necessary to pass many machinery Acts, and, surely to goodness, the sessions were long enough. The programme of the Barton Government Avas too comprehensive for any one Parliament; and it is unfair to tAvit us with supporting a Government, Avho Avere eleven months dealing with the Tariff alone. The present Prime Minister said that it was simply a sham, and a humbug, for the Barton Government to place old-age pensions 1 on their programme, because legislation in that direction could not be carried into effect, until the expiration of the book-keeping period. Now, however, the Prime Minister places old-age pensions in his own programme, and Ave learn for the first time that its introduction depends on the consent of the States. But the States are self-governed, and have the poAver to fclloAv the example of the tAvo States in which old age pensions are established. It is a fair argument that, if Ave do not find the States moving in this direction noAV, they are not likely to co-operate Will the Commonwealth. The Aveak policy of the Ministry is not the .kind of policy Ave ought to expect from gentlemen Avho talk so glibly about responsible government.",61
635,Mr WILKS,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"There is a Labour GoA'ernment in Queensland, and there are no old age pensions in that State.",61
636,Mr SPENCE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"The Labour Government in Queensland are prepared to establish old-age pensions promptly, and they have the necessary knowledge and ability to carry out such legislation. The present CommonAvealth Government kneAV that they could not establish old-age pensions when they put the proposal before us, and the Prime Minister is guilty of the same sham and humbug with which he charged the Barton Government. Although arbitration admittedly affects only a limited number of industries at present, no one can foresee how many may eventually come under the Federal Act; and any legislation is desirable which will prevent strikes, with their disturbance of industrial life, and conditions. The fact that we cannot at present say how many industries may be affected, makes it all the more imperative that the measure should be an efficient and workable one. This Bill has wrecked Government after Government; and we now have a Government in power, who, if they have a chance, will impose on the people of Australia, a measure which will be productive of much evil, suffering, and injusticewhich will make the conditions of industry worse than they would be without a measure of the kind. I make that remarkadvisedly, and am convinced of its truth. One particular clause will, in my opinion, not only do a great injustice to unions, but will prevent many registering under the Bill.",61
637,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"When the honourable member says that, does he mean that unions will be prevented from registering, by reason of the difference between the two amendments ?",62
638,Mr SPENCE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"Yes ; I know that, because of the clause which has been adopted,' unions which were waiting for the Bill will not register.",62
639,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"They may not gister, but it will not be because of the difference between the two amendments.",62
640,Mr SPENCE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"The Watson Government when in charge of this measure in Committee, were in many instances forced, by the influence of those now on the Treasury bench, to accept certain amendments which rendered the Bill less efficient, and were not in the interest of those concerned. The clause on which the late Government were defeated, was not the only one to which, we objected, and it was not fair to twit the members of that Government, because they had to accept some amendments in which they did not fully believe. It was the duty of the Government to pass as good a measure as possible; and it was only when an amendment was reached, which rendered the measure unworkable, that the Government took their final stand."" One point is overlooked by those who have had no experience of the trade union movement, and who, like the Minister of Defence and his colleagues, regard that movement from a theoretical point of view. Because certain things are possible under the measure, they suppose that those things are going to be done. We who are connected with trade unions, have practical experience of men as they are, and with us it is not a question of what men of adifferent stamp might do, but what the men whom we know are likely to do. The great difference between the two amendments is particularly felt in the union of which I have been president for eighteen years, and about which I claim to know more than any other honourable member in the House. It would be impossible for that union to prove to a 1 Judge that a majority of those affected were in favour of preference being given. The members of. the union are not working in the industry except at a certain period of the year, and no living soul could say where the members were, or who were affected by the award, and there is no machinery to secure the opinion of those affected. We could not give any evidence that would be accepted, and any lawyer, or even a layman, could break us down and prevent our getting an award which would give a preference. In some other industries, I admit that the whole position would be different; but we are legislating for specific industries. The organization to which I refer is the largest in Australia, and is connected with the greatest industry and biggest export trade of the Commonwealth. The union has had a long re- existence, and the opinions of its representatives ought to have some weight. Let us suppose, for a moment, that a matter involving only legal questions was before the House, and let us further suppose a most unlikely thing, namely, that all the lawyers in the House were unanimous. What wouldthose lawyers say if a layman like myself were to deny the correctness of their assumptions and opinions? Such a denial would not have any weight. Those who have had experience of the trade union movement are, by reason of their practical knowledge, unanimously of opinion that the measure, as passed by this House, is unworkable, and I can only interpret our being ignored as showing a desire to make the Bill ineffective. I speak authoritatively on this matter, after consultation with those controlling the affairs of the union of which I am president, and I may say that I used no influence whatever in order to secure the opinion I express, namely, that the union will not register, and. thus will be shut from any benefits under the measure. may be asked why the union should not gister and get an award. The answer that an award, would be useless unless Judge had power to protect, the interests the organization. The measure will be abinterests of the non-unionists. solutely inoperative unless it recognises encourages the maintenance, of all such orwith ganizations. In the New Zealand Bill, when originally introduced, the preamble spoke the encouragement of industrial unions, measure being based on a desire to encourwithin age the formation and registration of nizations, so that they might be used as'mathe chinery to bring about industrial peace. this House the conservative element, with its influence operating on others who have ditions for them. practically no knowledge, has reversed the. position altogether. Each clause which cognised unions was attacked the moment came before us,, and we had proposals compulsory organizations, proposals which were intended to strike a blow at existing institutions, and render the measure nugacould tory. No one can say that I did not do my discharged for that reason. best each time to resist those attacks; though we were forced to accept some amendments, that is not a fact on which ought to be taunted, because our acceptance for the dismissal of unionists. does not mean approval. For myself should not have accepted the amendments which the late Prime Minister consented make in the Bill, but would have kept debate going single-handed until all were - Union. tired out before I gave way. The remarks I have made apply to other organizations, but particularly to the organization which I am connected. In industries where the men are constantly at work, it would easy to ascertain the views of concerned, but in. an industry where we do not have the same men working year by ployer year, it would be impossible to prove to any Judge the consent of the majority of those affected. In my opinion, the Arbitration .Bill has been deliberately destroyed.. was very plainly to be seen what influence was brought to bear on honourable members towards that end. That influence counts same tone. in the present movement, and. will, count the coming election if we have the luck of dissolution - I mean that anti-labour influlabour member. 1 ence, which is called anti-socialistic. Unless the Arbitration Bill is improved-as must be, or I hope it will not become lawit will introduce tyranny, and take us back to a period from which we thought we had escaped. The measure as it stands would inflict a great deal of misery, and.

The writer of those directly the article saysWe now advise a course which may seem drastic, but which alone can be effectual. No emshouild give employment to a member of the Australian Workers' Union.

Then follows a good deal more in the That was written just after in the recent New South Wales elections, bea. cause the electors insisted on returning a",63
642,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,Surely no one takes it any notice of such statements !,63
643,Mr SPENCE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"They are taken notice of, and the honourable member knows it. I think that he must have forgotten a great deal of his trade union experience, because these practices are not confined to any one class of industry. While I do not rank all employers alike, I know that the organizato tion to which this newspaper appeals-th Pastoralists' Union-practice s a systematic boycott. There have been produced in this Chamber the official papers of the Queensadministered. land branch of that Union,' and we have in our possession other similar documents. haw seen its official circulars, and the into structions to its agents, and I know that a boycott is worked by means of a system of registration, which is made compulsory upon its members, with a view to weeding out union men. MT. JOSEPH COOK - Does that member . believe that any member of this House is in'sympathy with that sort of thing ?",63
644,Mr SPENCE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"What is the use of symuse pathy, if honourable 'members do not give effect to it in an Act of Parliament? is the use of the honourable member talking of sympathy with labour, when he prevents the passing of labour laws ?",64
645,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,The honourable memcants ber is talking humbug now.,64
646,Mr SPENCE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,I am stating an absoaccepting lute fact.,64
647,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I did not dispute the honourable member's statement'of fact, but I complained of his unfair criticism.",64
648,Mr SPENCE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,I do not think that the honourable member understands the difference between a fact and an insinuation. The organization to which this newspaper appeals carries on a systematic boycott. Probably the majority of its members decline to put it into force; but those who choose to do so use the machinery that is provided.,64
649,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,And the honourable member wished to insinuate that I am in sympathy with that sort of thing.,64
650,Mr SPENCE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"If the honourable member is not in sympathy with it, he should show that he is hot. I charge the honourable member with not doing so, and with voting in such a way that the workers cannot obtain a law which is necessary for their protection.",64
651,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,What the honourable member says is pure nonsense. I am amazed at his unfairness.,64
652,Mr SPENCE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I am not generally charged with being unfair. The honourable member and others voted for an amendment which will prevent the labour organizations from securing protection against unfair dealing and injustice. That is undeniable. Boycotting is no new method. It has been worked before by men of strong prejudices. All that we asked was that the Court should have power to grant preferences if it chose do so. The phrase "" preference to unione : ists "" is really a misnomer. What is desired is protection to unionists, and protection to the Act, so that it may be' effectively",64
653,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"The honourable memI ber's leader said that it was not intended give this preference, except to majorities;",64
654,Mr SPENCE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"The honourable member is slow to admit that he is in a false posir tion. It was not a question of there being - a majority, but of proving the existence of a majority. I have already explained that:; it is not my fault if the honourable member cannot understand plain English."" In addition to the boyoott, which the employers may if they choose, .and some of them do use it, there are other ways in which they can What weaken the labour unions. It is a very - common thing in America, and I can quote instances of it here, to make it a condition - of obtaining employment that the 'applishall not join a trade union. A elause in the agreement of the South Australian Register office, for 1888, with compositors a thirty-six months' engagement, was thisThe employee shall not during the 'service aforesaid be or become a member of the'South Australian Typographical Society, or any of a similar nature, or having similar objects. If employers choose to insist upon such conditions, how can we prevent it, unless power is given to the Court to give preference to unionists-that is, to-see that the unionists get fair play? I need not dwell on this matter, because I have spoken upon it before, and I know that it is hopeless to convert honourable members opposite by force of logic.",64
655,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,The honourable member's statements are too unfair to convert any one.,64
656,Mr SPENCE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"The position I am taking is, that the attitude of the Government in regard to the Arbitration Bill is sufficient to condemn them, apart' from their want of a policy, and the other charges brought against them. Although honourable members opposite have pretended to desire the passing of a measure which will secure industrial peace, they voted for an amendment which defeats its object, merely to displace the then existing Government, and to obtain office themselves.",64
657,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"The honourable mem. ber is in favour of the Bill as it stands, with the exception of the provision in dispute.",64
658,Mr SPENCE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"No j I am not. There are other provisions to which I object. The late Government had forced upon it provisions which make some of the clauses of the Bill imperfect, and which I should have accepted. Honourable members know that when a Bill is. in Committee, those charge of it are sometimes forced to accept amendments in which they do not believe. The Watson Administration are not responthroughout sible for such amendments. member for Macquarie is one of those who sought every occasion to turn that Governber ment out of office. I should have to find with the present Administration, if its leader had defeated the Watson Governfor ment by a straight-out fight, on a motion censure... If he had done so, the present discussion would have been saved. however, took advantage of a difficulty connection with a most important measure, which affects the well-being and the living of thousands of men and women, who have little enough to live on, and who have been so hopelessly mixed. waiting for a long time for a Bill which allow of the peaceful settlement of indusa pure myth. trial disputes by a Justice of High Court, in order to defeat Watson Government. It is our daitv to ascertain whether the vote by which he came into power was not a catch vote. If it was given deliberately, order 'to displace the then Government, that fact will be seen when a division taken on the motion now before the House. Upon a previous occasion I pointed out that the declared attitude of the present Government and their followers is socialistic. The extraordinary feature of the position is that whilst they profess be strong opponents of Socialism, the only tion ? definitions which they offer of thai term refer to reforms, such as the establishment of a co-operative Commonwealth, may possibly be accomplished in the far distant future.' The Government and their supporters do not attack anything which the Labour Party has done, or proposes do now, but they condemn something which, statements. according to their own wild imaginings, may occur a hundred years hence. Constisocialistic tutional government, as I understand term, means that at certain fixed periods the people are called upon to choose their Parliament. We have a democratic of government-in other words, Demos being rules. The people elect their members Parliament upon certain definite issues, send them here to give effect to their manjects. date. ' Consequently, .the business of liament is really controlled by the erectors. For the Government to attack conditions which they say somebody is anxious to Mr Sfence. establish in the misty future, but which may not never be established, seems to me a most extraordinary position to take up. They in say that they intend to combat Socialism, and yet the very organizations to which they are appealing to fight their battle Australia are themselves of a The honourable socialistic character.",64
659,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"The honourable memhas raised a nice little bogey, and now no fault he should knock it down.",65
660,Mr SPENCE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"The honourable member Parramatta is chasing a mere shadow. of The statement has been made that the Labour Party intend to rob everybody. He, Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Who said that? I in am amazed at the honourable member's unfairness. He is absolutely reckless. M i . SPENCE - If the'honourable member would remain silent he would not get The Socialism of will which we have heard in this Chamber is The honourable and learned the member for Wannon has declared that the the Labour Party wish to rob the farmerto confiscate his stock, and land, and, indeed, all his worldly possessions. I have no desire to misiepresent the honourable in member for Parramatta.",65
661,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,The honourable memis ber is misrepresenting me all the time.,65
662,Mr SPENCE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I repeat that Socialism, as defined by the honourable and learned member for Wannon, means the confiscaantition of all the farmer's property.",65
663,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,Will the honourable to member permit me to ask him one ques,65
664,Mr SPEAKER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,The honourable member cannot ask a question at this stage. which Mr SPENCE - I recognise that the honourable member must be uncomfortable.,65
665,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,I assure the honourable member that I am uncomfortable to. only when I hear him make such unfair,65
666,Mr SPENCE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"The so-called antimovement outside is merely an. the attempt to defeat the Labour Party by branding its members as Socialists. The Federated Employers' Union, the Property form Defence League and other bodies are associated for that purpose, of and the Prime Minister has declared and himself in sympathy with their obThat fact connects every supParporter of the Government with the movement in question. But I would point out that one of the meetings, which was held at' Geelong, concluded by asking the Government for a grant of ,£1,000 to enable the producers to buy compressed fodder and to find a market for their produce. These are the people who denounce Socialism. A similar gathering, which was held at Hay, wound up by adopting resolutions urging the Government to pass anIrrigation Bill. At Adelaide, too, a meeting was recently held to form an organization to combat Socialism. Every other consideration is to be sunk in order to defeat the Labour Party. The extraordinary feature is that those who most violently denounce Socialism themselves practise it. In New South Wales, the followers of the Government, led by Mr Carruthers, have asked for nearly £8,000,000 from the Public Works Department and, strange to say, the gentleman who requested the biggest sum, namely, jQi,700,000, was the honourable member for New England who is a strong individualist. He desired that a railway should be constructed from Guyra to Grafton. As the brunt of the attack upon the Government has hitherto fallen upon the Prime Minister, I think it is about time that a little Victorian history was introduced into the debate. In this connection, it is very singular that the Minister of Trade and Customs-wh o is ""equal in all things"" with the Prime Minister-was , when Premier of Victoria, a most astounding Socialist. In his address at Bairnsdale he submitted a very socialistic programme. He proposed to find money for housing the industrial classes, and advocated the granting of loans to the extent of 60 per cent, upon the value of the securities offered, at 6 per cent, inteiest, with a fifteen years' currency. He also proposed to establish old-age pensions, and a system of State-aided insurance. He wished to go one better than the Labour Party. He further advocated technical education for all branches of industry. Does he still believe in those principles? He favoured the establishment of dairy farms, at which instruction could be imparted in the best methods of making butter. He also promised to provide the people with inferior land at 5s. per acre, and proposed to compulsorily resume it. He assured his hearers that he had resumed 90 acres within a two-penny tram section, and established a settlement.",65
667,Mr MCLEAN,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,And a very good settlement it is.,66
668,Mr SPENCE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"This is the programme that we are advocating, and yet the honourable gentleman has now decided that his special mission in life is to keep the Labour Party out of power, in order to prevent these good things being brought about. If not,, why did honourable members opposite put us out of power ?",66
669,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,Why does the honourable member wish to put the honourable member for Gippsland out of power when he is so pronounced a Socialist?,66
670,Mr BAMFORD,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,Because the honourable gentleman does not propose to do those things now.,66
671,Mr SPENCE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I like something approaching decency and honesty in politics, and not sham, humbug, and hypocrisy. I object to men speaking in one way and acting in another. I object to their saying that these things are not socialistic, while some proposal which may never be introduced is Socialism. The co-operative Commonwealth and such things are not before us now, but the other measures to which I have referred are before us, and they are distinctly socialistic. The Minister of Trade and Customs nowhas as his colleague the "" star "" of the company opposite, whose anti-socialistic proclivities lead him to support private enterprise pure and simple. But I have not yet exhausted the honourable gentleman's programme He was also prepared to support grain elevators for loading the farmers' grain, and water conservation for their benefit. All these excellent ideas are distinctly socialistic. I wish to know, and I think we are entitled to know, where honourable gentlemen opposite draw the line. The right honourable member for Swan has carried out an excellent socialistic scheme in Western Australia. It was a very big project indeed, and the right honourable gentleman deserves very great credit for having the courage .to enter upon it. But he says that that is not Socialism. It is time these honourable gentlemen had some teaching to enable them to know what Socialism is, and what it is not. We say that where the general community takes up an enterprise, or in a certain degree gives assistance to an enterprise, that is State Socialism. It may be limited according to circumstances, but it is all a form of State Socialism. The Minister of Trade and Customs was consistent with his advocacy of Socialism when he went in for protection, because the object of protection is to enable people to carry on industries here by giving them the assistance of protective duties. That is distinctly socialistic.",66
672,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"Is the honourable member a protectionist or a free-trader? We are coming to it now. Mr SPENiCE,-The honourable member - for Parramatta need not bother himself about that. . I hope I am something better than either. I do not find any reference to t'he matter in the speech to which I have referred, but I have been told that the present Minister of Trade and Customs, although a federalist now, was in the past somewhat opposed to Federation, on the ground that it would probably do away with the Victorian Stock Tax. The honourable gentleman, it appears, would rather sacrifice Federation than d[o away with the Stock Tax. I hope that his association at the present time with the right honourable gentleman, who is going to bring about harmonious relations between the Federal and States Governments, has induced him to abandon his opposition to (Federation, and even to forget all about the Stock Tax. However, the honourable gentleman is, I think, in duty bound to tell the House exactly how far he is going, and how far the consent of his partner in this business, as the head of this peculiar Government, will be given to bring about complete Socialism.",66
673,Mr MCLEAN,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"If the honourable member will support the Government, I shall be prepared to go as far as I said on the occasion to which he has referred.",67
674,Mr SPENCE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"How can I support the honourable gentleman and the! Government of which he is a member, when he has declared that he will knock the Labour Party out of existence if he can, and when I know that that is the only partywhich honestly and openly advocates these things? The members of the honourable gentleman's party say one thing and do another, and they are being backed up by a party outside that wants everything socialistic for itself, whilst it denies the! advantages of Socialism to everybody else. The honourable gentleman speaks of the Labour Party as representing a section, of a class. I presume' that the honourable gentleman means that the wage-earning class, the artizans who work for an employer, are not to have their share of Socialism. They are not to have any share in socialistic enterprises, which are only to be proposed for the benefit of the men on the land. I shall presently have something to say about the attitude of the Government to the men on the land. I have just a word or two to say about another anti-Socialist who stood for the Victorian State! Parliament at the same time as the honourable member for Gippsland, and who was a supporter of that honourable member. I refer ' to the"" honourable and learned member for Wannon. I am sorry the honourable and learned member is not here, but I shall say nothing concerning him that is not perfectly fair. I desire merely to show how much deception there is about some of these honourable gentlemen. In a speech delivered at Hamilton, when the honourable and learned member for Wannon stood for the Victorian State Parliament, after Federation had been accomplished, he was able to tell the electors that the fiscal issue had been transferred to Federal politics. As he dealt with the matter at the beginning of his address, I suppose I may conclude that it represented his first plank, and I find that the honourable and learned member complained that the retiring member had altogether neglected local requirements. He had not h i d enough Government money spent in the district. The honourable and learned member for Wannon was going to see that more was spent in futuie. The other man had done nothing, and he knew that he would be able to do a great deal more. The position which he then took 1 up was that it was justifiable to grab Government money for the constituency; but the honourable and learned member is now an anti-socialist, and he believes only in private enteiprise. I need not refer to some other statements which must have been jocular, because the honourable and learned member claimed that he was a liberal, and a follower of ""the Liberal Party. He told the electors that he had the support of Major Reay, with whose politics residents of Victoiia are well acquainted. T find that he favoured a number of things which were advocated by the honourable member for Gippsland. For instance, the honourable and learned member for Wannon on that occasion favoured the establishment of State dairies in agricultural districts as educational institutions ih which the people might be taught to make good butterequal to the Dutch butter, and so on. That is, no doubt, a very good idea, but it is distinctly and entirely socialistic. There can be no denying that.",67
675,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,What is the use of denying it? Would the honourable member accept a denial if he got it?,67
676,Mr SPENCE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"But the honourable and learned member for Wannon is now denouncing Socialism. He said, further, that he would support closer settlement, and advocated the resumption of the large estates around Hamilton. That is a socialistiic proposal, which has been advocated by the Labour Parties in the States. The honourable and learned imember then favoured tine taking away of people's land, and is now denouncing, with all his powers invective, the taking away of land from its owners. If further taxation was necessary, the honourable and learned member said, in reply to a question, that he would extend the land tax, so as to include cities,, towns. What about taxing the poor farmer He also advocated old-age pensions, and that is decidedly socialistic. The honourable and learned member favoured the tories Act, which is) a socialistic meaunder sure> interfering with private enterprise; He favoured an eight-hours' day railway employees, and he. said he members, would compel every public servant to insure his life.. That, again, is tinctly socialistic proposal. It involves terference with individual liberty, and the denial of the right of a man to do as likes with his own. It: ference with men, by compelling them to pay a portion of their income or wages for of Wannon? the purpose of insuring' their fives, whether they like it or not. These proposals are enversed by the railway tirely socialistic. This only shows how ridielectorate. culous is the position of honourable members who claim to be anti-socialist, and who found. mouth about Socialism, when they have themselves, professed to be supporters to the fullest extent to which it has. so been advocated by the Labour Party in anv State. I have said before that we are titled to claim to be judged upon, the posals we put forward, and not upon thing which some one may have proposed,, and which, is not, and may never be,, before us. It. is most unfair for honourable bersto make these attacks upon, a growine political party- If they desire to the party, they should do soin an honest way on its policy. Honourable (members, have professed to attack the Labour Party, because of its socialistic principles, when have themselves advocated those principles, are guilty of cant and hypocrisy, when talk in the way they do. The honourable and learned member for. Wannon, who now squase. miles, or i„i8o,oo o acres. so strongly denounces all State interference, desires individual liberty, and believes interference with private enterprise positively wrong, has favoured the tion of land held by private owners 'district which he represents. In that trict, there exists at the present time', I sup- £d. in. the £ pose; one of the most crying istence in Australia, in the form of a monopoly of land. I propose to introduce here a little more detail than I had an opportunity of doing, when I spoke previously. he If we take an area of 4,000 square miles, 1 of of the western portion of Victoria, we shall find that nine-tenths of it is owned by sixty families. The total number of. dwellings upon it, including tents, is 1,285; the total population of the area, men, women, and and children, is 7,869. According to the r logic of honourable members who do not believe in interference with private enterprise, we have no right to alter that state of afFacfairs. The owners of the land secured it the law, and according to the people who preach private enterprise, it is theirs for to do as they like with. I want honourable to be aware of their inconsistency, when they at the same time claim, that that a disland should be resumed.. Three hundred inand sixty-two miles of railway rum through - the area, and chiefly through properties in he the .hands of forty owners. These railproposes an interways cost £3>753>o'oo.

Is. not that Socialism? Are not railways a. socialistic institution in the enhand's of the State. They are constructed proto open up country, and yet this country is somemonopolized. And if the policy of those who advocate non-interference with private enterprise be carried out fully., we cannot memresume one of those estates in order that the land may be put to its proper use. We attack cannot do what the honourable and learned member, for Wannon said should be done,, who when as a candidate for the State Parliament of Victoria he advocated that these they lands should be resumed, in order that men should be put upon them instead of sheepthey As another illustration I take the Hampden and Mortlake Shires, an area of 1,845 In thisdistrict, twenty families own over 800,000 all acres. The shire value of the territory, with to be all improvements, amounts to £5,000,000. resumpThe towns of Terang, Camperdown, and in the Mortlake are included in this valuation. disThe rates amount to' £ 1 2 , 4 0 6, or to about These shires have had evils in ex- £ 4 , 1 1 2 from the State.",67
677,Mr BAMFORD,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,What for ?,68
678,Mr SPENCE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"F o r the purpose of making roads to enable these land-owners to get their produce to market. There is, in this district, also illustration of what every one in Victoria knows has been a crying evil in the State for many years. These land-owners have enclosed roads, covering ""an area of 16,337 acres, for which they have paid nothing. Their fences include land which has been surveyed as roads, and they pay nothing it. These peirsons all belong to the antiStates socialistic crowd. They are supporting present Government.",69
679,Mr MCLEAN,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"Does not the honourable member know that the Labour Party in Victoria has always opposed proposals make these persons pay for the use of the roads. Such a proposition has been made on several occasions, but has always been opposed by members of the Labour Party.",69
680,Mr SPENCE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,The Labour Party has never been strong enough in Victoria to accomplish any great reform.,69
681,Mr MCLEAN,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,But they have always opposed such a proposal. I would vote to make these persons pay for the use of the roads.,69
682,Mr SPENCE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I know that the honourable member would, but I am anxious to going straight on. learn whether he intends to stand by the policy which he formerly advocated. Leavvernment ing out towns, over three-fourths of this has only one human habitation to every seven square miles, and only 6f per cent, of the land is used for dairying. figures are, I think, of sufficient importance to be brought under public notice, and they may induce honourable members opposite recognise the inconsistency of their position. In the counties of Dundas, Follet, Lowan, Normandy, Villiers, Heytesbury, Ripon, and Hampden, 2,960,000 acres are held by three companies, and 105 individuals or families.",69
683,Mr SPEAKER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,Does the honourable member think that this has anything to with the motion?,69
684,Mr SPENCE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I think I shall be able to connect these statistics with the motion, by showing that the'y constitute a reply those who say that Socialism is the one thing against which they are fighting.",69
685,Mr SPEAKER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,If the honourable member can connect these statistics with the motion there will be' no complaint.,69
686,Mr SPENCE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"I shall do so, sir. Oneeighth of all privately-owned land in member* western Victoria is held by 525 persons, 1,240,000 acres are held by eighteen perequally ? sons, and over 1,000,000 acres by eleven inrich dividuals. We have heard some honourable members opposite declare that they are inan dividualists, and are opposed to interference with private enterprise. These figures should afford them food for reflection. It may be said that the Commonwealth has nothing to do with the lands of the States, but it has been urged again and again that the Labour Party in the Federal Parliafor ment, and those in the Parliaments of the are controlled by tlje same organizathe tion, and constitute a menace to the well-being of the Commonwealth. That being so, I think we are' justified in showing the inconsistency of Government supporters into attacking us, when they themselves really support the policy of our party. When they say that the Labour Party is inimical to the! interests of the Commonwealth, they are really attacking their own position. They declare that they are opposed to our methods of seeking to improve the conditions of the people; but they must definitely declare whether they are going to renounce for ever the principles which they advocated before they joined the coalition. They must say where they draw the line.",69
687,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,We say that'we are,69
688,Mr SPENCE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"The leaders of the Gohave stated that they are opposed area to Socialism, but they do not say how far they will go. Every honourable member on the Government side who"" has. yet spoken These during this debate has intimated that he is opposed to the Labour Party because it con1 sists of socialists. We do not .deny that to we are socialists. We are proud to say that we! are, but we certainly deny that we have ever advocated the ridiculous proposals attributed to us and to socialistic writers about the equal division of property. No true socialist has ever suggested anything of the kind. Statements of this char1 acter are purely mythical. They are somedo times made by the ignorant, and repeated as jokes, but they have neVer been seriously put before the people by the Labour Party. It is a very serious thing for honourable to members to make such charge's against us, without adducing any specific fact in support of their assertion. I desire to draw from the Government some definite statement as to what socialistic enterprises they favour or disfavour.",69
689,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,Does the honourable deny that any socialistic writer has ever advocated the division of the product,69
690,Mr SPENCE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"That is not the point. Honourable members have charged us dation. with a desire to deprive men of their property, and to divide it amongst The leader of the Government has intimated that his policy is an anti-socialistic one, the Sydney Daily Telegraph, in its issue of 6th inst., puts the .position of the GovernHe ments very clearly, when it says The Government has not come to bring peace to Socialism, but a sword, and unless it makes itself felt in opposition to the aims of the Labour Party, its mission will totally fail . That the fiscal issue has been sunk for, and why a coalition between Mr Reid and Mr MCLean has become tolerable. That is a clear statement made by a leading newspaper, which champions the present Government. In these circumstances holdthat we have not yet heard enough regard to the policy of the Ministry.",70

I do not know whether the honourable member has! read the report of that address.",70
697,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,I have.,70

Dr Mercer, in dealing with the socialistic to a Gomovement said thatHe believed that, while there might be bad in it, there were good ones at the bottom of the social movement, and there were a numbei of educated thinking men who were moved with for the multitude, because of all the sweating and miseries, of slum life. He Lad had eight years' experience in the slums of the London, and if any man realized the enormous of suffering and degradation there was among members of the human, race at the present if he had any sympathy at all with the of mankind when he looked on the multitude in the wilderness, he must have compassion them, and he believed that there was at the heart of the socialistic movement of the present day genuine compassion for the multitude, and a determination to raise the standard of life for submerged mass of. the race. Then there was the sense of brotherhood to be found in the and he believed in that brotherhood of humanity, and that they were increasingly realwhat that brotherhood could be, because of of the socialistic ideas - The people might be long in working them out, but he thought they setting them ideals towards which they could That is but a very short extract from a very excellent address, and I think that the I sentiments expressed indicate that the a Bishop has made a more correct analysis proof the socialistic movement than has the",70
699,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,Does the honourable member call that which he has read an analysis of the socialistic system?,70

702,Mr SPENCE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE,"The honourable membei must be opposed to Socialism, or he would not associate himself with the party which is now making an attack on something which it terms Socialism. The wild outcry against Socialism is simply abogy. has been'raised for party purposes. Either it is a case of ignorance appealing to ignorance-becaus e the declamations against Socialism, which we hear, will have no weight with the intelligent, or with those who have paid any attention to the study of the social questions-o r it is simply a cry raised for party gains. Having nothing else to urge against the Labour Party, our opponents must raise this bogey. Other persons have raised the cry of "" reform,"" knowing that it is a good word and that many people time to study socialistic The statement has also been made by our opponents that we are going to rob the farmers of their land. They expect to create such an antagonism ""against the Labour Party that they will be bound to win when a dissolution takes place. That is the plain object coalition. We rejoice that they have adopted these tactics. It is the best thing that could happen for our movement. The stronger the reactionary, parties outside Parliament fight, the more successful will the Labour Party be. We are on solid ground, and put forward measures which we contend are practical. It is not denied by the Government that they are practical. They have offered some criticism on the only proposal which we have put forward that seems to be debatable in a socialistic sense-the tobacco monopoly proposal. With this exception, they advocate every one of our measures and adopt them as their own. Therefore, their present tactics are merely an attempt to appeal to the prejudice and the ignorance of the people. We are not afraid of that. When we can get the people to understand our proposals we have no fear that we shall secure their support. If, as honourable members opposite contend, they wish to prevent Socialism and promote private enterprise, let them advocate the selling of the Government railways and the putting of all enterprise of that description in the hands of private persons.
