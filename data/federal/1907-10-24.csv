56,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am speaking of the whole item, and I contend that there is an addition to the old duty.

60,Mr STORRER,Unknown,"Bass) [3.18] - I move That the words "" and on and after 25th October, 1907, per lb., i d . , "" be added. I submit this amendment as a protectionist who believes in a fair Tariff, which will apply equally in its incidence to all sections of the community. Under the ConstituNOES. tion, public servants who were transferred from the State to the Federal service at the establishment of the Commonwealth lost none of their existing or accruing rights, and I think it is just as necessary that the States themselves should be protected in the same way. In Tasmania we have a candle-making industry which has teen injured under Inter-State free-trade by the competition of the larger factories of the mainland. Prior to Federation, we had there four soap and candle factories, employing a large number of hands, but the competition from the mainland became so keen, in ""consequence of the establishment of Inter-State free-trade, that two of them had to close down. If this item be' passed, as proposed by the Government, the remaining soap and candle factories in Tasmania will have to close. I hope that the Committee will be prepared to extend consideration to the industries of the smaller States. It has been said that the use of paraffine wax candles in mines is injurious to miners, but those made in Tasmania are sold for household purposes, the miners obtaining other candles to suit their-special requirements.",19
61,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,But the paraffine wax candles made in Tasmania could be sent to the other States for use in the mines.,20
62,Mr STORRER,Unknown,"That is not likely whilst we have on the mainland much larger factories, which can successfully compete with them.  as a good protectionist, ought not to complain about this duty.",20
63,Mr STORRER,Unknown,"I have not gone back on any of my platform pledges. first offered myself as a candidate for election to this House, I said publicly that I believed in a fair protectionist Tariff, and would vote against any duty that was calculated, in my opinion, to be prejudicial to the public interest. My proposition is designed to do justice to Tasmania, and I feel confident that the representatives of the larger States will be prepared to do this act of justice to an industry of one of the smaller States. The Tariff Commission took evidence in Tasmania, as well as-on the mainland, in regard to the manufacture of candles, and the protectionist section of it recommended the imposition of a duty of Jd. per lb. on paraffine wax. The Chairman of the Commission, the honourable member for Bendigo, in dealing with this question , in the course of the general debate on the Tariff, saidAt the same time we recognised that there were candlemakers in Tasmania and New South Wales who were making composite candlesthat is candles composed partly of stearine and partlv of paraffine wax-and we declined to accede to the request to increase the duty upon paraffine wax and the raw material, because any such action would oppressively affect the manufacturers in question. That decision was arrived at after careful consideration, and I hope that it will be endorsed by the Committee.",20
64,Mr WYNNE,Unknown,"Balaclava) [3.23] - I move That the figure "" id.'"" be left out. If that amendment be adopted I shall submit a further proposal that the Governof ment be requested to bring down to increase. the duty to 2d. per lb. It is generally recognised that the use of paraffine wax candles in mines should not be encouraged, as they are injurious.to the health of the miners. If we allow paraffine wax to come in at a low duty it will be used extensively for moulding candles in Australia, with the result that our large stearine candle works will probably be closed, and many men thrown out of employment. Stearine is manufactured in Australia. The raw product, from, which it is made is produced in abundance here, arid I fail to see why we should destroy a great industry for the benefit of foreign producers.",20
65,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"Paraffin e wax"" is made here.",20
66,Mr WYNNE,Unknown,"Some paraffine wax may be produced at the shale works at Hartley Vale, New South Wales, but the quantity is infinitesimal as compared with our outWhen I put of stearine. Australia is a stockraising country, and, therefore, the raw material necessary for the manufacture of stearine candles is produced here. I hope that my proposal will be agreed to.",20
67,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"IlJawarra) [3.27] - The amendment proposed by the honourable member for Balaclava is designed to prevent the introduction of paraffine wax. I would point out that, on page 12 of the report of the free-trade section of the Commission, it is stated thatSome of the niakers who protested most loudly against the importation of the - material were the largest buyers of it, and made candies with the largest proportion of wax. Among these were Messrs. Kitchen, Mowling, Upton, Clarke, Testro, and Gillies. A certain proportion of wax is absolutely necessary in the making of some classes of candles. The principal ground on which it is urged that we should encourage the manufacture of stearine candles is that stearine is made from tallow,-which is largely produced in Australia. Mr Mackinnon, a well-known candle manufacturer, told the Commission thatThe use of paraffine wax enables a larger quantity of tallow to be used in the manufacture of candles. A lower percentage of the by-products required to be extracted, while the use of the wax stiffened and finished the candles made of this low-grade stearine. It will thus be seen that the introduction of paraffine wax tends to increase the use tallow, an Australian product, in the a message candle-making industry.",20
68,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,"Fawkner) [3-2QJ-I wish to call the attention of the mittee to the fact that our imports of paraffine wax, exclusive of some importamade? tions from Japan, have increased from 1,168,000 lbs. in 1.904 to 6,363,000 in 1906. There is no doubt that the local 30 manufacturers use this foreign product in their manufacture, and it behoves us to impose upon it a fair duty. I cognise, as the honourable member for has said, that we should deal fairly with . the candle manufacturers in Tasmania, but. as we make candles from stearine, Australian product",21
69,Mr STORRER,Unknown,Paraffin e wax is necesnative sary to mix with it.,21
70,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,"I do not agree with that contention. Candles made from stearine are as good as any made from paraffine wax. I am inclined to support the Government proposal. The tionist section of the Commission, in commending that a duty of £d. a lb. should be imposed on paraffine wax, was largely ' influenced by the fact that there are in Tasmania two candle-moulding factories. I shall be glad if the honourable member for Bass could show us some way in which the Tasmanian industry could be' preserved without injury to the more important try, the manufacture of stearine. In my opinion we should support the Governuse ment proposal, in order to stearine factories. - Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [3.31] - I wish to supplement statement of the honourable member for Fawkner regarding the importation of paraffine. Last year, as he has pointed out, it amounted to 6,363,946 lbs., which 285,745 lbs. came from the United Kingdom; 459.994 lbs. from Burma; mittee 1,064,662 lbs.' from Indi a ; 3,330 from New.

72,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Yes . quantity of paraffine imported in the first six months of this year was 3,297,253 lbs.. The use of Australian paraffine will largely help the development of our oil industry, because this by-product is almost valuable Comenough to in itself give a good profit.",21

It will commence operations next month, and from the district from which it is working, and, I dare say, from an other districts, immense quantities of oil will be obtained. If we wish to help industries, let us use the paraffine which is made here, instead of that which is imported.",21
75,Mr WILSON,Unknown,Will not the proposed duty give protection ?,21
76,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Yes . But alprotecthough there are some who say that I try reto get the highest duties possible, in this instance it was considered, after the question had been thoroughly gone into, that a duty of i d . would be a fair one to impose. The duty proposed in the Kingston Tariff was i:id., but if was reduced by Parliament to Ad.

80,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,"Denison) [3.42]. people. - I wish to remind the Committee of a . The CHAIRMAN fact, which I am afraid is frequently gotten, that the Constitution is a solemn agreement of partnership between the States. Forgetting that, we frequently give our attention chiefly to the affairs of the larger States, which are 1 degrees monopolizing the manufactures of Australia. I am obliged to the honourable member for Bass for having called attention to a proposed rate of duty which, if agreed to, will seriously affect the industries of the State which we both represent. Under a Tariff which allowed the free admission into Tasmania of both stearine and paraffine, two factories were established in years gone by, which gave employment to a large number of people, and their operations, after years of struggle, began to return a fair profit. The Kingsrepresentative ton Tariff, which placed a duty of i upon stearine and paraffine, seriously affecto ted this industry. I submit that, in view the evidence to which reference has been made by the honourable member for warra, and of the fact that five-sixths the candles consumed in Australia are locally made, it is not necessary to increase the duty. The factories of which I speak will have to close if the proposed rate agreed to. Two members of the present Government, as well as myself and another honourable member sitting on this side the Chamber, were members of the first Commonwealth Ministry, which pledged itself to give effect to the Maitland manito festo of the then Prime Minister, Mr., now Sir Edmund, Barton, which stated that by the Tariff which would be imposed there should be no destruction of induspletely tries. That was part of a compact which was to last, not for a few years, but long as the partnership between the States should endure. The protectionist section of the Tariff Commission has recommended the imposition of a duty of - Jd. per lb. upon the articles enumerated in this item, and I can see no reason why we should ignore its recommendation by increasing rate levied under the old Tariff, and thereget [1.82] to by destroy some of the factories which we are pledged to maintain.  I submit that the amendment of the honfor a orable member for Balaclava would have the effect of increasing the duty proposed is upon the articles enumerated in this item from i d . to 2d. per lb., and would therefore increase a tax or burden upon the - I would point out forto the honourable member that there is no amendment before the Chair to increase the duty from i d . to 2d. per lb. The question which I shall put to the Committee is- "" That the figure proposed to be by left out stand part of the item.""",22
81,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"Parkes) [3.47]- It is very desirable that from time to time the attention of the Committee should be called to broad principles which, though not immediately applicable to any particular item, may underlie the whole of them. The honourable member for Denison was perfectly justified in reminding honourable members that the Government proposal, if agreed to, would involve a breach of one of the broad principles upon which we were returned to this House. Although I am a of the largest State of the d . Commonwealth, I am always very willing entertain protests of this sort from the of smaller States, where they go to the root of the Federation of which we form a part. IllaI do not profess to know much about of the particular commodities specified in this item, but I certainly sympathize with the representatives of Tasmania when they point out that-if the prois posal of the Government be adopted - greate r encouragement will be offered to the manufactures of Victoria, whilst .of those of the smaller States will be destroyed. I now wish to call attention to another broad principle which seems to me touch the present work of the Committee. The duty on this narticular item under the old Tariff was Jd. per lb. The proposal of the Government would comignore the recommendations of both branches of the Tariff Commission, and so would increase the old rate of duty by 100 per cent. From time to time. I have inwardly protested against the barrowloads of appeals which have been made by manufacturers to me in common with other honourable' members. I do not hesitate to say that some of their communications conthe tain the most infamous exaggerations. We ex parte statements from both sides,. each one giving the lie to the other. The only effect which this correspondence has had upon my mind has been to convince me of the great value of a body like the Tariff Commission, which sat in a judicial capacity, which subjected the authors of these communications to a most searching cross examination under oath, and which, after hearing their evidence, endeavoured to arrive at a conclusion which was just and reasonable under all the circumstances. That Commission sat for two and a half years. Its Chairman was the honourable member for Bendigo, who is a confirmed, protectionist. After hearing all the evidence in favour of those who advocate adutv of 2d. per lb. upon these articles, and also the testimony of those who favour no duty at all, the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommended that the rate of duty operative under the old Tariff should be adopted. I am informed that the comparative statement relating to the Tariff, which is before honourable members, contains an error. The honourable imember for Illawarra assures me that, under the B column of the recommendations of the Tariff Commission, the words "" i o per cent. "" should be substituted for "" 20 per cent."" He ' further tells me that 10 per cent, is .equivalent to Jd. per lb. The protectionist section of the Commission having all the evidence of manufacturers, recommend the adoption of a duty of Jd. per lb., and the free-trade section of that body recommend the imposition of a duty of \ d . per lb. Therefore, even if we accept the recommendation of the protectionist half of the Commission.",22
82,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,Will the member accept their finding in respect of all the items in the schedule?,23
83,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"I do not say that I shall, but I will accept the complete Tariff Commission's findings, because its members are in an infinitely better position to judge of this question than we are. We frequently hear honourable members say, I have received a letter from so-and-so,"" mentioning the name of a large firm of manufacturers, ' ' and they recommend that a certain rate of""duty should be adopted."" Now, it may be a very proper thing for honourable members to echo the recommendations of large manufacturers who happen to be located in their particular constituencies. But personally I do not think it is the right thing to do. We are here to hold the scales of justice evenly as between all parties, irrespective of States and of constituencies. I can point to my own actionin respect of the duty upon wire netting to show that I am not preaching what I do not practice. The 'Treasurer has told us that he has received a letter recommending the imposition of a duty of 2d. per lb. upon these articles. The honourable member for Balaclava made a similar statement. . Mr WYNNE - I did not.",23
84,Mr BRUC ESMITH,Unknown,I understood him to do so.  he had received a letter.,23
85,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,I feel that I am sent here to hold the scales of justice evenly as between the two extremes. The Treasurer has told us candidly that in many cases he has asked for double the duty that he expects to get.,23
86,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I did not say anything of the kind.,23
87,Mr BRUC ESMITH,Unknown,The Treasurer did say so.,23
88,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I rise to a point of order. I wish to say that I have never said or even thought what the honourable member attributes to me. - Mr Bruce SMITH - I withdraw the statement in the form in which I couched heard it. But the Treasurer told us that in some cases he had asked for a higher duty than he expects to get.,23
89,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I did not. The honourable member must not make misstatements of that kind.,23
90,Mr BRUC ESMITH,Unknown,"Then I withdraw the assertion unconditionally. Honhonorable orable members will recollect what the Treasurer did say, and I leave them to judge of the accuracy or otherwise of my statement. But whether the Treasurer said so or not, does not touch my argument that we are here to do our duty to the whole of the people of the Commonwealth. We are here to remember the consumer-the forgotten factor in protectionist arguments. I feel that it is quite impossible for any of us to give these matters the same judicial treatment that has been given to them by the Tariff Commission. The members of that body have considered some of these items for hours and days together. They have heard the evidence of all the gentlemen who are now ipestering us with ex - parte letters, and they have also heard the testimony - of those who protest that the other side are asking for too high a rate of duty. Having regard on to all the - circumstances they have recomthen mended the imposition of certain duties. years When we find that the free-trade section is of the Commission recommend the adopdone tion of a duty of Jd. per lb., whilst the protectionist section, whose sympathies are to naturally with the manufacturers, recomsene mend the imposition of no higher duty than Jd. per lb., how can we adopt the proposal of the Government to double the old rate? firms I ask honourable members to recognise the one-sided and ex parte character dence now put before us with regard these commodities.",23

96,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"The Sydney Soap vail and Candle Company. I have asked.that largehere; company to supply me with a report upon this matter under different headings, and the most concise way in which I can place the information before the Committee is reading extracts from that report. company state that-Foreign competition is a serious matter. Our business, in which nearly j£ 100,000 has been pended in plant, & c , was started for the manufacture of soaps, stearine candles, and stearine with its by-products, glycerine, and oleine, from Australian tallow under the old Parkes Tariff, which provided for duties on candles and also [182]- 2 stearine, but not on paraffine wax, which was very little used in candle-making. Of late this wax has been imported from America and Burmah on a very large scale, and as it the finished article, all its cosllv refining being in countries of origin, it only requires a very inexpensive moulding plant and boy labour melf it and mould it into candles. This material is a by-product in the manufacture of kerofrom petroleum, and is principally in the hands of the Standard Oil Trust of America and the Burmese Rangoon Oil Company. These control prices and shipments and dump theii cheap material . into any unprotected market which they may wish to capturt by knocking out of the eviexisting candlemakers. to The importations of paraffine wax from America which have increased so largely I during recent years, point conclusively to the practice of dumping from that country. comThe report goes on to sayThe American wax is controlled by the Standard Oil Trust, and the Burmah Company not sell us wax of the quality of their best candles. The present Tariff provides a but utterly inadequate duty on wax. The effect of these large imports of wax, which makes a cheap but very inferior candle, has been to largely cripple our stearine business, which is only about one-third of its former under the Dibbs Tariff; this meuns greatly restricted local market for our' raw material, tallow, and a great diminution in hands employed, and Australian-made chemicals, g that we boxes, paper, & c , used. We consider this competition is absolutely unfair, as without.an adequate duty we are at mercy of the American Standard Oil Trust, can dump their virtually finished article against our Australian-made stearine, of which all the complicated processes of manufacture carried out here. _ It is, therefore, absolutely necessary, in our view, that a duty should be imposed on wax stearine equal to candle duty. The stearine candle imports are entirely from Belgium and America Holland, and the wax candles come from and Burmah. which has The report goes onProbably a number of workmen would be at least in New South Wales, and a matter of ^15,000 or so more wages paid. This would, however, depend somewhat on imports of Australian-made goods from other States made under cheaper labour conditions than prein any case there would be a very increase in labour, as during the good times of the Dibbs Tariff we were turning out nearlv thrice the stearine and employing a very great number more workmen than at present. by On the subject of the rate of wages in The Burma and other countries the report gives some valuable informationThe rate of native wage in Burmah paid in exthe manufacture of Burmese wax and Rangoon candles is 5d. per day; in Belgium and Holland in the manufacture of stearine and stearine candles it is about 15s. per week, .of 72 hours. We have no data as to the wages paid by the Standard Oil Trust in America, but however high they might be it would not concern or help us here, as the Standard Oil people fix their ing or dumping rate regardless of cost. Some reference having been made to the effect of the duty on the consumer, I made a point of asking the company if they were favourable to the new protection scheme of the Labour Party, and I was informed that the company were prepared to accept the proposed conditions. connection the company sayThis company pay the highest rate of wages : JI the soap and candle trade in the Commonwealth, and would cheerfully agree to the ""New /'rotection"" idea of giving the workers a share, provided adequate protection (which would really protect) were given to the trade. There is too much Inter-State competition to"" render any Trust or Ring possible, and as there is sweating carried on in our trade in some of the StatesPerhaps the Tasmanian representatives will listen to thiswe should hail legislationbringing all wages payable in the Commonwealth up to our level at least, and also to enforce the placing very legibly on each packet of candles the net weight of the contents. In addition, it has been pointed out that paraffine wax candles are very injurious, and that miners' all over Australia are calling for their prohibition.",24

The Hartley Vale Company are manufacturing oil from shale, and, no doubt, will be able to turn out paraffine wax as a by-product. It is anomalous to impose a duty of 2d. per lb. on paraffine wax candles, and then to propose a duty of half that amount on paraffine wax, thus nullifying the decision at which we arrived a few minutes ago. pointed that the Treasurer has adopted an attitude which will prevent any honourable member proposing, with any hope of success,' that the duty on paraffine wax shall be raised to 2d. per lb.",25
101,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"Wilmot) [4-5]-- I light- hope that the Committee willdecide to reduce the duty from i d . to Jd. Under the latter duty, which was fixed in 1902, practically no stearine was introduced into Australia; and, from that point of view, I am personally not particular whether the duty be Jd. or i d . per lb. In regard to paraffine wax, however, I think In that the Committee would be right in making the reduction suggested. I suppose that 90 per cent, of the candles made in Tasmania are of paraffine wax; and it would not pay any firm there to erect a still for the making of .stearine, because such a still would have to be run day and night, and would turn out more stearine than is required in so small a community. There were four factories in Tasmania not long ago under the duty of £d. per lb., but now there are only t w o ; and we may readily imagine the result to the remaining factories if the duty be raised to i d . If we are to have protection it ought to be fair and just all round. It is unjust, merely in order to bolster up' Messrs. Kitchen and Sons, and one or two other wealthy candle makers, to crush out the smaller manufacturers of Tasmania. I am satisfied that the Committee will give that generous consideration which is author of essential to the industry by agreeing to the amendment proposed. The manufacturers of stearine candles have nothing to fear from the manufacturers of Tasmania, who could not possibly compete by exporting their product to the mainland. No one would be benefited by the increased duty on paraffine wax, except those manufacturers already strong enough to do without any such aid.",25
102,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,The miners would benefit.,25
103,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,The miners do not use paraffine wax candles from Tasmania.,25
104,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"Unfortunately , they are compelled to do so. ' Mr ATKINSON - I contend that, under the circumstances, the Tasmanian manufacturers of candles are entitled to the favourable consideration of the Committee. It is not only on behalf of the candlemakers that I am making this plea; because paraffine wax is used in a large numI am disap- ber of other industries. For instance, it is used in the dairying industry, to which,' more than any other, Victoria owes its present flourishing condition.",25
105,Mr STORRER,Unknown,So does Queensland.,25
106,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"That is so. I have in my .possession the following letter, written, not by a Tasmanian, but by a. Melbourne manParaffine wax is used in Australia for many other purposes than candle-making. stance, in the great dairying industry an immense amount of waxed paper is employed in the packing of the butter. We exported during last season from Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia about 1,250,000 56-lb. boxes of butter, every one of which had to be lined with waxed paper. An equal number of boxes would 'be used locally, also lined with waxed paper. Waxed wrappers are also used in the confectionery trade and in the 0 putting up of tea. It is also used in the local finishing of certain electrical goods and in many other ways. In fact, paraffine wax is the raw material of many manufactures and trades outside candle-making. Again, there is the consumer point of view. Candles are the light of the poorest classes. Wax candles are also very extensively used in mining and other industries. Further, it is well known' that there is a ine Trust or Combine in Australia headed by J. Kitchen. If the i d . prohibitive duty posed, Kitchen and his friends will be' able to charge what they like for stearine, or refuse to supply this raw material to candlemakers who compete with them The statement that there is a combine or trust is, I think, well founded. Not very long 'ago, certain Australian manufacturers endeavoured, by dumping candles in Tasmania, to ""knock-out"" the local manufacturers. The latter, however, bought up all those candles at the price asked, and, sending them back to Victoria, sold them to the original makers at a good profit.",26
107,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,Who is the author of that letter? Is the honourable member prepared to lav it on the table?,26
108,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"I shall lay it on the table with the permission of the honourable member for Bass. I do not know that I am actually bound to give the name of the gentleman who wrote the letter; but the document is here for any honourable member to see if he so desires. I have no wish to repeat arguments already advanced by other honourable members; and I leave the matter to honourable members, trusting that they will extend fair and generous treatment to the manufacturers of Tasmania.",26
109,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"North Sydney) [4.15] - It is evident that the suggestion that the duty on stearine and paraffine wax should be increased to 2d. per lb. is due to a desire to make a wholly unnecessary gift to the large candle manufacturers of Australia. The proposition' is an extraordinary one. We have already increased the duty on foreign candles from id. to i j d . and 2d. per lb., although under the old Tariff the manufacturers here had practically captured the bulk of the Australian trade. Apparently the local manufacturers have sufficient influence to secure the acceptance of their representations, For in- and eventually their prices will be raised to the full extent of the duty. We are asked to make a large gift from the moneys of the people of Australia to those engaged in a successful industry. The shares in some of the candle-making companies of Australia have been advancing, and their present rates are far above the levels of previous years. We are .now asked to.so fortify them that no one will be able to compete with them. By the imposition of a duty of 2d. per lb. not merely on paraffine wax, but on stearine and the other associated articles in this item, we shall enable the large local manuStearfacturers to control the market and to crush out any small competitor. The smaller is im- States have reason to complain of the way in which these duties are dealt with by the Parliament. It is all very well ""for representatives of Victoria and New South Wales to support the imposition of duties which they know, or ought to know, will lead to a monopoly in their own States, but they ought to be prepared to extend consideration to the manufacturers in other parts of the Commonwealth. I am prepared to accept the statement of those who are competent to speak with authority on this question that the use of paraffine candles in mines is injurious to the health of the miners, but if their use for such purposes is to be discontinued it will be necessary for the States to impose a prohibition. Even if we adopted the proposal of the honourable member for Balaclava we should not overcome the difficulty. Paraffine is already being produced in Australia, and Sir George Newnes' company will shortly give an increased output. It seems idle to declare that paraffine is injurious and should not be used in imported candles, whilst at the same time we allow paraffine wax to be locally used.",26
110,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,We can get rid of one of the two evils by producing paraffine for our own use.,26
111,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"That is the whole secret. As a matter of fact, a considerable quantity of paraffine wax is used in composite-candles, and the duty of 2d. per lb. will not prevent the use of such candles in our mines. This duty will fall on composite candles only according the proporton of wax used in them, in addition to that, locally produced, some paraffine wax will be used in any event in the manufacture of candles in Australia. It is not contended that the use of paraffine candles above ground is injurious to health, and we should not refuse to give the people an opportunity to procure a cheap candle if they desire to do so. I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Bass. It cannot be said that the candle-making industry was badly treated under the old Tariff, and since we have increased the duty on candies I fail to see why the course proposed Z ft\T A should be adopted.",26

As a representative one of the less populous States, I have every sympathy with Tasmania when threatened with unjust treatment in the larger States.

Amongst other things, it declared that the bulk, if not the - whole, of the paraffine wax imported into Australia was sent here by the Standard O i l Trust.",29
147,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"I did not say that. I said that that Trust sent 3,000,000 lbs. of paraffine wax here annually.",30
148,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I understood the honourable member to say that the Standard O i l Trust was practically supplying Australia with the whole of its imports of paraffine wax. I ami also reminded that the honourable member for Hindmarsh made a similar statement. Now, as a matter of fact, almost 50 per cent, of the total importations of paraffine wax into the Commonwealth come from the Straits Settlements and from British Burmah. If honourable members will turn to the comparative statement relating to the Tariff and to importations and duty payments for 1906, they will find that our imports of paraffine wax during the year totalled 6,457,692 lbs., valued at . .£13,623. During years' the British Imperial O i l Company has . become a very competitor with the Standard Trust of America, with the result that the latter has"" not the monopoly which it formerly enjoyed. I wish, further, to point out that in the stearine industry very little labour is employed. The bulk of the work is performed by machinery, and the industry is one that we are not justified in attempting to bolster up. making industry throughout the Commonwealth is practically in the hands of a very few individuals. ' These have already crushed a number of the smaller manufacturers, and under the monopoly which we shall give to them, if we sanction the duty proposed, they will possess even greater power to crush small competitors. I do not think it is the desire of the Committee - that we should create monopolies. If anything is to be done in the way of promoting industries, I think that, even from a protectionist stand-point, more regard should be paid to the struggling man than to the individual with an immense amount of capital, who by means of business combinations is in a position to crush his smaller rival. But honourable members seem determined to give every possible assistance to the bigger men who are able to pool their interests, and thus establish monopolies. Later on we shall be doing our best to circumvent the very monopolies which we are now creating.",30

151,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I fail to see any d if ference between the two evils. I do not see that the competitor who is crushed by a monopoly is benefited by the knowledge that he is crushed by a local and not by a foreign monopoly. If I were to be placed under a steam roller and crushed into pulp .it would not be any consolation for those who are dependent upon me to know that that roller was made by a local firm, and not by a foreign one. The effect would be precisely the same. To me it would not matter whether I were crushed by a roller of foreign manufacture or by one which was manufactured in Collingwood. I hope that before we proceed further with this kind of legislation honourable members will give serious thought recent to that aspect of the matter. After we have firmly entrenched these monopolies, after strong we have enabled them to increase prices to Oil the consumer, to limit their output, and generally to restrain trade, we shall hear the very honourable members who are assisting to pass this legislation crying out against such iniquities.",30
152,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,We shall do more.than cry out. The candle Mr JOHNSON - Surely prevention is better than cure. Those honourable members who now desire to bolster up monopolies will be the loudest in their cries for legislation to mitigate the evils of their own creation.,30

155,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Canno t we impose checks upon the local man? - Mr JOHNSON - Now is the time to impose those checks. But instead of doing so we are building ramparts around him to protect him.

Further, it will place those smaller men at the mercy of this Combine or Trust, who will be able to charge what they like stearine.

A duty of Jd. per lb., added to the 30s. per ton represented by the freight, amounts to 25 per cent., protection; and point out that these candle-making firms, who are in the.ring, have been eminently prosperous.

167,Mr STORRER,Unknown,The grievance is that the smaller men cannot get paraffine wax.,31
168,Mr CARR,Unknown,"The company I have mentioned are prepared to make all, or nearlythe paraffine wax required in Australia. At present the company employs about 1,300men, and pays £13,000 monthly in wages. Candle-making is one of those industries in which, in my opinion,' protection ought 1 to have the effect of reducing prices. That has been the effect of protection in other industries where competition is fairly easy. I can quite understand that protection may build up monopolies in larger industries, which are more essential to the development of the country than is candle-making. There is the iron-making industry, for instance, which must of necessity be a monopoly; but surely it is not suggested that, therefore, we must not develop that industry and make our own guns and machinery. The same principle is involved, only its application is of lesser degree, in the case of candle-making. I am prepared, in the interests of Australia, to experiment with the duty proposed.",31

173,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"I have received letters from miners' associations in several parts of ""Victoria, protesting against such candles being manufactured or imported.",32
174,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"It has already been pointed out that if these are not proper candles to be used in mining, it is for the States authorities to prevent their consumption. The honourable member for Yarra said that in the manufacture of stearine candles there was four to six times more labour employed than in the manufacture of paraffine wax candles. I am sorry the honourable member is not in the Chamber, because I should certainly have liked to hear some justification for that assertion. The labour cost in connection with the manufacture of candles was gone into very closely by the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission. I may point out that the protectionist section of the Commission did not seem to bother themselves' much about the labour cost of this or any other product. I contend that the labour cost is one of the most important facts to be taken into consideration, especially by protectionists, when deciding as to the rate of duty necessary. On this subject, the free-trade section of the-Tariff Commission say, at page 20 of their reportWitnesses were in practical agreement that the entire labour cost in the manufacture of best stearine candles does not exceed £ 6 per ton. At ' an average price of 4d. per lb., the product would thus be worth ^37 6s. 8d. per ton; therefore, the proportion of labour cost to product would be 16 per cent. Wax and composite candles cost much less, from £ 1 ns., all wax, up to £ 3 ios. per ton for composites, including the making of the stearine. At an average factory value of 3id. per lb., equalling £ 3 2 13s. 4d. per ton, the labour cost would range from 5 per cent, for wax to 11 per cent.' for composite candles, according to quality. There is a very great difference between those figures and the ratio presented to us by the honourable member for Yarra.",32
175,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"What deduction does the honourable member draw from that fact, in regard to the item before us?",32
176,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"The deduction I draw is there is no justification for the proposal of the Government, but that, on the contrary, there is every justification for the recommendation of the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission. On the question of labour cost, I would refer honourable members to page 19 of the report of the free-trade section 'of the Commission, where it is shown that Mr Testro, one of the most competent witnesses that we examined upon this question, gave evidence thatWith an up-to-date plant, costing .£40,000 or less, and 150 men and boys, he could produce all stearine required by the Commonwealth. That does not suggest that a great deal of labour is involved in the production of stearine.",32
177,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,What about the labour employed in hewing the coal required in connection with the industry as well .as in other directions? *,32
178,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"Does the honourable member think that we should take all these subsidiary matters into consideration? In dealing with this question of labour cost, are we to consider the labour employed in every industry even remotely associated with the manufacture of stearine? It is /pointed out in the report that Mr Testrogave a lucid explanation of the process, and in answer to further questions re-affirmed his first estimates and stated that 50 men and 70 boys would produce 120 tons of stearine a week. We know that at present the requirements of the Commonwealth are being provided for locally. No stearine is being imported under this Tariff, and our statistics show that manufacturers of stearine in Australia have nothing to fear in regard to competian tion from abroad. The evidence of Mr. Upton, a well-known manufacturer of soap and candles in Sydney, was that he did not desire a duty on either stearine or paraffine Australia, wax. Candle manufacturers in Tasmania, as well as in other parts of the Commonmer managing director of the Sydney Soap, and wealth, who were able at one time to obtain paraffine free of duty, felt the old Tariff, and they will certainly be ously prejudiced by this duty which parently designed to force the whole of candle-making industry into the hands certain manufacturers. I agree with the observations made by the honourable member for Lang as to monopolies and am surprised that the Labour Party, who are supposed be strongly opposed to combines and trusts, monopoly. are not prepared to take advantage of the present opportunity to prevent the growth wax. of a monopoly in connection with the manufacture of candles in Australia - In order that they may thoroughly understand the position, it is absolutely necessary that orable members should learn who are owners of the various candle-making tories in the Commonwealth.

192,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"At . least five. They were all manufacturers of stearine, and they naturally asked for a higher duty. It is to be regretted that the managing diis rector of the Sydney Soap and Candle Company, a letter from whom has been reread to the Comtmittee by the honourable for Cook, did not see fit to appear before the Commission. We sat for some time in Sydney, and had he appeared before us, we should have had an opportunity underto cross-examine ham - The Committee should receive with very great caution inletters written by those who failed to avail themselves of the opportunity to put their case .before the Commission. The honorports able member for Hindmarsh asserted that the Standard Oil Company had practically a monopoly of the oil trade in Australia. The figures quoted this afternoon by the Treasurer showed distinctly that the imfitably portation of oil is in the hands, of the Standard Oil Company and the Britishduced India Company, and that the importations of the first-named company are more than equalled by those from other parts of the world. From the remarks made by honourable member for Hindmarsh, one would imagine that the Standard Oil pany had a monopoly of the trade.",33
193,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,They tried to secure a monopoly.,34
194,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"But they have not been successful. Another company has been fighting them in this market, with the retions. sult that those who use paraffine wax are able to obtain it on much better terms than before. If this duty were removed, users of paraffine"" wax would be able to supply a better candle at a cheaper rate.",34
195,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The free-trade secper tion of the Commission for the most part recommended revenue duties.,34

It would good thing if honourable members would think a little more of the position.of poor man. Monopolistic manufacturers appear to be able to get the ear of some honourable members, whilst the poor man unable to do so. Let me put before the Committee some figures as to the imports paraffine wax. From Burma were ported 459,994 lbs.; from India, 1,064,662 lbs.; from the Straits 1,070,012 lbs.; from. Java, 71,636 lbs.; from Sumatra, 161,141 lbs - in all these people. countries the output is under the control the British-India Company- ; from Dutch Borneo, 255 lbs.; from the United Kingan dom, 285,745 lbs.; from New Zealand, stearine. 3J33Q lbs.; from Belgium, 1,104 from Germany, 718 lbs. In none of the countries which I have named is the output, under the control of the Standard Oil Trust, and the total importations from them, sometimes. about equal the importations from America controlled by the Standard Oil Trust, which came to 3,250,340. lbs. . How, then, can the Standard Oil Trust have a monopoly this market, when quite as much as it imis imported by other companies? In my opinion, there is nothing to justify the proposed increase. The free-trade section of the Tariff Commission found that the manufacture of stearine is carried on proby several manufacturers in the Commonwealth, and could be profitably prowithout fiscal aid if modern plant were employed. If the manufacturers of stearine in Australia are suffering-and they did not prove to the Commission that the they were-it is because they have old. machinery. According to Mr Clarke, the Compresent manager of the Sydney Soap and Candle Company, it, some fifteen or twenty years ago, to use his own expression, threw away tons of money in machinery, which had to be put on the scrap heap, and new machinery introduced. Of course, that has increased the cost of the company's operaBut the evidence of Messrs. Kitchen, Upton, and others shows that stearine is being successfully manufactured in the the Commonwealth, and that the manufacturers are not suffering from the competition of importers. Furthermore, a duty of Jd. lb., or £ 4 13s. 4d. per ton, is equal to from 13 to 15 per cent, upon the normal shipping value in Europe, while the natural protection in freight and charges approximates 10 per cent, more, or 25 per cent, altogether. The entire labour cost in the manufacture of stearine ranges from 2 to 6 per cent, of the value of the finished probe a duct, according to its quality and grade. In the lower grades, which are largely used the in the principal factories in New South Wales and Victoria with an admixture of paraffine wax, the labour cost is often as is low as 2 per cent. I have already shown that the factories in which stearine is made of are mostly under the control of one firm. imTo impose an extra duty would seriously handicap certain candle manufacturers.

It is proved conclusively that combines are formed in these industries; and, as honourable members know, I am opposed to combines, as being diametrically opposed to the interests of the people of Australia. We ought not, by means of very high duties, to enable a few manufacturers to form combines at the expense of the public.",37
252,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Melbourne Ports) [6.5] - Severa l honourable members have condemned the Committee for not adopting the suggestions of the Tariff Commission. The position of those honourable members seems to be that they follow the recommendations of the Tariff Commission when it suits them to do so, and ignore those recommendations when these are not in accord with their opinions. Did Parliament relegate to the Tariff Commission the right to fix the duties? If Parliament did do so, why should we put ourselves and the country to the trouble of considering the Tariff? In my view, however, the Royal Commission was appointed because it 'was considered that a few men could collect, better than the larger body of Parliament, evidence from those who are directly interested in industries, and present the result in the of a report, leaving it to Parliament, in its wisdom or unwisdom, to decide what shall be the Tariff of Australia. Honourable members seem to have lost sight of the fact that the Committee have already, by a large majority, fixed the duty on candles made of paraffine wax, and also of other materials. Yet we are now discussing the question whether we shall allow the importation of the raw product at the low duty of Jd. per lb.",37
253,Mr REID,Unknown,"That duty was recommended by the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission. Mr MATHEWS . ^ I have already dealt with the Tariff Commission. I am assured by men who work in this industry that, in the manufacture of stearine, six times - - as much labour is employed - as in the manufacture of candles. Of course, I am not a candle maker, and, like honourable members opposite, can ' only speak from information received. I may - say that I have little concern with employers ; my only interest is with the working men who sent me here. Of course, 1I have enough common sense to know that unless employers can make their businesses pay, the wages paid must be small; but the - information I have given as to the proportion of the labour employed, is that given to me by those who are most closely 'interested, as employees, in this industry. Under such circumstances, where is the - common sense in allowing paraffine wax to be imported in large quantities? be derided for expressing the opinion that Tasmanian manufacturers ought to be able - to manufacture the whole of the candles required in that State. But I see no reason why that should not be so. I cannot believe that the only chance of the Tasmanian manufacturers lies in importation of this raw material. Surely there is enough tallow in Tasmania to provide all the stearine that is required; and I say that in spite of the fact that some ,£40,000 has been estimated as the cost of plant and machinery, I have known candles to be made in a little shed, at very much less than their cost today, though, of course, it must be admitted that the larger and the more modern the appliances, the cheaper the production. In my opinion, the manufacturers of Tasmania ought to be able to place the natural stearine product on the market as cheaply as do the manufacturers of Victoria. ' Anshape other fact which seems to be lost sight of is that in New South Wales today paraffine wax is being produced, and that a duty would be beneficial to the manufacturers of that State. It has often been said that the protectionist proposals are made in the interests of the cities of New South Wales and Victoria; but, as a matter of fact, the oil works of New South Wales are situated in the country. Knowing that we have tallow here, and also paraffine wax, it seems illogical on the part of any protectionist, even of the milk and water and revenue tariffist order, to accept the proposal for a duty of Jd. I quite understand that many honourable members, who represent mining or agricultural constituencies, must pay regard to the price at which the candle is placed on the market; but it has been proved over and over again that protection does not eventually mean an increase in price, but rather the"" reverse. There are innumerable examples of the truth of that statement, and I am not claiming more for the manufacturers here than I am willing to concede to the manufacturers and producers in every other portion of Australia. Honourable members may not be immediately concerned in this item before us, but the time may come when items in which they are interested, and in regard to which they expect to get some support Mrt REID - Lo g rolling ! ' Mr MATHEWS - L o g rolling ! I am speaking from an Australian stand-point. I may Is it - log rolling to ask the people of Queensland and Western Australia to assist the people of New South Wales and Victoria? In my opinion such a request represents an Australian sentiment which ought to be acted upon both in this House and outside of it. Has it been suggested that the power given to Western Australia under the Constitution to impose a special Tariff for five years was the result of log rolling?",38
254,Mr REID,Unknown,No ; that was a proper bargain.,39
255,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,Was there any semblance of log rolling in connection with the insertion in the Constitution of the provision .that the Federal Capital should be in New South Wales?,39
256,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,I must ask the honourable member' to confine his remarks to the question before the Chair.,39
257,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"I appeal to honourable members to deal with this question from an Australian stand-point.. We must be guided, not by any consideration of what may suit the people of one electorate, but rather by a desire to benefit Australia generally. The candle-making industry is a large one in which some of our natural products are employed, and it would be foolish to impose a high duty on the manufactured' article if we did not also impose a reasonable duty on the stearine and wax used in the production of that article. I should like to see a duty of 2d. per lb. imposed, since we have imposed a fair duty on the finished product.",39
258,Mr REID,Unknown,"East Sydney) [6.17] - I should like to remind the honourable member for Melbourne Ports that the proposition that the duty should be reduced to Jd. per lb., so far from being a free trade one, was actually made by the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission. After taking evidence, and giving the matter full consideration, that section of the Commission recommended that, in the interests of Australian industries, and from a protectionist, and not from a free trade or a revenue point of view, a duty of ^d. per lb. should be imposed. That being so, the Opposition are not raising, in this case, the fiscal issue. I do not understand the position taken up by the honourable member for New England. Notwithstanding the efforts that we are making to suppress monopolies, he does not seem to be very - much concerned about their creation. He ought to remember, however, that it is ' a very serious thing to suppress a young industry in any part of Australia in the interests c of a big combine or association. We may not be able to do all that we want to do, but young industries, although perhaps they do not employ a large number of men, should receive from protectionists a. fair amount of consideration.",39
259,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,Does the honourable member affirm that there is a combine?,39
260,Mr REID,Unknown,"I cannot speak from personal knowledge, but I understand that the great candle manufacturers of the. Commonwealth have an arrangement which practically makes them an association. The Royal Commission have reported to that effect, and the statement has not been denied. We must remember that the Commission was composed of gentlemen of very great intellectual power and experience who have had the advantage, which we have nothad, of 6eeing the witnesses and hearing the evidence. They have laid it down that the great manufacturers of candles have a. sort of association which is tantamount to throwing the whole industry under the one power, even if it does - not mean turning the whole of the profits into the one pocket. Whether a man is a protectionist or a free-trader his feelings are rather in favour of the small ""struggling industry which has been able to fight combinations.""",39
261,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,But the candle-making industry in Tasmania is purely artificial.,39
262,Mr REID,Unknown,"If that be so we should be a little more desirous of preserving the plant, which has been struggling under such unfavorable conditions. When the old - Tariff was under consideration, a statement that a man and a boy had a.tinpot factory in Little Bourke-street carried the whole Committee, but when we now hear that factories in Tasmania have to fight against dumping and all sorts of contrivances, the position seems to be different. We are not asked to forsake the protectionist view of this question, because the protectionist branch of the Commission proposed, the' very duty which the honourable member for Bass desires should be imposed. The reference made a few minutes ago to the presence in the gallery of a manufacturer who is interested in' this question was wholly uncalled for. Night after night, since the introduction of the Tariff, there have been manufacturers in> the gallery.",39

We have imposed on candles from foreign countries a duty of 2d. per lb., and there certainly ought to be on paraffine wax a higher duty than that which prevailed under the Tariff of 1902. For that reason, if for no other, I sincerely trust that the Committee will pass the item as it stands. Although a large section of the Committee would doubtless have supported a duty of 2d. per lb., we felt that a duty of i d . per lb. would be sufficient, and as Government proposition is a moderate one I trust that it will be endorsed by the Committee.",41

286,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"Robertson) [7.45] - The Government propose to place a duty of i d . per lb. on stearine, paraffine wax, beeswax, and similar substances, .the duty under the Kingston Tariff being Jd.', which rate the "" A "" section of the TariffCommission recommended the continuance of, while the "" B "" section recommended a duty of 20 per cent. I understand that a duty of Jd: per lb. is.eqUal to one of 15 per cent., and'a duty of i d . per lb. to one of 30 per cent. Therefore the Government proposal is 10 per cent, above the recommendation of the "" B "" section of the Tariff Commission, and twice as high as the rate recommended by the "" A "" section. The "" A , "" or - protectionist, section of t the Commission may be taken, to have given full consideration to the interests of the manufacturers. I learnt from the evidence that one firm alone could supply all the stearine required in Australia, and that some years ago it. refused to supply stearine to the factories in Tasmania. Thus there is already a monopoly in existence. Manufacturers have stated that very little stearine is imported, because, with a duty of Jd. per lb., it would hardly pay to import it. The higher rate proposed by the Government is not asked for by the trade, and is not needed for protective purposes, because the local manufacturers have command of the market. Therefore, if imposed, it can only so to swell the profits of the manufacturers by increasing prices. That is a business-like view which even a protectionist might take. As for paraffine wax, I am informed that the best quality is made in New South Wales, although a great deal is imported. Much of the imported wax is used in candle-making; but if the duty on it is increased, the price of the candles in which it is used will be raised, while no more employment will be given. Under these circumstances, I cannot understand the action of the Government in wasting time by sticking out for their proposal. Why do they not accept the recommendation of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, and let us get on to some other item better worth fighting about? Why is the Treasurer so stubborn that he will not take the advice of his friends, and of those the on this side whom he regards as his enemies, though we are not so, notwithstanding that we fight in the interests of the consumers, of the workers, and of the industries of Australia ?",41

306,Mr STORRER,Unknown,"Bass) [8.4] - No argument has been advanced in favour of the imposition of a duty of i d . per lb. upon this item. The honourable member for Hindmarsh has declared that paraffine wax is a product of Australia, and that, therefore, we ought to encourage its use. Is he prepared to adopt a similar line of reasoning in regard to the imposition of a duty upon kerosene? Some honourable members have affirmed that Tasmania 'should produce her own stearine. But Tasmania is only a small State, and to establish stearine works there would necessitate a capital . outlay of about .£40,000. Even when the works had been established, there would not be a sufficient local demand for their produce. Any business man must recognise that it is impossible to establish such a large industry as stearine in a small community like that of Tasmania. Of course, it has been urged that such an industry would be in a position to export its produce to the land. But large stearine works have already been established there, and Tasmania would not be in a position to compete successfully against them. The statement has also been made that the paraffine wax candle industry in the State which I represent employs only a limited number of hands. It . may be my misfortune, but throughout my life I have made it a practice to study the weak and the poor. If my.honourable friends of the Labour Party will adopt a similar course upon this occasion their action will redound to their credit.",43
307,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,How many boys are 'employed in the industry ?,43
308,Mr STORRER,Unknown,"I do not know. I do not go round the factories inquiring as to the class of labour which they employ. But during the course of this debate it has been pointed out that one of the Tasmanian manufacturers was considered good enough to be selected to contest a Senate election as the nominee of the Labour Party. The Government boast that they have accepted 400 of the recommendations of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission. Why, then, do they ignore the conclusion at jvhich that section arrived in respect, to this particular item? I - have been charged with considering this matter from a provincial stand-point, but if any other industry in the Commonwealth occupies a similar position to that of the paraffine wax industry of Tasmania I shall be found supporting it.",43
309,Mr WATSON,Unknown,The 'factories in Tasmania could purchase their paraffine wax from New South Wales.,43
310,Mr STORRER,Unknown,The factories in New South Wales will not supply it.,43
311,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,How does the honourable member account for the great increase which has recently taken place in. the imports of paraffine. wax?,43
312,Mr STORRER,Unknown,"It must be due to the increase of the factories upon the mainland. One honourable member has stated that if those who are engaged in the industry in Tasmania cannot make a livelihood they should abandon it in favour of some other industry. To my mind, this is a cold-blooded way of dealing with the matter. The 'honourable member for Laanecoorie has declared that this is a State matter. But he was very much permainturbed when a suggestion was made that a civil servant from another State should be brought to Melbourne to fill a high position in the Postal Department here. I trust that a duty of Jd. per lb. will be substituted for the"" proposed duty of i d . per lb. One section of the Committee has affirmed that its members will not vote for any higher duty than that recommended by the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission.  ner upon this question?",43
313,Mr STORRER,Unknown,"They are an uncertain quantity. I leave the matter in the hands of the Committee. If honourable members support the Government proposal I shall be very disappointed, because I shall think that they have not acted in a truly Federal spirit. For the sake of insuring justice all round, I trust that the existing duty will be reduced. Question-That the following words be added, "" and on and after 25th October, 1907, per lb., \a\.""

314,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"North Sydney) [8.22] - I am afraid the adoption of this amendment will prevent any prior NOES. amendment, such as the omission of the words, ""cocoa and chocolate.""",44
315,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"If the amendment before us be adopted, no amendment in an earlier portion of the clause can be moved.",44
316,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"Calare> [8.24] - It is"" only due to the Committee that the Treasurer should inform us why Tellers: he makes this proposal now. Why did he not insert ""medicated confectionery"" in» this item when the Tariff was drafted? PAIRS. Sir WILLIAM LYNE-Trea surer) [8.25] - This is an amendment which I have been asked by the Department to move, because medicated confectionery can be included here more appropriately than later on under "" Medicines,""' in which it at present appears, and from which it will be excised, if the presentamendment be adopted.",44
317,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"Perth) [8.26] - It will* be observed that the duty, in the case of item 291,- "" Medicines;"" is entirely different from the duty now proposed by the Treasurer; and I fail to see why medicated preparations should be taxed a.t: the enormous rate applied to confectionery. There are certain well-known medicinal' preparations containing sugar, which, if amendment be carried, will come within the category of confectionery; and I (Gen.) (UK.) think that it is simply monstrous that suchpreparations should be so classified. Poorpeople - may often have to' avail themselves of the simpler forms of medicine; and' I see nojustification for placing upon them what is practically a prohibitiveduty. 3}d. 3^d. Mr. JOSEPH COOK (Parramatta) 25 [8.27] - The Treasurer has not told us that the reason for the transposition, is the imposition of a largely-increased duty. Medicated confectionery, if dealt with in item 291, will bear a duty of 15 per cent., whereas, if the amendment be carried, it will have to bear a duty of, perhaps, 60 or 70 per cent. Medicated confectionery is quite distinct from ordinary confectionery. One class of confectionery is supposed to give a great deal of pleasure, while the other is intended to cure pain of some kind, and is simply a medicine.",44
318,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Trea surer) [8.28] - The honourable member for Parramatta is quite mistaken, because, under whichever item medicated confectionery appears, the duty will be about the same. Under item 291, the medicated confectionery is described as "" troches,"" which would include, for example, cough lozenges; and I am informed by the Comptroller-General, that,- while the duty will be about the same, it is more convenient to collect it under the heading of confectionery.",45
319,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Dalley) [8.29] - There seems a likelihood of this amendment being accepted very quickly, but I warn honourable members that it represents a considerable danger. If the Treasurer had taken the trouble to read the report of the Royal Commission on secret drugs, he would have found that a large and important part deals with what is called medicated confectionery, under cover of which, not only drugs, but alcohol in various disguises, is dispensed. I suppose, however, that the only object of the Treasurer is to get his Tariff through, iand obtain revenue.",45
320,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The amendment - will result in no more revenue.,45
321,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Confectionery , in the ordinary sense, is supposed to be harmless, whereas medicated confectionery may be a most dangerous manufacture. There are - honourable members who, if they had been present, I should have expected to advocate the exclusion from the country of medicated confectionery. It is contended that the drink habit is engendered by the juvenile consumption of sweets in the form of medicated confectionery. Chlorodyne and other dangerous drugs are .made up in this way. Just as in the days of our childhood, a' Gregory powder was administered to us in a spoonful of jam, fo various drugs are - concealed in confectionery. The honourable member for Barrier, who has taken a keen interest in the question of patent medicines, should be able to give us some interesting information on this question, and I think the matter is. one which we should take into serious consideration. Amendment agreed to.  move That after the figures "" 3?d."" the words "" and on and after 25th October, 1907, (General Tariff) per lb. 2d.,"" be inserted. During the discussion of the Tariff reference has been made again and again to the facility for the formation of combines which is afforded by high protective duties, and before granting further protection to any industry we should be careful to .ascertain whether any combine exists in relation to it. I have nothing to say against the confectionery works in Victoria, which I inspected a few days ago, and which I found to be thoroughly up to date; but I have before me a copy of a letter addressed by Mr W. T. Home, secretary to the committee of the retail confectioners, to the editor of the Argus, and published in this morning's issue of that newspaper. Mr Home writes- ' I am desired by the committee of retail confectioners' to place before our legislators and the public the reasons for and against the increase in duty on confectionery. The proposal is the outcome of efforts put forth by the local manufacturers for many months past, and when the present tariff was announced it came as a surprise .upon an unorganised body of shopkeepers who had to face the strongest combination of manufacturing confectioners Victoria has yet seen, backed up by a bank balance so substantial 'that opposition seemed almost hopeless. Mr W. Bowman, whom we have to thank for voicing our side through your columns,- has shown"" ("" The Argus,"" October 15) that all manufacturers but one had joined the combine, the smallest being required under the constitution to pay £1 0 entrance fee, an'd a subscription of 2^ per cent, weekly upon this, eciual to £ 1 3 per annum. This is not a ordinary trade association, and its constitution proves that it will be almost impossible for any' new manufacturer to commence business, unless be becomes a member, and the combine reserves to itself the right to refuse admission. Turning from the power and financial strength of the combine to the industry itself, we claim to have shown very conclusively that the progress made by manufacturers is proof that under 'the former tariffthey were amply protected. In the progress report of the recent Tariff Commission (page 8), in spite of decreases shown, in Queensland and Western Australia, figures are given showing that the whole number - of factories in the Commonwealth increased in six years (1899-1904) from 71 to 79, and the number of hands employed from 1,845 to, 2,418. Since the last date given, a still more striking proof of the progress made is found in the report of the chief inspector of factories (Victoria), issued in May I do not think it is necessary to read the whole of the letter. It contains a direct charge that a combine exists amongst certain manufacturers in the confectionery industry in this State. I intend to make an effort to show that such a combine exists. I shall begin by reading a letter written by Messrs. Bennett and Taylor, importers and wholesale confectioners, and published in the Argus of 25th September.",45
322,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,Unknown,"Importers ?  singular that as soon as one attempts to quote evidence from any one, save a manufacturer, it is suggested that no reliance can be placed upon it"". The writers of this letter did not hesitate to append their names to it. I have often heard my friends, and"" especially members of the Labour Party, assert that it is dangerous for a man to put his name to a charge against a body of men, because it often results in his being "" boycotted. labour man knows that it is more than many a man dare do. The letter is as follows- . In your issue of yesterday a-nnears a statement by Mr MACRobertson, denying altogether that there is a Confectionery Combine, or that anything - in the nature of such exists. On or about the gth August, we, by request, waited on the Secretary of the Chamber of Manufacturers with reference to a document which we wereasked to sign under threat of being refused local goods. In this document was embodied a clause binding those who signed to procure all their requirements for the' confectionery trade, only through members of the Victorian Manufacturing Confectionery Association. As, at one stroke, this would rob us of a considerable portion of our business, we refused to sign. On the evening of August 14th we again attended by request at the Chamber of Manufactures, and had the matter further threshed out, with the result that the association gave way with regard to oversea importations, but absolutely prohibited shipment from Sydney, even insisting that we must cancel all contract with New South Wales. This action alone proves the incorrectness of Mr MACRobertson's statement, and is conclusive evidence of an existing Combine. Additional proofs to the above facts of the working of a very real and live Combine will be given at the proper time and place. Yours, & c , (Signed) BENNETT AND TAYLOR. I have in my possession a copy of the constitution of the Combine, which is known as the Victorian Manufacturing ConfecAlthough tioners' Association.",46
323,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"It has been circulated by the people concerned.  public property, it is unnecessary for me to read the whole document, but I shall quote from it certain clauses which to my mind disclose a state of affairs to which an end ought to be put. Under clause 5 it is provided that:5. Any Member breaking or failing to observe any of the rules of the Association for the time being in force shall be liable to expulsion by the resolution of the Association. That bears out the statement made in the letter written by Messrs. Bennett and Taylor. It is also provided that five members shall form a quorum, that rules may be rescinded or varied, and that a member may be expelled. Under clause 3 of the general rules it is provided thatThe names and addresses of. all middlemen,, wholesale merchants, and special customers shall be registered by the Association, and it shall be considered an infringement of the Association's rules for members to supply other parties than - those who are registered at the Every prices allowed by the Association's rules for middlemen, wholesale retailers, merchants, and special customers. Clause 4 provides that the prices of goods and discounts as fixed by the association are the minimum prices and the maximum discounts, and must be strictly adhered to by members of the association. It is further provided thatIn the case of Middlemen, Wholesale Retailers, Merchants, or special customers not selling at the Association's list or exceeding their discounts or acting against the interests of this Association, the said Association has the power to eliminate the said Middlemen, Wholesale Retailers, Merchants or special customers from the registration roll. 6. 'Every Member shall charge the respective rates and charges and adhere to the terms and conditions which may be agreed to by resolution from time to time, and shall not be at liberty to depart from them in any way. Subject thereto, no discount, no money gratuity, and no advantage direct or indirect shall be offered or allowed by any member or his agent or employee to any customer or other person in connection with the sale of Confectionery. 7. The Association shall be entitled to call upon any Member or any employee of any Member to make a statutory declaration that the declarant has not directly or indirectly evaded these Rules, and may also insist upon such Declarant giving details as to price or prices charged and other particulars which may in the opinion of the Association be deemed expedient or desirable. I am reading from copies, I have seen one of the originals, and I am informed that there are persons who are prepared to come forward to produce them, and, if necessary, to support by testimony on oaTh every statement that I am making. An agreement was made between the middlemen and the Association in which the members of the latter sayThat upon the Middlemen entering into the under-mentioned Agreement with the Victorian Manufacturing Confectioners' Association, the Members of the Association will supply Authorised Middlemen with their Confectionery, as heretofore. They will also undertake' to supply them with Imported Confectionery, as far as can be obtained at the time of ordering. They allow 15 per cent. On their part the middlemen sayWe, the undersigned middlemen, hereby undertake to adhere strictly to undermentioned terms and conditions, and will abide by all Rules, Regulations, and Conditions, as may' be made from time to time by the Victorian .Manufacturing Confectioners' AssociationThat we will only sell to Retail Shopkeepers. That we will not charge less than such price or prices as may be fixed, by the Victorian Manufacturing Confectioners' Association from time to time. That we will not allow a greater discount than 2jr per cent.",46

Sirs, As a Retail Confectioner, I protest against the increase of Duties on Confectionery, for the following reasons :That I shall have to bear the extra burden, for the position is such that I cannot charge the Public the extra duties, and I have no hesitation in saying that by allowing imported Confectionery to come in on a fair duty, the local manufacturers will be able to make progress in the future as they have amply done in the past on a duty of id., and 2d. per lb. For example, similar goods that are sold to shop-keepers in England at rod. per lb. and are retailed to the Public there at i d . per oz., are made by the leading firms here, and are sold, to us at is. 3d. per lb., which we have to' retail at 2d. per oz., or 2s. per lb. This shows that the Public of Australia are already very heavily handicapped and the shop-keeoers here are in a worse position than those in England, for we have not got the population to work on. our rents are higher, cost of gas over 100 per cent, more, and many other things . are in keeping with those mentioned. The following are also some of the troubles that I have had to contend with :1. Short weight in the boxes. This was so glaringly rampant that though I complained to the traveller 'about it , and he to the firm, it still went on, and I then brought into' the shop my large scales, and weighed the boxes in front of the carters, and required them to put the gross weight on the boxes, and initial them, and when empty I again weighed the boxes to ascertain the nett weight received. The traveller told me there was trouble about my delaying the carters, and that I was to weigh them myself, and what was short he .would always (and did) allow me for.' (I pity the shop-keeper who was not sharp enough to find out the above.)",47
326,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,"What firm supplied the short-weight boxes?  say positively, but I think that it was MACRobertson. Mr Bruce SMITH.""-If the honourable member does not know definitely, he ought not to make that statement.  sire to ascertain who supplied short-weight boxes, they can very easily do so, because the author of this letter is prepared to give sworn evidence, if necessary, and the same remark is applicable to his wife. The we document continuesAnother grievance- A friend of mine was paying 7d. per lb. for a line and I was being charged 8d. per lb. for the same line, same that aspect of the matter. quality, and by the same traveller. In another case I was paving is. 3d. per lb. for a line, a combine. but another. friend of mine was being charged is. 5d. per lb. for the same line, from the same firm, but not the same traveller. .Another, fair practice-Certain lines of toffy. at lb. are put up in tins, which tins .weigh a lb. The gross weight is charged, but only 6d. is allowed for the empty t in ; thus the shopkeepers lose 2d. or more on every tin, if they have not discovered this trick. Then again, the discount has been (and I have every reason to believe is still) a source of great complaint. I have been getting 5 per cent., but J find some have - been getting 10 per cent., and some 15 - per cent., whilst one lady who signed our petition to Parliament showed me invoices (two of which I now hold as evidence) on which she received no discount at all ; yet we, as retail confectioners, are asked to trust these firms who are craving for more protection, which will, if carried, .injure us still further, and penalize the public. I think I have said enough to warrant the Minister of Trade and Customs in postponing the consideration of this' item.",49
327,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,He has left the chamber.  courtesy which he extends to me. Since I commenced to - fight the . excessive duties levied under this Tariff T have had nothing but 'insults from the Minister - Upon the first occasion that I spoke he told me that I ought to cross to the other side of the chamber. To-night I arm endeavouring to defend the interests of the thousands of persons throughout the Commonwealth who retail confectionery in a small way.

The honourable member's experience of the way in which the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act has been allowed to become a dead letter should be sufficient to convince hirm of that. He knows perfectly well that,- owing to the negligence of the Government in failing to put into operation the provisions of that Statute, a number of trade unions are being ruined.

334,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,"The Employers' Federation is not permitted to fine anybody nowadays. It was able to do so ""at one time. It is singularly amusing to hear these violent onslaughts upon combines emanating from persons who are members of the biggest combine in the country. I admit that the formation of combines is typical of the spirit of modern trading. Of course, our object must be to so regulate the operations of such bodies as to vent them from robbing the retailer and the public. I had previously read all the statements which the honourable member for Grey has placed before the Committee this evening. I dare say that there may have been excessive combination on the part of confectionery, but now that the matter has been ventilated, there is not much risk of any further injury being inflicted upon the retailers. The petition which I presented to this House, and which was signed by 744 confectionery retailers, constitutes a strong indictment of the methods which have hitherto been followed by 'the .manufacturers of confectionery. But now that they realise that the retailers are combining against them, it ' is very probable that if their methods are continued they will have the worse of the deal.",50
335,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,What can the retai lers do if we exclude imports ?,50
336,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,"They can combine and refuse to sell the goods of the manufacturers-. The confectionery industry is a very valuable one, and one which every civilized community desires to encourage. There is no doubt that the manufacturers of Australia are gradually getting this industry into their own hands. In 1905"". the number of people employed in the confectionery trade in Victoria was. 797, whereas in 1906 the number was 1,043, which shows a very satisfactory increase. In 1899 the number of manufactories in the Commonwealth was 71, whereas in 1904 the number was 79, while the number of hands had increased in the same period from 1,845 t 0 2,418.",50
337,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,That was under the old duty.,50
338,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,"Yes . We do not desire to see any great increase in the price that the public have to pay for confectionery, but' at the same time, it is satisfactory to know that the local manufacturers are gradually obtaining the Australian market. In 1906 the importations of ordinary confectionery into the Commonwealth amounted to only 3,000,184 lbs., representing a value of £116,000. This, in comparison with the total consumption in Australia, is a very inconsiderable figure.",50
339,Mr GROOM,Unknown,The importations have been gradually increasing.,50
340,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,"Importation s have slightly increased, as is shown by the repre- turns, and I cannot find any reliable information as to what the local production really is. However, the local manufacturers aregetting the market, especially for the lower-priced articles, though some progress has yet to be made in regard to the more valuable confectionery, such as chocolate creams and so forth.",50
341,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,What is the reason the local manufacturers cannot get the market for chocolate creams?,51
342,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,"I cannot say, but we are told that it is because the i local manufacturers have not the proper sort machinery.",51
343,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,It is want of capital.,51

346,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,"Who are largely children. We have also to remember that the cost of raw materials, such as glucose anda considerable number of essences, which are to a great extent imported, is increased by the present Tariff; and that, 'to my mind, justifies more protection to our local manufacturers.",51

We must also remember that there is a high Tariff on sugar in Australia, whereas in Great Britain the manufacturers may obtain cheap sugar from Germany and other countries, where large bounties are granted. This places the Australian manufacturers in a very fair position. In Canada, a country which is similarly situated to Australia, the duty on confectionery is from 3|d. to 6d. per lb., but, of course, Canada has face the competition of the United States, and therefore, must have a high Tariff order to protect her industries.

However, this is one of the industries which I think ought to supply the whole of the requirements of and Mr HENRY WILLIS - Will the proposed conduty increase the price to the consumer?",51
355,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,"I should set my face very strongly against any duty which would increase the price to the consumer. There has been a great deal of discussion on that point; and, from the Melbourne Argus of 30th August, I see that Mr. MACRobertson has said that his prices have been increased by only i \ per cent., and that he justifies the increase by contending that his raw materials have been enhanced in cost by the Tariff. On the other hand, a statement has been made that Mr MacRobertson'sprices have increased in some instances by 33 per cent., and, under such circumstances) a poor unfortunate member Parliament is naturally inclined to say, David, that "" all. men are liars."" In a debate of this sort we cannot enter into all the details of this industry; and I ' greatly deplore the absence of the honourable member for Bendigo, who would have been able to throw a great deal of light on the subject. In the absence of that honorunable member, we have to do the best we can. In my opinion, this is an industry which ought to supply the whole, or, at any rate, the greater part of the Australian to demand; and I shall favour an increase of duty. I cannot go so far as the Goin vernment propose, because the duty which they submit is in the nature of prohibition; I would impose a duty of 2jd. per lb. as against Great Britain, and 3d. per as against other nations. That I regard as a fair compromise, and if I get of an opportunity later, I shall move in that direction.",51
356,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"That is 50 per \a\. cent, more than the duty recommended by 1901. the honourable member for Bendigo.",51

358,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,We have the results - of his inquiry.,52
359,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,"But in some cases those results are somewhat meagre, and this is one of the cases. The confectionery industry is a good, clean industry which ought to receive the benefits of protection. It is an industry in which the people here may engage, we hope, with profit, and one which may even attract people from across the seas.",52
360,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,There is no doubt that the honourable member is a protectionist !,52
361,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,"I always have been a protectionist, and I see no reason to change my opinion - We desire to have industries of every kind in Australia, so . that we may have a thriving population. I would sooner see people in country occupations ; and I hope we may hear something from the Government about immigration.",52
362,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,Unde r the high Victorian duties population was driven away.,52
363,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,"I do not think so; on the contrary, I think it was a. certain amount of protection which kept the people within the State; and I am very glad fo find that we are now becoming suppliers to the Commonwealth.

The honourable member has placed before the Committee information furnished to him by one side of the trade, and I candidly admit that I have been supplied with certain facts by a member of the Manufacturers Association, who, I do not forget, stood by one of the employees of the Confectioners' Union when other employers tried to boycott him.  Association sent to the Crown Law Department is not that .vyhich I read, but a later one ",52

If the Manufacturers Association have committed a breach of our Anti-Trust legislation, it will be open to the Crown Law Department to take action. They were not afraid to put their agreement before the Department. We all know that the importers are anxious not to lose any part of their trade, and they would naturally do their utmost to prevent the expansion of an Australian industry. It has been said that this industry is holding its own. I have taken from the Customs returns the imports for 1904-5-6, and find that, whereas the imports of confectionery in 1904 totalled 2,724,000 lbs., 2,729,000 lbs. were imported in 1905, and 3,237,000 lbs. in 1906. Milk chocolate is a line which has displaced, to a large extent, ordinary confectionery, and I find that the imports of cocoa and chocolate in 1904 were 2,449,000 l b s . ; in 1905, 2,821,000 l b s . ; and in 1906, no less than 3,355,000 lbs.

The honourable member for Grey quoted a letter written by Mr Home, Secretary to the Retail Confectioners' Committee, which appeared in this morning's issue of the Argus, and which contains an absolutely misleading statement as to the state of affairs disclosed by the report of the Victorian Chief Inspector of Factories. I took the trouble this afternoon to compare the figures quoted by Mr. Home with those given in the report of the Chief Inspector of Factories, and found that an attempt had been made fo mislead us.

The honourable member for Denison told us this afternoon the lot of them. it was understood at the inception of the Commonwealth that under the Federal existing industries Would be conand .that the duties relating to them would not be cut down. I believe althat in pre-Federation days, the duty on confectionery under every State Tariff higher than that imposed under the first Tariff. In some States a duty of 4d. per lb. prevailed, while in others duties of 3d. and 2d. per lb. were in operation. Under the first Federal Tariff, however, the duties on confectionery were reduced to 2d. per lb., and on cocoa and chocolate to i d . perlb.

I am as anxious as is any honourable member that a combine shall not impose unfair conditions upon the retailers, but I would be last to say that manufacturers have not much right to band together as I have to join in a trade union with those who work with me.

At page 568 of volume II . of the Minutes of Evidence will be found the following questionAlthough you come before this Commission and ask us to recommend the reduction of duties on sugar and glucose you yesterday reduced the price of this jube jube by 3^d. a lb.

380,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"The honourable member should read what follows"", to show why the price was reduced.",54
381,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I was about to do so. The explanation is that we had to compete with others, and had to sell at the same price.",54
382,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,An attempt' was being made to cut out some one else.,54
383,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The evidence continuesWhat others?-Othe r manufacturers. In Victoria?-Yes , in Victoria.

On the next page I find this evidenceWhat was the price before the reduction?is. n d . per lb. Are you losing on it?-We do not hope to lose much on it, because we have bought material cheaper than we used to buy it, and we are able to turn out more than we were formerly. We must increase the output, or it would not pay us. There are about 300 lines of confectionery altogether, and prices have been increased in regard to about thirty of them. We have been told that the price of chocolate dates has been increased, but we were not told, as we should have been, that the duty on dates has been increased from i d . to 2d. per lb. Apparently the manufacturers are expecting to pay that increase, instead of passing it on.",54
384,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,The protectionists that it is never passed on.,54

390,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,I do not know it.,54
391,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I believe that not one-fourth of the cocoa butter which is used is produced locally. Starch is also used for the making of jelly moulds, and on it there is a duty of 22s. per cwt. There is also a duty on walnuts and other raw materials which I will not now specify. ' Prior to Federation, in New South Wales, the duty on confectionery, cocoa and chocolate, and sugar candy, was i d . ; in South Australia, 3d. j in Queensland, 4 d . ; in Tasmania, 2d. on confectionery, 4d. on cocoa and chocolate, and 2d. on sugar candy; in Western Australia, 4d. on confectionery, nothing on cocoa and chocolate, and 4d. on sugar candy; and in ""Victoria, 2d. on confectionery, 3d. on cocoa and chocolate, and 4d. on sugai candy; the rates in the Kingston Tariff being 2d. for confectionery, i d . for cocoa and chocolate, and 2d. for sugar candy, or lowerthan the average of the rates for the six States. The honourable member for Denison said this afternoon that the industries which were in existence prior, to Federation should receive as much protection now as they, did under the State Tariffs. In today's Argus, notwithstanding the footnote to similar correspondence in yesterday's issue, "" This correspondence is now closed,"" a letter appears which has obviously been inserted because it was thought that the debate on the confecsay tionery duties would almost certainly come on today, and there would be no opportunity to reply to it.

399,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,And the honourable member was ready to counter him immeber diately.,55
400,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I am always ready to fight for an Australian industry. I hold in my hand a letter from Mr. Davis, Chairman of the Victorian MiddleWhile men's Association, which is addressed the Chairman of the Victorian Manufacturing Confectioners' Association, and which . readsDear Sir, In this morning's Argus I notice under the heading of "" Confectionery Combine"" that the secretary of the Committee of Retail Confec-' tioners states that the middlemen were forced P "" to sign the agreement with the Manufacturing er Association against their own free will. He also "" challenges the Combine to name one middleman who accepted their condiof his own free will . "" In reply to this I would like to say that my Association views with favour the agreement entered into, and believes that it is beneficial to the lewhole trade-manufacturers , middlemen, and retailers. The agreement in question has matebenefited the position of middlemen, as they are now on an equal footing with the direct of the manufacturers, knowing that all prices are equal. In conclusion, I would of say, on behalf of mv Association, that we were not forced into signing any agreement that we thought detrimental to our figures own or the trade's interests. Mr Home, in the course of his letter to the Argus, saysI know from experience that lines usually retailed at 6d. will not sell at 6£d. or 7d., nor 3d. lines if raised to 3^d. or 4d. Confectionery sold at 4 ozs. for 6d. can only be altered to 3 ozs. for 6d., and this adds Sd. per lb. to cost to consumer, which is regarded, as excessive. What does that mean? Four ozs. for 6d. is equivalent to 2s. per lb. For that class of confectionery, the retailers would not pay more than is. 6d. per lb. They would thus make a profit of 33 per cent, upon their outlay. But if the price be increased by 2d. per lb., they say that they must make a profit of 8d. per lb.",55
401,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,It is quite clear that the consumer must'suffer.,55

411,Mr WILKS,Unknown,The last sentence to the for addendum of the Tariff Commission as to the use of glucose in confectionery readsEvidence was also piven showing that both paraffine wax and plaster of paris occasionally enter into the composition of confectionery.,56
412,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,Does not that refer to chewing gum only?,56
413,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"I cannot say. There is no doubt that confectionery is wonderfully and mysteriously made; and if we knew all the details, I am afraid that we should eat very little of it. The honourable member for Grey spoke of a combine; but let me say that Mr Stedman, one of the largest manufacturers in New South Wales, has stated openly that he does not require any beyond that of 2d. per lb. all round.",56
414,Mr COON,Unknown,Did Mr Stedman give reaevidence before the Tariff Commission?,56
415,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"No ; and the reason was that he did not require any increase of the duty. The honourable member for Batman, who is no child of innocence in business, has ingeniously interjected a question as to Mr Stedman's not giving evidence be the Tariff Commission. The fact is that he did not come forward as an interested party and ask for an increase of duty, being satisfied with the profits he is making-and all the more credit to him for ' the attitude he The honourable member for of Yarra did not deny the statements of the member for Grey in regard to the existence of a combine in this industry. I do not desire to deal with the question of combines generally; but I remind honhe orable members that we were promised by the Government a measure of new protection under which combines or individuals who misused the Tariff for their own ends could be deaTt with. In my opinion, the new protection proposals ought to be introduced at once, because they would form a guide to many honourable members in their dealing with the Tariff proposals now before us. As a matter of fact, the immediate introduction of the new protection proposals would be the best way of securing a speedy dealing with the Tariff. As an ardent free-trader, I can say that I should not occupy much time in dealing with the proposed duties if I were certain that the benefits would be equally distributed amongst the manufacturer, the wage earner, and the consumer ",56
416,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I am amazed at the Labour Party voting duties pntil they have seen the new protection proposals.,57
417,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Quite so. Why should I be asked to vote for high duties before I know what the new proposals are? I suggest to the honourable member for Grey' and others that they "" stick up"" the Tariff until the Government have shown what they mean by their new protection. Personally, I should help in such a movement; and I am astonisFed that the more ardent spirits of the Opposition have not endeavoured to force the Hand of the Government in this connection.",57
418,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I was the first to raise the protest.,57
419,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"That is so; but what I am suggesting is resistance to the Tariff until the new protection pioposals have been introduced, because it would be most unfortunate if the high duties proposed were adopted, and the Government got into recess without their scheme of new protection having been dealt with. The honourable member for Fawkner frankly said that he was a Victorian, and that he desired the confectionery trade to be captured by the manufacturers of his own State. What a truly ""noble and Federal spirit! I do not ""desire to see any State obtain any special advantage from the Tariff; and in view of the attitude taken up by Mr Stedman, to which I have already referred, I am prepared to vote for a duty of 2d. per lb. all 'round, with, of course/a preference to Great Britain in whatever proportion honourable members may desire. The honourable member for Fawkner was most unfortunate in his reference to the importation of the bountyfed sugar of Germany into England. A few days ago the honourable member received .rather a severe castigation at the hands of the Melbourne Age, and I can only suppose that he is now endeavouring to put himself right, and desires to 'obtain a panegyric as a thorough Victorian protectionist. In Germany the people are taxed in order to produce bountyfed sugar for export to England, to be there converted into confectionery, which is sent to Germany to undersell the German manufacturers.",57
420,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,And shorter hours are worked in England.,57
421,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Quite so; and that is an answer to those who say that the confectionery of Great Britain is made by means of cheap labour, which competes with the more highly paid labour of Australia. English labour in this connection competes not only with the highly paid labour of Australia, but with the low paid labour of Germany. I may say that I have refused, on this or any other item, to receive any technical information from manufacturers, .importers, or importers' agents, preferring to rely entirely on the results of the inquiries of the tariff Commission. On this item there is no difference of opinion between the two sections of that Commission, because both recommend a duty of 2d. per lb. all round. Personally, I am astonished that the Commission should have recommended a specific instead of an ad valorem duty - I cannot understand why low priced confectionery should bear as heavy a duty as the higher priced articles. I intend to vote for the adoption of the recommendation of the Tariff Commission, with a reservation in regard to preference to Great Britain. The honourable member for Yarra has said that he is prepared to do certain things. I ask him to assist us to stick up this Government until they introduce a Bill embodying their new protection proposals. If honourable members did that they would expedite .the progress of the Tariff,- and would have an .opportunity of fixing in legislative form measures which we all agree are necessary to counterbalance the weakness occasioned by the imposition of . high duties.",57
422,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"North Sydney) [10.26] - The honourable member for Fawkner has said that the duties charged on confectionery in Canada are from 4d. to 6d. per lb. He gave that as a reason why we should impose, if not so large a duty as that, at any rate one larger than that proposed by the' honourable member for Grey. But I wish to point out that the information given by the honourable member for Fawkner was incorrect, alsiderable though no doubt he believed what he said. I have in my; hand the 1906 edition of Canadian Tariff, from which I find that the preferential duty on confectionery is 22 per cent. On the basis of the valuation the confectionery imported into last year, that percentage would about 2d. per lb. The intermediate duty in Canada is 32 per cent., and what is 1 called the general Tariff duty is 35 cent. I correct the statement of the honorknows able member for Fawkner so that others may not be induced by the supposed Canadian example to vote for higher duties are warranted. It has .been urged honourable member for Yarra that there is good reason for increasing the confectionery duties because many of the ingredients used are now to have higher duties imposed upon them. In reply, I point out that the duties on the important ingredients of confectionthe ery have not been increased. The duties on sugar and glucose are the same as they were previously.",57
423,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I suppose the duty on plaster of paris has been increased ?,58
424,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I hope fits that that will not be used as an ingredient of edible confectionery. As to the minor items which are used, I point out that .we have not yet reached them in the Tariff, and ifwe think that the duties on I them ought not to be advanced we imipose can vote against increases. There is no duty in this Tariff that can be less legitimately supported than the one der consideration. Unless we are going to adopt the attitude that we should not merely have protection but should actually shovel public money into the pockets those who are members of the Confectionery Combine, we ought to take up some stand. Certainly we ought not to give to industries that are already doing remarkably well, and in which the wages paid are good whilst profits are excellent, the benefit of increased duties. The only result can be to put more money into the pockets of a few individuals. Surely we are not going tion. to allow the people of this country charged rates that are entirely unnecessary. There is no better evidence of the increased prosperity of the confectionery trade than the number of hands employed. When we find an industry practically doubled it must be apparent that its progress is satisfactory. Any one who is acquainted with those conthat cerned in it is. aware that it is a very fitable tra'de. To my own knowledge confortunes have been made in it during the last twenty or twenty-five years. the One of the largest manufacturers of confectionery in Australia, whom I know to be a very honest man, plainly told the Tariff 1 of Commission in his evidence that he did not Australia require increased duties. amount to .

Whatever duties we impose, there will still be imports, for reason that it does not pay to go to the expense of erecting machinery to manufacture the more fanciful kinds of confectionery, of which the consumption is comparatively small. The honourable member for Yarra has himself admitted the prosperous condition of the trade. It yields good proto those engaged in it and pays good wages to the workers. Honourable members who require evidence of the strength of the industry have only to refer to the document quoted by the honourable member for Grey. f the manufacturers are strong enough to such terms on a large body of vendors they need no additional protection. Those who require protection are the people unupon whom such terms are imposed, and who if they could would defend themselves by importing goods from abroad, although they could not do so because the late of duties excluded. If I were a trader I would rather go out of business than sign such an agreement as that which has been quoted. But I think that I should be able to avoid that contingency by formthe ing a combination of vendors who would vastly manufacture their own supplies.",58
427,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"That is co-operato be . Mr DUGALD THOMSON - It is not in the ordinary sense of the term, but even if it were I do not object to it. The vendors, and especially those in a large way of business, would be able by organizing to establish their own factory, and to refuse to submit to such an agreement as which the Manufacturers' Association prohave called upon-them to sign. The best evidence of the strength of the industry, and the sufficiency of the protection it received under the old Tariff, is that the manufacturers here are able to make the retailers sign such an agreement, and to bring them to their feet. It cannot be said that the industry is afraid of foreign competition. If it were, it would not dare to insist upon such an agreement. That being so, it svould be absolute folly to grant additional protection to it.",58

429,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I do not, but if we grant this enormous increase the protection afforded the industry, it will be able to obtain higher prices from the distributors, who in turn will be forced to pass on to the consumer the increased charges. We were assured by some able members when the elections in New South Wales were in progress that when output ? we reached the schedule of duties many changes would be made, in order that the public should not be penalized, as ' vernment proposed. A ow is the time for them to give some evidence of their deterbour mination to make some modifications. Coning fectionery is used by all sections of the community, and every additional penny which we impose means largely increased taxation. We want evidence that these year. excessive duties, against which the kick, will be reduced.",59
430,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The people do kick, it is only the Opposition.",59
431,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Thos e to justify honourable members who took part in the recent general election in New South Wales know very well that the people of that State complain of the new Tariff. They were told by some of the members in the Ministerial corner that the Tariff was be regarded as having been accepted by the Parliament, and that many items would reduced. There is no reason for the creased duty on confectionery, except that duties have been imposed on some the minor articles used in its manufacture, and since we can deal with those duties when we reach them, I fail to see whyi honourable members should be prepared support this impost. The Tariff Commiswere sion recommended the old duty. It must be remembered also that in applying a of 2d. to edible cocoas and chocolates, which were under the i d . rate, we are grsnting a very considerable infacturers, crease of protection to the industry. As gotten. to the new protection, it was admitted by the leader of the Labour Party that it. would be very difficult for the proposed Board to deal with prices. The honourable member for Yarra has already said that the wages paid in this industry are satisfactory, and that being so, the new protection will have no effect upon it. It would be practically impossible to deal with the selling prices;",59
432,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Our imports of confectionery should be decreasing, instead",59

Honourable members cannot judge by one Even if this high duty be people imposed, we shall continue to have a large importation. There are certain not lines of fancy confectionery the demand for which in Australia is not large enough the erection of special machinery for its production. The manufacturers in most cases are importers;' they import the fancy confectionery, which it will not pay them to produce locally. Are we to impose a heavy duty on all confectionery in not to order that fancy lines may be made here? If .we do so, we shall enormously increase be the cost to the consumer.

I wonder that, strong protectionist though he is, he has gone so far, beyond even the Kingston Tariff and the recornrnendations of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, in proposing rates which are altogether unjustifiable, and which will cause the public to be heavily mulcted because of the opportunity they give to the manufacturers to combine to increase prices.
