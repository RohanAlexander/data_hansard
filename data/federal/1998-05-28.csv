2,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Taxation Laws Amendment (Landcare and Water Facility Tax Offset) Amendment Bill 1998 contains provisions which give effect to commitments in the government's election statement, Reviving the Heartland, to 'give farmers a choice between accelerated deductions for Landcare works under subdivisions 387-A and 387-B of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (the act) or a tax rebate/credit set at the marginal tax rate of 34c in the dollar for qualifying expenditure'. This is a significant initiative as part $1.25 billion Natural Heritage Trust to deliver the government's objective of repairing past land and water degradation and achieving a faster, more effective shift to sustainable agriculture in Australia. Importantly, it provides an incentive for land-holders to invest in works which are needed to ensure their future in agriculture and rehabilitate Australia's natural environment. The government's policy objective in implementing the landcare and water conserving and conveying facility rebate is to assist low income farmers who, because of their low incomes, are most in need of assistance to invest in landcare works. Subdivisions 387-A and 387-B of the act contain provisions which allow certain taxpayers to claim income tax deductions for landcare expenditure and for expenditure on conserving and conveying of water respectively. Low income farmers who have a low effective tax rate have a much smaller incentive to invest in such works compared with higher income farmers who are likely to have a higher effective tax rate. This bill introduces an alternative tax rebate for low income farmers so as to improve their incentive to invest in landcare works. Taxpayers with taxable incomes of up to $20,700 a year will have the alternative of claiming a tax rebate in relation to eligible expenditure incurred from the start of the 1997-98 income year. There is a maximum rebate of $1,700, based on expenditure of $5,000, for expenditure in a particular year that would otherwise be tax deductible under each of subdivisions 387-A and 387-B. This means the rebate can be claimed for up to $10,000 of eligible expenditure in any year if there is expenditure of $5,000 under each subdivision. The rebate for landcare expenditure is claimable in full in the year of the expenditure. This matches the treatment of the income tax deduction for such expenditure available under subdivision 387-A. The rebate for expenditure on facilities for water conservation and conveyance is claimable equally over the three years beginning with the year of the expenditure. This matches the treatment of the income tax deduction for such expendiof the ture available under subdivision 387-B. In circumstances where taxpayers have chosen to take the rebate but have an insufficient income tax liability with which to absorb it, they will be able to carry forward the unused portion of their rebate. No taxpayers will be adversely affected by this measure. This proposed rebate provides an incentive for those taxpayers whose low taxable incomes would reduce the benefit of deductions to undertake new landcare and water conserving and conveying works. The economic benefit they can derive from the rebate reducing their tax liability can substantially exceed the benefit of taking income tax deductions at their marginal tax rate. The government has set aside funding of $80 million over four years for the rebate. This funding will come from the Natural Heritage Trust fund. There will be no additional compliance costs imposed on those taxpayers who wish to claim the rebate instead of the deductions otherwise available to them. They will simply have to maintain records of expenditure in the same manner as for the deductions. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Melham) adjourned. NA (FARM MANAGEMENT DEPOSITS) First Reading Bill presented by Mr Bruce Scott, for Anderson, and read a first time. Second Reading",13
3,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill establishes the farm management deposits scheme. The bill introduces an important element of the government's inteand grated rural policy strategy to build a comreporting petitive, sustainable and profitable rural sector. The government's new Agricultureits Advancing Australia initiative is the first attempt in many years to comprehensively address the range of issues facing rural Austees tralia. This scheme delivers on a major comof deposits. mitment given by the coalition at the last election. Extensive consultation with state and territory governments, farmer groups, financial institutions and the public has contributed significantly in shaping the measures introduced today. The initiatives in this bill have received widespread endorsement from key farming bodies such as the National Farmers Federation and from the financial sector, including the Australian Bankers Association The farm management deposit, FMD, scheme enhances and expands the previous income equalisation deposit,IED, and farm management bond, FMB, schemes operated by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. This bill has been carefully designed to meet the coalition's long standing desire to encourage increased financial self-reliance among farmers, while also taking account of the high variability of farm income streams and the vulnerability of farming businesses to natural events. Mr Speaker, the bill takes the operation of the FMD scheme out of government hands and commercialises it. The FMD scheme will be a tax-linked financial risk management tool that allows farmer taxpayers to transfer income between high income and low income years. The government's aim is to improve primary producers' capacity to manage finanBILL 1998 cial fluctuations caused by environmental and market conditions. It helps them do this by allowing them to set aside considerable cash Mr reserves earned during high income years for use in a low income year, in a tax effective way. Financial institutions are likely to offer a range of products, providing farmers with choice as well as increased flexibility in their investment decisions. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) will be asking the Department of Primary Industries and Energy the Australian Taxation Office to ensure arrangements are in place so that the scheme retains its integrity and can achieve objectives. The restriction of the scheme to prudentially controlled deposit taking institutions or those with government guaranon the deposits will increase the security The key features of the enhanced FMD scheme will be: A limit on holdings in the scheme of $300,000 per taxpayer; The investment component will be set at 100 per cent on the entire balance-this means interest will be able to be earned on the whole deposit which has been made out of pre-tax income; - currently the investment component is only 61 per cent for IEDs; Eligibility will be restricted to primary producers with a taxable non-primary production income of not more than $50,000; The scheme will be commercialised and delivered through financial institutions, making it far easier for farmers to make deposits and withdrawals; Investors will be. able to elect only institution with which to hold deposits, however, this institution may be changed any time; Financial institutions will pay an interest rate determined in the market; Deposits will be fully tax deductible in the year of deposit and taxable in the year of withdrawal; There will be a minimum deposit period 12 months; Interest will be taxable in the income it is earned; On withdrawal 20 per cent of the amount withdrawn will be deducted for tax purjourned. poses but this deduction may be exempted if the depositor demonstrates to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy that he or she is in serious financial difficulties; As with current arrangements, FMDs will not be available to companies, partnerships, although individual beneficiaries of trusts and individual members of partnerships will be able to use them. rEDs and FMBs have, to date, had a low rate of uptake, mainly because they have been inflexible and not commercially attractive tax effective. Some $222 million is currently invested by more than 6,600 people in lEDs and $110 million by more than 3,300 people in FMBs. Primary producers with existing lED or FMB accounts will be able to transfer them to FMDs with no loss of tax benefits. The revised conditions in the new FMD scheme, including its commercial nature, larger investment component and flexibility withdrawals, should secure an increased uptake of the new scheme. This is appropriate as the aim of the package is to encourage more farmers to use such deposits to manage risk. The government will be closely monitorready ing the operation of the scheme; in particular the interest rates offered by financial instituhealth tions and the fees and charges they levy FMD accounts. The Income Equalisation Deposits (Interest Adjustment) Act 1984 applied only to interest payments made under the lED scheme during the period 29 June 1984 to 22 November for their hospitals. one 1984 inclusive. All relevant periods for amendment or appeal processes relating to at that time period have expired. The bill repeals the Income Equalisation Deposits (Interest Adjustment) Act 1984 as it has become redundant. Mr Speaker, today really is a great day for the primary industries and energy portfolio. The farm management deposit scheme and the new financial risk management capability it of offers will be of great benefit to the farm sector. I have great pleasure in commending year the bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Melham) adHEALTH CARE (APPROPRIATION) BILL 1998 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Warwick Smith, and trusts or read a first time. Second Reading",14
4,Mr WARWICK SMITH,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. or This bill delivers on the government's commitment to pay in full the offer made to the states in relation to health funding at the Premiers Conference in March this year. This legislation allows the Commonwealth to continue funding to all states and territories based on the fair and reasonable Premiers Conference offer. The government is not prepared to delay any longer in ensuring the of continuation of funding for hospitals. We are introducing this bill today to provide certainty for the people of Australia, who can rest assured that Commonwealth funding for their hospitals will not be stopped. AlQueensland and the ACT have given inprinciple commitment to enter into Australian care agreements. Although the other on states have yet to accept the government's very generous offer, we will not be denying the people of those states access to the services they require. The Commonwealth will continue to provide those states with funding To receive funding under this bill, the states will be required to adhere to principles ensuring universal access to health and emergency services free of charge on the basis of clinical need and within clinically appropriate periods regardless of the patient's location. These principles are based on those applying under the existing Medicare agreements. This bill reaffirms the government's firm commitment to Medicare and provides for fair and reasonable funding to the states. I have pleasure in commending the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Melharn) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1998 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Truss, and read a first time. Second Reading",15
5,Mr TRUSS,PASSENGER MOVEMENT CHARGE,"Wide Bay-Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs) (9.47 a.m.)I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Passenger Movement Charge Act 1978 to increase the rate of the passenger movement charge by $3 to $30 with effect from 1 January 1999. The increase was announced by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in the 1998-99 budget and will help to meet the additional costs associated with the transit of people and goods for the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. The charge, which is imposed on the departure of a person from Australia, is collected by airlines and shipping companies at the time of ticket sales and then remitted to the Commonwealth in accordance with arrangements entered into under section 10 of the Passenger Movement Charge Collection Act 1978. These arrangements have been extremely successful and beneficial to all stakeholders, not the least being the passengers whose departure from Australia is unimpeded through a seamless process which no longer requires the purchase of charge stamps. Current arrangements with airlines are due to expire on 30 June 1998 and the government is finalising negotiations with interested parties for new arrangements to apply from I July 1998 to 30 June 2001. The increase in the charge will have no impact on the arrangements and collection and remission procedures will remain the same. It is, however, desirable that the amendment to give effect to the increase in the charge from 1 January 1999 be in place at the earliest opportunity so as to provide certainty for airlines and shipping companies in relation to ticket sales for departures after the proposed date for the increase. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Melharn) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT (CHOICE OF SUPERANNUA TION FUNDS) BILL 1998 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Miles, and read a first time. Second Reading",16
6,Mr MILES,SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister) (9.50 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The bill implements the coalition government's choice of superannuation fund measure. This measure was a key initiative in the 1997-98 budget and involves reforms to give employees greater choice over which superannuation fund or retirement savings account will receive superannuation contributions made on their behalf by their employer. The choice of fund arrangements are about giving employees greater choice and control over their superannuation savings, which in turn will give them greater sense of ownership of these savings. The arrangements will increase competition and efficiency in the superannuation industry, leading to improved returns on superannuation savings. The choice of funds provisions were originally introduced to parliament in schedule 5 to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) 1997, which was introduced to the House on 4 December 1997. Those provisions were excised from that bill to ensure timely passage of other measures contained in the bill, in particular the savings rebate, which is another key initiative in the 1997-98 budget. Before the provisions were first introduced to the House in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.7) 1997, the government announced enhancements to the choice of fund measure on 25 November 1997. These enhancements were designed to significantly reduce the administrative burden on employers and provide more flexible and responsive arrangements to address the retirement income needs of all Australians. The announcement of these enhancements followed extensive consultation and they were met with a positive reaction from industry. Amendments to the choice of fund provisions contained in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.7) 1997 were moved by the government in the House of Representatives. The deferral of the start date of choice of fund for new employees from 1 July 1998 to 1 July 1999 is incorporated in this bill. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Melham) adjourned. NA (POLITICAL DONATIONS) BILL 1998 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Miles, and read a first time. Second Reading",16
7,Mr MILES,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister) (9.53 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The bill will implement the government's recently announced response to the taxationrelated recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, following its inquiry into the conduct of the 1996 Federal Election. This bill complements other legislation currently before the parliament which implements the government's response to the other recommendations of the joint standing committee - the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill 1998 and the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No.2) 1998. Currently, the income tax law allows a noncorporate taxpayer to deduct a contribution, which includes a membership subscription as well as a gift, of $2 or more to political parties registered under part XI of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. The total deductions allowable to a taxpayer are subject to a maximum level of $100 in an income year. Testamentary gifts or contributions are not deductible. The joint standing committee recommended that the income tax law be amended so that the maximum annual tax deductibility threshold for donations to political parties be increased from $100 to $1,500, and that companies be allowed to make tax deductible donations. The word 'donation' is a general term which covers contributions as well as gifts. The government has accepted that recommendation. The government agrees with the joint standing committee that an increase in the threshold will encourage small to medium donations, thereby increasing the number of Australians-including companies-involved in the democratic process and reducing a political party's reliance on a small number of large donations. The joint standing committee also recommended that the income tax law be amended to provide that donations to an independent candidate at a federal or state election are tax deductible, at the same level as donations to registered political parties. The government has also accepted this recommendation. This will provide an equivalence of treatment between independent candidates and members and political parties. To implement these recommendations, the bill repeals the existing provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 that apply to contributions to political parties and inserts a new subdivision that applies to both contributions to political parties and gifts to independent members and candidates. The bill also allows taxp,ayers to make tax deductible contributions. to political parties that are registered under state or territory electoral legislation. This expansion will complement the tax concession afforded to independent candidates and members. The amendments made by the bill will apply to contributions to political parties and gifts to independent candidates and members made on or after 1 July 1998. It is anticipated that implementation of these recommendations of the joint standing committee will increase the number of Australians involved in the democratic process and reduce a political party's reliance on large donations. The measures contained in the bill complement the election funding of political parties and provide an equivalence of treatment between donations to political parties and donations to independents. Full details of the measures in the bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable members. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Melham) adjourned. APPROPRIATION BILL (No.1) 1998-99 Second Reading Debate resumed from 27 May, on motion by Mr Costello: That the bill be now read a second time. upon which Mr Gareth Evans moved by way of amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House notes that the Budget: (1) does nothing to redress the pain caused to ordinary Australian families, and those doing it hardest in our community, by the impact of successive Budget cuts on health, education, job programs, aged care, child care and many other government programs and services; (2) by seeking to achieve surplus on the basis of savage Budget cuts, rather than on growth and job creation, does nothing to give hope to unemployed and underemployed; (3) confirms that the Opposition's alternative Budget strategy, as originally announced in 1996, would have returned the Budget to surplus in 1998-99-on the basis of putting growth and jobs first, with much more moderate outlays reductions; (4) lacks credibility in its growth, employment and current account deficit forecasts; (5) confirms that Australia has a private rather than public saving problem-and the stupidity of the Coalition's promise-breaking decision in 1997 to abandon Labor's superannuation cocontribution; and (6) is incomplete and misleading in its projections of future revenue and outlays, in that it makes no provision for election-driven new expenditures and the Government's GST and other tax proposals"" .",17
8,Mr NEVILLE,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"To conclude my remarks, the government has got the nation back on track. We have come through the recession that we had to have. The books of the nation are now balanced. As I said in my opening remarks in this speech, to come from a $10.3 billion deficit to a $2.7 billion surplus is a turnaround of $13 billion-a remarkable achievement in two years. Having been through the pain of recent years, we need to look to a vision for Australia beyond the coming election. I would like to conclude my remarks on this suggestion: I believe that, with asset sales and with the budget now in surplus",18
9,Mr MELHAM,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,You want to sell Telstra.,18
10,Mr NEVILLE,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The member for Banks might even support me in this for once. There is a great need for a national infrastructure fund. I think we need to see in this country an ability to fire up the imagination and to harness the dynamic people of this country to create a vision. We have spent too much time over the last decade looking at our navels and being the playthings of vociferous minority groups. I think a national vision is urgently required. I would suggest that such a fund-perhaps in the order of $2 billion-should be used to build dams, standardise railway lines, build bridges and look for innovative measures which might conceivably fire up the vision of the the people of this country and create employment. There are a number of projects in my own electorate of Hinkler but, in particular, the Paradise Dam west of Bundaberg would be a huge enhancement to our sugar and small crop industries. It could lift the current income from those industries from some $250 million to conceivably twice that amount. On that note, I commend the bill to the House and very much support the budget measures.",18
11,Mr OKEEFE,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Burke) (9.58 a.m.}-During my opportunity to speak this morning on this Appropriation Bill, I want to refer in particular to the appropriations that are made available for the carrying through of the government's role in what I now describe as the waterfront fiasco. I describe it in that way because I do not think it is appropriate for the national government of Australia to involve itself in the activities of a company which strips its assets in order to leave the employees in a holding company that does not even have the money left to cover their entitlements. I do not believe it is responsible for the national government to be involved with a company which breaks the government's own employment laws, as has been found in both the Federal Court and the High Court. I do not think a company that employs balaclava clad security guards with guard dogs to patrol the workplace is an appropriate organisation for the government to be linked with. I do not think that is the way we do business in Australia, and most Australians feel the same. Were I to take the time this morning, I could go through a number of very interesting facts about actual performance on the waterfront, compared to the total deception that has been perpetrated from the box on the other side of the House, particularly by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith). I give just one example. In late 1996, the Patrick workers employed in Melbourne entered into an enterprise bargain---<:osigned by the MUA and Corrigan-with their employer. It was a normal enterprise bargain, the same as operates in any other business. That enterprise bargain contained a number of provisions. One was an agreement that the employees of Patrick in Melbourne would work to certain productivity targets. They would change the work practices and seek to achieve certain productivity goals. If they reached those productivity goals-that is, if they did more work than the enterprise bargain provided for them to achieve during the three-year period-they would be paid a bonus. The Patrick workers in Melbourne achieved their productivity bonus for 38 of the 42 weeks leading up to the night they were sacked and locked out. The minister for workplace relations has stood here in the House talking about people getting $90,000 a year for 15 hours of work, when the award rate is $36,000, and anything on top of it is overtime and other pay according to their conditions. The minister has talked about the lies or misinformation that have been perpetrated-never once telling anybody in Australia that the Patrick workers in Melbourne achieved their productivity bonuses agreed to by Corrigan for 38 out of 42 weeks leading up to the night they were sacked. There are a number of issues we could cover in this debate, but I particularly want to go to something else that has taken my attention: what on earth has gone on behind the asset stripping and the ownership of these companies? We all understand that what Patrick did was separate its normal company operations employing wharfies by setting them up in a holding company, making that the labour company and employing the workers there. You might ask: why would you even do that? Why would you put your employees in a separate company? Answer: so you could strip the assets out of it, leave it with no money, and leave them stuck out there employed by a company that has no money to pay them when you terminate their employment. That was the first part of the arrangement. Then you ask: who is doing this? Who actually owns Patrick? Suddenly you find, when you look at the corporate securities information, that Patrick is not Patrick. It is another company-a company called Lang, the Lang Corporation-that owns Patrick. So it is the Lang Corporation that is actually making the decisions that run Patrick. But who owns Lang? And here is the rub. When you consult corporate information as to who owns Lang, you find that the majority shareholder is not Scanlon or Corrigan or any of those characters; the majority shares are owned by a consortium of financial institutions. They own 38.2 per cent of the shareholding-the majority share. Those financial institutions include organisations such as Westpac, BT, Chase Manhattan, AMP, National Mutual, WorkCover Victoria, Permanent Trustees, the National Bank and ANZ Nominees. So you then ask: why on earth would Australia's premier financial institutions be all holding shares in a stevedoring company that is not performing very well? These are supposed to be the smart money men of Australia. And we have seen the Patrick share price fall over the last couple of years from $3 a share to $1.80 a share. Any smart investor out there says, 'Hang on. If the share price is going down and the company is not making profits, this is not a place for me to be with my money. I should sell my shares and go and put the money somewhere better.' That would be the normal pattern of events. When which you look at AMP in particular, that is exactly what they did. In July last year they shares and ceased to become a significant T shareholder, as did BT. Another little twist: in January this year they bought the shares back again, as did a whole lot of institutions buy back into a dog stevedoring company. That leads to several inferences which I am going to trace through in a minute. I looked at this and thought: what on earth are the financial institutions doing being majority shareholders in a company which behaves like this, especially when those very same institutions took exception to the way Coles Myer was conducting its affairs and intervened in the affairs of Coles Myer, demanding broad restructuring, replacement of certain people and a completely new corporate plan? They did not sell their shares and go away; they actually moved in and demanded that Coles Myer lift its game. In the case of Pacific Dunlop, these institutional investors also moved in and demanded that the show change its game. But here we find that the majority of shareholders in a company which has broken the government's laws-left employees stripped of assets, employed security guards wearing balaclavas and used guard dogs-have actually bought more shares. You have to say to yourself: what the hell is going on here? So I wrote to all these organisations and asked them questions about their shareholdings. I make this point. Many of these companies hold superannuation funds. Every worker in Australia at the moment has seven per cent of their pay go off to these superannuation funds. This is workers' money going into companies which are investing in a show that does over the workers like this. There are ethical issues here about how a company that holds billions of dollars of workers' superannuation funds should behave in relation to workers. I have been a passionate advocate of compulsory superannuation, but there are responsibilities that are incumbent on the companies holding these funds. So I wrote to them and said: Whether or not it is superannuation or other publicly raised funds, I believe that institutions hold this capital have a duty to ensure that the companies they invest in conduct themselves sold their appropriately in our economy. assume that as substantial shareholders in Lang, the 'institution investors' are represented on the board and have been parties to, or aware of, the decisions taken in the lead up to the events which occurred. If so, warning bells should have rungand this is to the managing directorsand you or someone senior in the organisation should have been informed. And I asked the question: Am I right to assume therefore, that the Patricks scam was conducted with the approval of the institutional investors or have they collectively turned a blind eye to corporate conduct which is unbecoming in our community. Obviously it does not remain as just a question of prior knowledge of the Patrick corporate activities. That is around the conspiracy case. Remember, many of the characters had prior knowledge that these men were going to be sacked-and there has already been the banking syndicate involved in this in the Federal Court and the High Court; that has all been flushed out-whether or not they put money in or were financial institutions which conspired to hold the share price up. The point is this: the government's worse nightmare in this is that these institutions may have lost their nerve and said, 'We don't want anything to do with this, we don't want to be a shareholder of an organisation that does these things, we don't want to be named in the federal parliament' - exactly as is happening now. If they had said to themselves, 'We don't want to be in any of this,' the smart thing to do would be to sell the shares, to get out of them. Why would they not do that? Because the government's worse nightmare is that, if those people sell those shares and the share price falls, the controlling interest in Patrick would then be bought by somebody else who may even be friendly to the MUA. It could be a P&O, it could be a Sealand or it could be a Lindsay Fox. It could be another transport operator who buys the shares and says, 'We can do business with the MUA.' That is the government's absolutely worse nightmare. That would mean the collapse of the whole waterfront fiasco. I believe that a number of these financial institutions had prior knowledge and actually agreed to support the share price. That is why, when they have been put under pressure, they have stayed in there. I will say a bit more about that in a minute. So I wrote to these managers back on 22 April and said to them: Obviously it does not remain as just a question of prior knowledge of the Patrick corporate activities. They are now very public knowledge and the question which then follows is what steps the institutional investors have taken since to insulate themselves from becoming implicated, by virtue of their shareholdings. I will not go through all them in the parliament, but I have had replies from six or seven of these organisations. You would reckon they had all rung each other up and worked out exactly the same script to send to me. In order to reinforce that point, let me refer to one of the replies which I received. I refer to the reply from the Victorian W orkCover Authority. They all said the same thing, so this is representative. WorkCover said that external fund managers are appointed. They say, 'As a financial institution, we put the money with an external fund manager; we don't involve ourselves in what goes on in the companies we are investing in.' Remember Coles Myer; remember Pacific Dunlop? They have all said to me, 'We don't involve ourselves in what goes on in these companies. We give the money to an external funds manager and he operates it on our behalf.' W orkCover, in their letter to me, stated: In the general course of events, the Authoritythis is, WorkCover Victoriadoes not ask for detailed information about the breakdown of companies in which the fund managers invest ... They all say they are not represented on the board and they all say they take no part in the active decisions of the operation. It is a uniform response from them all. I have to say that it is an extraordinarily hands-off investment strategy for companies which otherwise feel no compunction at all about intervening as they did in the example of Coles Myer and Pacific Dunlop. I then look, for instance, at AMP. I find AMP a particularly interesting case, because anyone who follows this stuff will tell you that AMP are what yOl- call a quantitative investor. They don't just rush in and buy shares somewhere and then sell them, and then buy them again, and in and out. AMP sit down and do a strong actuarial analysis of a company. They take a long-term view about how it is likely to perform, they buy their shares on that basis and they stick with their judgment. That is what you call a long-term, quantitative investor. Some years ago, AMP bought into Lang and they stayed there. But last July, they made a decision that there was no point staying with them, so they started to wind down their shareholding. In winding down their shareholding they were opting out, and that is normal behaviour for AMP. But what did AMP do then? In January this year, absolutely out of context with anything else they do, they bought back in. For some reason, they bought back in. The inference is this: AMP were absolutely reliant on the support of the government for their demutualisation. One of the biggest issues going on for AMP at the moment is the support of the government for the demutualisation of the organisation, with billions of dollars involved. The question remains: was there a meeting at any time between AMP and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), or AMP and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) where AMP were given the message that they were required, in order to have government support for the demutualisation, to buy back into Lang Patrick and support the share price of Lang Patrick? That is the question that now arises out of the corporate behaviour of AMP in this whole operation. As I said earlier, the role of the financial institutions in this whole scam is going to become a central focus during the next few weeks and, in particular, the role of AMP and whether those meetings took place between the Prime Minister and AMP in the lead-up to the conspiracy which led to the sacking of the workers. They are questions that will be asked in this parliament during the next few weeks.",19
12,Mr HOCKEY,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I hope that people in my electorate will forgive me if I pass up the opportunity to talk about the government's budget. I take this opportunity to reflect on what I perceive to be the challenges for us as a parliament over the next few years and also to reflect on what I have seen to be the standards of behaviour in the chamber over the last three years. In particular, I pay tribute",22
13,Mr MELHAM,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. In view of what the member is now saying, I suggest that is out of order. This is a debate on the appropriations.

14,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I am sure the honourable member for North Sydney will be within the standing orders because this is a debate on the Appropriation Bill, so a general debate is allowed under the standing orders.

15,Mr HOCKEY,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I was going to say some nice things about some members on the other side. Upon reflection, I might not do that. However, I am feeling very gracious this morning, particularly towards the member for Banks (Mr Melham). I must have had a late night; I feel a little disoriented. There is a considerable amount of debate at the moment amongst members about what sort of chamber we wish to have. It is important to reflect on this matter in the circumstances, because there is no more significant career achievement which an individual can have than to have the opportunity to represent, in my case, 130,000 people in this parliament. When I first walked into this chamber, there is no doubt that I thought it was an awesome environment. It is an amphitheatre, if you like, with the highbacked seats and the very large distance, for example, between me, as a new member-if I were located any further back, I would be sitting in the gallery-and the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese), who is also a new member, who sits a good 40 metres away. Yet we are expected, in an environment in which there may only be a few people present, to have an interchange of ideas and to debate ideas which are obviously in the best interests of the nation. Unquestionably, we have a chamber-a magnificent building-that has been built for the future, but the problem is that it has no heart. That is very frustrating. At the time of an election you are in an environment of confrontation, in a spirit of confrontation. You are endeavouring to win a seat from a member of the opposition. Having been elected to the House, and having previously seen the five-second grabs on late night TV of a very aggressive--even tortured--environment in question time, you say to yourself, 'What does it really mean? What are we meant to do in the House--engage in debate or in confrontation?' Unfortunately, it is confrontation. I share the disappointment of many people about question time. I sit some distance from the main table. The interchange across the table is barely heard up here, but I can hear and see the nastiness between members of the opposition and the government, the nastiness that pervades the atmosphere at question time. I read a column by Alan Ramsey in the Sydney Morning Herald entitled 'The decline and fall of parliament'. He referred to the very impassioned speech by the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) on the waterfront dispute. It is pleasing to hear passion-sometimes aggressive passion-in a speech. I can accept that in a sense, but I think that we need to create a forum where there is a real interchange of ideas and policy. Unfortunately, with the developments between the House of Representatives and the Senate over the last few years, we have seen the House of Representatives, in a policy sense, become totally dominated by the executive. The Senate has become the chamber where policy is debated in detail. There is no real detailed policy debate in the House of Representatives, although we make up the numbers. As a new member-and, perhaps, a new generation of members. I find that extremely frustrating. I also find it frustrating that this generation has been handed down this situation by the previous generation-yet the previous generait tion is the first to lament existing standards. that. ' I have inherited this; I have not had much of a chance to do anything about it. I felt sense of frustration when I gave my maiden speech, which focused on the things that really believe in-the policy principles that am going to apply to my career. I was foltions lowed immediately by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), who made a number of grandiabout ose, incorrect and misleading statements and untruths, yet she was the focus of the nation. I am not lamenting that I was not the focus the nation, but I am reflecting that it is portant that we set down our principles in our maiden speeches. Some of the great names that were a part of the eighties, a part of the seventies and, in the case of the Speaker, a part of the sixties, shortly be leaving this chamber. It is frustratextremely ing that they will not pass on to us something which is as good as what they might have had. There has been a gradual deterioration parliamentary standards, which I think can linked to television. It was not just due to fact that the former member for Blaxland, the previous Prime Minister, had a roster system for his ministry during question time; it a gradual deterioration over a period of time. It could have been the result of a different environment or that we televise debates. A good suggestion made by the member for Parramatta (Mr Ross Cameron) is that perhaps we should not have speaking lists. I think there is a good case for not have speaking lists. If members have to seek the call-in a competitive environment-there would be more members in the chamber. After all, people expect us to be in here. Furthermore, the older generation has also provided us with the system of entitlements. For that, I can never forgive them. When I became a member of parliament, I was expected to have an understanding of my new role as a member, my entitlements and how to use them-through the air conditioning ducts in my new office. If you rang the Department of Administrative Services, as it was at the time, and asked: 'What can I use this for?' they would say, 'I'm not so sure, but you can use it for that, and you can use for that, and you might be able to use it for As a new member, you rely on oral advice a great or a wink and a nod from someone about what is appropriate. As a corporate lawyer, I whether in the private or public sectors in I New South Wales, I was never given instruclike that. I find it totally inappropriate that we are not given definitive instructions our entitlements-the grey areas, as they are still being called. They are there to help us further the interests of our electors. At of the same time, we have had the debacle that imoccurred with the travel allowances over the last 12 months. It has got to the stage where it confirms the very worse views of members of the public about members of parliament. The previous generation, the older generawill tion, has passed on to us a system that is difficult to understand. Mr Deputy Speaker, if I am ever provided with the opportunity, you can rest assured, and the of people of North Sydney can rest assured, that be I will not simply be relying on a wink and a the nod to implement an entitlement system for MPs. I would like to thank my predecessor in the seat of North Sydney, Mr Ted Mack, who was sat with me after I was elected and took me through a lot of the various entitlements.",22
16,Mr MELHAM,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,And he went an extra term to make sure that you got the nomination.,24
17,Mr HOCKEY,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"There were a few other things that he managed to leave out, which is quite frustrating, but I suppose I learned from those experiences. Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to take a minute, if the whip will give me an understanding moment, to pay tribute to those people who are leaving the House at the end of this term. Obviously we do not know when an election will be called, but I would like to thank them for what they have given me as a new member. There are several people I may miss, but I would like to begin by thanking the member for Fowler (Mr Ted Grace), who is going to help me set up the ArmenianAustralian Parliamentary Friendship Committee. He has been someone I have always found to be very entertaining and informative. In his electorate he probably has the most difficult area in Australia to represent, matta, yet he has done it with dignity. I would like to thank him for that. I would also like to thank the member for Charlton, Bob Brown. I have had the pleasure of sitting with him on the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts. He is a very interesting fellow, and he is a very passionate person with great dignity as well.",24
18,Mr MELHAM,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"He wrote a good economics text, too.",24
19,Mr HOCKEY,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Whilst I might not agree with some of his economic arguments, I think he is a man of integrity. He has represented Hunter and Charlton since 1980, and I think we will sadly miss his experience as a former minister. I have had the pleasure of sitting on the Standing Committee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration with the member for Gellibrand, Ralph Willis. I have found him to be a man of great integrity and honesty. He obviously has his place in Australian history. He has held some very difficult portfolios, but I have always found the member for Gellibrand to be a very genuine person in the advice that he provides. His experience has been invaluable to a number of the younger people on the financial institutions committee who for the first time have had to go through a very interesting and challenging role-that is, to cross-examine the Governor of the Reserve Bank about interest rates and various other forms of monetary policy. One of the pleasures of this parliament has been the opportunity to get to know the member for Lalor, Barry Jones. In this combative environment, there is not often an opportunity to sit down with someone and have a yam about the world. However, and people might not know this, he is the President of the Labor Party and yet one day he came into the government alcove where a number of us were sitting and we started chatting about what happened in the 1970s and the 1980s in parliament. I found it extremely informative and very interesting. That is one of a number of occasions when I have had the opportunity to speak with the member for Lalor, and I thank him for that. It is funny when you are watching a docuCabramentary and you see someone like the member for Melbourne Ports, Clyde Holding, come up. He was Leader of the Opposition in Victoria at the time of the execution of Ronald Ryan. I am yet to have a chance to speak with the member for Melbourne Ports, but with him go great experience and great knowledge. Obviously others, such as the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), the member for Riverina (Mr Hicks), the member for Groom (Mr Taylor), the member for Rankin (Mr Beddall) and the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), will be going. There are two other people I would particularly like to thank and to pay tribute to. The first is the former Speaker, the member for Casey, Bob Halverson. I have found Bob to be a great guy. He is a man of great experience who has gone through some very difficult times, obviously, but as Chief Opposition Whip and then as Speaker he made a great contribution to this House, and I wish him well for the future. I would also like to pay tribute to the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), the current Speaker. I walked into my first division in this place and sat down next to him, and asked, 'How long have you been here?' He said, 'When I was sitting here for the first time, Ming was standing at the dispatch box.'",24
20,Mr MELHAM,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,Before you were born!,25
21,Mr HOCKEY,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Yes, the right honourable member for New England entered this House before I was born and he has gone through 14 general elections, which is quite astounding. I think we will all sorely miss his experience and his contribution to the House. I think it is the end of a generation. He is the last person to have been here since the 1960s. I think a new generation has not done enough to learn from someone like that. What we have to do is to find some way that the new generation can continue to learn from the older generation, recognising their flaws, while at the same time seeking to improve upon their best points. Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity to thank those people for their great contributions to this House.",25
22,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Given my shadow ministerial responsibilities and the time constraints that have been imposed on this debate, my comments this morning on the 1998 federal budget will concentrate on the Veterans' Affairs portfolio. This portfolio is a key support to over half a million Australians-260,000 veterans who receive a DVA pension, 160,000 partners or dependants of theirs and a further 100,000 war widows. More than a third of a million hold a gold or white card. that entitles them to hospital, medical and dental treatment at DVA expense. Projected portfolio expenditure in 1998-99 is some $7.25 billion. Whilst veterans were frequently mentioned by the Treasurer (Mr Costello), budget night actually revealed only two new and quite modest spending initiatives for veteransadditional funding for continuing building works at the Australian War Memorial and the flow-on cost to DVA of the wider increase in Medicare fees for GP consultations. Other measures of interest to veterans and war widows had, of course, already been announced prior to the budget by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), frantic to restore his plummeting standing amongst, and credibility with, older Australians in general, and amongst veterans and war widows in particular. These pre-budget efforts included his 26 March statement regarding war widows pensions and his further announcement on 26 April regarding the gold card. Mr MCLachlan-Nonsense!",25
23,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The minister opposite might interject that it is rubbish, but the clear reality understood by every commentator and clearly indicated to this government in every poll is that the decline in their support amongst older Australians, a key ingredient in their last electoral victory, is because of their decisions with regard to nursing and aged care. I mention in passing that this year we are also privy-courtesy of the Financial Review of 4 May-to summary contents of the budget submission of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) to the Expenditure Review Committee. Whilst naturally interested in the defeats that have been inflicted on the minister, I was particularly struck by the omissions from his proposals, given that the 1998 budget will clearly be the last in the coalition's term of office. I wondered if the minister had forgotten that John Howard had, in February 1996, promised war widows that a coalition government would review the frozen rate of the income support supplement and the denial of assistance to those who remarried prior to 1984. I thought that surely the minister remembered that his party had solemnly promised veterans that the coalition would review the list of eligible drugs under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, with a view to increasing the number. This government had subsequently actually removed various treatments for diarrhoea, fungal infections, stomach cramps and vomiting from the PBS, saving the government $6.2 million. Reading further into the submissions of the minister and the coverage of it in the Financial Review, I noted that his submission contained no reference to overseas service anomalies. I thus concluded that the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) had obviously failed to remind the minister forcibly enough of his- Mr Tuckey's-promises to 'review the genuine and significant anomalies in veterans' entitlements which have been of long standing concern to the veterans community'. Quite frankly, the member for O'Connor did not say that once or twice-he made that commitment endlessly and constantly around this country. These anomalies include repatriation benefits for the British Commonwealth Occupation Force, the Far East Strategic Reserve and service at Ubon Air Base in Thailand. These have sunk into the quagmire of Minister Bishop's endless list of ongoing murky reviews and inquiries. This one has now been going on for eight months since Senator Tambling gave commitments to look at the FESR and Ubon. Regrettably, I could not find any evidence either of the minister seeking the necessary funding from cabinet to convert the Veterans' Entitlement Act into 'plain English'-a measure that was described by the Prime Minister of this country in February 1996 as being 'an important priority for a Coalition Government'. Three budgets later, nothing has been done. Enough, however, of the body blow to the coalition's credibility dealt by leak in the Financial Review. I now turn to each of the veterans related measures that the coalition has announced over the past few weeks. I come first to the welcome announcement on 26 March that the average weekly earnings driven pension rise would be extended to war widows, who had been excluded from the government's original legislation. This measure will cost $163.7 million over four years and has the opposition's full and total support. I have already spoken at length on the topic during debate on the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment (Male Total Average Weekly Earnings Benchmark) Bill 1998 and I will therefore not say anything further about it this morning. The next prime ministerial announcement was that the repatriation gold card would be extended next January-that is in 1999-to all veterans aged 70 and over who had faced hostile forces of the enemy in the Second World War. This announcement follows Labor's early significant extension of full treatment benefits to World War I veterans in 1973 and to Second World War ex-servicewomen in 1987. It is interesting to note that the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, constantly refers to the time period between the end of World War I and the extension of full treatment benefits to veterans of that war as the precedent for the decision on the gold card for Second World War veterans. I welcome the latest extension as a positive measure that will benefit some 50,000 veterans, including 17,000 who currently enjoy more restricted treatment benefits from the white card. The net cost of this extension is considerable, even after allowing for offsetting reductions in general PBS and Medicare outlays. The final cost to the budget is predicted to be approximately $480 million over four years. I have made it clear that the opposition fully supports the extension and that a Beazley Labor government will honour it in full. It is a fact of life that any concession to one group raises demands from those who missed out. Since the Prime Minister's announcement on the gold card, I have been deluged with requests-and I would say that many memthe bers on both sides of the parliament are in this situation-from groups and individuals seeking further extensions. Prominent amongst these have been the suggestion to give the gold card to all allied veterans, many of whom, as they would argue, are Australian citizens who have lived here for decades. Others seeking it have been those who were prevented from serving in war zones. Their contention is that they had signed up to go overseas to face hostile forces and had been prevented. Others seeking it have been the spouses of veterans, all veterans of the Korean and Vietnam wars who are over 70 years of age and who have qualifying service for time other than the Second World War. In other words, there are a significant number of groups and individuals out there arguing that they should have the extension. I certainly have particular sympathy for the situation of the last mentioned group-those who went to Korea and are aged over 70 years. The fact of life is that, post World War I, Australia was not involved in a significant international conflict which is comparable to either of the world wars. I think that both sides of politics have perhaps disregarded the reality that the Korean War followed very soon after the Second World War and we do have a significant number of people in that category who are over 70 years of age. However, the recent extension involved, as I have already mentioned, a very considerable cost. Whilst the opposition is happy to consider sound proposals, it would be unsustainable to constantly extend the gold card to more and more groups. Apart from anything else, such an approach could soon endanger the continuation of the level of benefits enjoyed by current cardholders. I now turn to the third pre-budget announcement affecting veterans; namely, the claimed extra $600 million for hospital treatment of entitled veterans. I plainly indicate that this 'claimed' measure simply cannot be accepted at face value. For weeks, the coalition has repeatedly claimed that state and territory governments have been offered an extra $750 million over five years for the hospital treatment costs of entitled veterans. Claims to this effect were made in question time by the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) on 23 March, by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs on 25 March, and by the Prime Minister again on 6 April. None of these gentlemen has had the honesty and decency to admit that their government has previously implemented cuts of $800 million in public hospital funding. As further details of the Commonwealth offer emerged, courtesy of disaffected state coalition health ministers, it turns out that the involves Veterans' Affairs meeting the hospital treatment costs of entitled veterans in contracted private as well as public hospitals. This continues Labor's initiative, implemented as part of the process of the Commonwealth relinquishing control of repatriation hospitals, to extend to veterans the option of receiving treatment in contracted private hospitals. I am thus not ca11ing this mechanism into question, but I point out that, even with access to the budget papers, it is far from clear how much of the earmarked funding for hospital treatment of veterans will flow through to public hospitals. The veterans affairs portfolio budget statement contains no such breakdown. It merely provides a single line item for estimated expenditure on 'veterans hospital and health services', which covers a raft of separate clements. State health ministers have reputedly calculated that much less than half of the money will tlow to them, with a majority going to the private hospital sector. This should not be of surprise, given the government's largesse to the private nursing home operators. As I say, the point we are making today did not come out of the Labor Party national conference. It did not come out of the Labor Party caucus. It is a fundamental point made by different coalition health ministers around this country at a state level. As I stated on budget night, if the Commonwealth's public hospital Medicare offer is as generous as the coalition claims, it is remarkable that so many coalition state health ministers have rejected it totally as being misleading and inadequate. The next issue that I want to address is the government's plans to clamp down on Vietnam veterans' disability pension claims for service related psychiatric conditions. In last year's budget, the Treasurer announced that the coalition would seek to save almost $16 million over four years through the introduction of a system of panel diagnosis, particularly of pension claims for post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD. The measure, which was due to start last November, was predicted to reduce the number of successful pension claims by approximately 150 cases a year. The ex-service community clearly did not offer support the panel diagnosis proposal, which had overtones of doctor shopping on DVA's part. Prior to this budget, it had been understood that the minister had agreed not to proceed with the original proposal. The opposition was surprised, therefore, when neither the official budget measures paper nor the DVA budget kit made any reference whatsoever to the status of the proposal. Normally any amendments to previous years' budget announcements are noted in the budget papers, and the estimated resulting increase or reduction outlays is quantified. Several days later, when the veterans affairs portfolio budget statement was tabled in the Senate, we were provided with the barest indication of the current situation regarding the PTSD crackdown. On page 35 appears a table headed 'Variations to program 1underlying outlays 1997-98 to 1998-99'. Dot point 6 says that they would 'introduce second opinion for certain conditions', and this is recorded as reducing disability pension outlays this financial year by $2.45 million. This seems to be the remnant of the panel diagnosis proposal of the minister with only a slightly reduced budget saving. What is outrageous is that there is no subsequent page reference or explanation of the proposal. This is totally unsatisfactory. We had the minister telling us in question time on Monday that he would 'leave no stone unturned' in following up the recent disturbing findings of the Vietnam veterans' health study. At the same time, he promised the Treasurer that he, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, a supposed representative of veterans, will save $2.45 million next financial year on the same Vietnam veterans' disability pension claims, and then he compounded his duplicity by refusing to tell the veteran community, or this parliament, exactly how his system of second opinion for certain conditions will actually operate. So, after all the rhetoric, all the sloganising, with regard to what we owe these people from Vietnam for their suffering, their pain, the outcomes of this health study, he seems to be proceeding in a very underhanded, subterranean way with this panel diagnosis proposal, which essentially is aimed to stop many of these same people succeeding with disability claims. We all know one of the other thrusts of this government seen around the states of this Commonwealth is their attack on legal aid. We can see in Queensland, in New South Wales and, in particular, in Victoria, at this stage, significant changes to the rights of all veterans in this country to proceed to their day in court against this government or any government with regard to their rights to disability pensions and other matters in the portfolio. So all the rhetoric about what we owe people is summarised in action by these kinds of attacks on their rights. Looking at the budget as a whole, it is clear that the reaction to the coalition's disastrous changes to nursing homes and pharmaceutical benefits has forced the government to suggest some positive sweeteners to veterans and war widows. I am confident, however, that most veterans and war widows well understand that they are still hit by exorbitant nursing home entry charges, charges which the private industry, which is so powerful with regard to this government, are saying are not high enough. Indisputably, they will be increased at a later stage when the people who have reminded the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) and others of how generous they have been to the government with regard to political donations get their way. Aged people in this country would further recall that their pharmaceutical benefits have been drastically cut over the last few years. They would note that legal aid funding has been slashed, thus reducing their capacity to fight for their pension rights. They would further be aware and take on board that the government pocketed over $5 million by delaying an overdue reduction in mortgage rates for war service homes. Equally, I continue to be inundated with complaints about the government's inaction on nuclear veterans and on the health of the Vietnam veterans. Above all, the ex-service community will not forget the broken promises that flow from the coalition's 1996 election veterans affairs policy statement, ironically titled 'Lest we forget'.",25
24,Mrs ELIZABETH GRACE,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I was very interested in the comments made by the previous speaker, the member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson), about the veterans and what is happening to them. Since becoming the member for Lilley, I have had to advocate on behalf of many, many, many veterans whose cases, to get some sort of recognition from the Veterans Review Board, have been four, five and six years in the pipeline. I had one case where a veteran was 92 years of age and he had spent six years waiting for recognition. I am grateful to say that that gentleman's recognition has come through and he is feeling much more content. I find it hypocritical that the opposition are making these comments about veterans. They had 13 years to attend to those veterans who had been suffering from nuclear exposure and those sorts of things, and they did absolutely nothing. They sat there and did absolutely nothing, and kept so many of these veterans waiting for their rightful rewards. The 1998-99 budget meets the government's commitment to return the budget to surplus in its first term of office. The governthrough ment can use this surplus and the prospective surpluses to pay off the debts left to the nation by Labor. In returning the budget to surplus, the government has focused on keeping spending under control. We have not resorted to increasing the tax burden on Australians and, for the third year in a row, the budget contains no increases in income tax, no increase in the company tax rate, no increase in wholesale sales tax and no increase in petrol excise. Even though we have put the government's finances in order by being careful with spending, we are still able to target areas of need. One of those areas is health, and today I would like to address the issue of child immunisation in Australia. Over the past 10 weeks I have had a student from AND, Janet Macnamara, in my office who compiled a report on this issue in response to the unacceptably low child immunisation levels currently recorded in Australia. In 1995 the ABS reported Australia's child immunisation levels as being 53 per cent, placing Australia third last among Western nations and well below many developing nations. In recent years, much effort has been put into devising strategies which would successfully improve child immunisation levels in Australia. Immunisation is a public health issue and, as such, comes under our government's responsibility. The coalition government's 'Immunise Australia: The seven point plan'-released in the 1997-98 budget and subsequently followed by further measures in the recent 1998-99 budget-is a coherent package which addresses the key problem areas of Australia's child immunisation system. The main focus of this government's initiatives is towards education-education of parents, providers and the community at large. The great need for education can be seen as a function of Australia's low child immunisation levels alone. However, a closer look at the issue highlights some alarming statistics. The Immunisation Schedule recommended by the National Health and Medical Research Council begins a child on a series of vaccinations from the age of three months right to school age. It has been found that, while a vast majority of infants begin the recommended schedule, less than 20 per cent are likely to complete it. This means that a majority of children are not fully immunised and that, of the 53 per cent who supposedly are, many are not completing the schedule on time. Studies have revealed that parents are inadequately informed of the many aspects of immunisation, such as when immunisation is due, where the child can be immunised, the diseases vaccination prevents and the nature of the vaccines themselves. The provision of education through federal strategies-such as the mass media campaign and the public relations strategy begun last year and the immunisation awareness days-are invaluable in supporting parents who require more information. Much support has been indicated in the Canberra region for these strategies, in particular for the dramatic television commercials featuring a baby coughing violently with whooping cough. Misconceptions of the safety of vaccines are also playing an increasing role in the attitude of parents towards immunisation. The most pertinent example is the whole cell pertussis vaccine administered in the trivalent DTP vaccine, which is associated with a minute percentage of adverse reactions. Around 20 per cent of infants who receive the DTP vaccine experience mild side effects, 0.1 per cent may experience convulsions and one in a million may develop encephalitis. While these statistics appear frightening to parents of young children, they are insignificant when compared to the severity of the whooping cough disease itself-where one in 200 infants six months and under suffering from the whooping cough infection die from pneumonia or brain damage. Last year, New South Wales experienced a devastating whooping cough epidemic, where 2,500 children contracted the disease and six died. This epidemic can conceivably be attributed to the low levels of DTP vaccination that are well below other vaccine levels. The experience of the New South Wales epidemic obviously demonstrates the benefit of full child immunisation and the great need for educating parents. In an effort to increase community awareness, this government has designated $6.6 million for an Internet 'megahub' which will provide a two-way flow of information, communication and education on health issues, policies, services and research in Australia. Much importance has been placed on research, with an ongoing level of funding for the National Health and Medical Research Council of $165 million a year. It is through education that many other aspects of Australia's immunisation system can be addressed. The most vulnerable groups in the community with respect to child immunisation are minority groups-Australia's indigenous and migrant populations. Whilst success has been reported for immunisation coverage in certain remote Aboriginal communities, indigenous people are nevertheless particularly susceptible to the transmission of diseases, such as Haemophilus Influenzae type b, or Hib. Special attention is therefore ed from us as a government and from the community to provide the necessary health programs. The recent 1998-99 budget acknowledges this by committing $72.6 million over four years towards combating the levels of infectious diseases in the indigenous population and providing free Hib and pneumonococcal vaccinations to all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people over 50. Unlike the apparent success of vaccine coverage among indigenous Australians, migrant groups remain particularly vulnerable to vaccine preventable diseases due to the practicalities of culture and language barriers. Migrants are also an at-risk group to vaccine preventable diseases, particularly rubella and Hib infection. In general, there is a lack of appropriate strategies that specifically address the needs of Australian migrants. Such strategies should be able to identify at-risk infants in the community, provide adequate education and service and monitor the resulting immunisation levels. The widespread provision of multilingual community health nurses and other such providers could prove invaluable to the provision of services and a subsequent improvement to immunisation levels in our migrant communities. Not only is parental awareness of immunisation issues proving detrimental to Australia's immunisat;ion levels, but more mundane practical difficulties have also been highlighted as preventing adequate immunisation. Effort needs to be put into providing out of hours services for working parents and mobile immunisation units for parents who have transport difficulties, for example. Provision for an on-the-spot immunisation service may also prove beneficial, as it has been said that 83 per cent of parents would support such a service. Of particular concern to the government is the adequacy of health services for Australia's rural communities. A $2.3 million rural multipurpose health and family services network is currently being established in which the immunisation needs of each rural community can be addressed. This government has focused its efforts not only on parents and the general community but very importantly on the GPs themselves. needGPs are key providers, providing over 60 per cent of all immunisations and seeing 93 per cent of nought to six year olds on an average seven times in a year. This places them in a prime position to monitor the immunisation status of each child. The 1998-99 budget outlined a new practices incentive program which is to replace the original better practices program. The new incentives, totalling $812 million over four years, will reward practices that make a commitment to providing high quality care for their patients. It has been established that providers themselves playa considerable role in Australia's low child immunisation coverage by not correctly administering and handling vaccines according to the NHMRC guidelines. In addition, the proper monitoring and evaluation of immunisation targets depends solely on the accurate reporting by the providers of the occurrence of disease, as well as the adverse reactions to vaccines. This government has addressed the issue of child immunisation by grasping the fundamental weaknesses in the system and implementing strategies and setting targets for much improved outcomes. My speech has outlined the firm commitment of this government to protecting Australian children from many vaccine preventable diseases that exist in our society. The previous government painted itself as socially responsible, yet failed to achieve any improved outcomes in indigenous health. The previous government had an ad hoc approach to public health, while this government is backing its commitment to preventative health with the biggest funding package ever for public health. This government will not 'tax and spend' indiscriminately. We are committed to improving health outcomes, not just committed to satisfying the consciences of inner city intellectuals. I congratulate the Treasurer (Mr Costello) on a budget that provides security, safety and stability for all of us. Debate (on motion by Mr Stephen Smith) adjourned. NA NA Motion (by Mr Andrew)-by leaveproposed: That the following bills be referred to the Main Committee for further consideration: Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1998-99; Appropriation Bill (No.2) 1998-99; and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1998-99",28
25,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,COMMITTEE," Mr Deputy Speaker, whilst I have personally on previous occasions indicated in this place that I am in principle opposed to the reference of the appropriation bills to the Main Committee, a view of which you are well aware, I am instructed and advise the House that, on this occasion, collectively, we indicate no objection to the motion moved by the Chief Government Whip. Question resolved in the affirmative. CUSTOMS LEGISLATION (ANTIDUMPING AMENDMENTS) BILL 1998 Cognate bill: CUSTOMS TARIFF (ANTI-DUMPING) AMENDMENT BILL 1998 Second Reading Debate resumed from 14 May, on motion by Mr Truss: That the bill be now read a second time.",31
26,Mr CREAN,COMMITTEE,"The Customs Legislation (Anti-dumping Amendments) Bill 1998 and the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill 1998 have been a long time coming into this chamber. The truth is that we are only considering them because Labor has forced the issue. In essence, these bills implement the announcement that we made on 3 November that we would put in place the key recommendations of the Willett anti-dumping report. We also moved a private member's bill which, I might say, the government refused to debate or, indeed, adopt at a time when we had indicated a preparedness to support, in a bipartisan way, through this parliament. Anti-dumping in this country is an issue that has been heightened because of the Asian economic crisis. The fact is that overproduction can lead to circumstances where product is dumped unfairly into our market jeopardising jobs-in particular, jobs in regional Australia. But, prior to the 1996 election, the coalition promised to shorten the maximum time allowed for anti-dumping complaints from 245 days to 155 days. That was an election promise. They then commissioned Lawrie Willett in June 1996 to recommend the means of achieving this end. His report came to the government in September 1996. So a report was commissioned in June, it was in the hands of the government in September 1996, and it is only today that we have the legislation before the parliament. The key recommendations which Mr Willett made were, firstly, that there should be a reduction in the maximum investigation time to 155 days or, in the case of some complex cases, 175 days. In other words, he was saying you could reduce the time in which an anti-dumping case was heard and determined. So his first recommendation was for that reduction. He then recommended that provisional measures-that is, measures that require the payment, in duty terms, of the equating price-could be imposed after 60 days of an investigation commencing. Obviously if the case is unsuccessful that money is repaid, but the point of being able to impose the provisional measures is that they do not continue to get advantage necessarily whilst the case is being heard. The current provision enables provisional measures to occur only after 100 days. The Willett recommendation was to reduce that to 60 days. The third recommendation was that a single stage investigation process be undertaken by Customs. At the moment we have this overlapping two-stage process in place whereby Customs deals with it, then the Anti-Dumping Authority deals with it, but consistently we have found that the Anti-Dumping Authority has tended to rehear cases all over again. What he recommended, however, was not just that there be a single stage but that Customs receive additional resources to carry out what would become an expanded role. That is important to note because in the recent budget papers presented before this parliament Customs has lost money. So, whilst this bill gives it an expanded role, which Willett recommended should carry with it additional resources, the budget does not allocate those additional resources. The fourth recommendation that he made was that a more stringent approach be adopted to seeking and verifying information from importers. In other words, this was an attempt to put the onus back on those bringing the products into justify the costs of production and whether or not the price being charged was fair. Previously, the onus fell much more heavily on the company being affected, and in the circumstances of this amendment the onus of proof shifts. That was the set of recommendations that came to the government in September 1996. But the government, having got those clear recommendations-recommendations which we had indicated support for-did nothing. So, after a year of waiting, we decided that we should make the coalition do the right thing. We announced formally the adoption of the recommendations of the Willett report. On 24 November we introduced a private member's bill which put the Willett recommendations in place. It was only on 24 February, some three months later, that the government announced its response to the Willett report. The government position very closely matched that which Labor announced three months before. We at the time called on the government to urgently introduce its own legislation to implement the decision and, given the fact that they could get bipartisan support from us, which we are giving today in relation to this bill, this was clearly a matter that could have been dealt with a lot earlier than it has been. We consistently said that we would give expedition to the passage of this bill. It is a pity, therefore, that we now find ourselves restricted in time, with this bill being bunched up with something like 18 others to be rammed through this parliament in the space of a little over one week-some 21 bills have to be considered and debated in about 26 hours of sitting time. We were saying as far back as February, 'We will give you support to get this through; bring it on.' It did not occur. As I understand it, the argument was that they needed to get the bill properly drafted, but the truth is that we already had a bill before the House, a bill which we had introduced back in November. So I would be very interested to hear from the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss), when he responds in this debate, why the government has taken so long. We have agreement on both sides of the parliament to do something. We have a bill drafted, but here we are in May, almost seven months after that bill was drafted, and we are just getting around to debating it. The point I am making is that, whilst we welcome this piece of legislation, it should have been introduced a lot earlier, and Labor was promising to support it a lot earlier. Labor in fact took the initiative in drafting a piece of legislation that could have been adopted by this House. The bills that are before us do appear to meet the spirit of the Willett recommendations. It has modified the Willett approach in some cases, but the main provisions of the bill do abolish the Anti-Dumping Authority and transfer to Customs the responsibility for the conduct of the investigations. They do provide provisional measures being available after 60 days. The bill also provides for a ISS-day total investigation timetable, including a 'statement of essential facts' to be issued after 110 days, with 20 days for the party to respond to that and then 2S days for Customs to complete their investigation and make the recommendation to the minister. We welcome that part, and that is consistent with the Willett recommendations. The other important part of this legislation is that the investigators have the power to disregard late submissions, so they cannot held up by people coming in after the event seeking to put in what they claim is new information but often is used as a delaying tactic. The bill also creates a new body, the Trade Measures Review Office, to review a dumping decision where parties feel a decimeasures; sion was flawed. This review will take days but, importantly, will not reopen cases. It needs to be treated effectively as an peal-that is, whether the decision taken properly taken on the facts before it, not ability to introduce new facts. That is an important change. We welcome that because the Anti-Dumping Authority, the body which is being abolished, on many occasions alcosts lowed the introduction of new material reopened cases. Having said all the things we agree with, there are two matters of concern. The first whether this new review body, the Trade Measures Review Office, will become a de legislation facto Anti-Dumping Authority. I would be pleased to hear some expression of confidence from the minister that that is not to be case. It is obviously not our intention to amendment in this regard-that would only delay the bill-but to make the point that as an opposition will be closely monitoring how this body is functioning. Of we fortunate enough to win the next election, we would be reviewing it from a different perspective. We are not concerned with the notion that there has to be some mechanism for review. Given the restriction of what the review can consider, it does give us cause for encouragement, but we will be watching carefully the way in which this new review body functions. That is the first point of concern. The second point of concern is whether the assurances on more stringent conditions applying to seeking and verifying information will be carried through. This again relates to the way in which the matter is processed once the structure is set in place, but it is another area that we will be paying attention to. In relation to anti-dumping as a policy measure, right from the start Labor's approach on this issue has been to safeguard thousands of Australian jobs from unfair international be trading practices by strengthening the anti-dumping legislation, legislation which has been significantly eroded by this government's inaction. Anti-dumping measures are fundamentally designed to ensure fairness in international trade. They are not protection they are about ensuring that Aus60 tralian businesses do not have to compete unfairly with products coming into this counaptry. They should not be used as a protective was trade barrier. We have never argued that. the What we have clearly and consistently argued is that businesses here competing in a global environment should not have to compete unfairly with products coming in where the of production do not reflect the price and ultimately being charged. Legislative changes are necessary to preserve the integrity of Australia's antiis dumping system. That we acknowledge, but we believe that the primary focus of such should be to create Australian jobs and build national wealth within our international trading obligations. Nothing that was the recommended by Willett was contrary to our seek obligations under the WTO. Nothing in this bill is contrary to those obligations, nor was we there anything in the bill we put into the parliament that was inconsistent with our course, were world trade obligations. I have heard assertions from the lobby groups we have been speaking to and from the interest groups that this was the government's excuse for not adopting Labor's bill. I remind the House that, when we presented our bill, we had it cleared through the parliamentary research facility. We specifically asked the question as to whether what we were proposing in the bill as drafted by us was consistent with our world trade obligations. The answer was yes. To ensure the primary focus was on the creation of Australian jobs, our strategy was designed to ensure that existing jobs and new opportunities were not lost through unfairly priced imports. We were concerned to repair the damage done by the government to the current anti-dumping system. We were also concerned to put in place a single stage process for anti-dumping complaints to ensure that they are completed in no more than 155 days. The Willett report itself was commissioned to cut the time taken to investigate complaints of dumping and improve procedures to ensure Australian producers are not disadvantaged. Yet, as I said before, whilst the Willett report was in the hands of the government for over a year and a half, it is only now that it has done something to put in place any of the 23 recommendations. Both sides of the House were capable of agreeing upon practically all of those recommendations. While that amount of time passed, all the government did when it came to office-it had the advantage of this report in its hand rather than these more comprehensive amendments which we are now debating-was to shave 30 days off existing investigation times without addressing any of the structural issues highlighted by Willett. We believe that the government believed it had fulfilled its obligation, its promise, of the last election by 3--day shaving of the investigation time. That was nowhere near what Willett recommended. When the government had this report, when it had knocked 30 days off the investigation period, what was its next step? To refer it to the Productivity Commission. This is the Productivity Commission that would have sent the Australian automotive industry out the back door, and the Productivity Commission whose recommendations would have put the TCF industries out of business. The government, rather than acting on its own report-knowing that it had made a commitment to reduce the days and knowing that it had a report that said to it, 'Here is the way in which you can implement your policy'-took the courageous decision to send it off to the Productivity Commission. Of course, the Productivity Commission did nothing. The truth is that, having got a report, this government referred it off to a body which did nothing. This was despite the fact that the recent economic developments in Asia, uncertainty over the government's lack of an industry policy and the mess created over the treatment of dumped product from China all combined to ensure that Australian manufacturers were more exposed to the threat of dumping than ever before. But this is not a unique experience. This form of government inaction has become a regular pattern. Let us go through it: first, you make an election promise; second, you redefine that promise as a non-core promise; third, you delay the decision by commissioning a report; fourth, when the report recommends action, you announce another inquiry to consider the recommendations of the first inquiry; fifth, you forget to send the reference to the second inquiry; sixth, you close your eyes and hope it all goes away; seventh, you went until Labor campaigns for the action that is needed; and, eighth, you follow Labor's lead and then pretend it was all your own idea. That is the pattern that has followed this issue. Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, I would urge you, as a person whom I know takes close interest in this issue and in particular takes a close interest in my activities, to look at that sethis quence of events and see if I am not right. I urge you to do that. A number of individuals and organisations have played a very significant part campaigning for their membership and for their constituencies in forcing the government to act on this bill. I should mention a few of them. In the northern part of Tasmania, an organisation called TasPEAC-the Tasmanian Papermills Employee Action Committee-through their president Royce Webster have been avid followers, active campaigners and effective advocates. They need a huge pat on the back for the contribution they have made through to pushing this government to act on the legislation and hopefully-I say hopefully because there are still other issues outstanding that the government should act upon-to be in a position in which their job security can be guaranteed. Similarly, down in the Gippsland region the A-team at the Maryvale mill, which is owned by Australian Paper, a subsidiary of AmcorChris Moody is the chairman of the A-teamhas also had active, effective campaigning through regular meetings and has persisted in working with the management structures to try to put pressure on this government to act. Again, I congratulate them for the activities that they pursued. Senator Shayne Murphy, a Senate colleague of mine who put a lot of effort into drafting the private member's bill, also deserves mention, as does the Labor candidate for Braddon, Sid Sidebottom, in contrast to the invisible member for Braddon (Mr Miles) on this. Mr Truss-Never heard of him.",31
27,Mr CREAN,COMMITTEE,"There is a lot of people down in Braddon who have heard of him. The minister says he has never heard of him. He will, because he will be sitting in this chamber after the next election, in part because of the government's inaction on this legislation. What did we have from the member for Braddon, Mr Chris Miles? When a major effort was needed in Tasmania in light of the minister's comments when faced with the potential closure of the Burnie mills, the member for Braddon said, 'The government would look at the situation in the light of events at that time.' That was the member for Braddon's contribution. Here he had mills in his electorate about to close down and all he said was that he would look at it at the appropriate time. The problem was that, as they were pointing out to him that now was the appropriate time and to do something, he sat on his hands. We also have the Labor candidate for MCMillan, Mr Christian Zarah, who has campaigned with the A-team in a hugely successful way-unlike the current member for MCMillan (Mr Broadbent) who tried to pretend that Labor's bill was deficient. Mr Truss-It is deficient.",35
28,Mr CREAN,COMMITTEE,It is not deficient. I challenge you to get up in this chamber and argue where that deficiency was. Mr Truss-I will.,35
29,Mr CREAN,COMMITTEE,"In any event, if that was your true belief, I sat down with you early in the piece and said, 'You show us where the deficiencies are and we will correct them.' That could have been done last November when we introduced the bill into the parliament. We offered bipartisanship, and you ignored it. So do not come in here with any unction saying it was deficient. If it was deficient, identify the deficiencies and let us work it out. But do not get your member for MCMillan on the airwaves asserting what was not true and in particular not being prepared to address the deficiencies himself, if he claimed they existed. We also have Sandra MCCarthy who has worked in her local community-the community of Gilmore which she is contesting in the next election on our behalf. I notice that the member for Gilmore (Mrs Gash), who is always writing letters that we can use from time to time, is in the House at the moment and smiling. I note that she has just started to take up a petition on this issue. No wonder she is in the House to debate the bill. She will tell us about how she has been actively campaigning all the way through on this issue. We know that that is nonsense and we know that Labor's alternative choice in that seat has been active in this campaign in a very significant way. I would also like to pay tribute to Bruce MCAllen's role in this exercise, which was to coordinate the industry end of the campaign. I would also mention Michael O'Connor from the CFMEU who has, as always, given strong, effective, passionate leadership on behalf of his union membership in striving to identify the issues, create the opportunities and represent them with the same dedication that he has shown on other occasions in relation to this issue. There is some unfinished business which I want to conclude on, unfinished business that the government has chosen to ignore. Since January last year, all goods allegedly dumped from China are priced as if they come from a free market economy. Does anyone in this chamber believe that China is a free market economy? Stick up your hands if you believe it. Come on, stick up your hand, Minister. you believe it is a free market economy? No matter how much the production and sale government controlled, the government class it now as a free market economy. They created the problem more than a year ago when they decided to treat goods from China on a case by case basis, apparently as a tradeleading off for the botch-up over the DIFF scheme. in a mess. Alexander Downer mucks it up, so Tim Fischer goes over and says to the Chinese, 'Well, we're going to fix this up, we'll treat you as a free market economy,' without of understanding the consequences. They introduced mishandled the matter in a way that has resulted in all goods from China being sidered as sourced from a free market. In case of glyphosate, that was in the face overwhelming evidence that export and domestic pricing of glyphosate from China was government controlled. We asked this question in the House, and the minister was talking only about export prices. But I again refer him to the letter which we have tabled in this parliament-he's laughing now because he knows he has no answer-from the Ministry of Chemical ished Industry of People's China, a notice about coordination meeting for pricing of glypstatus hosate. This is the free market at work. all get together in a room, and we coordinate the price. It is called price fixing, Minister. That is what it is called. This letter says the industry: ... have decided to call a conference for coordilost nation of Glyphosate prices. Through the event, it is hoped that through the efforts, studies on the exprices and export price limit will be well studied. That meeting took place on 10 October. Here we have the minute. We have the indication as to what they are discussing-fixing prices for glyphos ate-and this dopey government still calls it a free market. I will tell you what happened as a result of China being treated that way in relation to glyphosate. We lost an $80 million investment by Monsanto in this country. It can go now to Argentina. It is not too late, as I am told, for this investment to be revived, but only if this government is prepared to act to reverse its stupidity. No other country in the OECD Do treats product from China in this way-not one, just Australia, out there leading stupidly, are like the Prime Minister (Mr Hqward) in Thailand the other day with the glasses fogged up. Like Mr Magoo he was-the leader of the nation not knowing where he was going. And this is another example of your stupidly, because you get yourselves In February 1997 the government announced it would legislate to fix this problem its own making. Yet the legislation was not into the parliament until June, and even then it was woefully inadequate. Since conthen, 11 months ago, nothing has happened. the That bill finally passed the House of Repreof sentatives but has since been languishing on the Senate Notice Paper. The government has refused to bring it on for debate in the Senate, even though hundreds of jobs and at least one major investment-the $80 million one I talked about before-have been lost offshore. It now seems certain that the government is going to go to an election without this vital issue solved. So, whilst we welcome the bill, we will be monitoring it-and there is unfinbusiness. What I cannot understand is the when you have this issue of China and its as a free market economy when it We should not be, when you are talking about introducing legislation and priority in these last sitting weeks of the parliament-why this that is not being pressed in the Senate. I cannot understand it, Minister, and more jobs will be because of your inaction. (Time expired)",35
30,Mrs GASH,COMMITTEE,"I rise to speak on behalf of the residents of Gilmore, particularly those who work at the Shoalhaven Paper Mill at Bomaderry in the Shoalhaven and at the Manildra Starch Factory. I also speak on behalf of all the other producers in my electorate of Gilmore who are against unfair dumping by foreign companies. I also rise to speak for all Australians who like to buy Australian products and, in doing so, know that what they are buying is actually made here, therefore providing jobs for local people and investment for our future. As one example, the Shoalhaven Paper Mill has been lobbying for some time for tougher country of origin labelling and anti-dumping rules. I applaud the actions of the proactive Paper Action Community Team, which has been vigilant in its scrutiny of paper products entering Australia and of the monitoring of labelling. They have also been very active in promoting this issue in the wider community and in educating the public about buying Australian products in paper and all manner of goods. In fact, I urge all members and senators to ensure that their staff are instructed to buy and use only Australian made paper-preferably that from the Shoalhaven Paper Mill. It was this government which had the guts and foresight to change the unfair rules on anti-dumping that Labor maintained during its 13 years. It was this government which has further protected the Made in Australia and Product of Australia labelling to protect Australian jobs after 13 years of Labor doing nothing. Actions speak louder than words. When the Buy Australian Made campaign first began, it aimed at effectively cashing in on two underlying principles which exist in Australia: that of an honest day's work for an honest day's pay and that of protecting your own. Of course we like to buy Australian Made products, but it takes just that little bit of encouragement to get over the cargo cult nature of Australia and to show us all that we can do it as well as-if not better than-the rest of the world. And we can. In my electorate of Gilmore there are a large number of exporters, many of them in family businesses which are pushing the boundaries into the world's marketseverything from surf-wear to starch, flowers and, of course, paper. Until now, it has been relatively easy to market a product as Australian Made or as a Product of Australia, with scant regard to what that really means. That is because the definitions and identifications on the labels were so loose, making it possible for something to be mostly imported, have a final touch-up in this country and be stocked on shelves as Made in Australia. Shoalhaven Paper Mill is the only Australian producer of specialty papers. Some members may remember the paper and printing industry display held here last year to promote Australian made ingenuity, innovation and creativity. particularly that of the Shoalhaven. And local manufacturers are being rewarded with major contracts for all sorts of products-from simple cardboard box designs to, for example, security-safe watermarked paper such as Shoalhaven mill does for my stationery. Australian Made and Product of Australia labels protect the jobs of Australian manufacturers and workers. Protecting the identity associated with these labels encourages an environment which allows Australian innovators, business people and their staff to research and develop new ideas, new products and new technologies in the knowledge that they will be supported not only through the substantial research and development grants offered by this government but also through product protection when it is in the marketplace. I commend the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss) on these pieces of legislation which have been welcomed by the residents of the Shoalhaven, particularly those in the paper mill and in other industries which face competition from imports from overseas countries. While we are on the topic of imports, I despair at the way the Labor Party is denigrating the importance of the ship Columbus Canada, which has been blockaded by the International Transport Federation at the behest of the MUA. This ship carries very important material for export to United States markets from the Manildra starch plant at Bomaderry. There have been no words or action from my Labor opposition on that important issue-and no wonder when Labor members are being told to contribute $50 a week to threaten the jobs of workers and staff at Manildra in support of the refusal by wharfies to unload the ship. Mr Martin-On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: I was prepared to remain silent while the honourable member for Gilmore debated anti-dumping but in fact talked about another bill.",36
31,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEE,Mr Nehl)Could we have your point of order rather than argument. Mr Martin-She was talking about the wrong bill a little earlier and I was prepared to let that go. She is now talking about something which is completely different from the contents of this anti-dumping bill. I ask you to direct her to come back to the bill before the House.,38
32,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEE,I thank the honourable member. The honourable member for Gilmore will of course address the contents of the bill.,38
33,Mrs GASH,COMMITTEE,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The bills are interrelated. In relation to the new anti-dumping and country of origin legislation, both of which are being welcomed as a major boost for local industry, I would like to outline just what has been done. From now on, Made in Australia will mean exactly that and Product of Australia will mean it is Australian, not Indonesian, American or French with a green and gold stripe on it or a Southern Cross stuck on the package. Under this legislation, Product of Australia labelling can be used only on items with 100 per cent Australian content. In terms of anti-dumping, there will now be faster investigations of claims against unfair practices by foreign companies and quicker countervailing measures to help protect local industry and local jobs. The government has responded to the calls by industry to take action and the result is a huge improvement on the lack of security which was left as a legacy of the previous government's inaction on these matters.",38
34,Mr MARTIN,COMMITTEE,"We are in fact debating anti-dumping laws in this parliament this morning, that is, the Customs Legislation (Anti-dumping Amendments) Bill 1998 and the Customs Tariff (Anti-dumping) Amendment Bill 1998. In her efforts a moment ago, the honourable member for Gilmore (Mrs Gash) mentioned anti-dumping two or three times and no more and gave scant regard to one of the major examples of anti-dumping that effects her own electorate-the Shoalhaven Paper Mill. As I also represent the Illawarra region, it does not surprise me that she could only find a couple of seconds to talk about the Shoalhaven Paper Mill because she has virtually been silent in her own community about this, in stark contrast to the efforts of Sandra MCCarthy-the ALP's candidate for the forthcoming election. Sandra MCCarthy has met with PACT, the Papermill Action Community Team, as have 1. Sandra MCCarthy has been throughout the community with a petition-which, coincidentally, was tabled with 1,034 signatures on it in this parliament on Monday of this week. What have we seen from the member for Gilmore with respect to this? Some throwaway lines about the fact that the paper mill was subject to anti-dumping complaintshaving made them themselves because of the importation of cheap Indonesian paper. It is Sandra MCCarthy who has been on the ground working with PACT and the local community in the Nowra-Bombaderry area and working with the AMWU and other union representatives to try to get a just outcome from the owners of the organisation-being Amcorand to try to get this government to do something to protect jobs. Not only do 350 people work at the Shoalhaven Paper Mill but also, according to the statistics which are put out by the mill itself in this very attractive brochure on the mill's operation and the significance of it, some 2,000 other residents are dependent on this mill through the flow-on effect. The mill represents 15 per cent of employment of the Shoalhaven and 25 per cent of employment in Nowra-Bombaderry. No wonder it is such an important issue for people in the Shoalhaven region. The members of the Papermill Action Community Team, regrettably, have found that their efforts have been thwarted because the government is not taking much notice of them. They have continued to work away to ensure that their livelihood is sustained, a livelihood that is being threatened by the importation of cheap Indonesian paper which this government has done nothing about. Mrs Gash-Where were you for 13 years?",38
35,Mr MARTIN,COMMITTEE,"It is all well and good for the member for Gilmore to say '13 years' and all the rest of it. I say to the member for Gilmore that she has now been a government member for two and a bit years in this place. She purports to represent the people of the Shoalhaven and particularly the people who work at the Shoalhaven Paper Mill, but where has been the movement by anyone of the number of Customs ministers we have seen come and go through this place in the last two years? I can understand she has a problem. One day she goes through the door of the minister for customs, but suddenly the next day he has gone, he has been replaced by somebody else. We are on about our third or fourth minister in two years. So it is no wonder they have not quite got a grip on this particular issue. When I went down and talked to the people on site at the paper mill in March this year in the company of Sandra MCCarthy and talked genuinely to them about their concerns, they were these: first and foremost, the importation and the dumping of cheap Indonesian paper, because this is a mill that makes specialty paper. This is a mill that has a fabulous recycling plant there as well. As a conseinterests quence of inaction by this government, the current $1,310 per tonne floor price is in danger of being slashed in half to around $700 if in fact this cheap paper is allowed be imported. Quite obviously, Australian producers cannot compete in that environShe ment. It stands to reason. What have we seen from the member for Gilmore? Has she been to see any of the ministers involved-the ministers with responnational sibility for consumer affairs or customs-and argued this point with them? Has she said to them that people in the Shoalhaven are concerned that there was action taken in 1994; that in 1997, Indonesia was found to dumping some of this copy paper; that applied to the ADA to have the undertakings revoked; and that the company is appealing that decision? What has she done company in appealing that decision for the 350 employees who are there? What have we heard from her in this place about it? By contrast, the ALP candidate for Gilmore, Sandra MCCarthy, the Deputy Mayor of Kiama Council, has been active in the community and has been utilising the media to try to generate some interest in this issue. She has achieved something which is not an easy thing to do; I have been trying to do it for a while and I am not sure that I have actually cracked it in the two years that I have been in opposition. She has actually been mentioned in the Business Review Weekly as being a champion of the Shoalhaven Paper Mill against the dumping procedures of Indonesia and fighting for the cause of anti-dumping. I am referring to Sandra MCCarthy, the ALP candidate for Gilmore. Not the member for Gilmore; she could not crack it and be commended for actually being out there in support. Mr Barresi interjecting",39
36,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEE,The member for Deakin will remain silent.,39
37,Mr MARTIN,COMMITTEE,"The member for Deakin might yell, scream, stamp his little foot and all the rest of it. He cannot hide the fact that the member for Gilmore has been absolutely useless and inactive in trying to protect the of her constituents in this matter. As I said, the member for Gilmore does not leave it there. 'Too little, too late' is her motto in the local area. Most people know to that this is the case-too little, too late. comes in after the event, tries to generate a bit of interest and claim all the credit for it. But Sandra MCCarthy has not done that. She has been doing an enormous amount of work to bring this issue to the attention of the media, and to the attention of the national parliament through the tabling of a petition, which we were pleased to present on her behalf this week. Sandra MCCarthy has been out there involving me, as the shadow be minister for small business and customs. She they has brought the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) to the local electorate in his capacity as the shadow minister for employto assist the ment and training. Obviously, why wouldn't we take an interest in the issue? It goes back, as my colleague the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) said, to W ollongong, where the Labor Party and the Labor shadow ministry released a press release under the heading, 'Labor to strengthen anti-dumping laws'. That let the government know that we were prepared to put some legislation in place to pick up these issues. Once again, Labor did it for the government. There was the bill. There was the response to Lawrie Willett's report. There was a piece of legislation that Simon Crean was able to bring in, and it just lay there because the government was not ever prepared to pick up what the Labor Party might have been suggesting. It is just a nonsense. When it comes back to that approach that the government has taken, one cannot get away from the way in which the current member for Gilmore has been doing the job. Look at all these headlines, Mr Deputy Speaker, in terms of what she has been able to achieve. 'Howard fails jobs pledge' says the Milton Ulladulla Times. 'Promise not worth it' says the Shoalhaven Independent. Another headline reads, 'Mill jobs petition'. And all the ,ilrticles mention Sandra MCCarthy. I look at these and I ask: where is Joanna Gash's name mentioned as being out there fighting for her constituents? Mr Hollis-Where indeed?",39
38,Mr MARTIN,COMMITTEE,"Where indeed, as my colleague the member for Throsby says, because he knows the work that Sandra has been doing. 'Mill jobs petition' - there it is again. 'More of our local jobs get the chop'there is a great headline. That is because of what this government is doing to them. Another one reads, 'More to go at mill'. If ever there was a headline over which the member for Gilmore should hang her head in shame, it is a headline like that-'More to go at mill'. The article states: It looks as though the Minister for Federal and Consumer Affairs message of relief over Indonesian dumping of paper products has come too late to save the jobs of ShoaIhaven Paper Mill workers. What an indictment of this government, what an indictment of this last in a long line of ministers for customs, and what an indictment of Joanna Gash. What does she offer the people down there? Very little. What about this article headed, 'Community support for mill'? Who is in the middle of the photograph? Sandra MCCarthy. She is gathering names on petitions, she is out in the community, talking to them and saying, 'Save the Shoalhaven mill'. We see as well the state Labor government taking an active role in this matter. As was indicated a little earlier, we do not oppose the basic thrust of what is contained in this legislation. We wouldn't, would we? At the end of the day, it was a Labor bill. Mr Hollis-It's ours.",40
39,Mr MARTIN,COMMITTEE,"It is our bill. We wouldn't go and oppose it. What the member for Hotham has indicated is that there are some issues that we would like the government to review. There are some matters that we would like to think can be tackled sensibly and at least this legislation could be got through quickly. Where has it been? The government sat on the Willett report for 18 months. Where has the legislation been? Why were they frightened to bring it into the place? I suppose they were frightened because the member for Gilmore was not out there saying to the government, 'You've got to do something about the Shoalhaven Paper Mill. It's in my electorate. It only employs 25 per cent of my constituents in Nowra and Bomaderry. But don't worry about that, we'll just let it roll along.' This legislation needs to be passed quickly. It needs to be given the consideration by this place that it deserves. The sad history of this matter is that in 1996 the coalition promised, once again, with hands on their hearts, 'We will shorten the maximum time allowed for anti-dumping from 245 days to 155 days.' It was probably a non-core promise, or it might Customs have been one of those promises that the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) described on the ABC news last night in respect of a GST-that it only lasts for one election period. Maybe it is one of those sorts of promises. Mr Hollis-Not 'never ever' !",40
40,Mr MARTIN,COMMITTEE,"A 'never ever' promise, Mr Deputy Speaker. Mr Barresi-It's better than a 'l-a-w, law' promise.",40
41,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEE,"Order! The honourable member for Deakin will remain silent, and so will other members.",41
42,Mr MARTIN,COMMITTEE,"He is more to be pitied than rebuked, Mr Deputy Speaker. The simple fact is that over time what we have seen is a promise which we now know is non-core. We saw a report in June 1996 after the change of government. Here they were, hands on hearts, saying, 'We'll look after anti-dumping. We'll keep those Indonesians out of the paper mills. We will protect jobs in the Shoalhaven.' Mr Barresi-So we will.",41
43,Mr MARTIN,COMMITTEE,'So we will.' When are you going to do it? When are you going to get around to doing it?,41
44,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEE,"Order! Mr Barresi-Tell them about the DuPont factory closing in my electorate, and you guys did it.",41
45,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEE,Order! The honourable member for Deakin will allow the honourable member for Cunningham to continue his remarks in silence. I also ask honourable member for Cunningham to direct his remarks through the chair.,41
46,Mr MARTIN,COMMITTEE,"As I was saying before I was interrupted, in June 1996 the report was tabled. It made recommendations; it was not just a throwaway report. It was not something the government could turn its back on. It was a substantial report on anti-dumping measures. We found, 18 months later, that there had been no action. On 24 November 1997, Labor took the lead role and suggested how this might be approached and introduced into the parliament some private members' bills which we find now are reflected in the government's legislation. Here it is, the end of May 1998, and we are finally getting around to debating what most of us would recognise as one of the most significant issues in Australia: the fight against anti-dumping measures. How many times in the last 13 years have I been in this place and heard people talk about the need to protect Australia's producers from anti-dumping? My very good friend the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) sits over there nodding in agreement. I have listened to his complaints in this place about the importation of orange juice. He has been religious in his fervour when putting the views of his constituents about that issueand courageously so. But, once again, why did it take so long to get here? Why is it that when we make suggestions to members on the government side about this, when we say to them, 'Look, here it is. Here's the bill. We put it up to you last year. Here's what you could do. Why don't you put it in place?' it takes another six or seven months before it even gets in here? The inaction of this government has been matched only by the inaction of the member for Gilmore in the way in which she has not represented her constituents at the Shoalhaven Paper Mill. The inaction of this government is only matched by the inability of the member for Gilmore",41
47,Mr ANTHONY,COMMITTEE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I gather we are talking about the Customs Legislation (Anti-dumping Amendments) Bill 1998, yet the member for Cunningham seems to be fixated by the the member for Gilmore. I ask him to address the subject, or he might like to talk about the member for Macquarie, particularly in relation to tourism there, which he has not been very supportive of.",41
48,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEE,There is no point of order.,41
49,Mr MARTIN,COMMITTEE,"Come in at half past five, and you can hear me on that too, brother.",41
50,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEE,Order! Quarrelling is not allowed.,41
51,Mr ANTHONY,COMMITTEE,"I am not his brother, and I think he should retract it.",41
52,Mr MARTIN,COMMITTEE,"Thank the Lord. Let me conclude. The honourable member for Gilmore professes to have great beliefs in anti-dumping laws and the necessity for those laws to protect her constituents in the Shoalhaven area, yet her inaction is legion. She is noted for her inability to push even the simplest issue on behalf of her constituents. This legislation needs to get through now and it needs to get through quickly to protect those people in the Shoalhaven. It needs to get through because these people in the Shoalhaven area deserve support. They deserve a better government.",41
53,Mr MILES,COMMITTEE,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister) (11.56 a.m.)-I would like to enter into this debate on the Customs Legislation (Antidumping Amendments) Bill 1998 because forest industries are very important to Tasmania, and they have been for a very long time, with a substantial number of peopleprobably one in every six or seven people-associated with or involved in the forest industries. There are two major mills in the north of the state: the Wesley Vale mill is in the electorate of the member for Lyons (Mr Adams), who I notice is here today, and the other is in Burnie, which is in the electorate I represent. There has been very active representation from both these mills on this issue. I must say that it has been a pleasure to work with people in the TasPEAC organisation who have worked very hard to make sure that everything could be done. I am, though, absolutely puzzled by some of the lines of attack which have come from the opposition on this particular issue. I notice they have put out a press release saying that we have had 622 days to bring this legislation into fruition. I want to say to the opposition that they were there for 4,745 days and they did not do this. I can remember being on backbench committees for over eight years and talking about this issue. We went to the last election saying that we would shorten the period from 250 days down to 155 days. That is what we are doing today; we are delivering on our promise. We went to the election saying that we would do something about it. The previous government was in government, I repeat, for 4,745 days and they did nothing about this particular issue even though, for at least six years prior to 1996, there were people in Australia requesting that we look at this as a country and do something about shortening the period for the anti-dumping cases which might come before Australia. The previous government were aware of this issue, so for them to come in here today and say that they are speaking in the interests of the workers of Australia really is the height of hypocrisy . We as a government are doing something about it. We have brought this legislation in here today, and we want to see it go through expeditiously. I am sure it will go through quickly in this House and I am very hopeful that it will also do so in the Senate. But that, of course, depends on the attitudes of the senators in the other chamber-those from the Labor Party, the Independents and the Democrats-as to whether we can get this legislation through in a sensible manner, get if off the agenda and get it into place. I think the overwhelming majority, if not all, of the members want to achieve that. I hope that that can be achieved also in the Senate. Given the opportunity, there are countries around the world that will dump products into our markets; there is no doubt about that. We have seen that happen in a number of instances with the paper industry in Australia. Over the last two years, the Commonwealth government has had an opportunity to do something about this. I commend the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss) for the work he has done in this area and for the decisions which have been made; he has had to exercise judgment in talking with the industry and the employees. The Wesley Vale and Burnie pulp mills are very supportive of this legislation and of the measures which the coalition government has taken. My concern in all of this is that families and workers out there who arc working very hard and being productive in this industry are given the protection they deserve. In other words, other countries around the world are not allowed to just dump products here which are below the price of production in their countries. We as a government are standing rock solid behind that with this legislation. We are also making sure that the time it takes to bring this legislation in is shorter-by almost 100 days. That is a major step forward in the anti-dumping area. The member for Hotham (Mr Crean) said that certain people have sat on their hands on this issue. I say to the Labor Party, Tasmania and the environmental movement in regard to pulp and the pulp mill workers that it would have been most acceptable in Tasmania to have a world-class, modern, up-to-date and efficient pulp mill built at Wesley Vale. The political liaison between the then Senator Richardson and the leader of the Greens in Tasmania was fundamental to skittling the opportunity to have a world-class mill established in Tasmania. We probably would not be debating as vigorously the issue of the paper industry in northern Tasmania if that mill had been established. Unfortunately, it has not been established and the window of opportunity for a highly productive mill in Tasmania has been missed. I hope that can be resurrected at some stage, that the window of opportunity will come again. It is a great tragedy for the families and workers who have worked hard to be productive in this industry with the gear and equipment they have that that world-class mill went by the board-a $1.2 billion project. It was due to the antics of former Senator Richardson and the Greens. I do not think anybody can overestimate the cost of the environmental debate to Tasmania, which was brought into Tasmania by the radical Green movement. It is one of the reasons why, economically, Tasmania has not performed so well over the last decade and why unemployment is marginally higher than in other parts of Australia. This issue is very important to many families on the north-west coast of Tasmania. I have no doubt that they are delighted that this legislation is coming in. They are constantly in touch. In particular, I would like to congratulate Peter Spinks and Royce Webster for the work of their committee on TasPEAC. They have worked extremely hard on this issue for the workers. I hope that in the future companies and the community-everybodywill stand by them in their efforts to make this industry productive and effective. Tasmania should have the opportunity to have a world-class industry in paper and pulp; there is no doubt about that. Finally, it has been disappointing that, even though the members of the AMWU have really worked hard on this issue, one of the unions, the CFMEU, has been very lukewarm in fighting this issue. It has not been as aggressive as the AMWU in fighting for its workers. A tremendous amount of work has been done by TasPEAC, and I congratulate them for that. I am sure that everybody in northern Tasmania will be delighted when this legislation goes through. I commend the bill to the House.",42
54,Mr ADAMS,COMMITTEE,"The honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles) has put the loss of the pulp mill in northern Tasmania, at Wesley Vale or other sites, down to former Senator Richardson and the Green movement. The Green movement played a role in putting bars on the table, like the closing of the loop on how to get rid of the effluent from the mill, which was not possible at the time in either engineering or science terms. The real sinker of that mill was the vote in the Senate, where the Liberal senators voted against resource legislation. That came about because of disagreement within the forest industries. That was the decision which actually sank that mill. The member for Braddon had better look at a bit of history to find out exactly what occurred to sink that mill. When I spoke on the Customs Legislation (Anti-dumping Amendments) Bill 1998 before, I was concerned about the time this had taken-and still am-especially with the recommendations of the Willett anti-dumping report. We are nearly into June, almost a year after the legislation was first brought into parliament, and we have still had no actionuntil now. The honourable member for Braddon said that this had been an issue for years. Anti-dumping in the paper industry was not an issue that ever came before me in the last parliament. I have never received any letters or had representations on it at all and I have been involved in many forestry issues and in many debates within my state supporting forest based industries. This is an issue that came forward and needed to be dealt with by this parliament. The debate started in 1996 when the Willett report was submitted to government in September, with its four major recommendations. Nothing happened. That is the truth of the matter. The government received the report with its recommendations and it sat on it. The Labor Party put a private member's bill into the parliament with the recommendations in it in an endeavour to move the government along a bit, and it was only then that we were able to reach the conclusion where we now have this response, which is very close to Labor's private member's bill. Despite those delays, it is still important for us to get this legislation passed and onto the books-in fact, it is really becoming very critical because the paper mills in Burnie and Wesley Vale have been under serious threat during the past year through the dumping of wood-free coated paper sheets. Many jobs have already been lost as a result of this unfair trading practice. These jobs may well have been saved if our anti-dumping laws had been reformed before now and many Tasmanian families would not have had to lose their breadwinners and sacrificed so much. This is ongoing. We must put this bill into practice without delay. The major amendments proposed provide for a tightening up of the time scales and of the way in which investigations are treated and creates a new body, the Trade Measures Review Office. It also removes provisions allowing Australia to take retaliatory countervailing action against another country. It is claimed that this provision in the act is contrary to WTO obligations. It is not just the coated paper question that worries me about this and raises my curiosity about this bill. I believe that other products are being similarly affected in Australia today. The latest that has come to my notice is the pork industry. I am sure that many members in the House have been hearing from pork producers. I believe that subsidised pork is being dumped in Australia and is causing farmers here to go out of business. In my own electorate, there are people who are going out of business because of the price they are being offered for pork. Australia is very open to dumping because we have lowered our tariffs and dropped our bounties on a wide range of goods, and yet we are still allowing subsidised imports from other countries. This is having a terrible impact on Australian pig farmers. Some figures were given to me the other day: it is estimated that pig farmers throughout Australia are losing $3.5 million per week. Because of the 5.5 times flow-on effect to other rural enterprises, this means that over $19 million is being bled from rural and regional Australia every week. While the market problems are not entirely caused by subsidised imports, these have had a disproportionate effect comparcd with the actual volume. If there had not been open slather imports from September 1996 to December 1997, then the current crisis would not have occurred. Dumping is being allowed in the interests of so-called free trade. This does not make sense when it is sacrificing a good and keen market. The last official ABARE figures show a gross farm gate value of $589 million for the 1995-96 financial year. This sort of damage is not to be tolerated and we could well come up with other anti-dumping rules to protect this industry. I have seen figures which show that Canadian pork is landed in this country at between 50c and 80c per kilogram under the Australian production cost. Canada admits that subsidies of some 15 per cent are still in place as compared with Australia's nil subsidy situation. The labelling laws do not allow the consumer to properly identify the 100 per cent Australian product, so people cannot see whether they are buying an Australian product or one from somewhere else. There is a need to implement effective country of origin labelling laws, with adjustment measures for pork producers. That needs to be brought into the parliament as quickly as possible. Many would prefer to buy local pork if they could and if they could tell the difference between Canadian pork and Australian pork. There needs to be a good way of telling the difference for the consumer. So labelling needs to be addressed and not talked about, as the government continues to do. We should be getting it into the parliament as soon as possible. There is a motion on the books in the Senate to investigate whether the level of imports has been the primary cause of the pig industry's problems and, if so, whether we take action under the World Trade Organisation provisions. It is important that these amendments be put in place without delay. Under the WTO provisions for emergency protection of an industry, the agreement on safeguards section of the Uruguay Round agreement on GATT provides that: A member may apply a safeguard measure to a product only if that Member has determined pursuant to certain provisions that such a product is being imported into its territory in such increased quantities, absolute or relative to domestic production, and under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause serious injury to the domestic industry that produces like or directly competitive products. I believe that that is occurring. I believe that there is sufficient evidence flowing from the industry that there is a case under the WTO, but we need to clean up our act first and put the wording right in our own customs legislation to make sure that we are not disadvantaged. There are also 12,000 Australian people who are directly employed throughout regional Australia and many more indirectly employed whom we have to think about. It is interesting that, while we bend over backwards to open our doors to trade and try our best to roll a good level playing field, there is always someone out there waiting to take advantage of us. I am sure that we are not totally squeaky clean either and our companies will look at as many loopholes as they can find in other countries' trade laws to see where they can make a break as well. This is, after all, what we call competition. But, while companies fight out their market shares, the producers on the bottom are fighting to survive. Most are not party to this endgame, and they see their hard-earned living flowing out of their pockets and into those of another country. Those in government have to walk the tightrope of being fair to export companies and their suppliers, many of whom these days come from different parts of the world. However, I still believe a country has a right to favour its own producers because they are their economic base. There are some differences with the bill, as the opposition's amendments attest. I am concerned, for instance, that the new Trade Measures Review Office will become a de facto anti-dumping authority. I am also concerned as to whether the assurances on more stringent conditions applying to seeking and verifying information will be carried through-very important issues in this paper debate. Getting the information and the time lines on those things are very important. These two issues have not been adequately addressed through the amendments, but we cannot wait any longer. So I support the quick passage of this bill. I will certainly be keeping an eye on it-how it is implemented and how it applies to the industries that are so vitally important to my area.",43
55,Mr COBB,COMMITTEE,"It is with great pleasure that I support the Customs Legislation (Anti-dumping Amendments) Bill 1998 and the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill 1998. I, like one of the previous speakers, note that we have been in government now for 622 days. We are bringing in these anti-dumping bills today to be sped through the parliament, and the next bill to be discussed is the Trade Practices Amendment (Country of Origin Representations) Bill 1998. That will also be put through the parliament today. The previous government had 4,745 days to do something but delivered nothing. So I believe the ministers responsible are to be congratulated. The definition of 'anti-dumping' probably should be discussed up-front. If a product from overseas is sold in this country at a lower price than it is sold on the domestic market in its country of origin, that, in simple terms, is what dumping is all about. It is not when a product is sold cheaper here than the local product; it is only if it is sold cheaper here than in its domestic market. Some may ask why you would possibly object to someone wanting to sell you something cheap. Surely logic tells you that most objections will be against someone who wants to rip you off and sell you a product at a higher price than the cost of production plus a reasonable profit. That is a fair question. We have to keep that in perspective. There is no law in this country against someone from overseas selling a product at an unconscionably high price, but we are debating todaysome may say, strangely enough-someone wanting to sell us a product for a cheap price, below the cost of production. Why do we want to have laws against someone wanting to sell their product here for a low price because surely that benefits our consumers and, in some cases, benefits industry? We have tariffs, for example, against cars coming into this country, and not so long ago I think it added $5,000 to the cost of a car. We have tariffs against chemicals coming into the country, and that, for example, disadvantages farmers who have to pay a price higher than they otherwise would. We have that inherent sort of contradiction because, domestically, we have laws against people who want to sell products and make excessive profits on them. We try to encourage competition in that way. We want businesses not only in our own country but also around the world to compete on an equal footing. We do not want an overseas country dumping a product in Australia, wiping out the industry in this country and then perhaps coming back at a later time and charging a higher price. When a business is set up, a lot of investment, heartache and expertise go into it. People often take jobs in that industry. They commit their lifestyles to it. If they are being wiped out for ridiculous reasons, it is something that we should think about getting rid of, and that is what this legislation is about. Australian businesses, of course, still have to compete against not only other producers producing the same or alternative products in their own country but also overseas producers. If the overseas producers can put the product into this country on an equal footing but cheaper, so be it. That is what competition is all about, both domestically and internationally. Here we are talking about products that are dumped in this country, destroying legitimate producers. One or two previous speakers have mentioned the pork industry. I have a number of pork producers in my electorate, and they are going through a terrible time at this stage. It is costing them around $1.90 to $2 a kilogram to produce, and they are getting something between $1.30 and $1.70 for their product. If they are selling sows going out of production, they are getting only about 50c or so. They are suffering terrible losses in some cases. Some are suffering losses of up to $2,500 to $3,000 a week staying in business. It is interesting to go through some of the reasons why the pork producers are making a loss at the moment. Part of that reason, no doubt, is that there is pork coming in from Canada and there is talk of it coming in from Denmark and possibly other countries in the future. The volume of pork coming into this country from Canada has risen to about five per cent of the market, but the last figures I saw show that the volume of pork in the high value area-that is, the leg hams-is now 27.4 per cent of the market. It is not so much the volume coming in but the overhang on the market and the uncertainty that it is creating that is helping force prices down. There are other factors, too. One of the main factors is the high cost of production these days. Grain prices have been relatively high, at least until recent times, and alternative meats which consumers can switch to, such as beef, have been very depressed. As a beef producer myself, I am acutely aware of this. With recent rains, particularly in eastern Australia, there has been somewhat of an upturn in beef prices and it is to be hoped that pork prices will also increase. I do note that we have had a significant fall in the exchange rate in recent weeks, particularly over the last couple of weeks, which was mainly due to the Indonesian situation. That will help the pork producers too by forcing the cost of the imported product up. It will also help our exports. I compliment the government and the pork industry for the efforts that have been made in recent times to get export markets in pork. That has not been done until relatively recently. The July to February figures show that we are now exporting up to 50 per cent more pork in volume and value than we are importing into this country, and that is a market which is obviously going to grow. We have had a lot of debate in this country over the last five to 10 years about the dumping of citrus product into Australia, mainly the frozen concentrate area. But because of efforts that have been made to export citrus from this country under the new World Trade Organisation rules, our exports of citrus last year were $175 million and our imports of citrus were only a little more than $50 million. In other words, we are exporting 3Y2 times more than we are importing. If we had paid heed to the calls to shut down the imports of citrus into this country, the consequences-under world trading rules and action that would have been taken against us-would have meant that we would have lost all of our exports, and surely we would not want to see that happen, particularly as citrus is starting to take off. While the pork industry may be five to 10 years behind the citrus industry in terms of developing export markets, already we are exporting more pork than we are importing, and I believe the future in that regard is reasonably bright. But the question is what we can do with the dreadful situation that the pork producers will face in the year or two or more that it is going to take to develop those industries more. That is where we have to exercise our minds on how we can help them. One other area is improving the situation on our waterfront and reducing the costs there. I was alarmed to read in the paper this morning about the Columbus Canada, which has been black-banned from unloading in Los Angeles. It is now sailing back to New Zealand so the cargo can be unloaded by both union and non-union labour, ironically, and put on another ship to be taken back to America. That ship has on it a container of lamb and, if the media reports are correct, the expiry date on that lamb has now passed. I do think that is an absolute tragedy. It is almost high treason what has happened in that regard. Mr Hollis-They were warned of the consequences.",45
56,Mr COBB,COMMITTEE,"There is an interjection that, 'They were warned of the consequences' - as if that justifies the action. Mr Hollis-Of course it does.",47
57,Mr COBB,COMMITTEE,"He says, 'Of course it does.' in What an incredible attitude from the opposition. There is a little town near my electorate called Manildra which mills wheat. It has fought for years to overcome the European anti-dumping action of wheat gluten into America. That has involved people from the American President down and at last the Manildra Group has won access of wheat gluten into America and I congratulate them on their efforts. Today they hold 50 per cent of the American market of wheat gluten, despite America's wheat production, because we have been able to argue the case to stop dumping from the European producers and manufacturers. But what has happened? We have 36 containers on the Columbus Canada which could not be off-loaded in Los Angeles, and those 36 containers are sailing back to New Zealand too to be off-loaded by union and non-union labour and put on another ship to go back to America. What absolute madness it is in this country today that we are so dictated to by these irrational trade unionists. It is just killing production in this country and thwarting people who are trying to do the right thing, trying to earn export income for Australia and trying to get rid of these stupid trade barriers. Yet we have our own people stepping in and having ships banned. With those words, I congratulate the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss), who has just sat down at the table, for the work he has done in this area in bringing forward good and workable legislation to the parliament. I sympathise greatly with the dire situation that the pork producers are going through at this stage, and it is to be hoped that we can help them in every way we can. I commend the legislation to the House.",47
58,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEE,"I am pleased to speak on this anti-dumping legislation. The member for Gilmore (Mrs Gash) made much in her speech about the anti-dumping measures announced by the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss) in Nowra recently. What the member for Gilmore has not explained to this House is why it took this government so long to implement these measures, why it took months and months of pressure from Labor, two private members' bills and an Asian economic crisis to finally move this slowmoving government to repair some of the damage caused by its neglect of the anti-dumping legislation. This government has in fact picked up Labor policy. Of course, the Shoalhaven Paper Mill at Bomaderry was under considerable pressure because of the dumping of cheap paper on the Australian market. The member for Gilmore, who made much in her election campaign two years ago about not seeing jobs go from the Shoalhaven and about how she was not going to stand for unemployment, was prepared to see jobs being lost at the Shoalhaven Paper Mill because of the inaction of this government. As my friend and colleague the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) said, contrast this with the action of the ALP endorsed candidate, Sandra MCCarthy, in that seat. Here I have over 40 press releases and statements by Sandra MCCarthy, the endorsed ALP member, on the work that she has been doing in that area with the paper mill action team. She has been petitioning local residents, working with key personnel in that area and working with the community to make sure jobs at the Shoalhaven Paper Mill are saved. Labor has constantly pushed for protection of Shoalhaven jobs. Nevertheless, we welcome-regardless of how blatant it is-the government falling in behind Labor on industry policy. But we deplore the fact that it taken almost 18 months to get this far. The point is that the Willett review has been in the hands of the government since September 1996. They sat on it. They did absolutely nothing while jobs were being lost offshore. Many new investments went begging while the government sat on this report. We have always said that we will put into place the key recommendations of the report. As part of the 1996 election, the coalition promised to shorten the maximum time allowed for an anti-dumping complaint from 245 to 155 days. The report was commissioned in June 1996 to recommend means of achieving this end. The report was submitted to the government in September 1996, and there were lots of recommendations in it. On 24 February 1998, the government announced its response to the report. The government position very closely matched that announced by Labor three months earlier. Three months earlier, Labor called on the government to urgently introduce its own legislation to implement the decision. Subject to the detail matching the promise, we gave a commitment to ensure rapid passage of the bill-and we will do that. We are not, as the minister at the table knows, opposing this bill. The bill does appear to meet the spirit of the Willett recommendations while modifying the approach in some cases. Its main provisions include the abolition of the Anti-Dumping Authority to transfer to Customs the responsibility for the conduct of investigations-and one does not argue with that; provisional measures available after 60 days of an investigation; a 15S-day total investigation timetable, including a statement of essential facts to be issued after 110 days, 20 days for parties to respond to this, and then 25 days for Customs to complete their investigations and make their recommendations to the minister; investigators to have the power to disregard late submissions; and the creation of a new body, the Office of the Trade Measures Review Officer, to review a dumping decision where parties feel the decision is flawed. This review will take 60 days but will has not reopen the case, as occurs now with the ADA. In the main, as I and other speakers have said, Labor supports this legislation. As the shadow minister has said, we want to know if the Trade Measures Review Office will become a de facto anti-dumping authority, and if the assurances of more strengthened conditions applying to seeking and verifying information will be carried through. Labor wants to strengthen anti-dumping measures. Why should the workers at the Shoalhaven Paper Mill have to compete unfairly with imports, especially imports of cheap Indonesian paper? Imports at cost do not reflect the cost of production. We in Labor will fight to protect jobs at the paper mill, as indeed our candidate, Sandra MCCarthy, has been doing for the last months. She has been out there pounding the streets of Bomaderry with the petition, getting people to sign it, fighting tooth and nail to save jobs in t.he Shoalhaven. We are also concerned to save jobs in the other regions of Australia. Because of the inaction of this government and because of the delay, we have still got problems at the Shoalhaven Paper Mill. The plant is to shut down again on 11 June because of the backlog of dumped paper that they cannot sell. There have been 622 days of inaction by the government and by the federal member for Gilmore. On 11 June, 400 workers will be suspended from their jobs. This government could not be bothered to introduce the necessary legislation. Two thousand people in the Shoalhaven signed the petition put about by the ALP candidate, Sandra MCCarthy. This petition has been tabled in the parliament and, I might say-and the honourable member for Cunningham will agree with meMr Martin-Absolutely. How many are there?",47
59,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEE,"Two thousand people signed this. And there are more to come. That petition is still going the rounds. People are wanting to sign it because they are concerned. But now the member for Gilmore, following the Labor campaign-just now, believe it or not-has her own petition. But, instead of going out into the streets, the member for Gilmore has asked people to come into her electorate office to sign it. Contrast that with what the ALP candidate is doing. She is going out and getting the signatures of people in the street. What a successful petition that will be! The priority of the government to sell Telstra meant the legislation was introduced within a fortnight. The $250 million taxpayer slush fund to payout the sacked MUA workers, which the member for Gilmore supported, was introduced to the parliament in a matter of hours. But, for 622 days, since September 1996, this government has refused to act. I am winding up now but I will divert for one moment, because of what the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) said about the ship Columbus Canada. He introduced this into the debate so I am not straying; I am just responding to a comment he made. What we have to understand is that people are concerned about ships that have been denied permission to dock. But the point I make is this: when that ship was being loaded those loading it were warned of the consequences. Regrettable as it is, they chose to disregard the consequences of what was going to happen. Before that ship was loaded, those exporters were warned that if they loaded that ship it would not be docked. They chose to disregard that. Quite frankly, they have little to complain about. That is all I am going to say about that matter. We are concerned to protect jobs in Australia, especially regional jobs, and they are at stake in the federal electorate of Gilmore. We know that our candidate is out there fighting to save jobs. When she becomes the member for Gilmore she will continue to do the excellent job that she has started to do as a candidate-fighting to save jobs, fighting against this dumping of Indonesian paper which is taking jobs away from the workers of Bomaderry and the Shoalhaven. May she have the strength to continue that campaign. I am sure she will. The opposition welcomes this legislation.",49
60,Mr ROCHER,COMMITTEE,"Curtin) (12.39 p.m.)There are several salient points in the proposed customs legislation that attract my attention. The Customs Legislation (AntiDumping Amendments) Bill 1998 is the more substantial of the two bills being debated cognately. It is to that bill that I propose to direct my comments. However, before examining the main bill in detail, it is useful to consider a little of the background to the anti-dumping process and procedures in Australia. Goods are dumped when they are exported from one country to another at prices less than their nonnal value. Australia can take anti-dumping action when, as a result of dumping, material injury has been or is being caused to an Australian industry, firm business producing similar goods, or when the establishment of an industry producing such goods has been, or may be, materially hinddumping ered. Australia's anti-dumping laws are the product of our obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, in the embrace of the WorId Trade Organisacases tion; the anti-dumping code; and the code subsidies and countervailing duties. The Customs Act 1901 and the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act 1975 are the principal legislative instruments. Under the current system, where an Australwould Ian firm or business lodges an application claiming dumping with the Anti-Dumping Authority, the ADA, which administers the 245 to 265 days. anti-dumping system, the ADA must first determine whether there are sufficient grounds to initiate an investigation. Within the statutory period allowed for consideration of a claim, the ADA considers several matters, including the adequacy of the price evidence produced and whether there is a causal link between the alleged dumping and injury to an Australian firm. Countervailing duties are duties imposed by the Australian government on imports to offset foreign government subsidies to producers or exporters in the exporting country. In November 1997, the House debated second reading of two cognate bills on the same subject-the Customs Legislation (AntiDumping) Amendment Bill 1997 and the two Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment not Bill 1997. The substantive legislative change proposed in those earlier bills concerned the treatment for the purpose of assessing dumptaken ing allegations of so-called 'economies in transition'. During that debate, I drew to the attention of the House the criticism made the industry anti-dumping task force of government's proposals for dealing with allegations against imports from economies in transition. I also reminded the House of the government's March 1996 election commitbill ment to the procedure for investigating dumpframe ing allegations. On 27 November 1997, in my speech during the debate on those two earlier bills, I also drew the attention of the House to the or promise made by the government in its election policy 'Reviving the Heartland' about the administrative processes for dealing with complaints. In the section of that policy headed 'Fair Trade', the now governold ment promised, amongst other things, to now reduce the inquiry period for anti-dumping so that the preliminary complaints on screening takes a maximum of five working days; the preliminary investigation takes up to 60 days, with an extension in special circumstances; and the interim measures then imposed, pending the completion of a final investigation within 90 days. If observed, that ensure that the maximum total investigation period is 155 days in other than exceptional circumstances, compared with the then As I also noted in that earlier debate, on 13 December 1996 the then minister responsible for customs, the honourable member for  government would shorten the investigation time frame not to 155 days, as promised, but to 215 days. The then minister went on to say that the government had decided to refer Australia's anti-dumping arrangements to the Productivity Commission for report in 1997 and that the government would not move for the full reduction of the investigation process the until after the commission reported. At the time of the debate on those earlier bills, in November 1997, the matter had been fonnally referred to the Productivity Commission because the tenns of reference had still not been settled. The length of time to make a finding on an anti-dumping complaint is clearly of concern to Australian businesses, and excessive delay in investigatby ing a dumping case will inevitably damage the Australian interests. At that point in my speech, I expressly urged the government to act on its election promise. I am pleased then to see that the principal purpose of the main before the House today is to cut the time for anti-dumping investigations to the promised 155 days. Mr Bruce MCAllen, the chairman of the industry dumping task force to which I referred earlier, is reported as saying that this bill delivers exactly what industry wants and that industry's only concern was how long it would take for the legislation to be enacted. The explanatory memorandum states that the principal purpose of the main bill is to give effect to the government's response to the review of Australia's anti-dumping and countervailing administration prepared by Mr Lawrie Willett AO, the report now known as the Willett report. Significant recommendations of the Willett report included amending the legislation to allow the imposition of interim duties after 60 days of an investigation has elapsed if there is sufficient information to warrant such action. The Willett report recommended abolishing the ADA and giving Customs responsibility for the entire period of investigation. Furthermore, the report recommended a model that would allow the government, in line with its stated policy, to cut the inquiry period to 155 days. The main bill provides for the ADA to be abolished and for the Customs Service to take on the responsibility for the conduct of dumping investigations. In a procedure similar to that recommended by Willett, the government will implement its policy of reducing that investigation period to 155 days. As with the Willett proposal, provisional countervailing duties could be imposed on imports from the 60th day of an investigation. A new element proposed by the government in the main bill we are discussing is the creation of a public office of Trade Measures Review Officer, or TMRO, who will be charged with reviewing whether dumping action should be taken in a particular circumstance. I understand from what the minister has had to say that the TMRO would not have the power to reinvestigate the dumping allegations but rather its function would be limited to considering an appeal based on the arguments raised in the existing investigation. The reason we have been given for this is to ensure that dumping inquiries are resolved as quickly as possible and to provide certainty in the marketplace. I welcome the government's implementation of its election commitment, however belated that implementation. While I do not advocate special protection for our own industries, it is important and only right that they are treated fairly if they are to compete in international and domestic markets. The only other observation I would make is that the main bill will add new sections such as 269ZDB and 269ZZQ to the Customs Act 1901. That numbering of these new sections sounds dangerously like something we get from our old friends in the Australian Taxation Office in relation to the Income Tax Assessment Act. I hope the minister will be at pains to ensure that the Customs Act is not left in the same unwieldy mess as the Income Tax Assessment Act has been.",49
61,Mr TRUSS,COMMITTEE,"in reply-I am very happy to participate in the debate on the Customs Legislation (Anti-Dumping Amendments) Bill and the Customs Legislation (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill by way of summary. This legislation, I have to say, gives me a great deal of personal pleasure. I can recall raising problems in relation to anti-dumping measures in my own maiden speech in federal parliament. So I am pleased now as the minister to be able to bring legislation to the House which I believe will correct the serious deficiencies that exist in the legislation at the present time. I have listened with interest to the comments of honourable members. I would certainly like to thank those members who have contributed to the debate for their support for the legislation. It is perhaps a bit of a pity that this bipartisanship has been somewhat spoiled by some of the personal attacks by members of the opposition on the performance of government members. Let us make it abundantly clear right at the beginning of the debate: the anti-dumping measures we are correcting by this legislation were measures introduced by Labor in 1988. When Labor criticise the current system, when they say it is defective, they are criticising their own act, their own rules, their own regulations. I agree that they are right to criticise the current arrangements because they have not served Australian industry well and there is a need to speed up the process. In this legislation the government is giving effect to its election promise to deliver a ISS-day examination period for anti-dumping inquiries and to ensure that Australian industries have speedy relief where there are proven allegations of unfair dumping or subsidisation. The shadow minister, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), also suggested that the government could have speeded this process up by simply taking up Labor's draft bill. Labor's draft bill-I have brought it along-is some 2S pages. The bill before the House is 84 pages. I am not one of those people who necessarily believe that legislation is better just because it is longer, but I would make the point that it ought to be pretty apparent to everyone that legislation that only took 24 pages has failed to address the issues that are associated with these particular matters. The shadow minister was also critical of the comments made on radio by the member for MCMillan (Mr Broadbent) that the legislation was defective. In that regard, the member for MCMillan is absolutely correct. The department of foreign affairs concluded that many of the substantive provisions included in the opposition's proposed bill were inconsistent with our international obligations and exposed Australia to the likelihood of international criticism and the potential for a challenge before the W orId Trade Organisation's dispute settlement panel. The areas of defect included the lack of procedural fairness and the absence of any kind of effective review process. What Labor had proposed in their legislation was simply a mechanism for internal review. The concept of an investigating authority conducting an internal review on its own findings would certainly have called into question the credibility and impartiality of the entire process. Their legislation was defective in a range of other areas which made it impossible for it to be used as a basis for an effective review of these matters. Mr Crean-Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: could I ask that that reference from the department of foreign affairs be tabled?",51
62,Mr TRUSS,COMMITTEE,It is not a point of order. Mr Crean-On the point of order: it is a request. Will you table it; what do you have to hide? Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Hon. J.A. Crosio)-Order! The tabling of a document is not a point of order. The minister is in reply in the second reading debate.,52
63,Mr TRUSS,COMMITTEE,"I will reply also to some of the other matters that have been raised by the opposition in their contributions to this debate. They sought an assurance in relation to the operation of the Office of the Trade Measures Review Officer. The member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) and also the shadow minister asked for an assurance that this would not be an ADA, an Anti-Dumping Authority, by another name. I think that their comments reflect their lack of understanding about anti-dumping procedures and the way in which their own system had worked in the past. Australia has a two-stage system for processing dumping and subsidy complaints in which two agencies undertake an investigatory function. On receipt of an application, Customs undertakes an investigation leading to a preliminary finding which, if positive, proceeds to the second agency. The ADA investigation takes the form of a fresh inquiry, or a de novo review, where all interested parties arc invited to submit additional information to further their cases whether or not those parties were a part of, or cooperated in, the Customs preliminary investigation. So the comments of the shadow minister that sometimes there is new evidence considered is an inaccuracy. New evidence is considered virtually always. It is the investigative role of the ADA which industry criticises as leading to duplication, additional cost and delays and which allows parties to withhold information from the Customs preliminary investigation in the knowledge that it is possible to introduce that evidence before the ADA. It is a policy objective of the new system that investigations should need to be done only once, but thoroughly. All interested parties will be given every opportunity to fully participate in the investigation in order to protect their interests. All interested parties will be notified of the initiation of an investigation and will be invited to lodge submissions. A public file will be maintained throughout the investigation. A statement of essential facts will be published on or before day 110, and interested parties will be allowed 20 days to lodge submissions in response to that statement. If an interested party chooses not to avail itself of those opportunities to participate in the investigation, it will do so in the knowledge that it will be precluded from introducing new information in the review process. Unlike the ADA, the TMRO is not to undertake an investigative function. It will perform a pure appeal function and will be limited to assessing the minister's final finding in light of the claims made in the application for appeal and based on the information that formed part of Customs investigative record. Parties cannot seek to introduce into the new review process information that was not before Customs and the minister. The TMRO also cannot substitute its findings for those of the minister. I hope that that statement will give the opposition and others who may have had an interest in this issue an assurance that we will not be reinstituting the ADA by another name. Also by way of rebuttal, I noted that the member for Hotham once again referred to his old theme of the glyphosate case in relation to China. Let us make one point again abundantly clear-it is very important in the context of this legislation-that the AntiDumping Authority dismissed the glyphosate case for this fundamental reason outlined in its report. It stated: The authority has examined Monsanto's operations and it is not satisfied that the glyphosate acid produced in Australia by the company meets the local content requirements of subsection 269T(2) of the Customs Act. That subsection requires that not less than 25 per cent of the factory cost is of the goods incurred in Australia in respect of the goods. That particular inquiry found that the glysophate made in Australia did not meet the local content rule. This legislation also deals with that matter, because we are abolishing the local content rule-getting rid of another one of the legacies of Labor's ineffective anti-dumping and countervailing duty mechanisms. I welcome the bipartisan support for this legislation, even though some of it has not been presented in a particularly charitable spirit. I would like to particularly acknowledge the tremendous support and assistance in the preparation of this legislation that I have received from people like the member for Gilmore (Mrs Gash), the member for Braddon (Mr Miles), the member for MCMillan (Mr Broadbent), the member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran), the member for Mallee (Mr Forrest), the member for Riverina (Mr Hicks) and others who have taken a key active interest in these matters. I have had the privilege of visiting the paper mills in their electorates as well as citrus growers and others who have a particular interest in these areas. Their advice has been particularly helpful. Let me say that, if the people of Gilmore want somebody who is going to be in and around and participating in making the key decisions, they would be well advised to return the member for Gilmore, Joanna Gash, who has done an excellent job in ensuring that these matters have been actively pursued. It is far more important to be here and involved and talking to the companies than preparing 42 press releases, and wandering around the streets collecting petitions which clearly have had no impact whatsoever in the development of this legislation.",52
64,Unknown,COMMITTEE,Opposition members interjectingMadam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! The minister is drawing a long bow on the bill. I call the members to order and I remind the minister to come back to the bill.,53
65,Mr TRUSS,COMMITTEE,The legislation has been prepared following thorough investigation by the government and consideration of the reports that have been commissioned in this matter. I believe we have a new system of anti-dumping and countervailing protection measures which will be welcomed by industry. There is a firm view by industry that this legislation should be given speedy passage. I would like to thank members of the government who have supported me in bringing this legislation to the House. Mr Crean-What about the opposition?,53
66,Mr TRUSS,COMMITTEE,"I also thank the members of the opposition who have agreed to vote for this comprehensive reform of the legislation, which will deliver real relief to these industries who have suffered from unfair competition from dumping or subsidised products. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Truss) read a third time. CUSTOMS TARIFF (ANTI-DUMPING) AMENDMENT BILL 1998 Second Reading Consideration resumed from 28 May, on motion by Mr Truss: That the bill be now read a second time. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Truss) read a third time. NA (COUNTRY OF ORIGIN REPRESENTATIONS) BILL 1998 Second Reading Debate resumed from 8 April, on motion by Mr Truss: That the bill be now read a second time.",54
67,Mr CREAN,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Noone would dispute that the country of origin issue-the matter that this bill seeks to address-is a very difficult issue. Before the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss) leaves, I will say that I think he has put an honest effort into resolving it; but whether he has succeeded is not so clear. The main provisions of the bill are to establish a 50 per cent and 'substantially transformed' test for the use of the Made in Australia logo; to establish a close to 100 per cent test for use of the Produce or Product of Australia test; and to allow ministerial discretion to apply a stricter test. So for value-added manufactured goods, it is a 50 per cent test, it is a much higher test if you want to call it Product of Australia, but there will be discretion for the minister to apply stricter tests in certain circumstances. This bill is similar to legislation moved by the Labor government. The chief differences are that under our bill only one test for Made in Australia existed-the essential character test. Our legislation also sought to more closely define the various origin categories. When we, as a government, brought that legislation into the House, the then coalition played crass politics with that bill of Jeanette MCHugh's. They opposed the bill, moving amendments that set a much tighter test for the Made in Australia label. Each major ingredient and all production operations had to be Australian sourced. That is what the then opposition insisted on doing to our bill. Of course, it is a much weaker test that they are putting forward today. They sought to create a new label-Manufactured in Australia-to cover the essential character category. The coalition's amendments were much tighter than proposed in Labor's bill and, interestingly, as I said before, much tighter than in this bill. The member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) is not in the' House at present but I will be interested to see whether he speaks in this debate, because he was one of those who waxed lyrical about the importance of having a system in which Made in Australia meant that nearly all the ingredients and all of the manufacturing must be sourced from Australi a. What does he think of this bill? I will be interested to hear. It is extraordinary that more than two years after the federal election the government is now trying to rush this legislation through the parliament. In essence, it is a problem of the government's own making. It wouldn't support a bipartisan approach when we were the government and it has left it to the eleventh hour, now, to bring its own legislation forward. Firstly, the government allowed the Advance Australia Foundation to fold before this legislation came in. The management of the Australia Made logo-the green and gold kangaroo, which was developed under Labor's reign-was allowed to drift. They cut the funding, in the first coalition budget, for the Advance Australia Foundation. Well, that was a real commitment to the Made in Australia logo, to the organisation that had made such headway! That was a real commitment in terms of this parliament trying to get the legislative framework properly in place by which consumers could go into stores with confidence that what they were buying would be properly described! Also, that was a real commitment to an important legislative base which could send a clear signal to manufacturers and producers in this country as to what was required of them if they were claiming their products were Australian made! The concern amongst consumer groups and some primary producers that the system may not provide accurate labelling is as much about the government's neglect of this issue as it is about any shortcomings in the plan before us today. This bill appears to provide a level of certainty and simplicity in origin labelling-something major interest groups, industry, consumers, farmers and the trade union movement agree is a premium requirement. Also, it tightens existing labelling regulations. Labor will therefore not be opposing the origin provisions of this bill in the House of Representatives and we will not be seeking to delay the bill. We note, however, that the Democrats have referred the bill to a Senate legislation committee. While the Senate legislation committee is not the approach Labor would have preferred, now that we have got it, it will provide a useful opportunithat ty to test a number of concerns that have been raised about certain provisions of this bill. will also be an opportunity to test the level support or opposition to the bill. The concerns include the impact of a 50 per cent test on domestic food manufacturers and the role of the ACCI as licensing agent for the Australia Made logo. When the bill does become law, Labor will be closely monitoring its implementation to ensure it meets the needs of all interested parties. That having been said, there is another element to this bill which I suspect the government hoped we would miss. Tucked away at the back of the bill are some 'minor amendments to the Trade Practices Act'. These allow the ACCC to take representative action on matters of alleged contravention of part IV, Restrictive Trade Practices, and these actions can be retrospective. In other words, this is a power being given to the ACCC to take class actions retrospectively, and that is tucked away in this bill. I see that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Cadman) who is at'the table is expressing some surprise about this. Perhaps he hall learnt about it for the first time, as have other members in this chamber who thought this was just about product labelling. There is a much more sinister dimension to this bill. The minister's second reading speech claimed this was part of their 'New deal: fair deal' small business package-allowing the ACCC to act on behalf of small businesses. But the real agenda was revealed by Allan Fels, the Chairman of the ACCC, on the Business Sunday program last Sunday. On that program he lamented that he did not have the power to prosecute the MUA-the Maritime Union of Australia-in these terms. He said: It was worth thinking about as an extra element in law. What a coincidence! Just like the coincidence that had the bill rushed into the parliament straight after the stevedoring levy bill-you know, the bill that was used to back the sacking of the Patrick's work force and replace it with another work force; the bill was hatched overnight in the cabinet room; the bill that the Prime Minister (Mr It Howard) and the Minister for Workplace of Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) were slapping themselves on the back and laughing about as workers were being sacked. This bill followed immediately upon it. And inside that bill, tucked away, was the provision to get the MUA again; to have another arm-another part of the weaponry-to take legal action against the MUA. These amendments are squarely aimed at giving the ACCC additional power to prosecute the MUA and to do it retrospectively. I say to the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Forrest): do not shake your head, get up and debate the point when you have got the opportunity, and tell us if we are wrong. Why is it that this was not drawn to our attention? The disgraceful thing about this episode, and it reflects very poorly on the minister and a particular business group-because these were the people who spent hours in briefing us on what they said were the important elements of the bill-was the fact that not once, in those hours of briefing given to the opposition on this bill, was this proposal mentioned. I think it is a very important issue and I would like the minister to indicate, at the appropriate time, why it was not mentioned. It is for that reason that Labor will oppose items 3 and 5 of schedule 2 of the bill. These are clearly intended to strengthen the ACCC's hand-initially against the MUA, but with wider implications down the track. They are totally unnecessary. If the government intended this class action to apply to small business, they would have included it in the fair trading bill. Mr Martin-Correct.",54
68,Mr CREAN,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"And the shadow minister for small business is indicating his agreement to that assertion. If these matters were important, why did they not go into the fair trading bill-a bill which the minister pronounced to have satisfied the trade practices needs of small business? I ask you to take notice of this point: why did the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business come into this House and assert that his fair trading bill satisfies the trade practices needs of small business and then try to sneak this particular provision in? It is true to form for the minister, I might say: the sneakiness, the clandestine operation, the continuation of the conspiracy. There were further changes recommended by the Australian Law Reform Commission. The government indicated that those changes would not be made before the release of a discussion paper responding to the commission's recommendations. That discussion paper has not been released, but the government is trying it on anyway. The government is using this bill-this otherwise worthy billto get up the obsession of the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business with bankrupting the MUA. It is true to form for the minister. The conspiracy deepens: get the MUA at any cost; use the stealth of night, together with the balaclavas and the rottweilers, to take the work force. And all that time, you were introducing legislation to penalise unions pursuing legitimate activity. Let me say this also, because it is a very important point. What we have proposed here is a new power for the ACCC to go after unions on the basis that the minister claims that monopoly unionism is stopping competition on the waterfront. Why aren't they giving more powers to the Trade Practices Commission, through the Trade Practices Act and the ACCC, to enable it to pursue the anti-competitive practices on the wharf not associated with the union-for example, the monopoly control by the port authorities, the monopoly control that saw pressure put on to keep a new operator out of the port of Melbourne? When aaCL tried to come into the port of Melbourne, Patrick's sued the Victorian government to keep aaCL out on the basis that they said they had an understanding with the Victorian government that new operators would not be let in, and then, out of the Dubai fiasco, we have Patrick's, which would not lease wharf space to another operator, aaCL, bringing in the NFF on a sublease operation. I understand that aaCL, after a year's negotiation with the Melbourne Port Authority, pulled out because, unexpectedly, they were going to be charged $600,000 per hectare per year. This is totally out of step, I am informed, with world practice, because aaCL were going to build a facility at a cost of $150 million. Do you know what the wharf charge from Patrick's to the NFF was for the same access? It was $93,000 per hectare per year. Why isn't the ACCC investigating why a potential competitor can be kept out by being priced out of the market and then when a new operator, the NFF, comes in they can get a price of $93,000 per year as against $600,000 per year? I would have thought that raised seriolls questions about competition, about access and about the ability for new operators to come in and provide additional competition. That is what the ACCC should be investigating. They should also be investigating the settlement with the Victorian government and Patrick's, the secret settlement by which Patrick's sued the Victorian government to keep OOCL effectively out of the port of Melbourne. They should also be investigating where the opportunity for new entrants to effectively come into the port of Melbourne is being made available to them-not just wharf space but equipment. I think that you will find that the Patrick group have effectively sewn up all the remaining wharf space. At the same time as the ACCC should be investigating the anti-competitive practices consequent upon the monopoly control of the Melbourne Port Authority-and any port authority, for that matter-they should also be investigating the duopoly arrangements between the stevedores: for example, the arrangements that from time to time seem to emerge, the understandings, between a Patrick's and a P&O. They should also be investigating the cartel arrangements that the shippers, which are exempt from scrutiny under part 10 of the Trade Practices Act, can get themselves into. My point is this: what we need is more competition on the waterfront. We do need improved productivity, but we also need the competition that is going to drive the efficiency. But you are not going to get it if you have monopoly port authorities, duopolies as stevedores and cartels as shippers. The truth of the matter is that, in the time Labor was in government, we oversaw a restructuring program that took the work force in stevedoring activity-on the wharves, if you like-from 10,000 workers to 3,000 workers. When you are taking a work force down by two-thirds, you would expect there to be significant productivity gains consequent upon it, but those productivity gains will be trapped by the monopolies, the duopolies and the cartels. If those arrangements exist, there is no guarantee that the benefits and the savings that come from the restructuring of the waterfront will be passed on to the user, the customer. It is that sort of anti-competitive practice that should be being investigated by the ACCC. That is what Professor Fels should be attaching his energies to doing. It is aJl very well to go off and collect the so-caJled crate loads of information against the MUA and its arrangements with the International Transport Federation. It is all very well for him to be doing that and claiming it is within his mandate, but I would have thought these other things were much more in his mandate, because industrial relations are properly the province of the Industrial Relations Commission. Unfair competition, noncompetitive practices and the ability to keep alternative operators out are clearly within the mantle of the Trade Practices Act, and it is what the ACCC should be directing its endeavours towards. We are going to oppose these sections of this bill, these sections that were not outlined to liS in our briefing discussions-these provisions which were introduced, I suspect, at the behest and insistence of the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. He has made this an urgency bill not for the product labelling aspect of it but because he wants another arrow in the quiver to fire at the MUA. It is not just the fact that this is a double standard, this sort of 'concentrate only on the union and forget about the company arrangements' that is involved, we also have the retrospectivity, because this enables the class action power to the ACCC to pursue the MUA to be taken retrospectively. In other words, the minister is finding, much to his chagrin, that small businesses are not interested in taking action against the MUA. He wants the ACCC to take it on their behalf, he wants Professor Fels to continue to do his bidding and he wants to give Professor Fels an additional power so that he can do his bidding. I do not think any objectively minded person would disagree with the notion that Professor Fels has gone overboard to hound the union and done little to go after the monopoly provisions, the duopoly provisions and the cartel arrangements in the rest of the shipping and stevedoring activities. Yet this bill not only gives the power to strengthen Professor Fels' hands to continue to do the bidding of the government but gives him a retrospective power. The government has refused to implement a national retail tenancy code with retrospectivity clauses. Why is it introducing retrospectivity in this bill? The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business and the minister responsible for this bill, the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs, should take a leaf out of the book of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer), who wrote on 9 August 1995 in his own distinctive style: I carefully note the fundamentals involved with important matter, and I have to say that I'm totally opposed to legislative retrospective detriments. You have the Deputy Prime Minister opposed to retrospectivity. Was he told about this provision when it was whacked through in cabinet? Was he, Minister? You have the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business refusing to implement retrospectivity in relation to the retail tenancy code, yet he wants to sneak it through here. We are not going to cop it, and we are going to vote against it. I would urge the minister-because I can see him looking worried and ponderous at the table at the moment-to actually reconsider these dimensions of the bill. We are urging him to take them out. They are not appropriate to be dealt with in this bill. They do not go to the issue of product labelling and country of origin. They go to nothing more than enabling Professor Fels to do more of the government's bidding in this morass that Minister Reith has created for himself, this botch job in terms of waterfront reform, this job that 10 judges to one in this country have found involved the breaking of the law and that there is an arguable case for an unlawful conspiracy-a conspiracy, we argue, between the government and Patrick's. This is another piece of legislation which perpetuates that conspiracy. That is why we will fight this. It is not appropriate to have it in here. You did not raise it in your discussions with us; you never drew our attention to it. When we signalled our support for this bill we were not aware of these provisions. We became aware of them only when going through the detail in the last few days. The Senate will not allow retrospectivity. They have not in the past, and I would be surprised if they allowed it on this occasion, particularly when they understand what nice little tricks your side has been up to. I think the problem is that the minister for workplace relations treats your side as badly as he does us. He does not tell the full story-ever. As a consequence, he gets himself into more and more strife, because people start to realise what it is he is trying to put over them. We are going to ensure that this issue is exposed. We are going to ensure that the this minister for workplace relations, having made a botch of the rest of the industrial relations issue, does not get away so easily with sneaking through a provision that enables him to get Professor Fels to do his bidding in chasing the MUA, in trying to up the stakes in terms of the damages. We have still not heard in this parliament whether the government has indemnified the minister against damages. We know they have indemnified him against the costs, but have they indemnified him against the damagesdamages consequent upon the unlawful conspiracy? The courts have found a prima facie case for the unlawful action. What we have to establish, and what the courts have to establish of course, is an increasing demonstration of the conspiracy-not that he was actively involved, directly involved or taking an act that resulted in the sacking itself; only that he facilitated, through actions, those things that led to the sacking. The minister for workplace relations will still not answer in this House, but we will make sure that when the opportunity exists in the courts for him to have to answer under oath, when the charges come on, he answers this simple proposition: was he aware in advance of the decision by Patrick's to sack its existing work force and replace it with another? That is a question he will not answer in this parliament. He tries to say that he knew nothing about the Dubai exercise, and he gets up in arms when we do not ask him a question about Dubai-deliberately nowbecause we know he has refined his defence just to Dubai. But the issue is whether he knew of or was involved in any alternative strategy by Patrick's to sack its existing work force and replace it with another. The minister will not answer that question in the parliament, but we have had it tested through a reputable polling agency. Do you know how many people believe the minister when he says that he had no involvement in that? Only 10 per cent. This is a minister that cannot be believed; this is a minister that the public have lost all confidence in. They do not trust him because this whole exercise has been a cloak and dagger process. It is almost like the Keystone Cops: you find the dogs and the guards, et cetera; police cars come along, get knocked down and bounce back up again, all in fast motion; and then they go onto a new track. This has been a Keystone Cops operation, and the fact that the government have not been able to carry it out properly not only is a reflection on the extent to which they will go to try and break a union and sack a work force through supporting corporate scam rearrangements, but fundamentally goes to the lack of competence of this government. They cannot even manage an outcome when they have been plotting and planning it for 12 months. They botch it. And now the minister, realising he has botched it, realising that he has got to up the ante on the union, finds that he has got to create more powers by which legal action can be taken against the union and the damages bill against the union can be raised. That is why the minister has hoodwinked the current minister at the table into accepting this provision in the bill. I said at the beginning that I think the minister has made a genuine attempt to deal with this difficult issue in the broad, and I congratulate him for it. But what I do not appreciate is being kept in the dark about the ramifications of these particular provisions. We will not support them. We will vote against them here, we will vote against them in the Senate, and we will expose publicly the extent to which this government is prepared to go to break a union and to support companies that are prepared to sack their workers overnight by rearranging their corporate structures. It is un-Australian and it should not be supported. We should not be giving extra powers to Professor Fels to support that un-Australian activity.",56
69,Mr FORREST,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"It is my intention to talk about country of origin labelling rather than to focus on what the previous speaker, the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean), has just irrelevantly contributed. I have sat here patiently while parliament's time has been wasted to the tune of 30 minutes whilst there are people out there who have waited a decade for the parliament to get to agree on this legislation. This matter has been an issue for me for the whole five years that I have been here. My very first question on notice in this very place was on this issue-to the then Minister for Consumer Affairs and then member for Grayndler. The consequence was that she came to my electorate and spoke to the same citrus growers and the same dried fruit growers that the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss), the honourable member for Wide Bay, who now sits at the table, spoke to again this year during a visit. They had almost given up on whether this parliament had the capacity to bring the community together to pass this legislation. So my opening remarks are to congratulate the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs for having the courage to force it through. It is with a great deal of relief that I stand here finally as the government speaker in this debate. I appreciate the honour that has been given to me to speak on the coalition's behalf, particularly by those backbenchers who have worked extremely hard on this legislation. One is the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew), who represents similar citrus growers, dried vine fruit growers and dried tree fruit growers. Another is the member for Riverina (Mr Hicks). There are many other rural members who represent the food producers of our nation and, indeed, there are other members of this place who have interests in regard to whitegoods and all of the other consumables that are produced. So, what a relief it is to finally have the legislation here. It is also some relief to have some level of bipartisanship from the opposition. I was present last Thursday, only a week ago, at a public meeting attended by well over 200 pork producers from not only my part of the world but from South Australia and other parts of Victoria. The shadow minister for primary industry, the member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), was present at that meeting. He gave a commitment to those who urge for this legislation to be urgently supported and finally enacted so that they can get truth in labelling to meet their needs that he would ensure this bill had a speedy passage here. I am just appalled that the opposition have now sought to support the reference of this bill to another committee in the other chamber. There has been such a long history of this issue going to committees for referral. Why another inquiry? The debate is over. The consumers out there are demanding truth. There is an enormous amount of goodwill amongst Australians to support Australian growers. The dilemma they have when they approach the supermarket shelf is: which one is clearly identifiable as the Australian product? We have had this nonsense that has been allowed to happen in the last decade about the term 'Made in Australia'. Court case after court case finally not only reduced the confidence that consumers have in a product but also the confidence that manufacturers have in putting that label on their product, given that many of their components come from overseas whereas the essential character and manufacturing of the item has used Australian labour. I noted the comments from the member for Hotham in the early part of his remarks indicating some responsibility by the government for not supporting the Australian Made logo and organisation. The reason was that that was a private enterprise, and it was the lack of confidence by manufacturers and everybody else that saw their demise. If anything should highlight the point about the confusion that exists in the minds of consumers and manufacturers, it is that very point, because, with court case after court case, the rules have never been distinct about what is the essential character of an item, how much its components are manufactured, and how much input of labour is by Australians. I hope that if there is an inquiry in the Senate-I would certainly prefer there not to be one and that the Senate just give their speedy assent to the legislation-it is swift, because pork producers are suffering tremendously out there; they have waited patiently for the parliament they elected to resolve this issue. I think the minister is to be congratulated for finally establishing a formula to get around this thorny issue of essential character. The implementation of a substantial transformation test is the way to indicate that. I note that the member for Burke has now entered the chamber, and I would remind him and other members present of the level of demand of those pork producers at that meeting in my electorate last Thursday. The substantial transformation test that this legislation provides is that; if 50 per cent of the cost of production of the goods is borne in Australia, that is the level that will determine the application of the term Made in Australia. But the real strength is the enshrinement of the terms Product of Australia and Produce of Australia. I think the debate we need to win in terms of public understanding, especially in relation to food, is that Product of Australia and Produce of Australia are the labels to look for on supermarket shelves. If one goes to a supermarket with a commitment to support Australian growers of food-that is in the interests of my electorate; the interests of others will be different, but mine is essentially to deliver to those citrus and pork producers of my electorate-Product and Produce of Australia are the two terms which are 100 per cent guaranteed to represent what is truly an Australian product. That is the public debate we need to win. In addition to that, to embrace the amount of manufacture and value adding that often goes on, many products made into a final item for consumption confusingly do include ingredients that are not made in Australia or not produced here, a-d we sho-1d have. the term Made in AustralIa to descnbe the Item as essentially, although not entirely, Australian. Mr Rocher-Fifty per cent.",59
70,Mr FORREST,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Fifty per cent is enough to accommodate everybody. If we want to revisit some higher percentage than that-70 or 75 per cent-this legislation will get - uried again, as so many other manufacturers wdl.reenter the argument. We have been argulllg about this for 10 years. It is virtually impossible to make the term mean all things to all men. If the essential character of the item and the substantial transformation test are in here, then let us make a decision on that and determine that that is sufficient for the item to be called Made in Australia. The real strength of the legislation that the minister put before us in supporting Australian food producers are the two items P:oduc! of Australia and Produce of AustralIa. I Just hope that we go on from here and win that debate from the public's perception. In conclusion, I would like to respond to the contribution that has been made by the member for Hotham. He has drawn an enormous and incredibly long bow between items 3, 4 and 5 in schedule 2 of the legislation to make any connection with what has occurr-d in the last month or so on the wh-rves. He IS just looking for an excuse to divert the real issue here. I did not hear him speak once about the pain that citrus, dried fruit and pig producers have been going through. I did not hear him indicate once his concern for those people out there who carry the back of this nation. If he wants to indicate some level of bipartisanship on this, it is an irrelevancy to my pork producers at the moment to hear a 30-minute contribution about some alleged conspiracy in connection with recent activities on the waterfront. I was looking forward to a positive contribution from the member from Hotham, having heard the member for Burke publicly advocate his support for a speedy resolution of this legislation through both chambers of this parliament. This is a matter of urgency. The sooner this legislation is enacted the better. I am pleased to offer my support for it and commend it to the' House. I look forward to its speedy transition.",61
71,Mr TRUSS,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"in reply-I thank the honourable members who have contributed to this debate. We are anxious to move on to the consideration in detail stage so that members can contribute in the limited time available. I would like to thank those who have actively campaigned for this bill over a very long time. I make particular reference to the member for MalIee (Mr Forrest) who, as he said, has been particularly forthright in pursuing especially the concerns of farmers in his own electorate who have wanted truthfulness and honesty in country of origin labelling. I am pleased that this legislation will in fact deliver certainty in the labelling of what can be called Product of Australia; namely, something that is 100 per has cent Australian or as near to it as possible, and what can be called Made in Australia, that is, a product which must be substantially transformed in this country and of which the majority of the cost of production is incurred in Australia. These, I think, are important measures which will provide certainty to consumers. When they want to buy something that is Australian and the labels claim it to be Australian they will know after this legislation has been enacted that it is indeed Australian. It will also provide certainty to manufacturers whose confidence in the system has been damaged as a result of a number of seemingly conflicting court cases which have meant that people do not know when they can use descriptions like Made in Australia. It will also reinvigorate the Australian Made logo and clarify the circumstances under which it can be used. The legislation will give confidence to industry and to consumers that the claims about country of origin labelling can be relied upon. I commend the legislation to the House and I trust it will be given speedy passage also through the other chamber. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Schedule 1 agreed to. Schedule 2, items 1 and 2-by leave-taken together, and agreed to. Schedule 2, item 3.",61
72,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"We all feel for the member for MaBee (Mr Forrest) if he finds it rather tiresome and boring that the opposition has got grave difficulties with this particular provision. It is ironic that today the representatives of the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) have attempted to ensure that the conspiracy case against him is not heard before December of this year. There is no willingness-no keenness to have the matter decided-to allow the Australian public to know what has really been behind this waterfront dispute. I am very pleased that the MUA has tried to push this matter up front and very quickly, because, as other people have indicated, there are very serious doubts about the way in which this dispute was manufactured. We see here today an attempt to retrospectively tackle the MUA and its individual members. As a person who has been very interested in my time in this federal parliament in the immigration field, I find the actions of this current government quite interesting and informative. They cried week after week when the previous government tried to do something about exorbitant compensation payments for illegal boat people. They came in here and they said, 'You cannot do anything retrospectively against these boat people-it is dreadful.' Yet here today they are saying that against Australian workersPAYE taxpayers, people who fund our social security system, people who actually have tax deductions, as opposed to boat people-we can retrospectively tackle them and take away their rights. It is quite clear, despite the from the member for Mallee that this is a long bow, that this piece of the trade practices bill is designed to be retrospective. It is apparently so serious and so overdue and so urgent, but one has to question, when in other legislation they could have given themselves a large amount of this power, why today, at this point in history, it is so urgent. This is an attempt to allow the ACCC to pursue unions through the courts under the restrictive trade practices section of the Trade Practices Act for further future industrial action. I think it is also informative in regard to industrial relations in this country that for the last week or so the government have been bemoaning the plight of the Columbus boat. We are supposed to have such dreadful industrial action in this country, we are supposed to have so many laws that cannot tackle it, so it is very informative to actually face the fact that this ban is in America. The Republican governor of the state does not seem to be able to tackle it; he does not seem to have laws as draconian as this government's to basically smash people who take industrial action. It has been very informative to listen to this constant bemoaning of what is occurring in California. Quite frankly, it seems that that government, despite its powers and its opposition to the trade union movement in the United States, has not been too keen to do anything about it. What we do see is an attempt by the government, by the back door, in a very sneaky, underhand manner to bring in provisions that are quite separate from the main thrust of this legislation, which is the labelling of Australian products. That is what the bill is supposed to be dealing with: how we protect Australian industry and Australian jobs from unfair, misleading labelling. That is what we are supposed to be dealing with here today, and I am very sorry that the member for MalIee is a bit bored and a bit frustrated by the fact that we are actually talking about this provision being brought in without any consultation with the opposition. I would also like, very briefly, to refute his slanderous assault on the Advance Australia claim Foundation that he dismissed as a minor private operation. I think most of us are prepared to put on the record the work the foundation did in relation to the Advance Australia logo. This government, which comes up with all this rhetoric about how it is trying to help Australian manufacturers, is the government that pulled out $1Y:z million from the foundation, forced it to go into liquidation and essentially destroyed the 'Australian Made'logo.",62
73,Mr MARTIN,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Cunningham) (1.50 p.m.)As has been indicated by a couple of speakers on this side, we do oppose this particular section of the bill because it would enable the ACCC to take representative class action for anti-competitive conduct. Clearly, whilst it has some superficial attraction to some, as we have indicated, it obviously has ramifications for the trade union movement in this nation, bearing in mind the almost pathological bent by certain members on the government side to destroy those organisations. I find it quite intriguing, as the shadow minister for small business, having debated in this chamber the passage of changes to the Trade Practices Act already this year and last year, to ponder why it is that suddenly we find this other amendment appearing out of the blue. If we are talking about small business, representative class action can already be taken in relation unconscionable conduct under part IV of the Trade Practices Act and for consumer protection under part V. Just to refresh your memory, I go to the source of those amendments that were moved in this parliament by the government in December in the House of Representatives and in April in the Senate which have now become law and will take operation as of 1 July. In the parliamentary inquiry 'Towards Fair Trading in Australia' entitled, Finding a Balance, we find at page 133, recommendation 4.59: The committee recommends that the Trade Practices Act 1974 be amended to give the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission the power to take representative actions under Part IV of the Trade Practices Act, which deals with various forms of restrictive trade practices including the misuse of market power. If this piece of legislation was so important why didn't the government choose to introduce this measure back in December when it dealt with small business issues, when it changed the Trade Practices Act to gi ve effect to these sorts of matters? Why is it that in regard to the unconscionable provisions which have now become law and which will have operation from 1 July that the government decided to leave these sorts of recommendations out of that legislation? Why is it that at the 11 th hour they have sought to put them into a piece of legislation, dressed up to tackle one of the most enduring, regrettably, issues which governments of all political persuasions have been endeavouring to tackle for a long period of time? The minister at the table, the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss), regrettably has been sold a pup on this issue. He has been beavering away; he is the third in a long line of ministers on the government side since they came into government two years ago to be given this particular responsibility but he is the one that has got closest to it. And we commend him for the fact that he has been prepared to bring into this place for debate origin labelling legislation, but unfortunately he has been sold the pup because-and he does like dogs, as we know-the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) is the one that has leaned on him as he has leaned on so many others in the small business community and elsewhere who have had to accept what he is prepared to offer-'put up or get nothing', as we have heard him say beforein these provisions which have a retrospective clement. Madam Deputy Speaker, in the time that I have been here any attempts by the Labor Party when in government to put legislation in place on any issue which had a retrospective element to it was fiercely and with great vigour opposed by coalition members of the parliament, both in the House of Representatives and the Senate-vigorously opposed. And one who now sits as an independent, the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), who I have a lot of time and respect for, echoes those comments because he knows it is true. He knows that those members of the coalition when in opposition at every tum got up and argued the case about retrospectivity in any legislation. And yet here what we see is a retrospective element being introduced in respect of granting the ACCC powers to carry forward representative class action for anti·· competitive conduct. As our colleague the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) has already pointed out, it may well be that the ACCC and the media-shy Professor Allan Fels might like to tum his attention to some other elements of the way in which anti-competitive practices, whether it be on the waterfront or elsewhere, are being tackled in this nation. It may well be that there are some other important issues such as the way in which the waterfront is managed in Dampier, such as he indicated about the way in which another stevedoring company was prevented from coming onto the docks in Melbourne. Why is it that those sorts of issues have not been pursued? Has it been lack of will or lack of legislative background? Perhaps this might give him that wherewithal to do that. But at the other end of the spectrum, we oppose it for the insidious way in which it has been introduced. (Time expired)",63
74,Mr TRUSS,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Wide Bay-Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs) (1.55 p.m.)There has been no attempt by the government to deceive the opposition in relation to this matter. The facts are that this particular item was announced by the government in the New Deal, Fair Deal statement on 30 September 1997. It was substantially publicised at that time and indeed I believe that probably the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) was amongst those who actually supported the idea of the ACCC being able to take representative actions. It is a move that is being sought by small business and widely supported, I think, by the broad cross-section of the community. It was certainly in the bill at the time the briefing was provided to members of the opposition. We referred you to what we believed to be controversial items. I am surprised that you consider this to be controversial in view of your previous support for these sorts of proposals. There is no conspiracy theory involved. The Commonwealth had to consult with the states, and I might add including the Labor state of New South Wales, in relation to these changes under the requirements of the national competition policy. It has taken some little time to undertake that consultation, but having now finalised that consultation process the government has included these clauses in the first available Trade Practices Act bill. The clause does not allow retrospective action against someone contravening the Trade Practices Act that could not be taken now by a small business victim. All the clause does is permit the ACCC to assist an aggrieved small business against contraventions of the Trade Practices Act. So the capacity to act in this regard is there in the current act. What this does is extend the capacity of the ACCC to assist as'mall business that is aggrieved. The shadow minister's paranoia about the ACCC and its legal right to pursue the MUA seems to be the real reason for these concerns, especially in regard to breaching the secondary boycott provisions and other provisions of the Trade Practices Act. These have no bounds. There is certainly no substance to the arguments that have been put forward by the shadow minister. I believe that the fundamental purpose of this bill is, as the member for Mallee (Mr Forrest) said, to address country of origin labelling issues. Those are the matters of substance. Appropriate briefings have been provided to the opposition in that regard. These are matters that have been announced for a very long period of time, which have been the subject of discussions with the states, including the Labor state of New South Wales, and we are surprised, therefore, that the opposition suddenly considers them to be controversial.",64
75,Dr THEOPHANOUS,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I also want to share in the comments of my two colleagues in the opposition in relation to this subsection because it is quite obvious that there is an intention behind this being brought in at this particular time. The so-called assurances the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss) tried to make in no way indicated that the bill would not be used in that particular case in relation to the wharves issue. You did not indicate, Minister, that this was the case. The minister also referred to the fact that this was primarily intended for country of origin labelling. The situation with respect to that issue is that the minister has trumpeted himself as having brought forward this legislation, but this legislation is two years late. This legislation should have been before this chamber in the very first parliament after members opposite came into government, because in fact the whole thing had been negotiated with the trade union movement, with employers and with consumers' representatives over a long period of time, and I personally had a lot to do with those negotiations and we put that package together. What do we find two years later? Essentially, nothing much new from the package which we put together two years before except that, on the question of origin of labelling for food, the government has totally failed to take into account concerns of the food industry in relation to made in Australia labelling.",64

77,Mr SPEAKER,GALLERY,"Yesterday the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson) raised the question of photographs being taken from the press gallery. I thought that before we commenced proceedings I should explain that after investigation it appears that current guidelines do permit photographs to be taken from the press gallery in very restricted circumstances and only if there has been prior specific permission. This is not given lightly, nor had it specifically been given yesterday. The person taking photos from the press gallery yesterday, however, thought that he had permission and, consequently, it appears that there was a misunderstanding. In future, permission to take photographs within this chamber from whatever position will be given only after specific requests and approval from the Speaker's office. NA Taxation",65
78,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, do you recall telling a caller yesterday on Radio 6PR that whatever rate the GST is introduced at it 'will stay at'? Did you mean forever? What do you mean by 'forever'? Do you promise to never ever increase the rate of your GST?",65
79,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I made a statement yesterday on Perth radio, and I stand by that statement. These matters, of course, will be resolved by the Australian people, as they should be, through the ballot box. They will decide whether they believe me or they believe the opposition. In making that decision, they will be greatly instructed and guided by the knowledge that in 1993 the current Leader of the Opposition",65

81,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition has asked his question.,65
82,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, went to the Australian people knowing full well that if they were re-elected they would introduce their own version of a goods and services tax, and refused to tell the Australian public that. They will also know that when the Leader of the Opposition went to the election in 1996 he absolutely concealed the true state of the budget deficit. So, in making an assessment of whether they believe the Leader of the Opposition or whether they believe me, the Australian public will be guided by the behaviour and the track record of the Leader of the Opposition. In 1993 he promised income tax cuts and no GST. And when he won the election on the strength of that promise, he gave the Australian public the exact reverse, as Dr Warren has pointed out. Not only did we have the infamous repUdiation of the l-a-w, law, tax cuts, but we also had the Labor Party's version of a goods and services tax after 1993-and for good measure and for added insult to the battlers of Australia, there was no compensation.

83,Mr NEHL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Trade. Can the minister confirm that the ship Columbus Canada has had to sail from the United States to New Zealand to be reloaded and then return to the United States to deliver its cargo, because of union thuggery and blackmail? What message does this send to our overseas trading partners?",65
84,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is my melancholy duty to inform the House that the Columbus Canada has in fact now sailed from the west coast of the United States of America as part of a very costly transhipment of containers, which is going to put in jeopardy the jobs of exporters here in Australia-large and small. The member for Charlton and the front-bench of the Labor Party might rejoice in this, but I want to refer to the Daily Telegraph editorial today, which quite correctly gave real prominence and highlight to the other side of this equation: In the wake of our ship of shameThat is the only part of the editorial they got wrong. It is not our ship of shame. It is John Coombs's ship of shame. It is the MUA's ship of shame. It is Kim Beazley's ship of shame, who has in no way condemned this costly transhipment of Australian containers which are the subject of a piece of blackmail, a piece of thuggery, which you seem to rejoice in. Why have you not rejected this development? In addition to vital Australian beef exports, in addition to wheat gluten, there is yet another container in that shipment, involving a market breakthrough for the first time to USA and Mexico by a smaller company, Lavery International, a small dairy company based in Victoria. That company had just managed to win a contract in northern America-and part of that in Mexico-after strong competition from other competitors. Loaded on that ship is gouda cheese valued at $US60,OOO-about $AIOO,OOO. It is now past its use-by date and is no longer suitable for the client. You have contributed to the destruction of a new export deal to northern America from Australia. The government stands very firm in support of waterfront reform. And why wouldn't we, when you have this shocking conduct mounted against Australian exporters and agreed to by the Leader of the Opposition, the person who would have us believe that he would be a responsible Prime Minister of this country? I quote further from the Daily Telegraph editorial: It demonstrates that the Federal Government is right to insist on waterfront reform to put an to the corrupt practices and poor productivity of the MUA. A union willing to undermine our export markets to maintain a closed shop must not be tolerated. We will push on with genuine waterfront reform. We have made a number of diplomatic representations with regard to the Columbus Canada and we will stand up for our exporters. Definition: 'Never Ever'",66
85,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister recall yesterday defining 'never ever' as lasting only till the next election? Is he aware that the Concise Oxford Dictionary-the same dictionary that he relied on to defend his Menzies directorship-defines never as, 'At no time. On no occasion. Not ever. As an emphatic negative. Not at all'? Prime Minister, will you be writing to the publishers of the Concise Oxford Dictionary with your new definition?",66
86,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I do not think the Prime Minister is responsible for definitions in the dictionary. I call the Prime Minister.,66
87,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You are a great definition of an emphatic negative, if I have ever heard of one! It is very interesting, this line that the opposition is taking. Apparently there is something wrong with a political leader going to the public and actually telling them what he is going to do if he gets re-elected. I am guilty of the political crime of saying to the Australian public that I am going to tell the Australian public what I am going to do and, if I am re-elected, I am going to do it. The Leader of the Opposition does the reverse when he is in government; in other words, he deceives the Australian public about what he intends to do. He did not do it once; he did it twice. In 1993, he conspired with Paul Keating to mislead the Australian public about the introduction of the Labor Party's version of a goods and services tax. And in 1996 he conspired with the same Paul Keating to mislead the Australian public about the size of the budget deficit. By contrast, I went to the 1996 election . saying that there will not be a GST in our first term. I go to the coming election saying end that we are going to reform the Australian tax system and I will tell them how we are going to reform it. What is the reply of the Leader of the Opposition? The reply of the Leader of the Opposition is that, even if the Australian public votes for our tax reform policy, he will try to stop it. I operate on the principle that the Australian public are the political masters of this nation. The Australian public will decide who they want to vote for. The Australian public are entitled to be told before an election what a government will do after the election. They do not deserve to be misled. They do not deserve to be deceived. They will not be misled and deceived by me. I will lay out our tax plan and I will be very happy to accept the verdict of the Australian public. Waterfront",66
88,Mr CHARLES,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. Minister, I understand that the Maritime Union of Australia has claimed that the Federal Court order which restrains the MUA from inciting international boycotts against ships loaded by non-union labour during the waterfront dispute would have no effcct. Is this a sensible or reasonable responsc to a Federal Court order which is designed to protect Australia's international trading interests?",67
89,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the member for La Trobe for his question. It is not a reasonable response from the MUA. Mr Crean-What would you know about it?,67
90,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Hotham will remain silent.,67
91,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The reason I say that is that the relationship between the MUA and the ITF is well known. To give the House two examples, on Melbourne Radio 3AW earlier this year, on 2 February, Mr Kees Marges from the ITF-which is the international union for the Maritime Union-was asked by the compere, 'The MUA has asked you?' He said, 'We are following requests and we are looking at what is going on in ports all over the world.' So it is quite clear, as he makes that statement, that the ITF is responding to requests from the MUA to black-ban Australian exports. Furthermore, on 8 April on Australian television, Mr Cockcroft from the ITF was asked about the involvement of the ITF organising against Australian exports. He said: We had a meeting last June in Miami where all the dockers union signed what we called a solidarity contract",67
92,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On a point of order, Mr Speaker: the question went to the responses to the decision of the court yesterday. There was only one response from the MUA to that decision and that is that they will comply with it. They have said that.",67
93,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition is not now raising a point of order. He will resume his seat.,67
94,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He is now dealing with matters that occurred before the decision. How could it be relevant?,67
95,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You are not to rise in your seat and argue a question. If you wish to raise a point of order, you may do so.",67

97,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Hotham!,67
98,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It would be no surprise to anybody in this House to see the embarrassment of the Leader of the Opposition, whose political party is today raising funds-$50 a week from his own front and back bench-to support the MUA which is running a campaign against Australian exports. As Mr Cockcroft said: We had a meeting last June in Miami where all the dockers unions signed what we call a solidarity contract where they pledged this kind of action, if this kind of thing happened, that they would take the necessary action. Here it is as plain as the nose on your face: these people have been in cahoots, conspiring against Australian exporters. Yesterday, we got a Federal Court injunction against them. You ought to be apologising to Australian exporters. Mr Kelvin Thomson interjecting",67
99,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Wills will remain silent. Mr Kelvin Thomson interjecting,68
100,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Wills!,68
101,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They are not passing the hat around for small business; they are passing the hat around for the MUA which is running a campaign against Australian exporters. So we get 'Labour International'. Exporters finally break into a market, they have a container of gouda cheese, valued at $96,000, on board and they are now unable to supply that market as a result. The Manildra group has containers on this ship. They reckon, in a letter we have from them, that the cost to them is $450,000 to $500,000 in this financial year alone as a result of the deduction from the quota. Why? Because Australia is not a reliable supplier. Why? Because the MUA is running a campaign against Australian exporters which you are publicly supporting. We have some details of the what is on board the Columbus CanadaMr Robert Brown- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order understanding order 59, which states that every member desiring to speak shall rise and address the Speaker. He is making accusations against you and I ask that you call him to order. I raise an additional point of order understanding order 145 on the general question of relevance. I also raise a number of 'points of order in connection with standing orders 75 to 77. Standing order 75 states: No Member may use offensive words House of the Parliament or any Member . . . Standing order 76 states: All imputations of improper motives and all personal reflections on Members shall be considered highly disorderly. Standing order 77 states: When any offensive or disorderly words are used, whether by a Member who is addressing the 'Chair or by a Member who is present, the Speaker shall intervene.",68
102,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think the honourable member has made his point of order. Mr Robert Brown- Mr Speaker, following those points of order, I ask you to protect me against the violence of the minister, who obviously",68
103,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I ask the honourable gentleman to resume his seat. You have raised several points of order. I would point out to all members that there are actually' standing orders numbered 1 to 402, and I suggest that you comply with the lot of them. In terms of addressing the chair, there is a requirement, and I ask the minister to resume his remarks and to address the chair.",68
104,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, the member for Charlton did not address the chair when he called for this ship to be sunk. This is the member who has the support of the Leader of the Opposition when he stated publicly he was pleased that 40 tonnes of top quality beef, which was only chilled, would now have to be dumped. This is an opposition that thinks it is reasonable, fair and in the public interest that any produce of those who are not members of a union ought to be black banned. This is a member, supported by the Leader of the Opposition, who believes that if you are not a member of a union, you are a scab. This is a member, with the support of the Leader of the Opposition, who probably thought it was fair enough, when those workers went back to work at Darling Harbour, that this union, as its first act, took industrial action. The second act that it took",68
105,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On a point of order, Mr Speaker",68
106,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Your embarrassment is clear against either, for all to see.",68
107,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My point of order goes to relevance. The specific question related to the Federal Court's determination and the passage of that ship. He is now ranging far and wide about the generalities of this dispute. I would ask you to bring him back to the question.,68
108,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition has raised a point of order regarding relevance. I suggest to the minister that he address the question.,68
109,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, it does range far and wide for the opposition to publicly condemn anybody who is not a member of a union as a scab. It does range far and wide, when thousands of businesses have been affected by a policy position advocated by the Labor Party, when they are publicly raising funds to support the MUA which today is in breach of a Federal Court injunction. That ranges pretty wide, Mr Speaker. That ranges right across the national interest. Those workers at Darling Harbour complained that they were asked to wear the safety vests of those people who had been wearing them and had been working there before. They said, 'These vests are unclean, put them in a plastic bag and bum them,' because they were worn by people who are not members of a union. It is pretty far ranging that, at the heart of this dispute, the Labor Party is supporting compulsory unionism on the waterfront and the repealing of the secondary boycott provisions which were the subject of the proceedings in the Federal Court yesterday and which allow this union to hold this country to economic ransom.",68
110,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order as to relevance. The specific question related to the court decision and the situation of the ship. This is just a mad rant, Mr Speaker, and it ought to be dealt with.",69
111,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition is not in a position, during the raising of a point of order, to go into a debate on the subject. The question was wide ranging and the minister is in order.",69
112,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I have had more interruptions from the Leader of the Opposition than I usually get from the ABC. Opposition members-Oh!",69
113,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You are always guaranteed to react. Mr Speaker, what we are seeing with the Columbus Canada is the Labor Party's policy in action. This injunction yesterday was an injunction granted under the secondary boycott provisions of the Trade Practices Act and their policy is to repeal those provisions. Why are they doing so? Because it is a payback for the support from the MUA. They are publicly raising funds for a union which is working against the public interest. They deserve to be condemned. It shows you what a weak leader the Leader of the Opposition is. Taxation",69
114,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Given that GST rates have increased in 21 of the 23 OECD countries that have this tax, what assurance, other than your word, can you give Australians that the GST rate will not rise here? Mr Wilton inteljecting",69
115,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Isaacs will remain silent. Mr Wilton interjecting,69
116,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Isaacs.,69
117,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I wonder whether, before we get to the election, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, having 'fessed up about the budget deficit and having 'fessed up a couple of days ago about giving Chris Skase a new passport, will 'fess up to the fact that they all got their heads together before 1993 and said, 'We'll run this line about giving tax cuts without a GST, but if we slip back into office, we'll introduce our own version of a GST.' I say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that I have stated government policy. It remains the position. You can say what you like; nothing will alter the position and the Australian public will decide whether they believe you or us. NA",69
118,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon the Hon. Roger MCClay of New Zealand, who is the Commissioner for Children in that country and a former minister in the New Zealand parliament. I extend to Mr MCClay a very warm welcome to Australia. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Taxation",69
119,Mr GEORGIOU,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister inform the House how the overall competitiveness of Australia's taxation system compares with the rest of the world?,69
120,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yesterday the President of the Business Council, Mr Stan Wallis, delivered a very important speech on the future of the Australian taxation system. In the course of that speech, he presented a very coherent and indeed an overwhelmingly effective case in support of taxation reform. Mr Wallis not only explained many of the domestic advantages of reforming the Australian taxation system but, not surprisingly, as the President of the Business Council of Australia, addressed his mind and turned his attention to the competitiveness of the Australian economy. He drew attention to the global competitiveAustralia ness report which is published annually by the respected World Economic Forum. This latest report found that Australia ranked 17th out of 53 countries in terms of overall competitiveness. But, interestingly enough, what that survey disclosed-and what Mr Wallis's speech also analysed and disclosed-was that Australia's outdated taxation system is a major reason why our competitiveness position is not higher. The report found that the overall competitiveness of Australia's tax system ranked 41 out of 53 countries. That is the system that the Leader of the Opposition wants to maintain. That is the system that the Leader of Opposition says does not need any change. That is the system that the Leader of the Opposition is now bound to hand and foot. In other words, the Leader of the Opposition will say to the Australian public, 'Although we are approaching the next millennium, although we are going into the 21st century, we do not need a 21st century taxation system.' The Leader of the Opposition is quite prepared to say to the Australian public, 'To hell with the competitiveness of the Australian economy.' By contrast, all of the actions that my government has taken since being elected have been designed to provide greater security, stability and safety through greater competitiveness for the Australian economy. The speech delivered by Stan Wallis yesterday demonstrated that, unlike the Australian Labor Party and unlike sections of the trade union movement, the business community of Australia is looking to the national interest. There are two prerequisites for taxation reform in Australia. One of them is that the reform should be in the national interest of Australia, and the second is that the structure of the reforms should be fair to all sections of the Australian community. The Australian community is indebted to Mr Wallis for such a penetrating and cogent analysis of the weakness of the present Australian taxation system. What he has done is to look to the national interest. What he has done is to say that we need a tax system that makes Australia more competitive. We need a taxation system that will take with pride and strength, and in a forward looking way, into the 21 st century. It is very obvious, as every day goes by in this tax debate, that the only side of politics that is interested in the national interest, the only side of politics which is looking to the future, the only side of politics that really wants a competitive Australia is made up of the members of the Liberal and National parties. Taxation: New Zealand",70
121,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Acting Treasurer. Will the Acting Treasurer confirm that immediately after the introduction of the 10 per cent GST the in New Zealand in 1986 inflation rose by over eight per cent and interest rates rose by over 10 per cent, with interest rates still running above 19 per cent a full year later? Isn't the New Zealand experience proof beyond doubt that a GST equals higher prices equals higher interest rates? Mr Ross Cameron- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I do not doubt that the Acting Treasurer is happy to answer the question, but I note that standing order 144 prohibits questions which anticipate debate on an order of the day or other matter. I note that the opposition has circulated a matter of public importance on the GST in particular. So far, we have had four questions on the GST. Can they have it both ways?",70
122,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Although there is a blue circula-ed, the honourable member for Parramatta would know that a matter of public importance is not initiated in the House until such stage as the Speaker rises, reads the letter and determines which of those matters will be chosen. Therefore, the matter is not on the Notice Paper.",70
123,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I draw your attention to standing order 142, which states: Questions may be put to a Minister relating to public affairs with which the Minister is officially connected. Much as I am sure we would do an equally good job for New Zealand as we have for Australia, the minister is not officially responsible for the interest rates or inflation in New Zealand.",71

125,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,71
126,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I ask members of the opposition to desist in their adulation of the member.,71
127,Mr FAHEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. Can I add to those remarks that I am supervising an economy that is in very, very good shape as the result of the work of the coalition government. I note with interest that the member for Holt has asked me a question on a consumption tax-on a broad-based indirect tax. I know the member for Holt is a great supporter of indirect taxes and a consumption tax. The authority for that comes from one David Morgan. It came through an ABC documentary-and, of course, we know that an ABC documentary would be very, very accurate-called Labor in power. The quote from David Morgan was: For me the breakthrough came, I think, around 1 a.m. on the Monday morning when Gareth Evans threw down his papers and took off his glasses and said, 'I've listened to this consumption tax argument for two days, and I have been waiting for the hole to be punched in it. None of you have been able to punch a hole in it.' Mr Gareth Evans- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: there sure as hell was a hole punched in it a year later in 1986 in New Zealand. That is what this question is about.",71
128,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The deputy leader is not raising a point of order. Mr Gareth Evans-On the point of relevance, he was asked about New Zealand and its implications for Australia and the argument that a GST does in fact increase prices and interest rates. That is the question and that is what he ought to answer, and you ought to draw his attention to that.",71
129,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,71
130,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The deputy leader will resume his seat. Members of the government are not helping; their level of interjection at the moment is unacceptable. The Minister for Finance and Administration will answer specifically the question addressed to him by the deputy leader.,71
131,Mr FAHEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The reason I informed the House of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's views on broad based indirect taxes, consumption taxes, is that he referred to a time in New Zealand in 1986. That quote comes from around that same time. Mr Gareth Evans interjecting",71
132,Mr FAHEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am delighted that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition welcomed the fact that I used that quote and that he remembered it so well. If only he had such a good memory in respect of passports-people like Christopher Skase and what might have happened there. Of course, the Australian people would like to know a little more about that. What I can say is this: the Australian economy is in very good shape because this government accepted the challenges that were presented to it. We accepted the fact that we had to address the $10.5 billion black hole. We accepted the fact that we had to live within our means. We promised that we would get the budget back into balance in our first term, and we have delivered. We accepted the fact that our workplace law needed some change, and we have made those changes. We have made the Australian workplace a far more productive place as a result. Mr Gareth Evans- Mr Speaker, I raise a further point of order. Isn'the stretching your tolerance on the question of relevance just a tiny little bit-just a tiny little bit? The question was about the impact of a GST on inflation and interest rates. I know he can't answer it, but shouldn't you at least require him to take a stab at it and use the words 'interest rates' and 'inflation' somewhere in his answer?",71
133,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Minister for Finance and Administration will answer the question. At the moment, he is answering it within the standing orders.",72
134,Mr FAHEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The point I make in respect of the last 21,4 years and the way in which the coalition government has brought the economy back into shape is that there is still one step that has to be taken. That step was pointed out, as the Prime Minister said, so coherently and so logically by the President of the Business Council of Australia only yesterday. The one thing we need to ensure that productivity continues, that job creation continues, that we maintain low inflation and low interest rates and that we increase our exports is to fix up a tax system which is all but broken. I do not care what New Zealand did. I know what will happen in Australia. I can assure you that what New Zealand did in the 1980s will have no bearing on what this government will bring to Australia in the 1990s. The next step that will ensure that that happens, that we will get that sustainable economic growth, is that we will put a taxation system in place that will give that incentive to exports, that will create those jobs and that will maintain that sustainable growth.",72
135,Mr SLIPPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is also to the Acting Treasurer. Has the Acting Treasurer seen alternative proposals advocating income tax cuts without any change whatsoever to indirect tax? What is the government's response to these proposals?,72
136,Mr FAHEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I have seen reference to proposals by the Labor Party to cut income tax. Those references, of course, had their origins in a speech made by the Leader of the Opposition last Sunday to the Victorian branch of the ALP. Since that time, I have noted that the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition have been embracing the airwaves; they have been running round the dial getting an opportunity wherever they can to speak on what they propose by way of income tax cuts. What they are saying they will deliver to low and middle income families is a new fridge and some new clothes and that they will fund that new fridge and some new clothes by way of income tax cuts. We know, of course, that all of this has been said before; it is deja vu. Before the 1993 election the promises coming from these very same people were that, firstly, there will be no increases in taxes and, secondly, 'We will in fact give you tax cuts; we will legislate J-a-w tax cuts.' What happened after the 1993 election? It was fairly obvious, because in that budget-the preparations for that budget were undoubtedly done probably before the count in the Senate had been completed-what did they deliver? They delivered their own version of the GST-increases in wholesale sales tax. So the new fridge that they are now offering low and middle income families was given a 10 per cent tax rise, and the equivalent in the way of a wholesale sales tax rise of a new fridge was given in respect of a motor vehicle. But we are seeing a little truth from the Labor Party in recent times. A couple of weeks ago we had an admission by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that, yes, they did leave the budget in that $10.5 billion deficit state. Again, we had the acknowledgment last night on the PM program by the Taxation- Deputy Leader of the Opposition, 'Yes, we did increase wholesale sales taxes back after the 1993 election, despite the promise we made to the Australian people.' So what we know is that this is the man, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who is going to be the author of the tax policies; he is going to be the author of what Labor presents to the Australian people before the next election. He is the man that has this truth tablet he takes each night and then out he goes and indicates clearly that he supports a consumption tax. He told the states only last year that he would encourage them to introduce death duties to get their income. This is the man that supports new taxes; he supports increased taxes. What they are saying now to the Australian people is, 'We are going to give you relief if you are low and middle income families, the equivalent of a new fridge.' What they are saying is, 'We are going to fund that by increases in wholesale sales tax.' Our GST is going to get you, and added taxes to it.' There is only one thing that you can believe the Australian Labor Party on when it comes to taxes. The one thing that you can believe, the one thing that you can trust them on, is that they never tell the truth on tax. Opposition members inteljecting",72
137,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the members of the opposition will restrain their enthusiasm, I will give their leader the call. The members of the opposition, including the honourable member for Burke, might allow the Leader of the Opposition to ask his question. One Nation Party",73
138,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, are you aware of former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser's statement of today? He said: By no stretch of the imagination can the coalition parties in Queensland claim One Nation policies are less hannful than those of the Australian Labor Party. On one issue alone, One Nation stands condemned: its policies are anti-Asian, anti-Aboriginal and anti-Semitic. Us policies are racist. Do you recall telling this House on 5 June, after Eddie Mabo's grave had been desecrated: ... the best messages all of us can convey to those who peddle racist bigotry is to ... brand them as moral outcasts of our society. Prime Minister, why won't you follow Mr Fraser's lead and tell your party to put One Nation last? Is it because you think he is wrong or is it because you are not prepared to live up to your own words?",73
139,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answer to the first part of the question is no, I was not aware, but as the statement has been",73
140,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You should be aware.,73
141,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Well, I wasn't. I have been busying myself with other matters today, I can assure you. My attention having been drawn to the words uttered by the former Prime Minister, let me say a couple of things. The first thing I would say is that the distribution of preferences in the state election in Queensland is, of course, a matter for the Queensland division of the party and is a matter for the Queensland divisions of both the Liberal Party and the National Party. The second observation I would make is that, when it comes to the allocation of preferences, the man who has just asked me the question is the man who authorised the Western Australian branch of the Labor Party in the 1996 election to place the former Labor member for Kalgoorlie, the continuing member for Kalgoorlie, Mr Campbell, in preferences terms ahead of the Liberal Party candidate in that ballot, despite the fact that views expressed by the current member for Kalgoorlie on many immigration matters are similar to those expressed by the One Nation Party. The man who asked the question is also the person who authorised a sleazy preference deal between Australians Against Further Immigration and the Australian Labor Party in the Lindsay by-election. He is also the person who has said to his shadow ministry, 'When you go to Queensland be careful what you say about Wik and when you go to Queensland make sure that you run your comments past Wayne Swan before you say anything about Wik in Queensland.' I remind the Leader of the Opposition that in taking that stance what he is doing is speaking with one voice to one section of the Australian community and speaking with another voice to another section of the Australian community. The Leader of the Opposition has no authority to give moral lectures to me or to any member of the Liberal Party or the National Party.",73

148,Mr BARTLETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Can the minister inform the House of recent action taken by the Australian government in assisting Asia through the current financial crisis and the implications this has for Australia's standing in the region? How does this contrast with Australia's regional initiatives in years gone by? Mrs Crosio--That is certainly going to go over well in Macquarie.,74
149,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. As the honourable member for Prospect once more-for the 496th time today-interjects, this time she is right: it will go down well in Macquarie. It is a very good question and well asked. I would have to say that over the last nine or 10 months or so we have been wrestling in the Asia-Pacific region with the impact of the Asian economic crisis, but out of any crisis comes opportunity and the Australian government has taken the opportunity during this period to make a historic shift in Australia's positioning in the region. We have gone from a country which at times looked like a howling and scratching country at Asia's door to a confident country able to make a strong contribution during a time of crisis. We have done that in a very constructive and very positive way. We have contributed to all three East Asian IMF packages and we have provided export insurance to Korea and Indonesia. The Reserve Bank of Australia has provided assistance, including seconding an officer to Indonesia. AusAID has established an Asia crisis fund in next year's aid budget. Importantly-and I note that this has received rather little publicity, if I could complain about that-the Prime Minister's initiative for the APEC finance ministers meeting, which was carried forward by the Treasurer, was an initiative adopted by the APEC finance ministers meeting to build stronger financial sectors through improving the standards of prudential regulation. It includes training initiatives amongst regional financial institutions. There is a whole range of different things that Australia has done to change its standing in the region from a country which was clawing to try to be accepted by the region, to being a country which is a serious, considered and valued contributor and friend as part of the region.",74

152,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is in that context that I have to say I was just a tad disappointed to hear the speech of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition last night, who sought to misrepresent the government's policies towards Asia and suggest, almost incredibly, that the government was pursuing a policy of withdrawing from Asia. This allegation is clearly false. Anybody who knows anything about public policy in Australia knows how totally false that is. But it does remind us of the way, in years gone by, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, as the foreign minister, went to Asia in a deferential way trying to claw his way into the region. I do not think anybody should ever be allowed to forget July 1995 in Brunei when the then foreign minister, the now Deputy Leader of the Opposition, went up there carrying with him a map of East Asia. This is the map. You will remember the map. Here is Australia on the map. Here is Antarctica. Here is East Asia. He went around with this map to foreign ministers from the Asia-Pacific region and pointed out to them, 'Here's Australia. It's on this map. We're part of the region. Australia is on this map.' This was one of the all-time humiliating moments for Australia, and it was summed up in an article by Geoffrey Barker of the Financial Review, who said: Senator Evans has seemed pathetically anxious to establish Australia as an East Asian Hemisphere nation. Pathetically anxious, that is what you were. As the Reuters Business Briefing said: Mr Evans's definition of the East Asian Hemisphere and of his c-)Un.try's. place in it evoked surprise followed by mdlgnatlOn. We have gone from the position under Labor where we were almost apologetic in our approach to Asia, pleadi-g to be accepted. as part of the region, to bem- a country - h-c.h is a major contributor, which plays a sIgmfIcant role in the region and can stand proud at last, instead of crawling in the humiliating way we did under Labor.",74

154,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I suggest the member for Denison remain silent. Taxation: Home Ownership,75
155,Ms HANSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, the great Australian dream is to own your own home. Will the many materials currently exempt from sales tax that are used for the construction or repair of homes and other buildings, such as timber, concrete, roofing and plumbing, be exempt when you introduce your GST? Will the currently sales tax exempt items important for rural Australians, such as water tanks and stands, be exempt from your GST? If these and the many other basic building materials currently not subject to sales tax are not exempt from your GST, will it be more expensive for Australians to buy and maintain their homes?",75
156,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am very interested that the honourable member has raised the great Australian dream. One of the greatest contributions that you can make to buying a home in this country is having record low housing interest rates. I would remind her and everybody who sits opposite that my government has delivered the lowest housing interest rates that this country has had since the 1960s, that it is my government that has cut interest rates by $330 a month on the average loan, and that it is my government that has delivered interest rate cuts that are worth the equivalent of a $100-a-week wage rise for the average wage and salary earner in Australia. So the message out of that is that, if you want to enjoy the great Australian dream, there are only two parties to vote for-that is, the Liberal Party or the National Party.",75
157,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Why don't you answer your little friend Pauline Hanson's question about the GST?,75
158,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Under standing order 304A I ask the member for Denison, who has been - arned and who has been persistently interjecting, to leave the House for one hour. The honourable member for Denison thereupon withdrew from the chamber.",75
159,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member for Oxley's raising the great Australian dream gives me an opportunity to remind her and those who sit opposite not only of the way in which housing interest rates have fallen but also, of course, that when the Labor Party was in power housing interest rates in this country climbed to levels that had not been expenenced at any time since the end of World War II. In the early 1990s, housing interest rates in Australia went to 1711z per cent. Now they are in the order of six, seven or eight per cent. In other words, they are down at levels that were undreamt of by Australians only a few short years ago. The most comprehensive legacy in the past 2- years that my government has given to the average Australian has been to bring those housing interest rates down. The other message that I would give to the member for Oxley is that, if the Labor Party were to be elected to the government benches at the next election, those low interest rates would be at risk because the tax and spend policies of a Beazley Labor government would drive interest rates up again. As sure as one can be of anything in Australian politics, if Labor again becomes the government of this country all of those low interest rates will disappear. They will disappear very quickly. Just as Labor ran a high interest rate policy when it was in government before, it will run a high interest rate policy if it is in government again.",75

167,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Kalgoorlie will resume his seat.,76
168,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am glad the member for Oxley asked me about the great Australian dream, because the great Australian dream is of enormous importance to all Australians. So far as the impact of tax reform on the housing industry is concerned, I can assure the honourable member for Oxley that the building industry and all allied industries in this country-like all other sections of the Australian business community-will welcome the tax reform package when it is announced. Native Title",76
169,Mr LINDSAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, has your attention been drawn to the recent comments made by the Queensland opposition leader that he would work to implement the government's native title legislation. What is your response to these remarks?",76
170,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As it happens, my attention has been drawn to some remarks that were made by the Queensland opposition  conceded that he could be forced to implement our native title legislation. The article makes the very interesting observation that: Sources said Mr Howard was expected to seize on Mr Beattie's concession to attack federal Labor over the issue. They were very perspicacious sources. What this represents is an attempt by the Leader of the Opposition in Queensland to have it both ways. What he is really saying is that he does not agree with the native title legislation but wink-wink, nod-nod, he is saying to the Queensland community, 'I really basically do think it is not a bad idea. The way in which I am going to demonstrate that is that, if after all of my valiant efforts to stop it coming in John Howard gets it through the federal parliament after the next election, I am going to get it in as quickly as possible.' In other words, when he talks to the Queensland people-particularly when he is touring the rural areas of Queensland-he will be able to say, 'I have to stand shoulder to shoulder with Kim Beazley when I am in Melbourne or Sydney or when I am addressing some kind of congress that has another point of view, but you must understand that, when I am addressing you as a Queensland audience, I really think Howard has got it right.' He is right on this. Howard has got it right. Our native title legislation is a balanced attempt to deal with a very difficult problem. Our native title legislation will benefit Queensland. Our native title legislation should not have been rejected in the Senate and those people who voted against it in the Senate were voting against the interests of the Queensland people. Those people who voted against it in the Senate were voting to delay resolution of a difficult problem. What Peter Beattie has done by his two-sided admission yesterday is acknowledge that deep down it is in the interests of Queensland that the government's native title legislation be passed, but he is hamstrung by the commitment he has made to the federal Leader of the Opposition. This is yet the latest example of where the Labor Party, on issues related to native title, say one thing to one audience and say another thing, either directly or by a wink and a nod, to a different audience. What Peter Beattie has done is to demonstrate very clearly to the Queensland public that deep down a resolution of the native title issue as proposed by my government is the only way to solve the problem, it is the only fair way to deal with the problem, it is the only way you will deliver security and predictability to the pastoralists of Queensland. Unless the native title issue is resolved, there will be <many hundreds, indeed thousands, of jobs destroyed in Queensland over the years and into the future. Of all the states in Australia, none has a greater need of predictability and certainty when it comes to mining and pastoral titles and none has a greater stake in the proper resolution of this issue. What the Labor Party has done is to betray the interests of Queensland by opposing this legislation, and what Peter Beattie has done is to pathetically say, 'I know in my heart the coalition is right, but I am not strong enough to stand up for Queensland.' He does not deserve to be the Premier of Queensland. Taxation: Election Advertising",76
171,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware of a report in yesterday's Australian that the Liberal Party is offering advertising agencies a blank cheque to rename and sell the GST? Prime minister, why did you attempt on the John Laws program this morning to slide away from the GST when you said, 'I won't be selling a GST'? Why don't you want to call a GST a GST and sell it as a GST? What are you afraid of? Is it because, as one advertising executive said yesterday, 'The GST has a loser's connotation about it'?",77
172,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,77
173,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The members of the government will remain silent.,77
174,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I don't mind, Mr Speaker. Please don't rule it out of order.",77
175,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,They go very close. I call the Prime Minister.,77
176,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have two answers for that. The first answer is that, when it comes to government advertising, my reply to the Australian Labor Party is 'Bill Hunter'. That is what I say in reply to government advertising. Of course, any new program that a government has is entitled to an appropriate communication of the details. The Australian Labor Party, when they were in government, adhered to that practice. We observed them adhering to that practice and we observed, with great interest, the extent to which they adhered to that practice. As to the second part of the question in which the honourable member said that I will not be selling a GST, that is typical of what the Labor Party does on this issue. You deliberately chopped out the rest of what I said. What I said was that I would be selling an aggregate package. What I said was that I would be selling a total reform of the Australian tax system. I will be selling reductions in personal income tax. I will be selling a tax system that boosts Australia's competitiveness. I will be selling a tax system that attacks the loss of $15 billion of revenue through the black economy. I will be selling a tax system that takes the load off the backs of Australian exporters. In other words, I will be selling as the head of a government which is proudly determined to improve the efficiencies of the Australian tax system a proposal that will take this nation positively into the 21st century. I will not be peddling backwardlooking fear. I will not be running a negative campaign, a destructive campaign, a campaign being run by people who in their hearts say, 'No, it is in Australia's interest to reform the taxation system.' The man who sits opposite me, the Leader of the Opposition, knows that reform of the Australian taxation system is needed. When he was in government, he had the courage in 1985 to support the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, on this subject. He knows that reform is needed and by opposing it, by being negative, he is gutlessly selling out Australia's national interest. Illegal Migrants",77
177,Mr BARRESI,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. Is the minister aware of reports of a growth in the number of people seeking to enter Australia illegally through our airports? Can the minister inform the House what measures have been taken to reduce this threat?,77
178,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question. I have seen the reports in today's newspapers about this matter. There was, of course, nothing new in the information provided in that article. In fact, it was based on information that I have publicly used myself on a number of occasions. It is a fact that, worldwide, we are seeing a significant movement of people occurring, essentially seeking either guest worker status or a long-term immigration outcome, but not approaching governments with a view to achieving that result lawfully. Many people are involved in the process of finding ways and means to circumvent the lawful arrangements that are in place for entry of people. We have seen a situation where, over a period of time, the International Convention for the Protection of Refugees has been used by people intent on claiming that they have an entitlement to asylum whether or not they have such an entitlement. We have seen a situation where Australia has been challenged in relation to those matters by large numbers of boat arrivals, and those issues have had be effectively addressed by this government. At the moment in the Port Hedland Detention Centre we have something in the order of 30 people. This is very different that we had a number of years ago. One of the reasons that that has occurred is because there has been a determination to return nonbona fide people and a determination to use, as part of an integrated system, a system of the Housewhereby people are detained when entering Australia clandestinely. But, having addressed those issues effectively, what we find now is that people attempt to find new ways around it. The way in which they are attempting to do that is by using fraudulent documentation. Often, they dispose of documentation when they are on aircraft seeking to enter Australia. In three years since 1994-95 we have seen of 278 per cent, from 485 such arrivals to something of the order of 1,350. Those with bogus travel documents are projected to increase significantly this year. Those issues need to be addressed effectively. In the recent budget we brought forward a number of proposals to do that. We are going to place additional compliance officers in overseas posts where we believe these issues arise, where there is a high incidence tice, and that includes Jakarta, Guangzhou, and another centre on which I have yet to Speaker. make a decision. That complements the staff already in Beirut, Beijing, Hong Kong and Manila. Additionally, we will put airline liaison officers in a number of places, increasing from two to four Australian officers who will assist airline staff in identifying people using bogus documentation before they get on aircraft. Further, we will put additional staff in our airports here in Australia. We will strengthen the totality of the regime to deal with these matters, including the provision of resources to deal with asylum claims, to get asylum claimants out of the system, and to put in place a new detention centre in Sydney as part of the overall framework to ensure that these issues are effectively addressed. Taxation",77
179,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question to is addressed to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister agree that a 10 per cent GST would mean a new slug on job seekers of $3.70 a week for travelling to interviews, $40 to the 500 or so for work clothesA government member-Ha, hal",78

Why does the Prime Minister want to slug job of malpracseekers in this way? Mr Hockey-I raise a point of order, Mr I refer to standing order 144, specifically referring to hypotheticals. In this case, the member for Batman has used a number of assumptions which we are not aware of in his question in order to come up with the prices he has come up with. Therefore, given that, and given the 10 per cent that he referred to, it is clearly in breach of standing order 144, and I ask you to rule it out of order.",78
186,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On the point of order, Mr Speaker, I am more than willing to go through in detail the report by me going to the question before the chair. It is based on Broadmeadows in Melbourne, and includes Woolies at Broadmeadows.",79
187,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The question is in order.,79
188,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am grateful for your ruling, Mr Speaker. Can Ijust say, in reply to the member for Batman, that he has put a whole lot of hypothetical assumptions which I do not care to respond to. What I do intend to say is that what he has put today is all of a piece with the attitude of the Labor Party to the issue of tax reform. The most damning criticism you can make of Labor is they know what is right for Australia but won't do it. The most damning criticism you can make of the Leader of the Opposition is that you in your heart, Kim Beazley, know Australia needs tax reform. You once were man enough, you once had the intellectual honesty, to support it. You once stood shoulder to shoulder with Paul Keating when he courageously argued for it before he lost his courage and became expedient in the early 1990s. At at:me when Australia needs tax reform, at a time when the national interest requires that political leaders have the courage to embrace reform, what you are prepared to do is to authorise an insubstantial, scurrilous scare campaign. It may cheer your hearts at question time, you may gather in your caucus conclave and slap each other on the back and say, 'Wasn't that clever?', but I suspect that out there on the highways and byways of Australia what they are really saying is, 'Hang on, this is a bit strange. Wasn't there a time when Kim Beazley and Paul Keating told us that this was a good idea? Isn't it a bit strange that a man who was prepared to say one thing before the 1993 election and do the complete opposite should now be taking this stand?' Ms Jeanes-I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker. I refer to standing order 303. I am mindful of the fact that there have been hundreds of school children coming through the gallery this week and surely, as members of this House and leaders of the nation, we deserve to offer them a better example.",79
189,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,And a better Prime Minister!,79
190,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Banks! Ms Jeanes-I use the member for Banks as a prime example of why we need to offer them a better example.,79
191,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member will address her point of order and not engage in chat across the chamber. Members on both sides of the House are transgressing, and I suggest that everybody recognise the significance of this federal parliament and treats it with proper propriety.",79
192,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The worse criticism, the most damning indictment of all that can be made of the Leader of the Opposition of the Australian Labor Party, is that they know what is right for Australia but will not do it. They know that it is in Australia's interest to reform the tax system. They know that the scurrilous fear campaign they are trying to mount is inimical to Australia's national interest. I believe that as the weeks go by there will be a greater realisation of that amongst the men and women of Australia, and they will, in political terms, rue the day that they put short-term expediency and political dishonesty ahead of Australia's national interest. Immigration",79
193,Mr BROADBENT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. Has the minister seen reports of new published work on the former government's approach to immigration and multicultural affairs? If so, what has the government done to address the identified abuses and policy failings identified in those reports? Mr Latham-Oh, Phillip, you are not going to support Paul Sheehan, are you?",79
194,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for MCMillan for his question to me. There have been a number of publications this week which I will draw to the attention of honourable members. One very important document published by my department on the economic impact of changes in the migration program between 1995-96 and 1997-98 is a report commissioned from Ecnotech. It is a very important statement about the economic advantages to Australia as a result of changes that have taken place in relation to the immigration program. By way of interjection, some members asked me whether I was going to refer to a book entitled Among the Barbarians by Paul Sheehan. Mr Latham-You have it there! You know about it.",79
195,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, I am aware of the published book. I intend to read all of it. Others may care to interest themselves in that matter, but I only wish to draw on one quote from the president of the Labor Party that I understand was included in the book. It was a comment offered by the member for Lalor when he spoke at a conference in northern Sydney dealing with migration. He had this to say: The handling of immigration by the previous government was, I have to say, less than distinguished, partly because immigration was seen as a tremendously important element in building up a long-term political constituency. Let me say in relation to that that it confirms, I think in a very graphic way, what I have been saying about the way in which the immigration program which we inherited was seriously out of balance-where 70 per cent of the migration program was represented in the family stream; where something in the order of 40 per cent of the program was spouse and fiance categories, amounting to some 33,500 places; and where parents represented 10 per cent of the program. We have addressed that imbalance. The family stream now represents about 50 per cent of the program. How have we done that? We have done that by dealing with a problem that you allowed to remain in the immigration program, where people who were entering into arranged and sham marriagesMr Hatton-That is false, and you know it.",80
196,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is absolutely right. We have seen a situation now where the number of applications are down by 30 per cent since changes were implemented to deal with these matters-not the rejection rates but the numbers of people coming forward and saying, 'I want to have my relationship tested against reasonable criteria.' Mr Dargavel-Why are you kicking people out who are already married?",80
197,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Fraser will remain silent!,80
198,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,But again we have seen a situation in whichMr Dargavel-They are not sham marriages.,80
199,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Fraser!,80
200,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There has been a very effective redressing of the way in which people with skills are able to enter Australia, and we have an effective rebalancing of the program. That has been confirmed in the study that I have referred to. I would like to perhaps table the study at the end of this answer and encourage members to read it as well, but it shows that Australians generally have benefited by an increase in their standard of living by $95 per year for each and every Australian, and that if we are able to introduce the further changes that we have in mind in relation to the skills categories it will add another $39 per person. That has been . achieved with marginal reduced population growth, with a younger population, because of the capping of the parents category, with a higher underlying labour force participation rate, and a higher skill level in the work force. One would have to wonder when those benefits are there why the Leader of the Opposition when he comes to speak on these matters, as he did when he spoke to the Australia-Israel review, has this to say-and I have spoken about the Leader of the Opposition before and the way in which he likes to walk on both sides of the street on these matters",80

202,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The House will remain silent.,81
203,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Labor Party, when it is out speaking for the Australian community as a whole, would have us believe that it was concerned about very important moral and wider questions. But when it comes to going out and talking to specific constituencies it has another message to take. What it says about immigration generally is that is interested in a population policy for tralia, implying, of course, that we should not have regular reviews of the migration program but that we ought to have a long-term view.",81
204,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister's answer is getting a little long. I suggest he draw answer to a conclusion.,81
205,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I quote from the Leader of the Opposition in relation to this, because there has been this criticism that our decisions in relation to immigration each year have been ad hoc and taken in the context of immediate issues. But the Leader of the Opposition, when he is asked on this matter, says: I think the annual intake is something we ought to determine on the basis of the exigencies of the economy at the time and on a non-discriminatory basis. So there he is saying that it ought to be considered on the basis of the economy in the particular year.",81
206,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister will wind up every his answer.,81
207,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will wind up, Mr incorrect. Speaker, on this point. He then had ment on the question of whether or not the Labor Party would be changing the immigraThere tion program. What did he have to say when he was speaking to a specific constituency? Oh yes, he said he would maintain the current immigration program levels but added that ALP would also increase the family reunion component. In other words, there they are again out there pleading to a specific constituency for the very politicisation of gration program that the honourable member for Lalor identified.",81

210,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Batman will either ask his question or resume his seat.,81
211,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question it is addressed to the Minister for Employment, AusEducation, Training and Youth Affairs. Does the minister recall whether, on the first day of the new Job Network, the Prime Minister gave this assurance on Radio 3AW, 'We're not charging fees.' Is the minister aware of his Huon Skills Training in Tasmania which, on top of the job matching fee it receives from the federal government, is charging extra fees directly to job seekers, many of whom are long-term unemployed? Is the minister aware that these charges include resume writing at $40 per hour, application writing at $20 per hour and career counselling at $70 per hour? Aren't these fees in breach of the Prime Minister's assurance on Radio 3AW of 1 May?",81
212,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Batman has waged a continuing campaign of disinformation against the Job Network. The one thing we know for certain is that he has been wrong in every accusation he has made. He has used his union mates out there to try to get information about Job Network members, and time the scurrilous statements about Job Network members have been proven to be Let me make it absolutely clear to to commembers of the House that the Prime Minister's statement was 100 per cent correct. is a clear clause in the contract with every Job Network member that no member may charge any unemployed person any fee where they are providing a service for which the the government is subsidising the Job Network. In other words, whatever the government pays, that service is free to job seekers. Mr Latham-What are you going to do the immiabout this one in Tasmania then?",81
213,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not accept for a moment the facts as they are stated by the member for There is no reason, without investigation, to accept them. Let me make this point: there are many professional job placement agencies in this country who charge professional people looking for work for a job placement or job assistance. These services are not part of the services provided by the Job Network on behalf of the Commonwealth government to unemployed people. It may well be that there is an agency which is charging within the law people who are seeking services beyond those provided by the Job Network. But let me also make it quite clear that many Job Network members are providing completely free services to unemployed people who are not on unemployment allowances. In fact, I can tell the House that early indications are that some 20 per cent of the total job placements made by members of the Job Network are for people who are not carrying job seeker cards. So the Job Network is lifting enormously the opportunities for the unemployed in this country to get jobs. I am sure no member of this House will be misled by the campaign of disinformation being carried out by the ACTU and the member for Batman. Mr Martin Ferguson- Mr Speaker, I seek leave to table a memo from Huon Skills Training detailing these fees, together with the Prime Minister's transcript from the radio interview. Leave not granted. Employment Australia",81
214,Mr BILLS ON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"After that very good answer from the minister, my question is also addressed to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. Has the minister seen comments about the government's performance in assisting young people? How has the government's work for the dole initiative and other programs increased opportunities and choices for young people?",82
215,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Dunkley for his question. The member for Dunkley is well known for his commitment to helping young people in his electorate expand their opportunities to get employment. The work for the dole program has been one of the pioneering breakthroughs of the Howard government. It has been a highly successful program which has helped to build confidence and raise the self-esteem for thousands of young people who have been shut out of employment for too long-until this government took positive action to help them. That is why the government is expanding the work for the dole program. As the Prime Minister announced earlier this year, over the following 12 months the government will be providing some 25,000 places in work for the dole. The first tender round for the first six months of that additional work for the dole program has now concluded, and the government has received applications to place some 12,500 young people on the work for the dole. I am delighted to be able to tell the House that the enormous community enthusiasm for this program, which was demonstrated by the very large number of applications we received for the pilot project, has been more than fully borne out in the response to this second tender round. The government has received some 680 applications from communities and organisations around Australia to place young people in these 12,500 places. That is some three to four times the number of projects likely to be contracted in this round. It shows the enormous community support out there for the work for the dole program. I would like to remind members of the House just how work for the dole is assisting young people. Let me quote, for example, the comment of Linda Green from the Caboolture area, who has been working with the Endeavour Foundation supporting people with a disability. Linda Green said this: This scheme has been great. It has helped me with contacts in the business community and given me much more confidence. I can see a much brighter future for my career now and will be returning to study. Mr Michael Shovelton, 19, of Tugun, who is involved in a project on the Gold Coast said: It has given me a lot more motivation to go out and get a job and it has boosted my morale. The member for Dunkley has drawn my attention to propaganda being distributed in his electorate by the Labor Party. That propaganda makes two things very clear: first, that the Labor Party opposes work for the dole and would discontinue this immensely successful and popular program if it were ever to return to government; second, that Labor also proposes to discontinue the common youth allowance which will give young people the positive message that it is not in their ests to drop out of school and go on the dole. The Labor Party supports a welfare system in which young people are given an incentive to go on the dole, and it opposes communities helping those young people to rebuild their confidence. All the gains that have been made by this government would be swept away by Labor. There are now 52,000 fewer young people-teenagers-Iooking for work than there were when the Leader of the Opposition was minister for employment. Young peopJe deserve a chance. Communities want to help young people, and this government will give them that opportunity. Waterfront",82
216,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. Are you aware that, according to documents now before the courts, on 27 March Chris Corrigan told a meeting of Patrick's bankers that the federal government was 'considering funding' his mass sacking strategy but that, not satisfied, the bankers sought a further meeting to confirm that government funding was available? Are you also aware that, at the following meeting on 2 April, Corrigan gained the bankers' support on the basis that 'the government would pay $160 million'? Minister, how can you still say that you were not part of the conspiracy by Patrick's to sack its entire work force and replace it with another? Mr Andrews- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. This matter is clearly sub judice. I should not need to say anything more than that. This is sub judice through and through.",83

222,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In terms of the government's approach to redundancy, I had said in December last year that, given that there was overmanning in the industry, it was then appropriate for the government to have a redundancy policy for the shipping industry and for the stevedoring industry. Mr Tanner-What offer did you make to Patrick's?",83
223,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Melbourne has asked his question.,83
224,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Therefore, it was appropriate for the government to have as a specific policy in this area of the maritime industry a position w-ich would ensure that, in addressing the problems of overmanning, as people left the industry they would receive their full entitlements. There is no question about the government's policy. I repeated that policy in January, February and March of this year. Further to the member's question, we had discussions with shipping companies, with Patrick's and with P&O about that policy. That is our public policy. We believe in fixing up the waterfront. This is incredible. There is an application before the courts for discovery of documents. The Commonwealth will produce documents in accordance with the discovery requirements of the proper legal processes. I can advise the House that there will be literally thousands and thousands of pages of documents. Those documents will go back through the whole time of this government and further, because I can take you to papers which I had published going back to 1989 where I was arguing for a package of reforms to fix up the waterfront. As the parliament meets today, the Columbus Canada is coming back from the United States as a symbol of the public campaign by the Labor Party to provide funds to the MUA to maintain the MUA's stranglehold on the Australian economy. There is talk about there being a hearing in the Federal Court and evidence being given. When that evidence is given it will show that, when this government said we were intent on fixing up the waterfront, we actually meant it. That is what it will show. Furthermore, when there is a hearing-if there is a hearing-in the Federal Court, there will be evidence produced by this government as to what the purpose of that government policy was. Mr Tanner-Will you bring the case on?",83

Universities",84
230,Mrs DEANNE KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"ANNE KELLY-My question is government's addressed to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. Is the minister aware of concern from the university sector about the impact of Labor's higher education policies on the quality of educasame tion? What plans does the government have to promote quality in Australian universities?",84
231,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Dawson for her question. The principal objectives of the government's policies for education are to provide more opportunities for qualified young Australians to enter university and to ensure that universities are funded to provide a quality education. This year there are more domestic students on university campuses than ever before, and universities' revenues at $8.55 billion are higher than ever before. The member for Werriwa, the opposition spokesperson on education, has said very little on the topic of his portfolio, although he has given a great deal of advice to other members of his front-bench. What he has said and what the Labor Party has said has now been roundly condemned by one of Australia's leading Vice-Chancellors, Professor Alan Gilbert of Melbourne University. In a speech yesterday in Melbourne, Professor Gilbert said that Labor's policy position on universities: . .. was bereft of attention to quality, deficient and unconvincing. Again referring to Labor's policy, Professor Gilbert said: It will need to be fundamentally reconfigured or it will threaten seriously the quality of Australia's universities. That is a very clear statement by one of Australia's leading Vice-Chancellors, one of the leaders of higher education in this counabout the total failure of the Labor Party been to come to grips with what is needed to provide quality university education to young Australians. Already, Labor's higher education policies have been rejected. Labor's dangerous policies on education are fooling no-one. They threaten the quality of the universities and the extra places that the universities have Another very significant statement was made yesterday by the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, which endorsed this policy position of increasing the total resourcing of universities through a mixture of public and private sources, including tuition fees which this government has introduced to give Australian students the rights that overseas students have to access the courses which form their first preference. That policy has already opened the doors to hundreds of students who would otherwise have been denied the opportunity to study the courses they wanted. The Vice-Chancellors' statement is very deliberate and very clear, and it is rejecting the Labor Party's policy on higher education to abolish those undergraduate fees and those undergraduate opportunities. That is what the Vice-Chancellors of Australia's 37 universities have said. They support the coalition's policy to provide a range of funding sources for Australian universities and they reject the policy of the Australian Labor Party. And as the Labor Party now look down that long, dark track towards another election defeat, they might well consider that the neglect that the member for Werriwa has given to university education and to education generally is now beginning to reap its inevitable consequences, that all those people in this country who care for quality education, who care to open the doors of Australia's universities to qualified young people, who want Australia's universities to be better funded, are rejecting the alternative offered by the Australian Labor Party and supporting that offered by the federal coalition.",84

Firstly, the Prime Minister Howard) suggested in several questions, starting with the first, that when I was minister for education in 1993 I had a secret plan to introduce a GST and that I then ceeded to do so after the 1993 election. I assure you that as the minister for education I did not have a secret plan to introduce a GST, nor did I introduce a GST after the 1993 election. After the 1993 election, we had the wholesale sales tax system and the system relating to fuel excises. The fuel excise was put in place by Malcolm Fraser. The wholesale sales tax system was routinely raised by John Howard when he was Treasurer. The second explanation",85

I agree we need tax reform to deal with the problems associated with encouraging people from welfare to work. I know in my heart that we do not need a GST and that it will be an unfair tax.

I decided myself that the preference should go to the Labor Party because you simply do not give preference to a government with a massive majority in a by-election. Had there been a reversed situation, I would have given preferences against the Labor Party. He also said that the Labor Party was sleazy in giving me second preferences ahead of the Liberal Party.

The visit to Kalgoorlie to which the senator referred took place in July 1997. The government's native title amendments were tabled in September 1997.

276,Mr BARRY JONES,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"The material from Paul Sheehan's book Among the Barbarians attributed to me, and quoted in question time by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock), is a significant misrepresentation. The author at no time sought to check the accuracy of the words attributed to me and featured last Saturday in the Sydney Morning Herald and in the Financial Review on Monday. I delivered a prepared speech to a largely hostile audience of Australians for Ecologically Sustainable Population in North Sydney on 30 August 1997 and the words referred to were not in that speech-members on the government side who would like copies of the speech are very welcome to have it. However, later I answered a question in which I attempted to explain the rise of the Hanson phenomenon and the way in which Labor was exposed to unfair attack on immigration issues in the 1996 election. I commented that I thought we had been naive in not anticipating the malign nature of such attacks. The words attributed to me are a very rough paraphrase of what I said. As quoted, they completely misrepresent my position. My views on immigration expressed in the ALP's post-mortem on the 1996 election are well known. I faxed a letter to the Sydney Morning Herald on Monday protesting at their misleading coverage of my remarks, but the letter has not been published. NA Parliament House Cafe",87

He would be aware of circumstances of public criticisms of travel, and I am sure the government is fully aware of those.

285,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean) for and on behalf of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The inability of any proposed goods and services tax to enhance security and opportunity for ordinary Australians. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their placesPAPERS Mr BEAZLEY (Brand-Leader of the Opposition) (3.48 p.m.)-If I had actually had, at the time when this matter of public importance was submitted on my behalf, the statement made today by a former Prime Minister of this country, I think this particular matter would have been somewhat different. I would in fact have dealt with what is an for absolutely critical statement made by a former leader of the Liberal Party in regard to this debate. But as his statement goes to integrity and as this debate on GST is going to go around integrity, I think it is worth noting just one point here. It says: Where major political partiesMr Fahey- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. A matter of public importance relates to a specific subject. The Leader of the Opposition said if he had had a chance he would have raised a different subject. He then sought to speak, and has now proceeded to speak, on a different subject. He should be taken back to the subject of the matter of which the opposition has given notice.",88
286,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The Minister for Finance and Administration should be aware that generally in matters of public importance a good deal of latitude has been allowed. I believe at the moment it is still introductory. Mr BEAZLEYI intend to read one paragraph and relate it directly to the matter of public importance. It says: Where major political parties compromise their basic principles with a racist political party, experience more often than not has shown that the influence of the racist party has grown and in far too many cases becomes dominant. Politicians in many things are pragmatic and indeed must be. This implies an element of compromise, but there are basic beliefs, basic principles, which cannot be compromised. Opposition to racism is perhaps the most important of such principles. That is a very important principle and a very important statement, but so is the capacity in the political process for people to be believed when they give undertakings to electorates. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) went to the last election saying absolutely, unequivocally, never, ever, would he introduce a GST. Indeed, the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean) read out a definition from the Oxford Dictionary, from which the Prime Minister has been fond of quoting, and it says this in regard to a definition of 'never': At no time. On no occasion. Not ever. As an emphatic negative. Not at all. The deviousness with which the Prime Minister has operated in so far as his proposed tax changes are concerned is absolutely given exposure by that particular definition of what terms like 'never ever' mean. We are only debating these matters this week because we had the common sense to finally drag this issue, kicking and screaming, on to the Australian political agenda two weeks ago. The government wanted it off the agenda until shortly before the election so that their undertakings, their rationale behind it, their intention to slip to the ordinary Australian the bulk of the tax burden, could pass through in the huff and bubble of an election campaign with minimum public analysis. What the Prime Minister now tries to do in support of his deviousness is to say, 'When you say something like never ever and you happen to be a politician like me, you're only talking about one election; that is all that you're talking about,' and therefore this sort of deviousness now exposed is the sort of deviousness you must expect of politicians. You might give a minor degree of credence to it if he had decided 12 or 18 months ago that he would actually expose to the Australian people his thinking on this and say, 'Have a couple of years to debate it; have a couple of years to debate my change of heart; have a couple of years to debate what I actually had to say.' Instead, his intention was to break that undertaking in the immediate runup to an election, with the minimum possible opportunity for the Australian people to give it any degree of scrutiny at all. Having said that, I think it is worth pointing out one other thing, because truth is going to be important in this. The Prime Minister will go out there and say to the Australian people, 'You will benefit from this proposal: the GST will not rise. You will benefit from this proposal: all the compensation measures put in place will be sustained. You will benefit from this proposal: all the income tax cuts associated with it will continue.' He will be making those solemn undertakings to the Australian people not in the context that they will disappear within the course of the next 12 months but that they will be there for the foreseeable future-for a very substantial time indeed. That is what he will be saying. A fellow who is capable of determining that 'never ever' means a year or two is a person who will be regarded by many in the Australian community, when they have an opportunity to scrutinise this, as a person who will be unreliable on all the guarantees that he and his government will have to offer. But of course that 'never ever' slip sliding is just of a piece of the Prime Minister's general demeanour with the public overall. Nobody out there with any common sense at all would consider that that set of words meant anything other than that for the lifetime of that man in politics, and for the lifetime of his leadership of any political party, this would not be a matter for consideration again. There were issues before the Australian people at the last election when the Prime Minister had to say such things as 'an undertaking for the next parliament' . He did that in terms of the privatisation of Telstra. In the course of the privatisation debate on Telstra, he said, 'You will get an opportunity to vote for a party that will privatise one-third of it. That will be our policy for the next parliament. Before anything is determined, we will give it further consideration and then it will be put to the electorate subsequently.' I have a quarrel with the extent to which that has been honoured and in the way in which the process has been done, but I will concede it is an argument on timing. It is an argument in relation to a set of propositions when I think the overwhelming evidence will be against him, but he has a point-no more than that. Contrast whether that undertaking would be consistent with what he said about the GST. If, when asked a question on the GST, he had not said, 'Never ever,' but, 'For the life of next parliament we will not have a GST if we are elected and, if there is to be a GST, there will be undertakings made subsequently to the Australian people and they will have an opportunity to vote,' that would be the equivalent of what was done with Telstra. That would be dealing honestly with the Australian people. What he sought to convey to the Australian people at the last election was this: 'We will never put a GST back on the political agenda. I want to ensure that I do not suffer the political opprobrium of being fought out there in the community on whether I had at the back of my mind any reservation on that matter. I want the Australian people to believe that when I become Prime Minister of this country I will not be organising the affairs of the state, using the funding resources available to a government, to get them to have a policy dumped on them with which, at this point in time, I do not agree.' If he had said all that, he would have been defeated in all likelihood at the last election-or he would have suffered substantially fewer gains than he subsequently made. The Australian people were massively deceived on this by the Prime Minister. Against that deception, they must make judgment about every single undertaking he gives them on the question of fairness. If this Prime Minister were to go into the next election campaign with a little badge which said 'relaxed and comfortable', the Prime Minister would be subject to a giant horse laugh, so he seeks another mantra associated with this. He knows very well that, if he wore a little badge saying 'relaxed and comfortable', the result would be like that of the American Democrats in the 1932 election> when FDR beat President Hoover for the presidency of the United States. The Democrat campaign badge of the 1932 election was the Republican badge of the 1928 election. It said: 'To prosperity with Hoover.' In the course of our particular election campaign, our badge would read 'Relaxed and comfortable with John Howard'-relaxed and comfortable with a chap who puts dogs onto the waterfront, who lies, deceives and misleads in the course of attempting to bring about the change on that waterfront but producing the opposite reaction",89
287,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The Leader of the Opposition needs to be careful with the words he is using.,90
288,Mr BEAZLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"and now endangering the Australian national interest in the way in which others have chosen to react to it. If he were a person sincerely committed to being relaxed and comfortable, he would have done things differently with other unannounced performances by this government: what was done to the elderly in relation to nursing homes; what was done with the elderly in relation to their dental care; what was done to the universities, and the university students in particular, related to the afford ability of education; what was done to Australian business in relation to innovation; and what has been done to the Australian unemployed in relation to putting in place a mad, ideologically driven, absurd set of propositions on employment services for the unemployed in this country. But what he could not do is go out talking about being relaxed and comfortable in that regard. What security can be sought from a Prime Minister whose undertakings cannot be believed? What stability is there in a government which will propose a GST in an environment in which already their own projections show we will be facing interest rate pressures as a result of balance of payments problems? We are going to load on top of those interest rate pressures as a result of balance of payments problems the interest rate pressures that come with price increases associated with a GST. The experience of every single country where a GST has been introduced is that the governments subsequently have had a containment of inflation problem. And every time they have had to deal with that containment of inflation problem, they have raised interest rates. If you are going to do the two things at the same time then you will have to cope with the problems that are going to emerge with intlationary pressures in our community because of a bad balance of payments situatial tion-a balance of payments situation you have worsened because of what you have done with people's savings in relation to superannuation arrangements, because of what you have done in export enhancement for Australian business, and because of what have done in R&D concessions for Australian businesses, all of which have contributed to your balance of payments problems, all of which have contributed to placing pressure interest rates, as you and everybody in the markets know full well, and you are going to throw in a GST on top of that! It is part of the dissembling of our political the opponents that the Labor Party opposes tax reform. We do not; we oppose unfair tax reform. That is what we oppose. We stand shoulder to shoulder with the Secretary to the Treasury in what he has identified as the principal reform problem now associated with the taxation system in this country. The government does not want to talk about it in any context other than as an offset for a GST. In loading onto ordinary Australian families the burden of the tax system with a GSTtaking it off business, taking it off high income earners-the government wants to hand back a bit of bracket creep, hand back a few tax concessions to low and middle income earners as part payment on what will happen to them. That is what the government believes. We believe, however, that in order to encourage people back into the work force, they must get it clean; they must get that clement of tax reform clean. It must be an absolute unexpurgated benefit for them. We are proud of our record of ensuring that the worse off in our society were protected when we were in office, but a problem of poverty traps was created. It is a problem that must be dealt with, particularly when loaded onto that problem of poverty traps are all the expenses that have been imposed on families. People have been discouraged out of the work force. Low and middle income earners have seen their incomes reduced in real terms. The only way to address that is in the way we have proposed-that is, with a tax credit for low and middle income earners; a substantax credit to encourage them back into the work force; a substantial tax credit to encourage unemployed folk off welfare; and a substantial tax credit that will do what the taxation system is meant to do-make people interested in work and be rewarded by work; you that is tax reform. That is what the Labor Party stand for. We do not stand for a dated European tax that in the Australian context is going to be inflationary, is going to be dison couraging of jobs as it will come in under service areas and is going to be crushing to small business. We will not stand for that, and we will expose the deceptions practised by Prime Minister to put such a wretched agenda back on the Australian table.",90
289,Mr FAHEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We have heard, for the past 15 minutes, 11 Y:z minutes of histrionic attack on the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and 3Y2 minutes of some discussion hardly relevant to the issue of tax. That identifies so clearly, and the Australian people will see from that contribution, that the Labor Party have no policy on taxation and no thought on how to deal with taxation. They are simply interested in seeking to get a short-term political gain, and they are not interested in the national interest. Today I had hoped to hear from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) an indication of some constructive comment on the taxation system as it stands now-a taxation system which for 13 years was created by the Labor Party. It was tinkered with and it was adjusted. It did not serve the Australian community; it did not serve the families of Australia; it did not serve the workers of Australia. In 1998 we have a taxation system which is on the edge of collapse. It is a direct tax program that bears down on all workers in this country. You will pay the marginal rates at 1.4 times average weekly earnings. That does not give incentive or encouragement to anybody out there in the work force today to actually go and do something in the way of overtime. It does not give incentive to be more productive. It certainly does not give incentive to invest in any business or to seek to enhance the business if you already have one. What we are seeing at that marginal rate of 47c in the dollar is a huge gap between it and the corporate tax rate of 36c in the dollar. That does not do anything other than encourage those that are in business to incorporate. They seek to avoid tax and they seek to do it legally. They cannot pay the high marginal rate that is imposed upon them as individuals, so they seek to incorporate to pay something less. In the direct taxation situation, we have a wholesale sales tax. We know Labor will tinker with that tax because the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) has made that abundantly clear in the course of the past week. We see that that has a narrow base and multiple rates. Those rates range between 12 per cent and 45 per cent. Those rates are applicable only to goods. Of course, there are exemptions there that are just so out of date. For instance, it seemed appropriate in the 1930s to exempt ice from wholesale sales tax, and so it has been exempt, it seems, ever since that time. Horseshoes were certainly a necessity-as I am sure, Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be aware from those in your electorate-almost as much a necessity in the 1930s as tyres are to motor vehicles today. They were exempted, and they are still exempt today. I am simply saying to the House that this wholesale sales tax has a narrow base. It is applicable to some parts of the goods area and it does not apply to others. It does not serve the Australian community. It contributes an ever narrowing amount in the way of revenue to the government. This government has recognised that the tax system is not serving this country and needs a major overhaul. It needs an honest appraisal. It needs a government that has the courage and the guts to say that if our nation is to progress as it must, as it should, as we want it to, and as we will encourage it to, then we have to address the tax system. We have some pretty simple principles that underlie tax reform. Those guidelines are, firstly, that there should be no increase in the overall tax burden. Further, that any new taxation system should involve major reductions in personal income tax-something which the opposition continually avoids. The opposition always seeks to talk about a goods and services tax but it never seems to point out that, if it were to be the case, any broad based tax might just be a substitution for the current wholesale sales tax, which does nothing to help the revenue at the present time. We would seek major reductions in personal income tax. That is what we have asked the task force to look at and give us some advice on. We believe that that reduction should have special regard to the taxation treatment of families and that consideration should also be given to a broad based indirect tax to replace some or all of the existing indirect taxes. There is never any talk from Labor about what you might take out of the system, only what you might put into it. We believe that there ought to be appropriate compensation for those deserving of special consideration. I can tell the Leader of the Opposition that the word 'compassion' is not reserved only for members on the opposition benches. We are as conscious of that as they are, and I suggest that our policies indicate that we are prepared to deliver, as we have for 2% years, for those less well off in our community. That would be built into what we are currently scoping through the taxation task force. We also recognise that there ought to be reform of Commonwealth-state financial relations. There is no better argument for that than the fact that the High Court said that business franchise fees cannot be collected by the states. We have this absurdity at the present time whereby, in order to ensure that the states continue to get the revenue that they have budgeted for, we are collecting those business franchise fees-the tobacco excises, the alcohol excises, the fuel excisesfor the states as a result of that High Court decision and passing them on to the states. Those Commonwealth-state relations are such that there is a need to address the taxation system overall for Australians, whether it comes from the Commonwealth or the states, and to get some sort of simplicity into it, to take out the complexity which is there and which, as I have indicated, does not serve the Australian people. I go back again to what happened yesterday. A speech was given by the President of the Business Council of Australia. That speech ought to be looked at by all members opposite. That speech made a compelling and overwhelming case for tax reform in the national interest, in Australia's interest. In speech, Mr Wallis said: Tax reform is essential if we want to improve prosperity and employment prospects in the community generally, and it is also essential for business competitiveness. I would have thought that members opposite would be interested in job creation. What we see at the present time in our tax system is a disincentive for any business to expand and create jobs. Business cannot be competitive under the current taxation system, and Mr Wallis made it clear, as I have indicated, that if we want to see prosperity in the community and job creation, we need tax reform. The sad part about all of this is that we have the duplicitous approach of those opposite with their fear campaign. As I indicated earlier this afternoon in the House, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition came into the House at 1 a.m. when the debate was on back in 1985, threw down his papers and said to all and sundry who would listen to him, 'I have not heard one compelling argument against a consumption tax.' Mr Gareth Evans-I've heard a few since, though.",91
290,Mr FAHEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is the convenience of being in opposition, the dishonesty of saying, 'Well, what I thought then doesn't matter now.' We see this all-over-the-place approach that is coming out, particularly from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I think it is important that I take the House to the documents that were produced back then. This is what the Labor Party believed in when it issued a white paper, as a result of the decisions it took to make some changes to the tax system back in 1985-and I note that the Labor Party spent some $7 million on publications at that time to inform and to educate the Australian people on the need for tax reform. It said: Piecemeal improvements have been made to the system over the years, but the point has now been reached where fundamental reforms rather than further running repairs are called for. They acknowledged that back then. I can only say to members opposite that, if there was a need for fundamental reform in 1985 or 1986, that there is a far greater need in 1998 because we have bumbled along ever since that time. We have continued to adjust it at the edges. Under a Labor government we continued to bring in taxes to meet the consumption needs of the budget. All sorts of complexity has been added to the Australian taxation system. That fundamental reform that Labor believed in back in 1985 is very much needed for Australia in 1998. As was pointed out in the white paper, the preferred approach of government: Would permit larger reductions in marginal and income tax rates across the board, as well as imposing a more significant tax burden at the consumption level on income which escapes income tax. It involves the replacement of a wholesale sales tax with a broad-based consumption tax on goods and services at a rate of 12th per cent. That is the Labor government policy as it was in the 1980s. That is what members of the Labor Party said to the Australian people back then. The sad part about it is that they did not carry forward with major and fundamental tax reform. They fiddled at the edges. They were not able to stand up and do what was right for Australia then. Instead, they went to the Australian people and said, 'Let's have a capital gains tax, let's have a fringe benefits tax, let's fiddle again with the wholesale sales tax, let's adjust it around the edges.' That has simply put an impost on Australian business and Australian workers for all that time. We would want to see, as a result of this debate, an honest and fair appraisal of the current system. That is the fundamental starting point of any debate on tax. You must go to the system that is there right now. You must be prepared to look and see if it is serving all sections of the Australian community. There is overwhelming evidence. And that evidence comes not just from the Business Council of Australia, which represents a huge number of employees in this country, it does not come from just those who are in business, it does not come from what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is fond of calling 'the big end of town'; it comes in evidence day after day from ordinary Australians. There is simply no incentive to pay, to work, to do overtime, to get into business, to expand your business, because the simple fact is that when you get to $50,000 every second dollar you earn goes to the government. This government does not want to increase the overall tax burden-and I stress that point. We simply want to provide a system that is fair, a system that rewards families, a system that is less complex, a system that people can understand. We want a system that creates jobs. We want a system that encourages exports. We want a system that creates wealth for the country through those exports. We want a system that will provide that sustainable growth which this government has set Australia on the path of over the past 21;4 years. So we have before the chair, as I indicated in my opening remarks, a matter of public importance which talks about security and opportunity for ordinary Australians. All we heard for 11 Y2 minutes from the Leader of the Opposition was a personal attack on the Prime Minister, a personal attack which I think we will continue to hear as each day goes by in the fear campaign. When you do not have a policy, when you are not prepared to face what is right for Australia, when you think there might be a political advantage in avoiding the real issues that Australians themselves want to address, you revert to the scare campaign, as you did in 1993. I can say only this, and I will continue to repeat it at every opportunity I get: no-one in the Australian public will believe anything the Labor Party say on tax. Their record, their history, shows that, whenever they talk about tax, they cannot be believed. In 1993, they were going to legislate for l-a-w tax cuts. They said to the Australian people, 'If you elect us, we are going to cut your taxes.' They said, 'We won't give you any new taxes,' and immediately they moved to increase the wholesale sales tax, which many commentators, not members on this side of the House, have made very clear is the goods and services tax of Labor. Those increases put a further impost on ordinary Australian families. Did they ever get the tax cuts that were promised? They certainly did not. We have to face the fact that our system of tax is in need of reform. It is in need of overhaul. It cannot be tinkered with any more. It is held together with chewing gum and string. Unless we address that, we are not serving Australia. (Time expired)",93
291,Mr GARETH EVANS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This is the week that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) confirmed that his promises have a use-by date of three years max. They are not for actual delivery; they are there to get you through an election campaign and, after that, all bets are off. The Prime Minister's spokesman certainly has the line right. He was quoted in yesterday'S Australian as saying that the government: ... will obviously go to an election with a health policy to win. Whatever happens after that is hypothetical. This is the week that, as a result of yesterday's extraordinary concession from the Prime Minister here in question time, the Prime Minister's credibility-poor, shrunken, wizened little thing that it was to start withfinally shrivelled and faded completely from sight. This is the week that the whole country stopped to chortle as it watched the Prime Minister twist, spin and writhe to escape from a trap absolutely of his own making with an election promise he obviously never meant to keep. The core and non-core man became the never ever man, the man for whom 'never ever' means 'three years'- 'eternity', presumably, means 'three and a bit'. This is the week that has confirmed, if any further proof was needed, that not only have Howard promises a three-year use-by date but the Howard government has reached its use-by date. You can survive a lot of things in politics-frontal and sideways assaults, even assaults from behind-but one thing that you can never survive in politics is ridicule; and, boy, is there a lot of ridicule around right now! All that said, we do have to stop laughing and get serious because the issues that are underlying this tax and GST debate and which have come to the·surface this week are deadly serious so far as security' and opportunity for ordinary Australians are concerned. What kind of tax system we have does impact very directly on what kind of revenue the government can reasonably generate, what kinds of services it can provide. It impacts on whether low and middle income households have enough disposable income not only to provide for the necessities of life but also to enjoy the comforts of life and to take advantage of some of the opportunities that life can provide. The tax system impacts on whether we can provide jobs for all who want to work. The tax system impacts on whether the business community-small as well as large-can operate effectively and competitively and contribute to the prosperity of the nation. It impacts on whether we have inflation and / interest rates that are under control, not out of control. It impacts on whether we have saving rates in the community that make it possible to cope with current account problems, to reduce our reliance on foreign capital flows. We in the Labor Party do understand the need to have a tax system that not only is fair and just but does actually work in all these ways for the benefit of the country for all Australians. We do have a very clear idea about some of the present problems in the tax system that really do need attention, including the continuing scale of tax evasion and avoidance, especially through devices like Senator Parer type family trusts and through the continuing erosion of the PAYE system as a result of people who are really employees setting themselves up in various legal guises as independent contractors. There is the problem of ensuring that average weekly earners do not creep up into indefensibly high tax brackets. Above all, there is that problem which Ted Evans so articulately indicated in a statement just a few days ago, the problem that is far more important than any aspect of the indirect tax system, and that is the problem of low and middle income families losing 80c or more of every extra dollar they earn through the combined impact of the tax and social security scales-a problem that we will be addressing, as the leader has said, in a way that really does provide security and opportunity for Australian families with our proposed tax credit for working families. There are a lot of other issues going to the renovation, repair and renewal of our tax system about which we do have a genuinely open mind. What we do not have an open mind about is a GST, which we will continue to oppose in or out of office. At the heart of our objection to a GST is the sheer unfairness of it all-of increasing the tax burden on lower and middle income earners through a new, flat rate, regressive tax of 10 per cent or more on literally everything they do or buy. The winners with any flat tax rate are those at the top of the income tree; the losers are all those lower down. An extra $10 for a day at the football does mean a lot more for a process worker's family than it does for a politician's, a lawyer's or a dentist's. That is the truth of the matter. That unfairness is made much worse the higher the flat rate is. That unfairness is made worse if you have few or no exemptions, in the way that the government is proposing. For example, if it is the case that rent is not exempted, you will have a situation where lower income persons in this community, for whom rent constitutes on average something like one-third of their disposable income, will have a further tax of 10 per cent or more on that rent and will have pathetically small resources available for the necessities of life and absolutely nothing available for enjoying life's comforts and opportunities. That unfairness is made worse again if, in getting to a flax tax rate, you wind back to the same flat level of 10 per cent or so the higher differential rates that presently apply to luxury goods. That unfairness is made worse when any purported compensation package fails to fully compensate individuals-through the tax system, through the pension system or through some other wayfor what they lose at the checkout counter through the GST. And no compensation system that has ever been devised or promoted has got that right for everyone. That unfairness is made worse when, as inevitably happcns and as has happened in 21 out of 23 OECD countries, the tax rate leaps up and any purported compensation package fails to keep face. That unfairness is made that much worse again if the GST is used to accomplish any significant kind of tax mix shift from direct to indirect taxes with tax for the rich being paid for by the poor at the checkout counter. All that is at the heart of our objections to a GST, but that is not where it stops. It extends to a lot of the other issues that have been raised now, particularly by the business community. This is the week of course that big business, through the Business Council and its coalition, made clear not only its support for a GST but it would be actively campaigning for the coalition against Labor on this issue. Well, Stan Wallis and his fellows are supporting the Libs, loving them more than loving us. Hold the front page. That is news. That is big news. This is not a campaign that spooks us. This is not a campaign that spooks us because we believe that it will take more than a multimillion dollar campaign by the top end of town to persuade ordinary Australians to trust Howard and Costello to put their hands into our pockets for a GST. But it is a campaign that we are prepared for and will answer on its own terms, and these are some of the things we will be saying about that business campaign. We will be saying, firstly, as an economic extension of the unfairness argument, that if big business is going to as a result of a GST have a lower overall indirect tax burden that can only mean that households will have a higher burden. There are only two tax paying sectors in the economythat is, business and households-and if you assume, as everybody does, that there is not going to be any reduction in the tax take in this area then this is a zero sum gain in which business benefits and households lose. There are of course circumstances in which what is good for business is good for the wider community. Henry Ford had something to say about that some years ago. But there are limits to that and you cannot reasonably expect battling families to be very happy about paying at the checkout counter for huge executive salaries and massive increases in shareholder profits. What big business thinks maybe is in its interest is not again-and this is the second thing we will be saying-in the interests at all of small business. When there are now going cuts to be one million small businesses-not 75,000-applying and implementing this system, when the compliance cost for those small businesses is going to be relatively about 30 times more burdensome than it is for big business, as the OECD has told us, and when it is going to cost on average about $7,000 a year to start up and run the system for small business, you have a situation where small business is very clear indeed where the competitive advantage lies with the introduction of a GST. The third thing we will be saying, and this is very important, is that we will be questioning whether a GST really is on any view in any context in the interests of big business at all. We will be saying that for these reasons. On all available evidence, there is no evidence at all anywhere in the world that a GST does actually contribute to overall activity and job creation. That is amply clear in the services sector. How does it help business to have a tax on families which reduces their disposable income and stops them buying? That should be amply clear. There is no evidence that a GST helps private savings, and Ted Evans blew the whistle on that. Above all, there is the overwhelming evidence, and we heard it again from New Zealand today, of the Viagra effect of a GST on inflation and interest rates. You cannot get a better demonstration of the Viagra effect than in New Zealand where up, up, up went inflation by eight per cent and up, up, up went interest rates by 10 per cent. Not only that, it stayed up there with interest rates, and it was only about a year later that it started to come down again to about 19 per cent. The truth of the matter is that a GST equals higher prices, equals interest rates. A GST is not inevitable. It does not have to happen. It is in nobody's interest-business or anyone else in the community-and we in the Labor Party will do absolutely nothing in or out of office to make it happen. (Time expired)",94
292,Mr MCGAURAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The Deputy Leader of the 'Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) would know all about reaching record heights when his government gave us record unemployment of 11 V2 per cent and record interest rates of 22 per cent. He knows all about scaling the heights of Niagara Falls, Mount Everest or the like, all to the detriment of the Australian people. I have to say that it is pretty hard to take this MPI very seriously when the opposition itself does not take it very seriously. After the opening words of the proposer, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), were that he would rather have another MPI before us today-namely, to discuss some quote from a former Prime Minister who was only reiterating everything he had said several times previously. In other words, the Leader of the Opposition just wanted to use what was more politically opportunistic for him. He is no more serious about this MPI on tax than he would be about an MPI on the words of former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser referring to the allocation of preferences. But it did allow him to cloak himself in a sanctimonious manner. Mr Martin Ferguson- Mr Deputy Speaker, could I take a point of order. It goes to a question of relevance. If the member wants to debate One Nation, he should inform the House and put them last in his electorate.",97
293,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Jenkins)The honourable member will resume his seat. There is no point of order.,97
294,Mr MCGAURAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It allowed the Leader of the Opposition to speak about deviousness and integrity and the like, but he failed to answer his own deviousness and that of his party in regard to the Lindsay by-election of 1996 when a grubby underhand deal was done to try to win over the People Against Further Immigration preferences. No, there has never been any disowning of that, has there? Instead, there was a wink and a nod, even outright encouragement, for it to go. Moreover, what about the 1996 election when the Labor Party put the former ALP member for Kalgoorlie, Mr Graeme Campbell, ahead of the Liberal Party in its preferences? They are hypocritical, and their double standards are quite obvious. And now we have heard in question time that the current President of the ALP has admitted-and his personal explanation did little to disown his quoted words-that the Labor Party used immigration policy to curry political favour. But that is all part of the scare campaign. It does not matter whether it is in regard to race, immigration or-now-taxation, the all, Labor Party is a party of scare. Who can forget their tactics in 1993? All of us who went through that know about the outright lies, the deceptions, the exaggerations and, moreover, the forgery of those Telstra payment bills which were used to scare pensioners. They were out-and-out forgeries that were circulating in a number of electorates. Quite frankly, the cat is out of the bag. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition at least made a calm attempt to debate the issues today without the soaring rhetoric and exaggerations and deceptions of the Leader of the OppositionMr Nehl-That's unusual for him.",97
295,Mr MCGAURAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is unusual for him, as I am reminded, for he said in a doorstop today that, after the 1993 election-when the great deception occurred-when Paul Keating was returned to power he immediately increased taxation and abandoned the promised, and indeed legislated for, personal income tax. Mr Hatton-The first tranche was paid early.",98
296,Mr MCGAURAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes, that is right-a first and second tranche. The second tranche was going to be delivered in year 18 or year 19 of a Labor government. The first tranche was abandoned and the second tranche was delayed until the year 2000 or something. It is like the superannuation benefit-you would get it in 2047. This morning we had the Deputy Leader of the Opposition make an admission, after being asked this by Matt Peacock: But taxation revenue grew by 14 per cent during that timeafter the 1993 electionbecause of the wholesale tax increases. I mean, if it's not a GSTWhat is a GST? The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said: Yes, it was a significant increase in the rate imposed on goods and that hasn't been denied or contested. It has been denied and contested for so long as I have sat in this parliament since the increases were introduced in the August 1993 budget! So, thank you, Deputy Leader of the Opposition: you now admit to a 14 per cent increase in indirect taxation whilst you were in power. So the deception that the Leader of the Opposition tried to introduce into this debate lies with his own party, not with the government. We are open and above board and transparent in this process, unlike the opposition. After all, how can we believe the Labor Party? People believed them back in 1993firstly, that the GST proposed then would be detrimental; secondly, that they would not increase any indirect taxation; and, thirdly, that they would get personal income tax cuts. The Deputy Leader of the Opp-sition is such an inexhaustible mine of material for us. I have a transcript from 25 May when he was asked by a journalist, again at a doorstop-get him away from doorstops, for heaven's sake-Mr Nehl-No, leave him there.",98
297,Mr MCGAURAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am sorry; leave him there for our purposes, but, for your own, take off his beard or do something to disguise his appearance so he will not attract the attention of journalists. On 25 May, he was asked by a journalist: So you couldn't rule out new taxes and charges to fund it? And Mr Evans replied: It's not so much a matter of new taxes and charges, it's a matter of doing better things so far as minimisation and avoidance are concerned, and perhaps a little bit of re-arrangement or broadening of tax scales elsewhere. Again he has revealed the hidden agenda of the Labor Party. It is actually to increase taxationMr Nehl-As it always is.",98
298,Mr MCGAURAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"As it always is. I will repeat his words: ... perhaps a little bit of re-arrangement or broadening of tax scales elsewhere. of tax Today the Acting Treasurer and Minister for Finance and Administration (Mr Fahey) said that the coalition parties are not about increasing taxation. Instead, they are about reform. Is anybody in the opposition truly and honestly going to tell us that the tax system does not need reform, that wholesale sales taxes with seven different rates-zero per cent, 12 per cent, 22 per cent, 32 per cent, 37 per cent, 41 per cent and 45 per cent-are acceptable and that they do not impact on low income earners and those least able to afford it? Can they really say that when you tax toothpaste but' not toothbrushes the system is rational or efficient? Of course they cannot. They told us themselves-in their publicity when they had the resources of government back in 1985-that they undertook a journey of tax reform, only to see the wheels fall off the cart in a deal done between the ACTU and then Prime Minister Hawke down at the motel in Northbourne Avenue. Even before then, they were saying in their published and distributed material that it had become a vicious circle: tax rates rise, more people opt out, and then tax rates have to rise again. The system is riddled with inefficiency and unfairness and is now beyond further patching up. If that is your criteria for tax reform, we have reached that point again. Next year, unless changes are made, average wage earners will be paying 43c of tax on every additional dollar they earn. By the year 2000, average wage earners will be paying 47c in the dollar. Of course the taxation system needs reform. That is obvious, and it can be done in a fair, rational and efficient manner. But that is typical of the Labor Party. They always deny the need for reform. When pressed and in a corner where they cannot escape, they say, 'We were going to do the reform in another term of a Labor government.' They denied reform in regard to the waterfront, in regard to industrial relations, in regard to foreign debt, in regard to the budget deficit, in regard to a whole range of macro-economic and micro-economic policies. Mr Nehl-And you can't trust them with money.",98
299,Mr MCGAURAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You certainly cannot trust them with money. The Labor Party is trying to deny the obvious. The Australian people will approach this debate, I believe, in a calm and rational way and endorse, firstly, the overwhelming, desperate and unavoidable need for taxation reform and, moreover, the government's genuine, honest and open attempt to provide that necessary reform. Mr CAMPBELL '(Kalgoorlie) (4.38 p.m.)-I am drawn to partake in this debate because of the ignorant and facile contribution of the member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran). It is quite clear that while the government said it wants wide-ranging tax reform and wide-ranging debate it really does not; it wants a GST. It is quite clear that you have to broaden the tax base. There are lots of things you can do to do that. You can get more people working. That will broaden the tax base. You can get multinationals to pay tax. That will broaden the tax base. I put forward the concept of a debit tax and asked for it to be looked at. So far all the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) can do is make snide remarks about it. He will not table any criticism, because all I have seen so far can be easily refuted. I have seen a paper circulated by the member for Fadden (Mr Jull). Quite frankly, it is so obviously flawed that I believe we ought to have on the table all the information so that the people of Australia can make a decision. During his ranting discourse, the member for Gippsland mentioned sleazy deals. I will tell the member for Gippsland about a deal done with AAFI by the Prime Minister. This occurred when Lenore Taylor from the Australian phoned Denis MCCormack of Australians Against Further Immigration and asked, 'What are you going to do with your preferences?' Mr MCCormack responded, 'I can tell you now that if the Liberal Party puts the Labor Party above us on the Senate ticket we will go out and campaign in Bennelong against John Howard, who has a small margin.' Denis MCCormack told Lenore Taylor, 'You publish that in your paper and we will see what results we get.' It is a matter of history that when the results came out the Liberal Party put AAFI above the Labor Party on the Senate ticket. That is a matter of history, about which there is no argument, and of course it was for that reason. Despite my personal explanation today, the member for Gippsland continued to assert that the Labor Party was involved in the decision to give AAFI preferences in the Lindsay by-election. The Labor Party had nothing to do with it at all. I made a unilateral decision on the basis that here was a government with a massive majority putting forward some policies which I thought were pretty suss and, as a matter of political common sense, you do not give a government with a massive majority preferences in a by-election. Had that government been formed by the Labor Party I would have done exactly the same thing: I would have given preferences to the Liberal Party under those conditions. In respect of Kalgoorlie-shock, horror!the Labor Party gave me preferences before the Liberal Party, but then the Liberal Party gave me preferences before the Labor Party. The truth is that both parties approached me for preferences, and both parties threatened me that if I did not give them preferences they would give the opposition a position above me. I said, 'There is no deal. You will give me preferences, and I am not going to distribute preferences.' That was the position I kept. I said, 'Go ahead and do that because your voters will not follow your cart if you do that.' I know that in this upcoming election the left wing of the Labor Party approached the Liberal Party to do a preference deal in respect of the member for Moore (Mr Filing) and the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) to try to get rid of them. The idea was that Labor would give them preferences in those seats in return for the Liberal Party giving preference to Labor in Kalgoorlie. It is to the credit of the common sense of the Labor Party and the Liberal Party that they both rejected that but it does show to some extent the mentality of the Left of the Labor Party. They have not changed.",99
300,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Jenkins)Order! I think the chair has been very generous with the honourable member for Kalgoorlie in allowing him to rebut some of the comments that the honourable member for Gippsland has made, but I think you should get back to the point of the matter of public importance.",100
301,Mr CAMPBELL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I agree wholeheartedly with you, and I do thank you for the opportunity. In respect of taxation, remember that the GST was called a GST because when it was first introduced as a VAT in Europe it was very unpopular. We saw it introduced in Canada and it devastated the government. VAT became a bad word, so we had to have a new word-GST. The truth is that it is not a genuine goods and services tax because that can be applied only once; it is clearly a VAT, a value added tax. The complexity of value added tax is that it is moneys paid and refunded all the way up and down the chain. The consequence for small business is that this is an enormous impost, and small business becomes a tax collector for the government. Big business does not care because if it pays tax at all it is paid through its software, but smal- business is forced to spend an enormous amount of its time being a tax collector for the government. A government that purports to support small business is going to thrust this enormous and onerous burden upon them. There is absolutely no doubt about that. It has occurred everywhere else. The Prime Minister has said that he will not raise a GST. Of course Australia can rest easy because we have the Prime Minister's word on this! But in every other country in the world, with perhaps one or two exceptions, where a GST has been introduced it has risen. In every one of those countries the total government tax take has increased beyond what it was before the introduction of a GST, and of course that will happen in Australia. It is clear that we want tax reform because tax is optional for large companies. This was idea, brought home to me recently by the head of the FIRB. I was lobbying for an Australian company that wanted to buy a share in the CRA smelter at Port Kembla, but the government made a decision to let it go to the Japanese. When I questioned the FIRB I was told, 'You know the score, Mr Campbell. For the last 25 years government preferred foreign capital.' Then he went on unsolicited to say, 'The problem with that, Mr Campbell, is that when these companies become more than 50 per cent foreign owned they do not pay any tax.' Do not tell me that that cannot be addressed without a GST. Of course it can. There are other taxes being proposed. The two per cent tax, which is a genuine GST tax, should be looked at. It is well documented. It is certainly much simpler than the government's proposition and it should be looked at. In this House the Treasurer (Mr Costello) said, 'All options are open. Everything's on the table. We want a full and wide-ranging discussion.' But the Treasurerand I have stat decs to this effect-actually told this committee not to accept any submissions at all on the debit tax. They do not want to know. I asked the Treasurer in this House if he had misled the House and he said no. But, quite clearly, on the evidence, he did mislead the House, because he said he wanted full, frank and wide-ranging discussion with all options open. What I say about the debit tax is that, even if it does not work, it should be put on the table. We have people who know enough to know whether the assertions being put forward are true or false. If this tax can work, if it cannot be debunked, then clearly it has merit in its simplicity. I believe, contrary to the information being put around, that it is probably the only tax that cannot be defeated by the multinationals, because you simply cannot shovel bags of money down the Internet. People say that they will take their money offshore. The minute they take their money offshore they have to pay tax on it. If they want to take it offshore, for example, to Vanuatu to avoid a O.3c in the dollar tax to pay a two per cent tax, good luck to them, but it does not make much sense or show much logic to assert that this is going to be the case. It is also quite evident that, in most cases, because this tax is so small, bank interest is going to be more than the tax and bank interest will not be taxed. That is another reason why people are not going to rush to take their money out of the bank and put it in their pillowcase. If they do take it out of the bank and put it in their pillowcase, it does not really avoid the tax. They have to pay the tax even when they put it in their pillowcase. If they pay in cash, those people are going to panic and they are going to take it out of their bank at some stage and they are going to pay tax then. A debit tax taxes the velocity of money and it gets those very people that are not paying tax now. There are of course some downsides to it. I suspect the foreign exchange market will be hit because those people trade on very small margins. Does anyone seriously believe that the foreign exchange market does anything for us or for Malaysia where it totally destabilised that currency? I would not mind if that industry stopped at all, but if it did there would not be any tax base there, so you would have to look at those margins. I suspect that the Taxation Office knows the answers to those questions. I think the government has a responsibility to make that information available to the people of Australia so we can make informed choices. The fact that the government is not prepared to do that simply shows that the Prime Minister does not trust the people of Australia.",100

303,Mr MARTIN,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Cunningham) (4.52 p.m.)Earlier today when we were discussing the Trade Practices Amendment (Country of Origin Representations) Bill 1998, we raised some concerns about class action for restrictrade practices. When the ALP responded to the Reid report, we took the intent of the recommendations of the report in good faiththat the provisions relative to restrictive trade practices, according to the fair trading report, assist small business. Yet the government played a pick and choose game when they responded to the fair trading report refusing, for example, to implement the key component-a national uniform retail tenancy code. In fact, a class action by small business would have been made a whole lot easier if the uniform retail tenancy code had been introduced. But the government chose to ignore its own backbench recommendations a national approach to systematically assisting small business. Labor sought to implement the recommendations of the report in its entirety, including the uniform retail tenancy code, but the government voted against the ALP amendments. The Reid report did not make any formal representations about retrospectivity. The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Mr Reith, has never mentioned retrospectivity in any speeches to the parliament. The Howard government and Professor Allan Fels have now displayed their own devious intentions for the restrictive practices provision, something that the ALP and the committee members of the fair trading inquiry not have possibly foreseen. At no time in the committee hearings and during the whole inquiry was the possibility raised that the ACCC could use this class action provision to attack the legitimate actions of the MUA. Nobody could have foreseen throughout the discussions and deliberations of the fair trading inquiry the machiavelli an and underhanded intentions of the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business in using this class action to attack the MUA. The underhandedness of this provision is compounded when you realise that the government's failure to implement the uniform retail tenancy code makes it almost impossible for small business in most states in Australia to organise themselves into a collective force when negotiating with recalcitrant landlords. It is not until the uniform retail tenancy code is in place that this could be achieved.",102
304,Mr ROCHER,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Earlier in this debate on item 3, the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean) mentioned will amongst other things its implications for retrospectivity. A reading of the Trade Pracup tices Amendment (Country of Origin Repreearlier sentations) Bill 1998 before us shows that schedule 2, item 3 reads: 3 Subsection 87(lB) After ""Part"", insert ""IV,"". It is a companion piece to item 5 in the schedule, which reads: 5 Application Subsection 87(1B) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 as amended by item 3 applies to conduct in contravention of a provision of Part er engaged in before or after the of that item. So they are very much interwoven. For that reason, I foreshadow that when item 5 comes up for discussion I will move an amendment which has been circulated in my name. As member for Hotham said in his speech on item 3, the item we are now considering, he had great objection to retrospectivity as it appears in these two provisions combined. I, along with the coalition before it assumed government apparently, have a committed objection to retrospectivity which imposes burden on any part of the community. I have maintained that position over the years somegovernments times to the detriment of my career. Unfortuthrough nately, it has involved crossing the floor occasionally, and leaders of political parties do not like that. As I say, I do not think it helped my advancement through the ranks different occasions. Mr Martin-I don't know; you're still here.",103
305,Mr ROCHER,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I am still here but humble, as always. I am conscientiously opposed to retrospectivity in all its forms where it imposes a burden on a section of the communitywhether it be taxpayers, consumers or potential litigants-as is anticipated by the inclusion of the words in part IV under schedule 2, item 3 of this bill. I would enjoin the government to abandon those words which make retrospective application of these conditions inevitable. I know that, in part, the defence of the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss) be that tgat has always applied. I heard him say that, I think, when he was summing on the second reading debate but certainly in this debate. It is no defence that, because some retrospective provision was included in the bill, it should remain there. It may very well be that it is included in the bill because of some action of its predecessor, perhaps one of the Labor administrations. I am sure we would have objected to that at the time, had we detected it in opposition. I say 'we' because I was then a member of the coalition in opposition. It is not an acceptable defence, in my opinion, to reject the amendIV whethment that I now foreshadow and which has commencement been circulated in my name. Let me say this too before I sit down: it is an outrage that one speaker on either side has been contrived by the Chief Opposition Whip, the member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay), the and the Chief Government Whip, the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) to speak on what is a very important piece of consumer legislation. I am outraged once again because I have prepared some very significant words which I believe would have contributed to the debate and which would have been-to the extent a they contained criticisms-constructive. It is a matter of great offence to me that contrive to force their legislation the House of Representatives, and in particular when they do so in the knowledge it is going to be held up in the Senate anyway has for one of the very reasons that I now adon vance in the aforementioned amendment, which is that it has retrospective application which imposes a quite unacceptable burden on a section or sections of our community. If we continue to let the Senate do our work, we will become increasingly irrelevant. And that is to the advantage of executive government and not to this House or to this parliament.",103
306,Dr THEOPHANOUS,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I was speaking on this item when debate was interrupted for question time, so I was not able to make the points I wanted to make to the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss) in relation to the Australian Made 50 per cent labelling in this Trade Practices Amendment (Country of Origin Representations) Bill 1998. The member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) is absolutely correct: we have not had the opportunity to discuss tremendously important aspects of this bill. The minister should keep in mind that while the situation may be fair enough when it comes to manufactured products, when it comes to food products and when you take into account the costs of everything involved-including production, packaging and what have you-and it is 50 per cent of that total cost that is going to be involved, you could end up with what is basically a foreign food product actually passing the 50 per cent barrier and ending up being labelled Made in Australia. The minister knows that he should have consulted with the opposition and with other members, such as the member for Curtin, about the specifics of this matter. It is a very serious question. I give notice to you, Minister, that this matter will be examined by the Senate committee and by the Senate itself and, if necessary, we will move amendments to fix up this issue with respect to food.",104
307,Mr OKEEFE,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I make a couple of quick comments. I share the observations made by a number of members that it is ridiculous that a bill of this significance has found itself in the parliament now being compressed in this form. As the opposition's spokesman on matters related to primary industry, the farm sector, and the food sector, and as the member of parliament who initiated the Australian Made campaign in the first place in the mid-1980s, I point out that this whole issue has reached a point now where consumers must have a label they can trust. This Trade Practices Amendment (Country of Origin Representations) Bill 1998 does not solve the problem. The Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss) thinks it does, but it does not. The minister is going to find that no sooner is his legislation through than we will have any number of manufacturers out there using Made in Australia or Australian Made or something along those lines, and the pork producers, or the citrus producers, or the strawberry producers, or whoever, will be saying, 'Look, sure, Product of Australia covers this, but Australian Made does not. It is not our product; it is not our component in there, and yet it is being labelled all over the supermarkets as Australian made.' That is just one of the issues we have still got to thrash out. I give the minister notice-as the speaker before me, the member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), said-that there are so many loopholes in this legislation that it will finish up under intense scrutiny within the Senate, and we certainly reserve the right to tidy up the problems we can see. I reiterate the undertakings that I gave to the pork producers protest meeting in central Victoria last week. Labor will give passage to this bill, because we think it is an outrage that the government dumped the Australian Made campaign in 1996, and we think it is an outrage that it has taken them two years to come back with it now. We will give passage to this bill because it has to go through, but we reserve the right to make the changes we think are necessary in the Senate. Question put: That the item be agreed to.

For almost the 13 years that the coalition was in opposition it eschewed any form of retrospectivity which imposed a burden on a section or sections of the community. It seems to be, now that it has a golden opportunity to carry that forward into government, that we have the situation where people can be imposed upon tomorrow for doing something they did yesterday; in other words, they have not had any opportunity to modify their behaviour. The Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss) indicated in his summing up in the second reading debate that the defence of the government, in effect, is that retrospectivity has always been in this clause, that is, it has always been in the Trade Practices Act 1974; or indeed, if it has not always been in there, it has been in there for some time.

Motion (by Mr Ruddock) proposed: That the requested amendments be made.",107
311,Mr LATHAM,AUSTUDY,"Werriwa) (17.37 p.m.)The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance Consequential and Related Measures) Bill 1998 returns from the Senate with several valuable amendments and requests for amendments, most of which were initiated by the ALP. One of these removes the proposed at home rate for students aged 25 and over living at home. This rate would have meant a reduction in Austudy payments of up to $45 a week for a thousand students. The government's proposed changes would have meant a drop from the current maximum rate of $132 to $85 a week. Under these arAmendrangements, some recipients would not have been able to continue their studies. This raises the question of where parental responsibility ends under the Howard government. The opposition mounted a strong campaign on this issue, pointing out its obvious unfairness. Reducing levels of benefits for older students living at home unreasonably assumed a level of income support from parents to their offspring well into adulthood. This measure followed the inequitable action of the coalition in raising the independence age youth allowance; for Austudy from 22 to 25. This bill was supposed to be about administrative arrangements for older students receiving Austudy, but for the thousand or so students affected, it would have represented a most unjust arrangement-not just administrative but substantially unjust. The sum of $90 a fortnight is a great deal of money for people on low incomes struggling to complete their education. The opposition is pleased that the government accepted its amendments on this issue in the Senate. I must point out that the opposition was rather dismayed by the attitude taken to these measures by the Australian Democrats. Their first priority was to try to extend rent assistance for students older than 25 instead of defending an existing benefit paid to the students affected by this amendment. Indeed, it is a reflection of this boutique party's refer- approach on education measures that the Australian Democrats are continually making ambit claims and, in so doing, are not representing the best interests of students as tactics and measures arise in the Senate. Just last Saturday I listened in amazement as the Leader of the Australian Democrats Meg Lees, addressed a conference of government school organisations. She was talking about the record of the Democrats on educaand tion. As with this measure, what is their record? They have no record of funding schools. They have never funded a school Australia. They have never funded a college in Australia. They have never funded a university. Their only record is to make ambit claims and to use tactical measures the Senate to try to improve their political advantages. On education matters, this is boutique party which is trying to niche market alike. itself towards a certain part of the constituency. The claim of the Australian Democrats to care for Australian youth is not reflected the fact that they would abolish funding every non-government school around Ausissues tralia, thus taking public funding away from hundreds of thousands of young Australians trying to get the very best education. On this, as with many other tactical measures adopted by the Democrats in the Senate, the ALP rejects their position. We are pleased to support in the House a Senate amendment that was initiated by the ALP in the other place. We are pleased that the government has had the sense to adopt our position on this measure. All the same the opposition recommits itself to improving the youth allowance operations when in government. It is not fair and it is not going to be successful to drive 27,000 students back into our schools without adequate support. The government had a funding submission that showed that $140 million was needed make the new system work. Schools short-changed by $100 million, and that is a matter that the ALP will certainly be improvthe ing upon when we form a government after the next election. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA Motion (by Mr Ruddock) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Aboriginal Reconciliation",109
312,Mrs DRAPER,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to speak in support of the government's response to National Reconciliation Week in particular the approach of the PrimMinister (Mr Howard) to this issue. Our theme this year, as the Prime Minister outin lined earlier, is 'communities working TAFE together'. This is in keeping with the government's fundamental belief that the interests of indigenous people are best served in by moving forward together to solve today's problems and to create a bright future for all a Australians, indigenous and non-indigenous Some people in this place and elsewhere want to use this week as an occasion to apportion blame, to inflict gUilt upon this generation for the wrongs of the past, and to in encourage a victim mentality rather than a for positive problem solving approach to the that confront us. Contrary to some opinions, the Prime Minister has personally apologised and expressed his regrets on more than one occasion in this place and in public. I would like to take this opportunity in this place in National Reconciliation Week to express my sorrow and regret for the mistakes of the past. As the Prime Minister has pointed out, we need to acknowledge past wrongs and to resolve to address the problems that we are still facing, which is exactly what the Howard coalition government is doing. At the end of it- first four years in office this government wll1 have spent almost $700 million more in real terms on indigenous-specific programs than the previous government spent in its last four years. The bulk of this spending is in the areas of housing and infrastructure, health, to educati-n, employment and training, and are being econom1C development. In the area of indigenous health alone, as Prime Minister stated earlier we have increa.sed spending in real terms 'by 37 per - ent smce 1995-96. Included in this spending 1S a. raft of n-w init-atives, including programs to f1ght respuatory 1llnesses and immunisation against influenza. Work is also under way to respond to priority health issues such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Resources have been especially devoted to hearing and eye health. Diseases affecting health status in these areas are causes of significant morbidity, but also contribute to the relatively high level of disability within Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. I am delighted to say that we are also spending $63 million to address the recommendations of the Bringing them home report. The government has also maintained a strong commitment to the Abstudy and community development and employment programs. To address the difficulties faced by our indigenous communities, we have allocated funds in areas which will bring about significant long term improvements. I congratulate the Prime Minister for his stance in this area of policy, and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Senator Herron, and the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) for the many positive initiatives that this government has promoted and implemented. Sadly, true reconciliation will probably not come about in our immediate generation-and how can it? How can it when our indigenous people have a higher rate of incarceration per head of population and their health care and educational needs are not met, nor are they anywhere near the standard of the rest of the population. Perhaps here, as a government, we could take a leaf from the book of Fred Hollows and provide not just eye care but comprehensive health care to remote areas by mobile caravan. What could be more simple or more effective than having it staffed by our own indigenous nurses and doctors-by those who best understand their spiritual, cultural and health needs? As I said, reconciliation will not come about in this generation. Rather, it will come about when all our children have been taught that, to differentiate one person from another, you need only ask their name. For true reconciliation, it is my hope that in the future our children do not feel the need to differentiate people by their race, religion, age, gender or culture or whether they have disabilities-or, rather, special abilities. That hope, I believe, is well founded. During the last school holidays, my two young boys went on a camp with the YMCA of Adelaide and shared their cabin with two brothers-very special, funny guys-both of whom, I sadly noticed (with the emphasis on '1') had intellectual and physical disabilities. When I asked how the two guys with the disabilities coped, my sons answered that there were no kids with disabilities that they noticed and questioned my concerns. What did my sons notice? That these two boys had a great sense of humour and were the greatest at basketball swishing, and that these two guys with the supposed disability were the only ones on camp who knew the entire Crows Club song word for word. The only thing my sons noticed of any difference was that these guys were super cool dudes. (.J'ime expired) One Nation Party",110
313,Mr ALBANESE,ADJOURNMENT,"Grayndler) (5.46 p.m.)I rise tonight to congratulate and, indeed, endorse the statement made today by former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser. It is a statement of principle which highlights just how far to the right the Liberal and National parties have come since the previous Fraser government. I will cite a couple of quotes from Malcolm Fraser's letter. He says: The Liberal and the National Parties have done Australia a great disservice. It is nonsense to suggest that their preferences will not be counted and that therefore the order of preference does not matter. If that were so, they would clearly have placed One Nation last. He goes on to say: On one issue alone, One Nation stands condemned: its policies are anti-Asian, anti-Aboriginal and antiSemitic. Its policies are racist. This comes from someone who was a Prime Minister of this country for eight years. This comes from someone who, whatever differences I would have with him on economic policies and on other social policies, has integrity on the basis of race. You have to have integrity across the board or you do not have it at all. It is one thing when you are addressing a Lebanese community meeting or a Greek community meeting, such as the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) does regularly-and he works very hard and puts forward a view of support for multiculturalism. But it is another thing when you are out there, when you see a political advantage, to do a sleazy deal with One Nation over preferences in Queensland and foreshadowing sleazy deals at the federal level. Malcolm Fraser has great integrity saying this because he has been there and done that. We all remember-and, indeed, remember well-his stance against apartheid in South Africa. We well remember that the two leaders who refused to condemn apartheid and did not grace themselves in that debate against that disgraceful regime in South Africa were Margaret Thatcher and, of course, John Howard, in his previous incarnation as Leader of the Opposition, when he failed to take on the apartheid regime. In terms of Malcolm Fraser's comments, he makes it clear: Politicians in many things are pragmatic and indeed must be. That implies an element of compromise but there are basic beliefs, basic principles, which cannot be compromised. Opposition to racism is perhaps the most important of such principles. And he says: Placing One Nation before the Australian Labor Party implies a respectability to One Nation that party does not deserve. Frankly, parties which do have a racist agenda do need to be put last. I, along with all Party candidates across this nation, will certainly be putting One Nation last at coming federal election. It is not just an issue of conscience. One would have thought that those opposite have recognised that there is also an econombecause ic imperative because it embarrasses our international standing in the region and, indeed, in the world. I have travelled overseas as a representative of this parliament. When I went to South Africa and met with leaders difficult. of the now ANC controlled government there, one issue kept coming up. That issue was Pauline Hanson, One Nation and what Austhem tralia was doing about it. They want to know about it. When you travel in Asia and talk to the leaders there, they will ask, 'What is the phenomenon of this woman running this agenda and why is it that she hasn't been isolated by decent, fair-minded Australians?' The fact is that John Howard has form on this issue, on the issue of Asian immigration, on the issue of South Africa and on the issue of his failure to condemn Pauline Hanson's maiden speech and his failure to distance the government and all decent Australians from that agenda. People of goodwill should be demanding that the Liberal and National parties distance themselves from One Nation. Do not go down this opportunistic road because, at the end of it, we are all diminished as a nation by this opportunistic coalition in terms of preferences between the Liberal and National parties and One Nation. Malcolm Fraser has really highlighted, and done Australia a great service in highlighting today, the disgraceful actions of this Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and of the government parties in Queensland. (Time expired) Mount Erin Secondary College",111
314,Mr BILSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to celebrate good work, to celebrate and recognise the contribution of the Mount Erin Secondary College, many of its dedicated professionals and the band of very which committed people who work with the Operation Newstart program that is administered through Mount Erin Secondary College. A Labor few weeks back, I had the opportunity to attend the graduation ceremony for the fourth the intake of the program. These young people between 14 and 18 from the Frankston City area come to be involved with the Mount Erin would Secondary College's Operation Newstart they are having difficulty fitting in with the educational environment-there are some challenges that are before them as people and in their lives that make their full involvement in the educational curriculum Those young people are involved in a program that over a period of 10 weeks takes through issues that are in their lives. It helps them adjust to the educational environment and delivers to them new skills and new respect for themselves and for the opportunities that are afforded to them so they can make the best of those opportunities and make a go of their lives. The people who are involved with this program include the Police  tireless coordinator of the program; Jeff Halmaric, from the Victorian Police; and others within the region, both at an educationallevel and in the human services area. They are supported by people from industry, including Brian Goodman, from the Australian Chamber of Commerce, Troy Flanagan, from RMIT, plus a host of other dedicated people who are all making a go of this program. Of the seven young people who were involved in intake four, six were successful in that they were able to return to the school environment, get involved in a TAPE program, take up an apprenticeship or find a job. That is a 90 per cent success rate for people who are finding it hard because of the experiences they have had or the challenges that confront them. They are making a go of their lives. One of the great things the program seeks to do is to get people back on track. So while the coalition government is getting us financially back on track, Operation Newstart is helping young people in my community get back on track. They work through the development of personal skills. They gain qualifications. They build their confidence and selfesteem. They tackle some issues, such as substance abuse, that may be limiting their potential. I would like to celebrate, in particular, a young man who was involved in this program some time ago. He was that young gentleman who, on seeing a Vicroads worker having trouble breathing at the Flinders Street Railway Station, jumped in and applied the skills that he had learnt to save that man. That young man's name is Ben Dunmall. Ben is a young man who was involved in the program. He noticed that Victoria Met employee at the railway station, saw that he was having great difficulty and resuscitated him. That is a young man who has done something quite significant and made a profound impact on another person's life. Ben received a special lifesaving award from Ambulance of Victoria for his very particular contribution and for the application of the skills he provided. Operation Newstart and John Burrell, who is the chairperson of it and the principal of the secondary college, should be appreciated, encouraged and rewarded. I would also like to add that the Connections Program at the Monterey Secondary College seeks to achieve the same objectives, and I would be delighted to inform the House of those at a later point in time. Tourism",112
315,Mr MARTIN,ADJOURNMENT,"Cunningham) (5.55 p.m.}-I will be brief tonight in my comments about some tourism issues. I cannot believe that my tongue-in-cheek comments, as reported in the Illawarra Mercury, could get so many people in the government so excited. When I was talking about the opportunity to rev up Illawarra tourism in the adjournment debate earlier this week, the member for Macquarie (Mr Bartlett) and the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) scurried in here and proceeded to attack me. The simple fact of the matter is that anyone who knows anything about tourism could not be other than impressed by the fact that the Blue Mountains and the Hunter Valley do things extremely well. I have been to both locations in recent times. As a matter of fact, I was up in the Hunter Valley a week or so ago. Since I have been the shadow minister for tourism, that was probably the third or fourth time. I have been there. I was in the Port Stephens area, I was at Maitland, I was at Nelson Bay, and I met with people from the tourism industry there and talked about the great product that each of them has to sell. I was impressed by the way in which the Hunter Regional Tourism Organisation has gone about its particular way of doing things. The point that I was making, and which I am afraid was missed by those on the other side with less than a thorough understanding of tourism, was that in the Illawarra we have to do it better. My comments have received instant recognition. I am delighted to be able to tell the House that, in the year 2000, the ACTU congress is going to be held in W ollongong in the new sports entertainment centre, a centre that is being constructed at the present minute courtesy of a $17 million grant from the state government, for which we will be eternally grateful to Bob Carr. This follows hard on the heels of the news that 3,000 delegates will be coming for an International Lion's Club conference in Wollongong in the year 2001. It would seem that at long last people in Wollongong are getting their act together when it comes to tourism. We have so many attractions, both natural and man made. The point again that I would make-and I hope it is repeated in the Blue Mountains and in the Hunter Valley-is that we are going to compete against you. We are going to compete against you for those tourists who go for the beauty of the Blue Mountains and for the wine industry in the Hunter Valley, and I make no apology for that at all. We have the Illawarra, with Australia's industry world, with its hotels, with its beaches, with the indoor sports entertainment centre and with its great rugby league team. All of those are attractions which we will be promoting. I say to the rest of Australia that Wollongong and the Illawarra are coming after you in the tourism market. We recognise the value of tourism to Australia's economy. We also recognise the damage the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) and her One Nation Party are causing the tourism industry in broader Australia and we are not going to put up with it. Despite her best endeavours, we will be attempting to attract not only domestic but international tourists to the Illawarra. The Blue Mountains, in the federal seat of Macquarie, and the Hunter Valley, in the electorate of Paterson, should certainly be warned. In any case, I will conclude on this point. Bob Home is going to be here. He knows the true value of tourism-he showed me around the other day-as do the people in the Hunter Valley. He will be here more properly representing them after the next election. Fraser, Mrs u.: Death",113
316,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"I thank the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) for allowing me to say a couple of words before the House adjourns. It has just come to my notice that on Saturday, 16 May, a very distinguished Australian, the mother of former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser, died. Mrs Una Fraser was the mother of Laurie and Malcolm. She was an extraordinarily cultured, delightful and traditional lady who made, in her own right, a very significant contribution in a range of intellectual pursuits. As one who worked with Malcolm and knew Mrs Una Fraser best during those days when he was Prime Minister, I can assure all Australians that she had a remarkable impact not only on Malcolm but on us all. She was very much a lady of her generation. She was truly a wonderful reflection of the best of the 20th century.

(2) When does he expect each of the major oil companies to open their terminals for competitive access. Mr Costello-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I do not disclose the contents of correspondinvited ence. However, Caltex Australia Ltd (trading as both Caltex and Ampol) is publicly committed to open access of their seaboard terminals as soon as price deregulation is implemented. (2) BP Australia Limited have already publicly established an open access regime through its terminal gate pricing system. I cannot speak on behalf of the other oil majors although I note that all are committed to introduce a system of open access in the event of full deregulation of the industry. Government Purchasing (Question No. 2268) Mrs West asked the Minister for Finance and Administration, upon notice, on 24 September 1997: Further to my question without notice (Hansard, 17 June 1997, page 5362) concerning Government purchasing, has the Government introduced initiatives to maintain and increase the policy of 10% of Commonwealth purchases being made from small business; if so, what. Mr Fahey-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: On 8 August 1997 Commonwealth, State and Territory Procurement and Construction Ministers agreed to endorse the adoption of the 'National Action on Small to Medium Enterprises in Government Procurement' as an agreed strategy to imNA prove the access of SMEs to Government procurement opportunities, especially in regional Australia. The agreed national actions include measures that: reduce the cost of doing business for SMEs and for government; encourage greater participation by SMEs in the contract chain; promote the benefits to SMEs of the use of electronic commerce; and give greater consideration to the regional impact of government procurement decision making. The Department of Finance and Administration is progressing initiatives to advance the national actions. The former National Procurement Board also conducted seminars around Australia and SMEs to comment on aspects of Government procurement. The Government announced new streamlined and simplified Commonwealth purchasing arrangements in December 1997 to cut the cost of doing business with Federal Government departments and to provide greater opportunities for small business to participate in Government markets. The key initiatives included: maintenance of the Government's election commitment that Commonwealth departments and agencies source at least 10% of their purchases from small and medium enterprises (SMEs); inclusion of industry development requirements and opportunities for SMEs in tender documents for major projects valued at over $10 million; abolition of the commission imposed on businesses supplying to government under Common Use Arrangements with effect from December 1997; establishment of a pre-qualification scheme for businesses supplying in specific markets where the government is a major purchaser. The primary aim of the scheme is to reduce the cost for suppliers and buyers in doing business; establishment in March 1998 of a Purchasing Advisory and Complaints Service within the Department of Finance and Administration to assist suppliers (particularly SMEs) with problems they may experience with departmental purchasing processes. Long Term Operating Plan: Winds (Questiou No. 2615) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 2 March 1998: How many pilots have been directed to use long term operating landing patterns in cross winds over 15 knots since the (a) first and (b) second stages of implementation of the Long Term Operating Plan. Mr Vaile-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Airservices Australia advises that pilots are not directed to use particular runways. Airservices Australia nominates runways based on a number of criteria relating to wind/weather, airport efficiency and Government noise sharing objectives. Under these criteria runways are nominated with up to 25 knots of cross winds. It is the sole responsibility of the pilot to ensure that the runway nominated is suitable for the operation of the aircraft in the prevailing conditions. Long Term Operating Plan: Landing (Question No. 2616) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 2 March 1998: How many aircraft have been directed to use Long Term Operating Plan (LTOP) landing patterns in conditions oflow cloud since the (a) first and (b) second stages of implementation of the LTOP. Mr Vaile-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Airservices Australia advises that pilots are not directed to use particular runways. Airservices Australia nominates runways based on a number of criteria relating to wind/weather, airport efficiency and Government noise sharing objectives. It is the sole responsibility of the pilot to ensure that the runway nominated is suitable for the operation of the aircraft in the prevailing conditions. Consolidated records of cloud conditions during the nomination of a particular runway are not readily available. Long Term Operating Plan: Pilots (Question No. 2617) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 2 March 1998: (1) How many times have pilots refused Long Term Operating Plan (LTOP) based landing directions since the (a) first and (b) second stages of implementation of the LTOP. (2) What are the details of the circumstances in which the directions were refused. (3) What reasons were provided by pilots for using a non-LTOP landing pattern. Mr Vaile-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) Airservices Australia advises that details are not readily available of the number of times and the circumstances in which pilots have indicated that they have an operational requirement for other than the nominated arrival runway. (3) Airservices Australia advises that it does not ask pilots the reasons why they require other than the nominated runway. Standard Terminal Arrivals (Question No. 2618) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 2 March 1998: Pattern Has the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (BASI) identified standard terminal arrivals route related procedures which do not follow accepted world best practice: if so, (a) which procedures, (b) in what way do they fail to comply with world best practice and (c) what reasons has BASI discovered for world best practice not being achieved. Mr Vaile-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) The Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (BASI) published a report in January 1997 entitled An Analysis of Incidents Involving Aircrew Failing to Comply with Air Traffic Clearances June to August 1996. The analysis included a review of the development and design of standard arrival routes (STARs) in Australia and also identified a number of then current air traffic control (ATC) procedures relating to STARs which did not follow accepted worldwide practice. (b)and (c) BASI's analysis found that generally, worldwide practice is for ATC to issue a STAR that leads an aircraft to a position from which an instrument approach can be made. However, on the basis of STARs procedures in place during the survey period June to August 1996, this practice was not always the case in Australia. For example, STARs then currently in place at Melbourne generally positioned the aircraft to join an instrument approach, whereas at Sydney, Brisbane and Perth, STARs culminated with an expectation that the aircraft would be vectored by radar to join the final approach course. Furthermore, ATC could instruct aircraft to cancel and subsequently resume flying a STAR, a procedure which is not in accordance with accepted international practice. BASI's analysis also found that compared with accepted worldwide practice, many Australian STARs included lengthy transition legs which aircraft were required to fly from an airways route to join the STAR. mits report, BASI made a number of recommendations to Airservices Australia which addressed issues associated with aligning STARs procedures to accepted worldwide practice including the need to: minimise vectoring aircraft within the STAR environment minimise the practice of instructing resume a STAR after having been vectored off a STAR ensure that STARs at all locations are designed with consistent design principles ensure STAR designs are compatible with aircraft flight management systems (FMS) especially where STARs are not runway specific. Proposed Second Sydney Airport: Rail (Question No. 2630) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 2 March 1998: (1) Has his Department entered negotiations with the NSW Government to site a rail link between Glenfield and the proposed second Sydney Airport at Badgerys Creek; if so, at what stage are the negotiations. (2) Has it been proposed to acquire land owned by Hurlstone Agricultural High School in Glenfield to facilitate the process. Mr Vaile-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The suitability of the Badgerys Creek site for the development of a major airport is presently the subject of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) process. The Draft EIS discusses two alternative route options for providing rail access between Glenfield and Badgerys Creek. Investigations undertaken by the Commonwealth and the NSW Government some years ago have been taken into account in developing the rail route options. Responsibility for acquisition of land for the expansion of Sydney's metropolitan rail network rests with the NSW Government. There is no current action by the Commonwealth to fund the acquisition of any land for a possible rail corridor between Glenfield and the Badgerys Creek airport site. Any Commonwealth involvement in the provision of rail access to Badgerys Creek will be dependent on the outcome of the second Sydney airport EIS process. Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (Question No. 2700) Mr Melham asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 2 March 1998. Is he able to say which countries have (a) allowed appeals or (b) ceased to allow appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council since the answer to question No. 1927 (Hansard, 30 aircraft to March 1995, page 2679). Mr Williams-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The source of the following information is Whitaker's Almanac 1998. (a) The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council is primarily the final court of appeal for the United Kingdom dependent territories and those independent Commonwealth countries which have retained the avenue of appeal upon achieving independence as follows-Antigua and Barbuda, Link The Bahamas Barbados, Belize, Brunei, Dominica, The Gambia, Jamaica, Kiribati, Mauritius, New Zealand, St Christopher and Nevis, St Lucia, St Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad and Tobago, and Tuvalu. The Committee also hears appeals from the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. (b) Since the answer to the House of Representatives Question No. 1927, appeals to the Privy Council are no longer allowed from the following countries and territories Akrotiri, Bermuda, British Antarctica Territory, British Indian Ocean Territory, Cayman Islands, Dhekelia, Falkland Islands, Gibraltar, Guernsey, Hong Kong, Jersey, Monserrat, Pitcairn, St Helena, Turks and Caicos Islands and Virgin Islands. Jandakot Airport: Noise Study (Question No. 2703) Dr Lawrence asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 2 March 1998: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 953 (Hansard, 15 May 1997, page 3720), did the Federal Airports Corporation refer the report of the J andakot Airport noise study to his Department in early April 1997. (2) Have the findings of the report been released for public comment; if not, why not. (3) When will the final report be released. Mr Vaile-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) and (3) The final report of the Jandakot Airport Noise Study was released by the Federal Airports Corporation in January 1998. Essendon Airport: Touch and Go (Question No. 2730) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 10 March 1998: (1) Is it a fact that on 24 January 1998 between 6 p.m. and 6.10 p.m. an aircraft with call sign Oscar Victor Oscar Harvard made four touch and go circuits at Essendon Airport involving ten movements including the proper take-of and landing. (2) Is it also a fact that the pilot, in asking for clearance for landing at Point Cook, observed that he would upset the neighbours if he did more touch and goes at Essendon Airport. (3) Are the operations described on part (1) inappropriate for Essendon Airport; if so what action will he take to ensure that they are undertaken at Point Cook rather than Essendon. Mr Vaile-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (l) Airservices Australia advise that the aircraft in question operated as described except that the tenth movement was about one hour latcr when the aircraft returned from Point Cook. (2) Airservices Australia advises that it has no reports on this matter. (3) Circuits by single-engined aircraft are permitted at Essendon for the purpose of test flights and pilot endorsements. Airservices Australia advises that it's operational procedures do not give Air Traffic Controllers the authority to question the purpose of particular flights. Travel Allowance Payments (Question No. 2740) Mr CampbeH asked the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, upon notice, on 10 March 1998: Has Sir Ronald Wilson received payments for travel allowance from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission since he ceased to be Chairman of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission; if so, for what purposes.",170
363,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: No payments for travel allowance have been made from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission to Sir Ronald Wilson since he ceased to be Chairman of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.

(12) How many government employees have been replaced through labour provided by labourhire firms in each department, agency, Commonwealth authority and company, including government business enterprises, for which the Minister has portfolio responsibility. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Department of Primary Industries and Energy (DPIE) does not maintain records of this nature and I am not willing to allocate resources to undertake the research that would be required to comprehensively answer the above questions. However, the department has entered into a contract, at a corporate level, with Kowalski Consulting. The terms of the contract are for the supply of temporary Executive Assistants on an as needs basis. This contract commenced on 1 September 1997.

(2) Has his attention been drawn to a press release entitled ""Joe Hockey and Mode 6A"" issued by the Member for Wentworth on 3 March 1998; if so, are statements relating to the matter referred to in part (1) which are contained in the press release accurate. Mr Vaile-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Neither I nor my office have been involved in discussions on the fanning out of flight paths over the eastern suburbs. The possibility of fanning out of flight paths over the eastern suburbs was raised briefly, but not taken up, at the meeting of the Implementation and Monitoring Committee held on 20 January 1998. The introduction of mode 6A was discussed at the meetings of the Implementation and Monitoring Committee held on 20 January 1998, 17 February 1998 and 10 March 1998. A representative of the Department was present at these meetings. (2) I and Members of the Implementation and Monitoring Committee were aware of the proposed mode 6A on the date of the media release. M5Freeway (Question No. 2809) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 26 March 1998: Further to the answer to question No.37 (Hansard, 20 August 1996, page 3286) what is the (a) priority status of the proposed construction of on and off ramps south of Brooks Road on the M5 freeway at Ingleburn, NSW ; (b) progress of discussions between his Department and the NSW Roads and Traffic Authority regarding this matter and (c) expected commencement date for the project. phase is given a defined meaning, any other part of speech or other grammatical form in respect of that word or phrase has a corresponding meaning. Mr Vaile-The answer to the honourahle Paths member's question is as follows: (a) No decision has yet been made on the priority status of funding for construction of the F5 ramps. The Government is funding a $100,000 traffic study in 1997/98 to investigate the need for additional entry and exit ramps along the F5. The study, to be completed by mid-1998, is examining the need for ramps at the intersections of Raby Road, St Andrews Road, Campbelltown Road and Brooks Road in the Ingleburn and Minto area. (b) The Department of Transport and Regional Development has discussed the ,possible need for additional ramps with the NSW Roads and Traffic Authority (RTA) in the context of the National Highway forward program in NSW. These discussions have also raised the possible need to develop joint funding arrangements with NSW, relevant councils and private sector developers. (c) A commencement date and funding arrangements will be determined when the results of the current study are available. Industrial Psychology Consultants Pty Ltd (Question No. 2834) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 31 March 1998: Has his Department contracted a company called Industrial Psychology Consultants Pty Ltd to provide employment services; if so, (a) in what location will the services be provided, (b) what is the nature of the services to be provided, (c) whaf are the detailed reasons supporting the choice of the company, and (d) what business premises does the company operate from. Dr Kemp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Yes. (a) Services will be provided from eighteen locations within three of the Department's Labour Market Regions: South West Sydney , Western Sydney and North Sydney and Central Coast. (b) Industrial Psychology Consultants Pty Ltd have been contracted to provide Job Matching (FLEXl), Job Search Training (FLEX2) and Intensive Assistance (FLEX3). (c) The tender submitted by Industrial Psychology Consultants Pty Ltd was rated as suitable against published selection criteria and following financial viability checks (including historic financial and qualitative information plus their business plan as reflected by cash flows) to ensure the organisation was able to meet contractual obligations over the contract period. lnfonnation provided by organisations is Commercial in Confidence. The complex assessment process was monitored by independent lawyers, Blake Dawson Waldron Lawyers, to ensure procedural integrity. They are satisfied that the tender process has 'been conducted in accordance with the probity requirements set down in the tender documentation and that there was no systematic bias or lack of objectivity which advantaged or disadvantaged any particular bidder.' It is not possible to provide particular details of any organisation's bid or reasons for selection, as these details are Commercial in Confidence. (d) Industrial Psychology Consultants Pty Ltd are providing Job Network services from the following locations: Unit A, I st Floor, 44-50 Auburn Road, Auburn NSW 2144; Suite 10, 432 Chapel Road, Bankstown NSW 2200; Suite 106A, 30 Campbell Street, Blacktown NSW 2148; Office 29, 1 st Floor, 95-97 John Street, Cabramatta NSW 2166; Suite 2, 60B Evaline Street, Campsie NSW 2194; Unit II, 6-8 Old Castle High Road, Castle Hill NSW 2154; 93 Erina Street, Gosford NSW 2250; Shop 2, [07115 Pacific High way, Hornsby NSW 2077; Suite 3, 374-378 Forest Road, Hurstville NSW 2220; Suite 4, 49 Oxford Road, lngleburn NSW 2565; Suite 2, Levell, 224-238 George Street, Liverpool NSW 2170; Suite 2, Level2, lA O'Connell Street, Parramatta 2150; 2B, 21 Lawson Street, Penrith NSW 2750; 8 [ Railway Street, Rockdale NSW 2216; 5 Church Street, Ryde NSW 2112; 31178- [86 Queen Street, St Marys NSW 2760; 13A Eton Street, Sutherland NSW 2232; 88 Pacific Highway, Wyong NSW 2259. Australian and United States Defence Forces: Exercises (Question No. 2864) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 6 April 1998: What were or are the (a) name of, (b) dates of (i) commencement and (ii) conclusion of, (c) Australian units involved in, (d) US units involved in, (e) cost to the Australian Defence Force of, and (0 nature of, each exercise which the ADF has undertaken or will undertake with US forces in (A) 1994, (B) 1995, (C) 1996, (D) 1997, (E) 1998, (F) 1999 and (G) 2000. Mr MCLachlan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The information required is available in various Defence Department databases but presenting the information requested by the honourable member poses the following problems: (a) the raw database printout of the exercises, without the costing information, is over 160 pages and it would take considerable time and effort to extract the information sought; (b) some of the information on exercises is classified; and (c) some of the costing information is not readily available. My Office can arrange a briefing for the honourable member should he require further details. Aboriginal Organisations: Supply of Motor Vehicles (Question No. 2871) Mr Hicks asked the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, upon notice, on 7 April 1998: What sum has been spent with each vehicle manufacturer in supplying vehicles to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission and other Commonwealth funded Aboriginal organisations in each year since 1993.",174
364,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,TION,"The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Nil. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission does not deal with vehicle manufacturers, however it sources its vehicles through DASFLEET. Aboriginal organisations can be funded for the purchase of motor vehicles to assist in the completion of their funded activities. Where motor vehicles are purchased it is the client who decides what type of vehicle most addresses their need. It is not feasible to compile a definitive response, even to the extent that it would be possible, due to the level of resources it would require. NA Aboriginal Hostels Limited The Aboriginal Hostels Limited has not directly paid a sum of money to any vehicle manufacturer for the supply of vehicles, in each year since 1993. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation does not purchase vehicles. The small number of vehicles utilised by the ATSICDC is obtained through DASFLEET and ownership of the vehicles rests with that organisation. Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders Studies AIATSIS has a policy of owning rather than leasing vehicles. The following prices are the amount spent (as asked for) ie purchase price after trade-in. 1993 Mitsubishi $12,464; 1994 ditto $7447; 1995 ditto nil Ford $11,189; 1996 ditto $10,999; 1997 ditto nil Ford $9,255. Torres Strait Regional Authority The Torres Strait Regional Authority was created on July 1 1994. All TSRA administration vehicles are leased through DASFLEET. Our record system does not allow us to identify individual lease payments only a combined monthly lease payment is made for all cars. Combined lease payments for administration vehicles are as follows: 1994/95$13,886; 1995/96-$22,482; 1996/97-$20,292; 1997/98-$23,858 (July to April). The following make of vehicles are currently leased from DASFLEET: Toyota Camry, Nissan Navara, Toyota Spacia, Ford Futura. The following are vehicles that have been previously leased from DASFLEET: Toyota Tarago, Toyota Camry, Toyota Ute, Toyota Tarago. Organisations and Councils funded through TSRA programs may purchase vehicles if they are required for the effective running of that organisation. Each Council/Organisation decides which vehicle most suits the need of their organisation. As Vehicle 1 Toyota Land Cruiser station wagon 1 Toyota Hilux utility 1 Toyota Landcruiser Trayback 3 Suzuki Ag Bikes 3 Suzuki 4 wheel motorcycles Similarly, Cardabia Pastoral Company Pty Ltd of the ILC, purchased the following vehicles. Vehicle 2 Suzuki DF200 Trojan motorcycles 1 Toyota Land Cruiser troop carrier Monies spent on the acquisition of vehicles in these two cases are effectively loans by the ILC, which will be repaid over time through income generated by businesses operating on the properties. More generally, the ILC has purchased a number of pastoral properties on a ""walk-in, walk-out"" basis. Several of those purchases have involved the the TSRA is not involved in the daily administration of these Councils/Organisations the TSRA is not involved in the decision as to what type of vehicles to purchase. However, as per the TSRA grant conditions before the purchase of any vehicle any Council/Organisation must obtain three quotes to ensure value for money is obtained. The majority of vehicles purchased by island councils from Commonwealth funds are in order to operate the Community Development Employment Programs. Indigenous Land Corporation The Indigenous Land Corporation (ILC) has not purchased any motor vehicles for use by ILC staff since its establishment on 1 June 1995. The ILC's current in-house motor vehicle requirements are met through the term leasing of four (4) Holden and two (2) Mitsubishi motor cars from DASFLEET in Adelaide, Perth and Brisbane and one (I) Holden motor car from City Holden in Adelaide. Mogila Merino Stud Pty Ltd (ACN 078 466 761), a wholly owned subsidiary of the ILC, purchased several new and second hand motor vehicles for on-farm use at Mogila Station, NSW. The cost of purchase of these vehicles has been partially offset by a recent clearance sale of surplus vehicles, plant and machinery acquired as part of the initial ""walk-in, walk-out"" purchase of the property. The decision by the company to do so was a commercial one based on its continued successful trading position. New Cost No $39,800 Yes $26,500 Yes $38,170 Yes $8,970 Yes $21,750 (ACN 080 766 463), also a wholly owned subsidiary New Cost Yes $7,600 No $15,990 acquisition of motor vehicles and mobile plant from the vendors of the properties as part of the sale. In some cases, reinstatement insurance values were attributed to particular items, although those values are not necessarily reflective either of the replacement cost neither of the items or of their current resale value. Brisbane Airport: Proposed Flight Paths (Question No. 2890) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 8 April 1998: (1) Do proposed flight paths exist in conjunction with the draft Brisbane Airport master plan released in March 1998: if so, (a) why were they not released with the draft master plan and (b) will he ensure they are released immediately. (2) What action will be taken to ensure that the effects of noise generated by increased air traffic over Brisbane and the number of residents affected are minimised. Mr Vaile-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The master plan process exposes the community to the airport owner's vision for the possible future development of the airport. It does provide approval, or imply that approval will be given, for any major projects such as new runways. Master plans have previously been released for Brisbane Airport in 1983, 1991 and 1995. None of these previous master plans have included flight paths for the proposed parallel runway. (a) The timing of the release of flight paths is primarily a matter for the airport owner. (b) Flight paths will be an important part of the environmental impact statement that will be required as part of any Major Development Plan such as a new runway, if that development were to be proposed in several years time. The Airports Act process does not allow a runway to be constructed until flight paths and all other environmental impacts are fully known to the community through an environmental impact statement process. (2) Brisbane Airport Corporation Limited (BACL) has provided information to the community which gives its commitment to minimising noise impacts on the community wherever and whenever practicable, in consultation with other stakeholders. The Corporation indicates that managing aircraft impacts to acceptable levels is a matter for the airlines, Airservices Australia, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, the Corporation itself, and land use planning authorities such as Brisbane City Council and State government agencies. Importantnot ly, under the Airports Act 1996, any Major Development Plan for constructing a new runway or extending the length of a runway is required to set out the airport owner's plans for managing aircraft noise intrusion, developed in consultations with the airlines, local government bodies in the vicinity of the airport, and the local community.",185
