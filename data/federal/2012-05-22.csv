1,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Ms AE Burke) took the chair at 14:00, made an acknowledgement of country and read prayers. NA  Opposition Business) (14:01): Deputy Speaker, I intend to raise a matter of privilege. I understand that under the current arrangements I present the matter of privilege to you and you will then convey it to the Speaker and then he will deliberate on it and you will convey his decision back to the House. In the form of a letter to the Speaker, I write to you under the provision of the House of Representatives standing order 51 to raise a matter of privilege in relation to member for Dobell, who, I believe, has deliberately misled the House on 21 May 2012 and request that the Speaker grant precedence to allow a motion to refer the matter to the Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests for inquiry and report back to the House. The standing orders provide that where a breach of privilege has been committed, the Speaker may grant precedence to a privilege matter and allow a referral to the Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests in circumstances where a prima facie case exists and where the matter has been raised at the earliest opportunity. My complaint concerns the statement to the House by the member for Dobell on 21 May 2012, which for the following reasons was intended to mislead the House. (1) The member's version of events given to the parliament is an outright contradiction of the findings of the report of 28 March 2012 of Fair Work Australia's investigation of the national office of the Health Services Union under section 331 of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009, based upon its analysis of the same assertions which the member made to it and which it found not to be credible. (2) The member's key claim is that he was set up by enemies within the Health Services Union. The only piece of evidence to which he points is the alleged threat by another union official, Mr of Marco Bolano, that he would 'ruin his Madam political career by setting him up with hookers'. He did not specify when this threat was made or the context. On the basis of this single threat the House was asked to conclude: (a) that this threat was given effect to by an unspecified number of unnamed people; (b) that in order to give effect to the threat these people (i) hacked into the member's mobile phone on numerous occasions in such a manner as to conceal the fact that the phone had been hacked and to the mask that in the billing of the phone calls to various Sydney brothels; (ii) took the member's driver's licence and subsequently returned it without his knowledge; (iii) impersonated the member at the Sydney brothels, where it is established that",17
2,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat.,17
3,Mr Albanese,PRIVILEGE,"I rise on a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. The Manager of Opposition Business did inform me that he was going to do this as a courtesy. I indicated that the government would facilitate it, but perhaps it is appropriate, given that this matter will be considered, that the Manager of Opposition Business reach his conclusion.",17
4,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"In accordance with the standing orders, the Manager of Opposition Business has the right to present the matter for privilege that will be referred to the Speaker.  the member at the Sydney brothels where it is established that photo ID was required before the services of prostitutes could be purchased with credit cards; and (iv) ordered outcall services to be provided in hotel rooms on non-brothel private premises from escort services on a number of different occasions from a number of different hotel rooms. (3) As to the claim against Mr Bolano: (a) in a statement released on 21 May, Mr Bolano emphatically denied the member's assertions; and (b) although the member said that Mr Bolano's threat was made in the presence of others at the HSU offices, he has been able to point to nobody who corroborates his claim that the threat was made. (4) That the member's attempts to explain away each of these matters are implausible and inconsistent. Dealing with each of the matters in paragraph (2)(b)(i) the member produced no evidence whatsoever that his phone had in fact been hacked. He merely says that it was theoretically possible for that to happen. He does not dispute that the phone calls in question were in fact billed to his mobile phone number. He claims that the phone calls were made some years before he was elected a member of parliament.",17
5,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"Order! While I will give leave to do this, I would remind the Manager of Opposition Business, just as I reminded the Leader of the House yesterday, that you need to get to the point, as this will be referred to the Speaker for consideration.  simply deal with matters on a factual basis and not make any political assertions",18
6,Unknown,PRIVILEGE,"Government members interjecting calls were made some years before he was elected a member of parliament. In fact, the phone calls to Keywed Pty Ltd",18
7,Unknown,PRIVILEGE,Honourable members interjecting,18
8,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,Order! This is a very serious matter and I think the parliament should pay it due regard.  made to Keywed Pty Ltd on 9 April 2005 and 16 August 2007.,18
9,Mr Albanese,PRIVILEGE,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. This is going to assertions and argument. This is not a kangaroo court; this is the House of Representatives of the parliament. The member has an opportunity to present this and he should wind up his remarks, as I did yesterday, and then we can go on with question time and the business of the parliament.",18
10,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"The Manager of Opposition Business has the call, but I would ask him to come to a conclusion on this matter.  outlined so far is a simple statement of fact. I am being very careful not to cast political aspersions but to simply to state matters of fact. A government member: Stick to the facts then!  member for Dobell claims that although the phone calls were made from Bateau Bay he did not live there until 2009. However, Bateau Bay is in Dobell, where he was the member since 2007 and where he had a presence as an endorsed candidate and preselection aspirant for years before. As to (2): he seeks to explain the endorsement of his drivers licence on the back of credit card receipts by the fact that his licence number was well known within the office. Even if that were true, it does not explain why the production of the licence was not required at the time the licence number was endorsed on the receipt. He says that the details of his drivers licence were kept on file by the HSU because they were needed for use on right-of-entry permits. However, right-of-entry permits do not require endorsement of drivers license details. As to (3): he simply did not address the evidence that the brothels paid for by the credit cards required the production of photo ID. He did not address the fact that the credit card receipts are signed in a hand which appears to be identical to his own signature, as verified by the forensic document examiner, Dr Paul Westwood, in his report of 22 August 2011 supplied to New South Wales police with a letter from Senator Brandis of that date. As to (4): his only explanation for the outcalls was that blocks of rooms were booked in his own name. If this were true his story only stacks up if every single instance of an outcall was from rooms booked to block in his name. There are only two such instances of block bookings recorded in the FWA report. One was with the Marriott hotel, Sydney for the national conference on 7 September 2006, and one to University House, Canberra on 28 August 2007.",18
11,Mr Albanese,PRIVILEGE,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. While I am reluctant to intervene again because the Manager of Opposition Business is, in fact, presenting a very good case of why privileges cannot consider this sort of detail, the Manager of Opposition Business should come to the point as you have asked him to do-as you did yesterday and I complied with.  on the point of order. The Leader of the House refers to the matter he raised yesterday. As you correctly pointed out yesterday, in fact it was quite unnecessary for the Leader of the House to raise that matter in parliament in the way that he did. He simply could have written to the chairman of the Privileges Committee. In this case, this is not a complaint about a breach of the register of members' interests and therefore this is the only way in which it can be raised.",19
12,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"The Manager of Opposition Business has the call, and will be heard in silence. But with four pages of tightly typed notes he is probably pressing the House's indulgence at the start of question time.  report gives no credence to this theory. (5): As to the allegations generally, he claims he has challenged the Victoria Police and the FWA to obtain CCTV footage from the brothels in question. This would be of no assistance, given that the majority of transactions appear to have been for outcall services. (6): The member's statement is riddled with half-truths. For instance, he stated that the New South Wales police concluded, after considering Senator Brandis's letter, that no offence under New South Wales law had been committed.",19
13,Mr Albanese,PRIVILEGE,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. That is a judgment made by the Manager of Opposition Business. I put it to you that he is not in a position to make that judgment either for or against.",19
14,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"The Manager of Opposition Business is raising a matter of privilege and I would ask that he continues to raise a matter of privilege.  Speaker. The point that I am making is that therefore the statements made by the member for Dobell were misleading, and that is why it is a matter of privilege. The Leader of the House should have heard what I was going on to say: the member for Dobell omitted to say that the New South Wales police also said that they were transferring the file for assessment by the Victorian police and that the Victorian police themselves subsequently announced a full investigation, which is ongoing. He also omitted to say that the New South Wales police then subsequently announced their own investigation-Strike Force Carnarvon-which is ongoing. He also stated that the Fair Work Australia findings as to electoral expenditure have been debunked, when in fact the AEC made findings as to whether specific payments were under the reporting threshold or had been disclosed-not whether they had been properly authorised by the union. (7): The claims and the explanations which the member made in his statement are either inconsistent with or were not raised by him when he was interviewed by Michael Smith on 1 August 2011. If the explanations he offered the House and to Laurie Oakes are true why did he not mention them almost a year ago? His new explanation has all the hallmarks of recent invention. Further, if all this explanatory material exists why has the member refused to cooperate with New South Wales and Victoria police?",19
15,Unknown,PRIVILEGE,"Government members interjecting conclusion, Madam Deputy Speaker. The member's statement concentrated almost entirely on the brothel and escort service allegations",20
16,Mr Albanese,PRIVILEGE,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. In the Manager of Opposition Business's previous paragraph he was talking about questions to be raised. Through you, he is putting those on the record. It is entirely inappropriate. This is an abuse of the process.",20
17,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"The Manager of Opposition Business is raising a matter of privilege. I would ask him to return to the issue.  privilege, and I am outlining to the House the case that I think the Speaker needs to rule on.",20
18,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"The Manager of Opposition Business should conclude, please.  explanation to the purchase of luxury goods for himself or the use of several hundred thousand dollars of union money for his election campaign. In fact, he states that the FWA failed to give credence to the fact that cash expenditure was properly documented and accounted for. This is entirely at odds with FWA findings 26 to 28 on page 289 and the extensive evidence cited for those findings. In summary, the member's version of events (a) is not supported by the evidence of a single witness (b) is explicitly contradicted by one person, Mr Bolano, whom he named (c) is not supported by a single piece of documentary",20
19,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"The Manager of Opposition Business has made his case for privileges to be referred to the Speaker. He will conclude now and I will call on questions.  Speaker. In doing so I present the annexures to my case: the Fair Work Australia report, the Marco Bolano media release, the interview with Michael Smith, the television interview with Laurie Oakes and the opinion piece published today in the Australian.",20
20,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE, documents and issues will be referred to the Speaker.,21
21,Mr Albanese,PRIVILEGE,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I do not think it can be let go that the Manager of Opposition Business just spoke about the member for Dobell not having called witnesses. That is the point. This is not a court. This is not somewhere where witnesses are called and come forward and a case is presented. That is the entire point.",21
22,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,The Leader of the House will resume his seat. The matter has concluded. NA Carbon Pricing,21
23,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. I remind him of over 2,000 jobs lost at BlueScope, OneSteel and Qantas, companies that face a combined carbon tax bill of over $400 million a year and rising. Will the Acting Prime Minister guarantee that not a single job has been lost or will be lost through the introduction of the world's biggest carbon tax, a bad tax based on a lie?",21
24,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, The last part of the question was out of order. The Acting Prime Minister has the call.,21
25,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," What I can say is this: after the introduction of a carbon price, our economy will continue to grow, and grow strongly. We will continue to generate income. We will grow strongly. If you look at where we have been in the last few years and where we can go, we have been in a position where we have been growing unlike any other developed economy. In the next two years we are going to outperform every other major developed The economy, and everyone on this side of the House is proud of our job creation record. Over 800,000 jobs have been created in this country-in the past year something like 90,000 jobs. On the Thursday after the budget, we had the Bureau of Statistics figures, which showed that unemployment in Australia was at 4.9 per cent. That is something we are proud of as well. But we also understand that our economy does face great structural changes and that there are people who do unfortunately lose their jobs. We should give them our full support. Those workers that have lost their jobs at Qantas should receive the full support of Qantas and should receive their entitlement to whatever benefits and support can come from the government, and we will do our utmost to help each and every one of them. But for those on that side of the House to maintain that these job losses are somehow the result of the introduction of a carbon price shows how dishonest those opposite are-completely dishonest with their scare campaign. They have no shame, because this is the crew that would not stand up for the Australian workforce at the height of the global financial crisis, when they came into this House and the Leader of the Opposition slept through the critical vote to save Australia, to save Australian small businesses and to support our employment. The Liberal Party were missing in action. This government provides an enormous amount of support to ensure that our economy continues to grow. We are investing in the productive side of our economy. We are doing everything we possibly can to set our economy up for the future. Putting in place carbon pricing reform is just as important a reform as bringing down the tariff wall, the introduction of national superannuation and the introduction of enterprise bargaining. We are doing this because we are all about jobs. Jobs are the No. 1 priority of every member on this side of the House, and they will continue to be our priority. We will not shirk the hard decisions. We will support the Australian workforce every day of the week. Afghanistan",21
26,Mr DANBY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. What role will Australia play in Afghanistan's long-term development?,22
27,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Melbourne Ports for that very important question, because the stability and security of Afghanistan is firmly in the interests of our region and our country. As the Prime Minister has said, we are on track to complete the transition in Afghanistan by the end of 2014. After the transition, Afghanistan will have responsibility for its own security. Of course, the nature of Australia's engagement in Afghanistan will change, but our commitment to development and stability in Afghanistan will remain. That is why the Prime Minister has worked directly with world leaders-the US President and others-to make sure that we get in place a plan for the future. the Prime Minister has also met with the Afghan President and signed a new partnership agreement between our two nations. This is a very clear demonstration of Australia's long-term commitment to supporting Afghanistan's security, development and governance following transition. Of course, we are committed to lifting living standards in one of the poorest countries in the world, and we will also be in full support of efforts to combat transnational threats such as terrorism and narcotics. There will also be greater commercial engagement between our two countries. This partnership will be backed up with a commitment to see our aid increase substantially between now and 2015-16. There will be a commitment to increase our aid from $165 million a year to $250 million a year. As we are already doing, we will be building more schools, more infrastructure and more health and education services. This new partnership will provide the assistance that Afghanistan requires for its future development, and it certainly does build on the very substantial foreign aid that we are providing right across our region and across the globe. Our aid budget is a reflection of our commitment to assist with the development of the world's poorest nations, and with this new agreement we will continue to do that. NA",22
28,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS," I would like to point out to the House that today we have an experiment going on: an Auslan translator is in the galleries. She will have to be at the height of her skills and ability to translate everything that is happening in the chamber today! She is with representatives from the Ballarat leadership group, and I hope they enjoy their That is why visit to question time today. Honourable members: Hear, hear! NA Carbon Pricing Mrs GRIGGS (Solomon) (14:21): My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. I refer the Acting Prime Minister to the letters sent by the Clean Energy Regulator to 104 councils across Australia regarding their liability to pay the carbon tax. I ask the Acting Prime Minister: will the Darwin City Council have a direct carbon tax liability as one of Australia's so-called biggest polluters?",22
29,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, I thank the member for her question. It follows up a question which I think we had yesterday which was factually incorrect.,23
30,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,23
31,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It certainly was-the assertion about the council in Queensland was just wrong. But I will go through the issue. The majority of landfills and the majority of councils in Australia will have no liability under the carbon price. The landfills have to be big enough to be liable. Many of them will never have to pay for emissions for waste deposited before 1 July 2012 and there will be no liability for the whole of 2012-13. The government and the regulator will engage directly with the councils to talk about these matters and to make the assessment as to whether they are liable or not.,23
32,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Madam Deputy Speaker, I ask a supplementary question. My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. Given that it is just 40 days till the introduction of the world's biggest carbon tax, is the Acting Prime Minister confirming that there are 104 councils around our country, including Darwin City Council, that do not know whether they will be liable for this tax or how much? What a disgrace!",23
33,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, The Leader of the Opposition will withdraw.,23
34,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I withdraw.,23
35,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It is an abuse of question time to add that to the end of any question.,23
36,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," It is not the issue that the Leader of the Opposition claims because there will be no liability in 2012-13. Budget Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (14:24): My question is to the Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation. Minister, how is the government supporting Australian families and businesses through sensible tax reform to spread the benefits of the mining boom?",23
37,Mr BRADBURY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Lindsay-Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (14:24): I thank the member for Petrie for her question. I know she is a tireless advocate for the people of north Brisbane in her electorate of Petrie. This government understands the pressures that the patchwork economy is placing on Australian families and small businesses, and that is why we are determined to manage the economy to spread the benefits of the mining boom and to ensure that we keep our economy strong. And it is a strong economy; it is an economy that has been growing strongly. It is now seven per cent larger than it was before the global financial crisis hit. We have low unemployment, at 4.9 per cent, and contained inflation. We have a record pipeline of investment coming into this country and our public finances are amongst the strongest in the world. A AAA credit rating from all three major ratings agencies is something that was achieved under this government for the first time in our nation's history. Not only are we determined to spread the benefits of the mining boom and manage the economy in the interests of working people but we are determined to do it whilst also cutting taxes. And we have been cutting taxes. Since we came to office we have delivered $47 billion worth of personal income tax cuts. And now we are delivering a new wave of tax reforms. We are tripling the tax-free threshold from 1 July, and that will mean one million Australians will not even have to lodge a tax return. We are delivering tax cuts to over seven million Australian workers. Over six million of them will receive $300 a year in a tax cut. This is real tax reform impacting on real people. At the same time, we are delivering tax reform for small businesses. On the one hand we have introduced our instant asset writeoff. We have also introduced measures that will be coming into effect shortly that will allow for the carry-back of losses. These are measures that underpin our approach to cutting taxes. But the best evidence that this is a low-tax government is our tax to GDP ratio. It is at 22.1 per cent in the coming year. How does that compare with previous governments? When the government left office it was at 23.7 per cent. In fact, it hit a record high of 24.25 cent back when they were in government. If we were taxing at those levels today, we would be bringing in an extra $33 billion in tax every year. We are a low-taxing government and they were a high-taxing government. And then we heard last week from the shadow Treasurer that he wants to scrap the tax cuts that we are about to introduce. He wants to scrap them, he wants to claw them back. The Australian people know that we support families and businesses. The opposition want to hike up taxes- (Time expired) Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (14:27): Madam Deputy Speaker, I ask a supplementary question. The minister has gone through what the government is doing to help people across the country. Minister, what does this mean for local communities like mine in Brisbane?",23
38,Mr BRADBURY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Lindsay-Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (14:28): I thank the member for Petrie. I know that she is interested in all of those people in her electorate who are benefiting from our government's efforts to cut taxes. When she comes into this place she has the 49,000 people in her electorate in mind-the people who will benefit from a tripling of the tax-free threshold. I know that she has got in mind the 3,000 people in her electorate who will not even have to put a tax return in and she is thinking about the 43,000 people in her electorate who will get a tax cut of more than $300 from 1 July. I know that she is also a very strong advocate of small business in her electorate. There are 12,300 small businesses in the electorate of Petrie that will be lining up on 1 July to take advantage of the instant asset write-off, where they will get an instant deduction on previous assets worth up to $6½ thousand. I know the member for Petrie is not the per only member representing the Brisbane area-it is the north Brisbane area, in her case-and interested in standing up for small businesses. Or, at least, so they sometimes say. I saw a quote that stated that small business is the nucleus of the Australian economy as the single greatest generator of jobs and opportunities in our economy, and that we must reward them and we must not punish them. That is what the member for Brisbane had to say. It is a shame she came into this place and voted against tax relief for the 33,000 small businesses in her electorate. (Time expired) Economy",24
39,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Acting Prime Minister and Treasurer. Will the Treasurer confirm that the government expects to pay $29 billion in interest alone on the government's borrowings over the next four years? Can the Treasurer advise the House how much of the $29 billion in interest is just interest on interest on existing Labor government debt?,24
40,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the shadow Treasurer for that question because it is a very important question. It is true that the government has a modest borrowing program. Those opposite have decided to go around the country and run a scare campaign about that as well. The truth of the matter is we do have a modest borrowing program and net debt is 9.6 per cent of GDP in 2011-12. Let us get things into perspective because that is about one-tenth of debt elsewhere across other major developed economies, so very modest. This is why the major rating agencies have given us our AAA gold plated rating. Our credit worthiness is very high. It is the highest rating they can give. This country, led by this government, has been given that by the rating agencies for the first time history. It certainly was not given to this country when those opposite were in government. Net debt at about 9.6 per cent of GDP is like someone earning $100,000 a year and owing a modest $9,600 a year. Net interest payments in 2012-13 will be 0.5 per cent of GDP and that is like someone earning $100,000 a year and paying only $500 in interest. This just puts our debt into perspective. What we have here is an irresponsible scare campaign",25
41,Mr Hockey,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order of relevance. It was a simple question. How much interest on interest is going to be paid over the next four years? It was a factual question.",25
42,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for North Sydney will resume his seat. The Treasurer and Acting Prime Minister is answering the question and has the call.,25
43,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I certainly am answering the question. If he wants to go into the ins and outs of every figure, he can read it in the budget papers. Indigenous Employment",25
44,Mr WINDSOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Indigenous Employment and Economic Development and relates to the Australian Employment Covenant signed in 2008. Given the successful Indigenous employment retention rates achieved by the program, could the minister update the House on the government's position on progressing the training for actual jobs methodology under the covenant and on the vocational training and employment centre proposal espoused by Mr Andrew Forrest?",25
45,Ms COLLINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Franklin-Minister for Community Services, Minister for the Status of Women and Minister for Indigenous Employment and Economic Development) (14:33): I thank the member for New in our England for his question. I know he has shown an interest in Indigenous employment for quite some time now and I know that he, like the government, is very committed to closing the gap on Indigenous employment, and I value his interest in this very important subject. The government signed the Australian Employment Covenant in 2008. Since 2009, through the Indigenous Employment Program, there have been more than 83,000 placements of Indigenous Australians into jobs or training. Of that 83,000, more than 38,000 of those placements have been into actual jobs. We are very committed to our target of closing the gap. When it comes to the 61,000 job commitments from the Australian Employment Covenant, the Australian government has supported the Australian Employment Covenant with more than $7 million so far for their Indigenous Employment Program. We have been working with the Australian Employment Covenant to ensure that when these jobs come online that we actually have Indigenous Australians trained and ready to take them up. It is important to remember that not all of the jobs come online straight away. They are forward commitments of large companies across Australia. In fact, we already have more than 73 covenant employers for which we are providing direct support today of more than $132 million. These job placements currently are with companies such as Coles, Woolworths, some of the big banks, Accor Hotels and Linfox. I am in regular contact with the Australian Employment Covenant and I have also met several times with GenerationOne in relation to Indigenous employment. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate those employers that are taking their commitments very seriously indeed. I visited the Pilbara last week. I visited the Fortescue Metals VTEC model. I also went and visited Rio Tinto, Woodside, Ngarda Civil and Mining to look at some of their Indigenous employment programs. The VTEC model is just one of those. I understand the commitment of Mr Forrest and of the other companies when it comes to Indigenous employment. What I have said is that we want to do an evaluation of the Indigenous employment programs such as VTEC before we commit any further funding. That evaluation will look at real outcomes for Indigenous Australians and it will also look at value for money for taxpayers for these programs. The Indigenous Employment Program is funded for $650 million over four years and we are very committed to ensuring that we have Indigenous Australians in jobs and that we continue to close the gap on Indigenous employment.

46,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS," I would like to acknowledge in the gallery today the former member for Macarthur, Pat Farmer, who has just completed a short stroll from the North Pole to the South Pole, some 20,990 kilometres. I have been reliably informed that is two marathons a day, every day with no days off; congratulations. Sitting through this, he probably wants to run away from question time too. Honourable members: Hear, hear! NA Economy",26
47,Ms SMYTH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Acting Prime Minister and Treasurer. What is the government doing to spread the benefits of the mining boom to help families and working people to make ends meet?,26
48,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for La Trobe for that very important question, because our economy does walk tall in the world. We have solid growth, we have low unemployment, we have contained inflation, we have rock-solid public finances and of course we have a huge investment pipeline. One of the reasons we are in such a strong position is what this government did at the height of the global financial crisis and the global recession to support employment in this country. We got the best outcomes of any developed economy in the world. Of course, those opposite, if they would have had their way, would have seen Australia go into recession, deficits and debt would have been higher, unemployment would have been higher and business closures would have been higher. But our economy is fundamentally stronger because of what we did at the height of the global financial crisis and the global recession. Now we do expect to return to trend growth and, given the investment pipeline, we are in a position to spread the opportunities from this growth right around our country, to make sure that these opportunities go to every postcode, to make sure that these opportunities do not just go to those that are in the fast lane of the resources boom. Plenty of people out there are sitting around and saying: 'Where is this boom? Are we part of it or not?' So the important thing that we have put in place in this budget is a plan to spread the benefits of a strong economy right around our country. Of course, that is why we are delivering tax cuts to something like seven million lowand middle-income-earning Australians. This will take something like one million Australians out of the tax system. These proposals would be ripped away by those opposite if they had their way. These very big tax reforms for people who are on some of the lowest incomes in our community would be ripped away. It is also why the budget delivers $5 billion over five years in additional support for lowand middle-income households to help with the cost of living. Here, in particular, is the schoolkids bonus, recognising how important it is to help families when the kids are back at school. Additional assistance will also be provided in additional family payments. All of these things would be ripped away by those opposite. They claim that they are concerned about the cost of living, but they are not when it comes to sending the kids to school or when it comes to actually providing some help through the family payments system. Of course there are also the payments that are going out now in terms of the clean energy package-payments to families and payments to pensioners. All of these would be ripped away by those opposite. In addition to that, they would rip away the instant asset write-off-this fundamental tax relief for up to 2.7 million small businesses right around this country. That too would be ripped away. What this really demonstrates is that those opposite have no plan to return our budget to surplus, no plan to provide tax relief for small businesses, no plan for the future of the country.

49,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. I remind the Acting Prime Minister of the actions taken by the New Zealand Minister of Immigration, who recently introduced strong measures to deter people smuggling, by making New Zealand are less desirable target, that included a form of temporary protection visa. If the threat of a single boat caused the New Zealand government to introduce temporary protection visas, why hasn't the reality of 18,000 people arriving on 314 illegal boats caused the government to reintroduce the coalition's proven border protection policies, including temporary protection visas?",27

53,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They might like to pretend that Nauru was a solution; it was not. But there is a solution out there that can be put in place. It is called overseas processing, it is called the Malaysian arrangement, and they are blocking it. And why are they blocking it? Because they know it will work-because they have made the judgment that they will not support overseas processing, which is the only measure which will break the people smugglers' model. They will not support it because they think it is in their political interest to have more boats arriving in Australia. So they get up and ask questions about boats arriving in Australia, but the blame rests fairly and squarely with them and their refusal to support overseas processing.",27

57,Ms LIVERMORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth. Will the minister inform the House how the government is helping families to meet the costs of educating their children? Why is it important that the government does this and are there any obstacles?",28
58,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Kingsford Smith Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (14:43): I would like to thank the member for Capricornia for her question. This budget was important because it provided an opportunity for families to additional support as they face cost of pressures when they are raising their kids and sending them to school. Not only was it spreading the benefits of the mining boom, not only was it focused on the vulnerable in our community, but it was making sure that at that time of the year when parents know that they have got additional schooling costs-the start of term 1, the start of term 3-if their kids are in primary school for each kid they could get $410, and if their kids were in high school they could get $820. This was a really good, positive measure that was put forward by this government, who understands that these costs are real for working families. Of course it came on top of record levels of investment in education by this Labor government over time. We have seen a national curriculum delivered. We have seen improvement in school facilities right around Australia. We have seen computers coming into high schools so that every kid in years 9 to 12 has the opportunity to get into the digital age. On top of all of that, we have got a budget which provides not only the tax relief that the Treasurer spoke about but also help for parents who face real cost of living pressures and know that some extra money for new school books, a uniform, some sports gear, or whatever it might be, would help them with raising their families. The question that I was asked, about how important this help from the government is, goes right to the heart of the challenges that parents face as they are educating their kids. When a kid comes home and says to their mum or dad, 'I need a little bit extra for a school excursion,' the parents have got to find that money out of their own pocket. We understand that these are real costs for parents around Australia. But when the Leader of the Opposition chose to block the schoolkids bonus he was saying in effect that get he does not trust families to make those living decisions. I do not think many people understand that 1.3 million families will benefit from this schoolkids bonus. That is 1.3 million families whom the Leader of the Opposition-who wants them to trust him as a politician-was not prepared to trust to make decisions about educating their families. I think that speaks volumes about the Leader of the Opposition. The shadow minister for education said something like, 'This is just a sugar hit.' I suspect that left a sour taste in the mouths a few people around Australia when they heard it. It highlights the fact that those opposite do not understand that families face real cost of living pressures and that this government is providing them with support as they send their kids to school.

60,Ms LIVERMORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Madam Deputy Speaker, I have a supplementary question for the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth. Following on from the minister's answer, how will these policies help families in my electorate and others in Queensland?",29
61,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Kingsford Smith Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (14:47): I thank the member for Capricornia for that important follow-up question. In Capricornia, some 8,650 families are expected to benefit from the schoolkids bonus. That is a lot of families who know what it is like to meet those additional education costs for their kids. Now, because of the budget that has been brought down by this government, they will have the opportunity to do that. It is not only 8,600 or so families in Capricornia but also 280,000 families in Queensland who are also expected to benefit. The government understand important education is. We know that every young Australian student who has the opportunity to be at a school that has good facilities provided by this government, access to computers provided by this of government, teachers with good quality training provided by this government, and a national curriculum delivered by this government will benefit. In the electorate of Capricornia, 13 schools have benefitted from eight trades training centres and more than $20 million from us. That is 13 schools who have benefited under national partnerships from the investment that we have made in making sure that there is teacher quality in schools, support for teachers as they teach kids, and improvements and additional effort on literacy and numeracy. All of these significant investments are happening not only in Capricornia but right around Queensland, because this government understands the importance of education. Member for Dobell  Opposition Business) (14:48): My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. I refer the Acting Prime Minister to the statement by the Prime Minister that the member for Dobell would not represent the Labor Party in Dobell at the next election and that he would be excluded from the Labor caucusa statement which the Prime Minister has reaffirmed in Chicago today. Does the Acting Prime Minister agree with the Prime Minister? If so, isn't it true that both he and the Prime Minister have been prepared to act as judge and jury over the member for Dobell in every respect other than refusing to accept his vote in the parliament?",29
62,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," No, I do not, and I would like to take some time to explain why. There is an enormous difference between the decision taken by the how Prime Minister and the decision taken by the member for Dobell to go to the crossbenches and what has been put forward by the opposition in this House. There is an enormous difference. What is going on in this House today is that those opposite want this parliament to be a kangaroo court. We saw that earlier today with the reference to the Privileges Committee by the Manager of Opposition Business. He wants this parliament to be judge, jury and executioner; whereas we on this side of the House believe that people are innocent until they are proven guilty and that they should be given an opportunity to explain themselves. Those on that side of the House want to turn this parliament into a kangaroo court. They should be ashamed of the tactics that they have applied in this House both yesterday and again today. The opposition have basically been trashing the rule of law in our country. That is what has been going on. They have been coming into this House and denying the presumption of innocence, and they have been denying the separation of power. All of this comes from the Leader of the Opposition. All of it comes from him. He wants to tear down the very pillars of our democracy. He wants to tear down the rule of law for political gain. I will tell you what: that is not leadership; that is weakness and cowardice. I can tell everybody in this House, and you can literally feel it here: there is a stench of negativity about this Leader of the Opposition and everybody over there knows it. These are the sort of 'say anything, do anything' tactics that we have had from the Leader of the Opposition that demonstrate that he is unfit for high office. Budget",29
63,Mr NEUMANN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Minister for Disability Reform. How is the government's budget helping Australian families make ends meet? What would be the impact of withdrawing this support?",30
64,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Jagajaga-Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Minister for Disability Reform) (14:52): I thank the member for Blair very much for his question and for all the work that he does for the people in his electorate, in the Ipswich area. I was very pleased to be with him in Ipswich late last week to meet with people with disability, people providing services to those with disability and their families and carers and to especially talk to them about the government's plans to introduce a national disability insurance scheme. We certainly are getting on with that job, and I appreciate the way in which the member for Blair and the people in Ipswich were so supportive of the government's moves. For the information of the people of Blair, from 20 June around 11,000 families will start to receive the schoolkids bonus, and of course that will mean that people who need a helping hand will get it with their education costs. One of the important things for that area is that that will mean not only that those thousands and thousands of families are going to get that extra bit of help but also that the newsagents, the clothing shops and those places that sell shoes and all the things that kids need will see a boost to the local economy. We expect around $11 million to be spent in the member for Blair's electorate, and that certainly will help those retailers as well as those families. This will be the case right around the country as we see parents get this extra help for all the things that their children need. We expect around one million families will get extra money. I have had quite a lot of correspondence from families around the country, one parent saying that he applauds 'the new schoolkids bonus-a lot less paperwork, always a good thing.' Of course, we know that did not stop the opposition from saying no. It does not matter what the public thinks, the opposition just say no. Parents say they want this schoolkids bonus; the opposition say no. The opposition say that they do not trust parents. Parents have found this deeply insulting. I heard from another mother recently, and she knows exactly how she will be spending this money. She is going to spend it on a new school uniform for her child-'Something,' as she said to me, 'I had to put off due to struggling financially.' Of course, that is something that those opposite do not understand at all. This government is determined to do everything it can to help parents and to make sure it supports them. All those opposite can do is say no and make it plain that they intend to claw back this assistance from families. Fair Work Australia",30

What is the government doing to ensure that the most vulnerable children in our society remain a key focus for the government now and into the future?",31
73,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Gellibrand-Attorney General and Minister for Emergency Management) (14:57): I thank the member for Fremantle for this question, and I know that she is particularly interested in the answer. In addition to all of the comments that have been made already in question time today by the minister for education and the minister for families, looking at the practical things that we can do to provide assistance to families who have children both at primary school and in secondary school, the member for Fremantle, along with a number of people on this side of the House, has been advocating for some time for the establishment of a national children's commissioner. This is an issue that we are giving attention because, as well as supporting families across the board with the costs of looking after children, we want to make sure that children, particularly those vulnerable situations, do have an advocate absolutely dedicated to listening to their needs and making sure that the voices of children are heard, and that in our policy making-like we did when the Treasurer put together this budget-we continue to pay attention to the needs of children. I am particularly pleased that I have been asked about this today, because tomorrow in this place we will be taking the important step of introducing legislation to establish the first National Children's Commissioner within the Australian Human Rights Commission. The National Children's Commissioner will have the important task of promoting the rights, well-being and development of children and young people in Australia. This will mean that for the first time Australia will have a dedicated advocate focused on the human rights of children and young people at the national level, and it will see issues of children continue to be front and centre of the government's policy development, instead of sidelining these concerns. Mr Katter interjecting",31

Whether it is making sure that there is more research, whether it is making sure that they have adequate advocacy or whether it is educational programs that can be conducted, these will all unashamedly focus on the in needs of the most vulnerable children in our society. Crucially, the commissioner is going to consult directly with children and young people to ensure that their voices are heard and their needs are pursued. Talking directly with kids will signal that, as adults, we think that they matter, that we value their childhood and that we will listen to their needs and their hopes. This has been a long standing policy of the Labor Party. I am delighted that we are now able to make this a reality because of a provision set aside in this year's budget. I think it highlights that, as well as being able to bring our budget into surplus and spread the benefits of the mining boom, this budget looks after those who are most vulnerable in the community, including those whose voices are often not heard. Member for Dobell",32
78,Mr BRIGGS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations.

There has been no evidence of misconduct provided to me. However, when I am asked about the statement and the matters referred to in the statement, let me also put on the record-as this government has done any number of occasions since the release of the Fair Work Australia general manager's delegates report into the HSU-that something has clearly gone very wrong in parts of the HSU. The conduct and behaviour, the subject of the findings, are unacceptable. It is disturbing.",32

There is no doubt that those who are responsible for the conduct reported in parts of the Health Services Union should be held accountable. We owe it to the members, we owe it to their families. But to do so means the court processes must be upheld. I think it is time for those opposite to stop engaging in the personal destruction of people. It is time for those opposite to accept that the court processes are the best place to test the evidence. It is in fact time for those opposite to return to the matters of importance in the national debate about the future of work and workplace relations. It is time for those opposite to raise their voice not in some sort of swamp of self-righteousness. It is time for those opposite to stand up and raise",33

88,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Watson-Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities) (15:04): I thank the member for Moreton for the question and the strong interest he is taking in environmental issues in Queensland. It has been the position of this government for some time, since we issued our response to the Hawke review on national environmental law reform, that if you can-without reducing the national standards of environmental law-have more of the referrals being done at a state level, then you can achieve the same environmental outcomes without increasing the burden on business. We have argued for a year that it is the right thing to do and our amendments that we will be bringing into the parliament will reflect that. Notwithstanding that, the Queensland Premier has gone further and has been demanding that these things be done immediately. He has also been demanding that he become the enforcer of national environmental powers at the COAG meeting. Well, it only took a fortnight after that before he went from saying he wanted to enforce national environmental law to wanting to tear it down. From time to time, people will ridicule environmental protections for endangered species when it is a species noone has ever heard of, when it is something that if you saw it in your garden you would think was a weed, when it is some sort of thrice-mutated frog. But only the Queensland National Party could say that an obscure species unworthy of protection was going by the name 'koala'. Only the Queensland National Party would be able to say, 'Well, we are just going too far if we going to protect the koala under environmental law.' So I say to the Queensland Premier, if he still wants to have a go at taking on and getting rid of some of the processing times, which we believe should happen-I wrote more than a week ago to my counterpart, the Queensland environment minister, as I did to the other states' environment ministers, and said there is one species where the delays have caused immense pain and annoyance for communities. Many members of parliament here on both sides of the House, notably the member for Kennedy, have complained for a long time about the impact of flying foxes when they are in urban communities, when they are in schools, when they are in hospitals, when they are in parks. There is a limited period each year when you can relocate them, and every day that you delay that with processing times makes the problem worse. It ends up with communities being saddled with these problems. I have written to the Queensland government saying, 'If you want this power on flying foxes, let's agree, and agree quickly, through a conservation agreement'-not a word in response. It is one thing to spend all your time grandstanding, but if he actually wants these powers it is time to play, to sign the document instead of just writing media releases, and to get an outcome that the people of Queensland can benefit from.",33

Will the minister please outline how our employment services are working to make sure that more Australians benefit from our strong labour market conditions? Ms KATE ELLIS (Adelaide-Minister for Employment Participation and Minister for Early Childhood and Childcare) (15:09): I take the opportunity to thank the member for Page for her question and for her longheld interest in this area. The member for Page knows well that our government has just delivered a budget which will return us to surplus, a budget that spreads of the mining boom but also, importantly, a budget that supports the most vulnerable people in Australia. Of course, we know that many of the most vulnerable people in Australia are those who are outside of the labour market-those who are unemployed and, in some cases, who have been trapped in a cycle of intergenerational welfare dependence. This Labor budget commits some $9.3 billion to our employment services over the next four years so that we can help spread the benefits of our prosperity. With an April unemployment rate of 4.9 per cent, we know that hundreds of thousands of Australians are sharing in the benefits and the dignity of work. But statistics like this do not just happen. We worked hard to create Job Services Australia, and I can now inform the House that, less than three years after these services were established, our providers have now successfully made over one million job placements across the nation. It is significant that amongst these placements the outcomes for the most disadvantaged Australians-for those suffering mental illness, for those who are homeless and for those facing multiple disadvantage-have improved by a staggering 90 per cent. This is the agenda that we are progressing. This is the Labor way: ensuring that individuals are not left on the sidelines, that those with the capacity to work are in work and that they are given every opportunity to participate. We know this is for their benefit but it is also for the benefit of our economy and our productivity. We are proud of the progress that we have made but we know that there is more to be done. In our budget we have announced new measures, new support, for the job seekers who need it the most, and new incentives for employers to help those job seekers to get that first foot in the benefits the door that they need. Our government has been very clear that no-one should be left behind. We are committed to ensuring that Australians have the chance to share in our prosperity. Through this focus, through this budget, we are creating jobs. We are supporting the workers who put in the hard slog and deserve the benefit, but we are also increasing workforce participation to help spread the benefits of the strong economy, and our nation is both stronger and fairer as a result of it.",35

117,Mr ALBANESE,IMPORTANCE,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (15:18): On indulgence, Madam Deputy Speaker, for the benefit of the House, it might be beneficial to indicate that more people than usual wish to speak on the MPI so that will be accommodated in following order: an Independent speaker, a government speaker, an opposition speaker, an Independent speaker, a government speaker, an opposition speaker and then an Independent speaker. So there will be three Independent speakers, two government speakers and two opposition speakers. That has been agreed with the Manager of Opposition Business and the Independents.",37
118,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE,"The Speaker has received letters from the honourable member for Lyne and the honourable member for North Sydney proposing that definite matters of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion today. As required by standing order 46(d), the Speaker has selected the matter which, in his opinion, is the most urgent and important; that is, that proposed by the honourable member for Lyne, namely: The importance of public confidence and public trust in the Australian Parliament, and the Parliament should respond to matters related to the Member for Dobell. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",38
119,Mr OAKESHOTT,IMPORTANCE," Quite obviously, there is an issue of importance before the House at present. The aim of this matter of public importance is certainly not to fan the lynch mob or be a kangaroo court. It is not to trawl through the tea leaves of events within a particular union a decade ago. It is not to add to the stress of the family of the individual member involved or to ignore the human element in dealing with the Fair Work Australia report. It is not to pass judgment or to play jury. It is to have a debate, starting with full respect for the principles of the presumption of innocence and the separation of powers. It is to have at its heart the aim of trying to kickstart a more rational debate on what next. Where do we go with the findings in a 1,100 page report from an independent statutory body of the Commonwealth and with a 59minute initial reply from the member for Dobell? We have what I consider to be a category killer for all of us. It is causing significant damage both short and long term with regard to public confidence and public trust in the Australian parliament itself. In my view, we do therefore need to respond in some kind. The point of this MPI is also to express my views that the member for Dobell's inactions as a member of parliament-not as a union official a decade ago-including the admission he made yesterday that he regrets putting legal advice and political party advice before getting to his feet and explaining to colleagues what an earth is how going on, are issues that this parliament needs to address. The point of the MPI is also to call for some very clear leadership from the executive and from the Prime Minister in particular on where to go from here. The vast majority of people who have contacted us, particularly in the last 24 hours, are asking that very simple question: what next? What investigations are currently underway and who is going to assure the community that these matters will actually go to court, which so many are saying is the appropriate place for these matters to be addressed? Leadership in explaining the next steps in the process is what is being sought by many. Personally, I remain, frankly, angry and let down by the member for Dobell as a fellow member of parliament for saying a year ago that he would make a speech to the House and only doing it yesterday, leading to an increased loss of public confidence and trust along the way. I as well, frankly, personally remain angry and let down by the member for Dobell in his confirmation that he had put in the public square some language with regard to defamation and just left it hanging-he did not choose to correct the record as quickly as possible, which should be part of the values that all of us as MPs hold dear. Frankly, personally, I remain angry and let down by the member for Dobell with regard to reports that continue to suggest a reluctance to fully and openly assist investigative bodies in an effort to resolve all issues, as should, again, be a basic value held by all MPs at all times. My interest in being a member of parliament is in empowering and building community and in working on issues nationally to lift the standard of living of all of us. It is not this stuff. I would be surprised if any of us are here with the motivation of being driven by issues that have arisen over the last 24 hours with regard to a fellow member. Issues for me include the Pacific Highway, regional education, regional hospitals, and reform programs in the areas of natural resources, aged care, innovation and tax. Each MP in this place, I am sure, has their own list. As a value, I believe strongly that the best way to achieve all these reforms for the better is through this place, through our parliament, and by that I mean in the process of debate. I believe in participatory democracy and that the simple act of airing issues and engaging community through debate can assist greatly in reaching the right outcomes in public policy. It is a natural default position of what it is to be an MP. So I feel sadness and anger that public confidence and trust has been eroded through the range of issues associated with the Fair Work Australia report, and in particular that issues have not been dealt with by the member in question in the past year when he said he would deal with them in the public domain. These are outstanding issues that go back nearly a decade and have remained outstanding for the past three parliaments. That, I think, is something that all should be pretty frustrated and angry about. As stated, my particular frustration is that it has taken so long for facts to be put on the table by both Fair Work Australia and the member for Dobell. That delay in establishing the facts has done damage to the parliament itself. The delay of four years is an unacceptable length of time by Fair Work Australia in its duties and raises policy questions of why and at what expense to the taxpayer. Likewise, the delay in the member for Dobell standing up and at least explaining the issues from his point of view has, in rugby league terms, brought the game of the parliament into disrepute and has ended up doing damage to the parliament itself. It was unacceptable that it took the member for Dobell so long to fulfil his duties as an MP and to stand up in this place, a point he himself acknowledged with regret yesterday. So just as the Labor Party has felt it necessary to dismiss one of its own over this issue, so the parliament should find the right response to the Fair Work report. The parliament needs to play its role, in my view, and express little tolerance for further delays in resolving the many issues in question. These issues in question do go back, as I said before, nearly a decade-not to the previous Rudd majority parliament nor the last two Howard minority governments, but back to 2003. It is wrong to blame this 43rd Parliament for dealing with what should have been dealt with by various parties involved a long time ago. It is right that we tolerate no longer delays in debating this issue and to encourage any investigations that may need to proceed. It was nearly a year ago that the member for Dobell informed us, his parliamentary colleagues, that he would make a statement on all issues to the House to clarify the swirling rumours and attacks on the parliament itself on issues that none of us, if we are honest, are fully aware of in detail. It is his failure to recognise the damage his silence has been doing to our great institution, as well as the findings of the Fair Work report itself, that are the two substantive issues this House needs to consider. The Fair Work report was a 1,150-page report with over 150 contraventions identified. It is a shocking and damning report. It has status and it has worth. The line of questioning at the end of question time today is the right way for this parliament to do its job. It is wrong to deny its status and is wrong to deny that the work done by Fair Work Australia does not deserve the full support of government. I accept that the member for Dobell has raised serious allegations against Fair Work Australia that involve Kathy Jackson and Tony Abbott's relationship with the deputy. On this point I do not accept an argument of interference from either Kathy Jackson or Tony Abbott, and arguments presented on websites such as VEXNEWS should be dismissed as both unhelpful and untested. In my view, the weight of evidence is with the Fair Work Australia report, and progress on those findings should be expected and encouraged. The Prime Minister this morning identified that progress in other investigations is expected from the Fair Work Australia report. I ask her-hopefully on behalf of the parliament as a majority-to be very clear on what those next steps are in the investigation processes. As well, to complement that, I will be raising-as has been raised with me by committee members-at its next meeting the question of whether the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit is willing to undertake an inquiry into Fair Work Australia itself, on the question of whether due process has been followed. It is ultimately a matter for the full committee to agree on, but it is a suggestion I will be putting to them later this week. As well, I will personally be encouraging debate on the coalition's position with regard to the 14-day suspension, even though personally I do not agree with it. Debate is important. I want to hear from the coalition on how they argue this motion is sustainable for the long term and for future parliaments, and how they answer the charge that several of their own MPs would fail the benchmark for suspension that they are trying to set for others. I will also be putting three motions to it the parliament for debate and consideration by the selection committee. The first motion will be a censure motion of the member for Dobell, and it will be along the lines that this House censures the member for Dobell (1) for the length of time taken to publicly respond to issues under investigation from 2003 to 2006 and the damage this has done to public confidence and trust in the Australian parliament; and (2) the lack of full cooperation by the member for Dobell with investigatory bodies, state and federal, and the damage this has done to public confidence and trust in the Australian parliament. The second motion is that I will also be putting on the Notice Paper a motion seeking the endorsement of the House for the draft code of conduct that has been circulated since November last year. It is related to this issue; it was agreed on by all of us and by all parties 18 months ago. It is timely that we progress that. Then if we are in the future caught in this space between issues raised by section 44 of the Australian Constitution and community sentiment wanting action, we will have a document that we can refer to and hopefully set a standard from. The third motion deals with other related matters, and there are four points to it. The first point requests a report from a committee on the integrity commission that I know is being followed up by others. The second point requests a report from the Standing Committee on Privileges and Members' Interests on any relevant issues for members' consideration in light of all information available in relation to the Fair Work Australia report, including issues of concern relating to commentary by any MP in relation to section 28 of the Commonwealth Crimes Act. Whilesoever any member has rights in this place, I would hope all of us respect, protect and defend those rights, no matter what we may think of a member personally. The third point is to encourage the Special Minister of State to act swiftly in bringing forward electoral and disclosure law changes as identified by the Australian Electoral Commission. And the fourth point seeks greater progress on Commonwealth whistleblower legislation from the relevant minister, again as agreed in September 2010, and I know it is being followed up by parliamentary colleagues. Ultimately, it is up to the majority of the parliament-all of us and all of you-to decide what we debate. I do not want in any way to be positioned as some sort of Mr Shiny Shoes on parliamentary integrity or human failing. I accept the majority view on each of these motions. I acknowledge that, at least on the crossbench, I have few friends in censuring the member in question, but still I think it is worth pursuing. I do think it is appropriate to make a statement about what we as members of parliament should all be trying to do-that is, to seek the highest values possible. I know that does not mean that others do not share the same values, but that is where I end up with this story that we saw unfold dramatically yesterday. I do not demand it; I just seek it. I fully recognise it is a group decision, on party lines, but as a collective of MPs and a reflection of the community. I do not think it is asking too much. I am surprised and somewhat saddened that we are quick as individuals to go down the path of, as I called it before, 'category killing' the values of what it means to be an MP when we attack each other, but then are strangely reluctant as a group to stand up for the values we do have and do seek on behalf of all Australians. From my perspective I would hope there is good and due consideration of those motions. I do hope this is a moment of reflection where we can collectively, regardless of party lines, do a bit of work in restoring some integrity and public confidence and trust in this institution that I hope we all hold dear.",38
120,Mr DREYFUS,IMPORTANCE,"Isaacs-Cabinet Secretary, Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and Parliamentary Secretary for Industry and Innovation) (15:34): I am very pleased to have the opportunity today to speak on this matter. I believe that the issue of public confidence and public trust in the Australian parliament is an issue of the utmost importance, as this place is the place where governments are formed and the shape of our nation is altered. It is imperative that the Australian public hold this place and its occupants in the highest regard and are convinced that their elected representatives carry out their obligations with judgment, with diligence, with honesty and with integrity. Most recently, there has been a great deal of debate about the actions of the member for Dobell, particularly in the light of the report by the investigator acting as the delegate of the general manager of Fair Work Australia, which was tabled recently in the Senate and was indeed the subject of the statement made by the member for Dobell not yesterday. The report, of course, made a number of findings against the member for Dobell and I would be remiss if I did not say I share the concerns of many in this place at the findings in this report. They are disturbing findings; they are distressing findings. No right thinking person could fail to be disturbed at the findings made by the investigator of misuse of the funds contributed to the union, which represents some of the lowest-paid workers in Australia. Yesterday we saw a lengthy statement by the member for Dobell, a statement in which the member for Dobell outlined very personally the impact that these events have had on his life and, of course, he maintained very strongly his claims of innocence. It is worth noting that this was a statement that the opposition had been calling for and that it was a statement he made in response to those calls. I should also say that, as I understand the position, reason that the member for Dobell had not made the statement before now was on legal advice. I think that the topic for this matter of public importance is well chosen. It draws attention to the tasks we have before us as members of parliament, and one of those important tasks is to maintain the integrity of this parliament. But we are not a court; parliament is not a court. Despite the baying and shouting from those opposite they have offered nothing concrete. This is why the member for Lyne has raised this matter of public importance; those opposite have raised no concrete suggestions as to how the matters raised by the report of Fair Work Australia can actually be dealt with. We are not here in some American TV crime series: we are not investigators, we are not police and we are not a court. As a democratic country we have very well developed institutions: we have police forces, we have investigators and we have different regulators for many parts of our society. And we have courts, and these matters need to be left to the courts. We are not a body that can consider evidence in the way that a court does. Listening to the statement made yesterday in this place for nearly an hour by the member for Dobell, one of the first things that struck me was the near impossibility of sifting claim and counterclaim, sifting allegation and counterallegation and sifting the vast body of factual material which forms the subject of the Fair Work Australia investigator's report. Those matters-that process of sifting and assessing and judging-are quintessentially matters that are dealt with by courts. They are not matters that this parliament is set up, either historically or actually, to deal with. We are not well placed to determine it, nor is it our role to determine whether the the member for Dobell has correctly stated the position, or whether the findings made by the Fair Work Australia investigator are true. We are not in a position to assess the claim and counterclaim, even though-and this has been pretty clear from the public debate and clear from some of the statements made in this House-many of us may question parts of the explanation. That is why this matter is going to go to the courts. I need to make it clear, just to put to rest the suggestion that the matters raised by this Fair Work Australia report are not presently before the courts. The general manager of Fair Work Australia has said publicly that she has instructed lawyers to prepare legal proceedings in respect of the findings arising from the investigations into the HSU national office and the HSU Victoria No. 1 branch. The general manager of Fair Work Australia has the power to apply to the Federal Court of Australia under section 336 of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009 and she indicated in her statement on 14 March 2012 that she would do just that-that she would instruct the Australian Government Solicitor to apply to the Federal Court for penalties and other orders in relation to contraventions of civil penalty provisions. She also indicated that she would apply to the Federal Court for declaratory relief in relation to three additional contraventions described in the Fair Work Australia investigator's report, those not being civil penalty provisions. So, on any view, this matter is going to court. It is going to the proper forum at which these matters will be looked at and at which the claims and the counterclaims that have been made yesterday by the member for Dobell can be assessed in their proper place. One is left to wonder what it is that those opposite are wanting here. We have legislation passed, indeed, by the Howard government. These provisions-these investigation provisions, these civil penalty provisions and this referral to the Federal Court provisions-are all of them Howard government legislation, indeed, passed when the member for Warringah, the present Leader of the Opposition, was the responsible minister. Are they saying, perhaps, that they do not wish this matter to be finalised by the courts? I hope that they are not saying that. We, on this side of the House, want this resolved for the benefit of the long-suffering members of the Health Services Union, and we want that to occur before the Federal Court, which is the appropriate place for these matters to be resolved. They cannot be resolved here. That is a key point that should not be lost. The actual matters that are the subject of this Work Australia report cannot be resolved in this place. There are a number of options that the parliament can consider in relation to the member for Dobell. But we need to think carefully in considering what actions might be taken: whether the actions that are taken actually will increase the regard that Australians hold for this House and for this parliament and whether it is the proper place for this House to act in the manner that is put forward. I will come back in a moment to the suggestion that has been raised here by the member for Lyne. But just to look at the range of options: some have suggested that the House should suspend the member for Dobell, some have suggested-completely without basis-that the House should expel the member for Dobell and some suggestions have been made of censure. I just note that it is worth reminding the House that this place no longer has the power to expel members. The power once existed but was removed by the Parliamentary Privileges Act of 1987, and for good reason. The power of expulsion was used once before, in 1920, to expel the member for Kalgoorlie, the Hon. Hugh Mahon, for what were said to be seditious and disloyal utterances. The member had expressed publicly sympathy for the Irish republicans and opposition to the British policy in Ireland. The power was abolished on the recommendation of the final report of the Joint Select Committee on Parliamentary Privilege in 1984. This was a bipartisan committee consisting of members of the Labor Party and members of the Liberal Party-indeed, members of the Liberal Party back then in 1984, who had a great deal more respect for the institution of this parliament, for the conventions of this parliament and for the institutions of Australia than the present opposition Fair demonstrates on a daily basis. The present opposition demonstrates on a daily basis nothing but contempt for the conventions of this parliament and for the institutions of our country. The Joint Select Committee on Parliamentary Privilege noted in 1984, in relation to the dangers inherent in a system where a partisan vote can determine whether a parliamentarian is fit to remain in officeand, one might add to that, where a partisan vote can be brought to bear on a censure or on a suspension: Looking back to the Mahon casewhich is the only time when a member was expelledone is struck by these features: the speed with which the motion was brought on; the limited time for debate; the haste in which such an important matter was determined; and the party lines. They emphasise: … the only case in federal history when the power to expel was exercised is … when … the power was demonstrably misused … I think that the bipartisan authors of that report would be very concerned to look at what has been occurring in this parliament in recent days. We might, in fact, be seeing some evidence of something similar to what occurred at the instance of then Prime Minister Billy Hughes back in 1920, when, relying on the numbers that he commanded in the House of Representatives, he used them to expel a member of the House. There should be no suggestion that the parliament should assume what would be a wholly inappropriate role for this parliament, that of the courts-or, even more than that, that of judge and jury-for partisan political ends. Suggestions that the member for Dobell should be censured are troubling for the same reason. Taking action to censure the member, to expel the member, which is now not open, as I have pointed out, or to suspend the member, I would suggest, will not result in an increase in the parliament's prestige-quite the opposite. That is particularly so if the purpose of the censure is to draw attention to matters which occurred before the member became a member of this House. What I am pointing to is the fact that there have been a very small number of examples in the history of this parliament when the censure power has been used. There have been only four occasions since Federation, but the most recent occasions were both in 1995, when this House censured the member for Barker, Mr MCLachlan, for misleading the House on the source of documents relating to the Hindmarsh Island Bridge matter, and when the House censured the vote on member for Chisholm, Mr Wooldridge, in August 1995 for intentionally misleading the House during a personal explanation relating to the Penny Easton matter. What is notable is that it is in some doubt, according to House of Representatives Practice, whether or not even those censure motions were within the traditional purpose of a censure. House of Representatives Practice notes 'the parliamentary convention that the traditional purpose of a vote of censure is to question or bring to account a minister's responsibility to the House'. The Practice goes on to note on page 322: Furthermore, given the relative strength of the parties in the House, and the strength of party loyalties, in ordinary circumstances it could be expected that a motion or amendment expressing censure of an opposition leader or another opposition Member would be agreed to, perhaps regardless of the circumstances or the merits of the arguments or allegations. That is, of course, what happened back in 1920, when there was an expulsion on party lines. I note that the member for Lyne has put forward the possibility of moving a censure motion which would be directed not at the conduct of the member for Dobell before he became a member of this House but rather at, as I understood the member for Lyne, the delay by the member for Dobell in making a statement in explanation of the allegations that had been raised. That, I can say without pre-empting a decision made on this side of the House as to the way in which we would treat such a censure motion, would at least be within the past practice of this House-not totally within the conventions of this House but at least within some past practicebecause it focuses on conduct in the House. That is a very important distinction which I would invite all honourable members to reflect on: that when we are thinking about what is to be the way in which this House responds, if it chooses to respond at all, it needs to be focused on parliamentary conduct. It is wrong to devalue the very special place that the legal system-the court system-has in our society, and if we are to embark to displace it then it would cut against all of the separation of powers that sits at the heart of our democracy. (Time expired)  Opposition Business) (15:49): The key point made by the member for Isaacs in relation to this matter of public importance is that it is outrageous for the parliament to be considering the matters to do with the member for Dobell. I would point the member for Isaacs to one of his own very respected and senior colleagues in past parliaments, Senator Robert Ray, from his own state of Victoria, who, when matters were being raised in 1997 to do with another person in another place, wrote to Peter Reith, at that stage the Leader of the House. He said in that letter: … your intervention is an affront to the principle that there is no authority superior to Parliament the determination of its own procedures and actions. Indeed, an earlier Speaker of the House of Representatives has relevantly observed that there is no authority superior to Parliament which could arrogate to itself the power to appoint any commission or other tribunal to invade the sphere of Parliamentary jurisdiction in the conduct and direction of its own business. In other words, the parliament had every right in 1997, as it does today, to consider, vote upon and deal with the matters to do with the member for Dobell. It is simply a convenience put forward by the member for Isaacs in this debate today to try to continue the racket that has surrounded the member for Dobell for a very long time in this place to stop him from being held to account for bringing the parliament into disrepute. On 9 September last year, the member for Dobell told the Australian, 'I will make a comprehensive statement in the near future.' Eight months ago the member for Dobell indicated that he would make a statement to the parliament in relation to what at that stage were allegations-now findings of fact by Fair Work Australia that have engulfed him. After many attempts to get him to do of so-all opposed by the Prime Minister, the Labor caucus and, until two weeks ago, the members for Lyne, Melbourne and New England, voting again and again in this place-he gave a statement yesterday. He was given one hour to justify himself. The opposition was not given even one minute to test his claims. But he did not give a comprehensive statement. He gave a statement that was an exercise in selfjustification, blame-shifting and heaping of conspiracy upon conspiracy. His statement, to many, sounded like pure fantasy, an alibi for the Prime Minister, a fig leaf for what we all know to be true-that the Prime Minister failed to act until too late. By rejecting his in vote in the caucus but accepting it in the parliament, she has exposed her own hypocrisy. While she is prepared to be judge and jury when it does not affect her, she will cling to her vote in this place because her No. 1 priority is in fact to hang onto power. The member for Dobell's claim was that he was set up by a tormentor in the Health Services Union. For his story to be believed, the following must be true: his tormentor was able to break into his hotel room and use the hotel room, leaving undetected, on numerous occasions; his tormentor knew the code to his mobile phone and was able to use it moments after the member for Dobell made legitimate business calls and get it back to him moments before other legitimate business calls, without being detected; his tormentor stole his credit card and drivers licence from his home on the Central Coast, drove to Sydney, passed himself off as the member for Dobell, forged his signature, drove back to the Central Coast, broke back into the member for Dobell's home and put his credit card and drivers licence back into his wallet, and left undetected",41
121,Mr Fitzgibbon,IMPORTANCE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: I am genuinely reluctant to interrupt-I mean that very, very genuinely-but I ask you to reflect on whether the Manager of Opposition Business is going well beyond any allegations made in the Fair Work Australia report and, if he is going to make such substantial allegations, whether he should do so by a substantive motion rather than abuse the MPI.",46
122,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE," The MPI before us is about how the parliament should respond to matters related to the member for Dobell rather than an examination of the actions of the member. I hope the Manager of Opposition Business will bear that in mind in his remarks.  Speaker. In order to be able to debate the MPI, in order to debate the importance of public confidence and public trust in the Australian parliament, we need to examine the believability of the statement the member for Dobell made yesterday. If it is found to be unbelievable, it goes to the second part of the MPI, which is about how the parliament should respond to the matters that are related to the member for Dobell. I thank the member for Lyne for putting the matter of public importance into debate today to give the opposition the first opportunity it has had to do so. I continue. His tormentor was able to pull this off not just to purchase the services of escort agencies but also to purchase personal items such as running shoes; to dine at restaurants such as 41 in Sydney's CBD; to travel interstate and overseas; to hire staff to work on the Dobell election campaign in 2007; to pay for printing for the election campaign; to make $100,000 of cash withdrawals from ATMs; and otherwise to live the high life-all without the member for Dobell suspecting that there was something going on. But if that is not enough to strain credulity, we need to suspend reality to believe that, in spite of the member for Dobell suspecting he was being set up, when each of the credit card statements was presented to him for payment he ignored the suspicions in the back of his mind that he was being set up and simply signed off on them being paid. That is odd, really. You would think that, if most people received their credit card statements and names like Miss Behaving escort agency appeared on them, it would cause them to pause before they signed off on the payment of such credit card invoices-not so the member for Dobell. It reminds me of the words of Jack Palance, from Ripley's Believe It or Not'believe it or not'. And the opposition does not believe it. In the statement the member for Dobell made yesterday, which he claims to be a comprehensive statement, he left out some of the very key issues that this House has been questioning the government about for some time and that were clearly needing to be dealt with yesterday in his statement. He failed to explain to the House the finding of Fair Work Australia that he misused $457,000 of funds on all the other matters besides the escort agencies, that he dealt with yesterday. How does he account for the finding of Fair Work Australia that he advanced false and misleading evidence to the authority in that investigation? Did he receive a credit card from the printing firm employed by the Health Services Union for his own personal use that would amount to receiving a secret commission if true? When did he receive the benefit of the payment of his legal fees from the New South Wales Labor Party and loans from the New South Wales Labor Party, and why were they not declared on the Register of Members' Interests until media inquiries were made about them? Why until recently has he declined to assist both the New South Wales and Victorian police with their inquiries into his own actions and the operations of the Health Services Union when he was its national secretary? On what basis did he claim to Mike Smith last year that $15,000 was repaid by a third party to the Health Services Union for unauthorised expenditure on escort services, a claim specifically refuted in the Fair Work Australia report? These are the key issues that the member for Dobell failed to address in his statement yesterday. I and the opposition believe, as do the member for Lyne and other independents in this House, that these key issues need to be explained by the member for Dobell in a further statement to the House-a statement to the House that is genuinely comprehensive. He needs to not only cover the matters that he covered yesterday but deal explicitly with the questions that I have placed on the Hansard today in this matter of public importance. Until he does, this matter cannot be resolved. Until he does, the parliament still has a right, as outlined by Senator Robert Ray in 1997, to protect its own interests, its own integrity and the reputation of every member in this House.",46
123,Mr WINDSOR,IMPORTANCE," I thank the member for Lyne for introducing this matter of public importance and I appreciate the degree of civility around the chamber in terms of trying to address what is a very substantive issue and troubling a lot members of this House. I also thank the member for Sturt for his contribution a moment ago because he highlighted the absolute need for due process. He raised a whole range of questions. I have no doubt that some of those questions, for students of the law, probably do need to be answered, but they cannot be dealt with in a kangaroo court situation. They can be dealt with in a court. Now a little bit of heat has gone out of the day on this issue, we are addressing how the parliament can deal with this issue and how we as individuals or as members of various committees can play a constructive role not only in the present issues before the House but also in potential issues in the future. It does highlight the need for clear minds, concise legal interpretation of people's rights, due process and, obviously, the separation of powers. I have said to the media in the past I would rather not be in this building if we start to use the numbers within this parliament-the delicate numbers of a hung parliament particularly-to start to adjudicate the law for individuals who have not been charged or convicted of anything. They may well be convicted by a court and, if they are, they should face the full force of the law. I will talk in a moment about maybe an extension of the current legislative arrangements for disqualification. I went through a very similar situation to this back in the early nineties in another hung parliament where a very good Premier, in my view, a man called Nick Greiner, was found to be corrupt by the ICAC, the corruption body of New South Wales. There were calls then, as there is now, by the then state Leader of the Opposition-the attack dog in those days, the Tony Abbott of his day-Bob Carr, who is now in the Senate, for the removal of Nick Greiner. The federal leader of the Liberal Party, John Hewson, was also calling for the removal of Nick of Greiner because it was doing damage to the party. Members of the Liberal Party in New South Wales themselves were calling for his removal. There was talk of a no confidence motion being moved against the Premier on a Tuesday of whatever month it was. It was my vote that put the Liberals in power in particular parliament. I can remember talking to Nick Greiner on the Sunday night and I told him that if a no confidence motion was moved by the other crossbenchers or by Bob Carr then I would not be supportive of it. I made the point that the reason for that, even though I was upset over the corruption charge as I am upset over the Fair Work Australia findings, was he had not exhausted due process. He said to me, and I remember his words quite clearly: 'It is too late. want me to go.' He resigned the next day as Premier. Some students of politics might be interested in this point that he made to me after his Liberal Party people deserted him. He said: 'You'll be interested in this, Tony. The National Party were the only ones who've stuck with me.' He resigned and about a week later, or it might have been only four or five days later, he was found guilty on appeal. After the subsequent election, with a majority of one, Bob Carr became the Premier and changed the corruption legislation so that what happened to Nick Greiner could never happen again. Therein lies a story too of a code of conduct. Codes of conduct tend to come before parliaments when the numbers are very tight or in a hung parliament. Both major parties tend to run from them. There was talk of a code of conduct in those days, and I think one was actually passed. I was not madly in love with the code of conduct because I knew quite well what would happen-and what did happen-as soon as a majority government came along: the code of conduct was dictated by numbers. That is one of the issues of a code of conduct. That is one of the reasons why I have postulated that maybe one of the things this parliament has to look at-if both sides are very concerned about the current issues before the parliament-and that may be worth considering is should there be other areas that qualify for that automatic disqualification of a member? We have two areas that automatically disqualify a member as I understand it. One is bankruptcy. You are out. There is no reference to your friends, your mates, your numbers, the marginality of your seat or the colour of your hair. The other is if you are convicted of a criminal offence with a jail term of more than a year. You are also out. There is nothing about civil offence and nothing about the standards that I believe the They community are requesting and in some cases are demanding. I think we should consider, if there are standards that this House is not meeting or that some of the members are not meeting, putting it into a legislative arrangement so that there is automatic disqualification for a breach, rather than just recommendations for a code of conduct. A previous parliament did decide that not bankruptcy and a jail term over a year were grounds for disqualification. Maybe there are other grounds that we should be looking at. I have said for some time that I would support references to the Privileges Committee for determination on activities, not the civil and criminal ones because they are dealt with by the courts, such as misleading the House or for internal procedures and processes of the House. I would be interested to see when that reference is finally made and the terms in which it is made. The member for Lyne made comment today about the possibility of introducing a censure motion. I have spoken to him about this personally and I fully respect his right to move that motion. I will not be supportive of it, because I believe it prejudges, in this case the member for Dobell, prior to due process. When I look at this issue-and I am as angry as anybody about the findings of Fair Work Australia. I think if we start to go down the slippery slope of prejudgment before the appropriate criminal or civil action is taken put ourselves out there as the judge and jury. I do not think that is what any of us have been elected to do. I might be an excellent bush lawyer but I would be pretty hopeless in a court. I think people need to reflect on that. I know there is a lot of hostility and feeling in the room. I have been in a hung parliament before. I was in another one with a majority of one, which was virtually the same, where one number is tantamount-is very, very important. And that can be built up by redneck radio and a whole range of other people to a crescendo, where the hounds call for blood. But I think of our parliament and our democracy-the fact that our fathers and grandfathers and others have fought for this country not just to keep us in a free state but also to preserve the rights of the individual, the rights of the democratic process, the right to separate the powers of the judiciary from the parliament. Those rights should be at the forefront of all our minds, irrespective of the numbers of the day. To start playing a game with the numbers of the day for a short-term agenda could do enormous long-term damage in terms of the integrity of this institution. I make a plea to people: be careful that you do not walk down a road that you regret later on just for short-term advantage. Thank you.",47
124,Mr JENKINS,IMPORTANCE," I thank the member for Lyne for proposing this matter of public importance and I thank those that have contributed to the debate from the crossbenches and Minister Gray at the table, because I think they have taken the discussion in the spirit that it was meant. Regrettably, the issues surrounding matters related to the member for Dobell have sunk to a very low point in politics. There has been an inability of the parliament to come to grips with the way that we should react to we do start to these matters. Of course all parliamentarians are politicians but not all politicians are parliamentarians. There are plenty of other venues where we can practice our politics. I see some from the press gallery grinning, because they know that they participate in that contest of personalities that goes with politics. It is regrettable that, when given the opportunity, not all the chamber can take the opportunity to have a real contest of ideas, even when it is over such controversial matters that surround the actions of the member for Dobell before he entered this place. Today we witnessed one of the great problems. There has been urging-and I appreciate that the member for Lyne is of this view-that the member for Dobell perhaps should have come into this chamber and made a statement earlier. But in the world of politics what have we seen since yesterday? The statement becomes the issue. In some way we conjure up that the statement, because in some eyes it misled this House, is the issue. Yet the member for Sturt can come in here and ask for another statement, but that is by the by. The privileges matter can be dealt with through the procedures and consideration of the Speaker, which will be reported back here and then the House will make its decision. But what I really find regretful is that this controversial flashpoint has focused those that think about these issues to think about the way in which we can actually tackle it, so we have discussion of a code of conduct. I had hoped that earlier in this parliament, given that it was part of very learned pieces of paper that are very important for this parliament, we would have got to the code of conduct much quicker. But all we have is the discussion document: the draft code of conduct. At least we have got it and it will be easy to implement it. But once we have implemented it let us really think about how we are going to use it. Hopefully, if we get over the hard part, which was creating a code of conduct, how we use it will be easy. I might be so bold-and it is not necessarily those that I now hunt and run with on this side's view yet-as to say that an integrity commissioner, an ethics commissioner is pretty easy. There are plenty of models around the world, and they sure take the sting out of the politics if people transgress. I happened to be in Ottawa last month. It was a very important issue-I will take that up with those that I am facing from the gallery later on. We have headlines: 'Raitt did no wrong in upgrading airline seat'. The 'Raitt' that they are talking about is the labour minister, Lisa Raitt. What was her crime? She got on Air Canada and Air Canada upgraded her to business. The next week the Canadian government intervened in an industrial dispute on the side of Air Canada. A bit embarrassing for poor old Lisa, because she is the labour minister. Where did it go? It went to the ethics commissioner. The heat was taken out of it. The ethics commissioner decided, given that it was just the poor bod at the gate who decided to upgrade, that there was nothing sinister. Another headline was, 'Fantino denies offshore accounts: ethics commissioner examining documents'. The article said that some documents of unknown origin had been handed into the Royal Canadian Mounted Police that indicated that Associate Defence Minister Julian Fantino had some offshore accounts. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police were investigating it; but, because Mr Fantino is a member and a minister, it has gone to the ethics commissioner. In several column inches of discussion in the Ottawa Citizen, not one member of parliament or politician is mentioned-because there is a process. You will love the headline that really attracted my attention, given my state of mind at the moment: 'Oda repays limo service charges'. Bev Oda is the international cooperation minister, and she was being asked to pay $3,000 that she charged taxpayers for limousine services while staying 'at a posh hotel in London'. Regrettably, this poor minister decided that the digs that she had been put in-where a conference she was attending was being held-were not good enough and she had to be sent to the Savoy. So she had to get a limo to the place where the conference was, and the ethics commissioner decided that she could pay the $3,000. The other incidental thing is that she is going to live to regret that she paid Can$5 for an orange juice at the Savoy, because she is being well and truly ridiculed. I give those examples to show that matters that could be blown out of all proportion can be handled in a sensible way. The fact is that before the member for Herbert was a member here we had failed to put in a code of conduct or an ethics commissioner, where you could have sent-if you had wanted to the member for Dobell, and you could have had the politics taken out and had it decided as a parliamentary discussion. That is the point that I make-besides the fact that we have a problem as a parliament because the matters pertain to actions of a member of this place before he became a member of this place. We have a matter of public importance that stresses 'the importance of public confidence and public trust in the Australian parliament'. That is not only about the statement that Craig Thomson made as the member for Dobell; it is the reaction of this House about the statement. We had people jumping up, after a 59-minute statement, with a prepared speech going to matters that they thought would be in the statement. It had to be rehashed and rehashed. Emotive terms were used by members of this placewho use those emotive terms all the timesaying that the member for Dobell's vote is tainted. If it is tainted, it There have been plenty of occasions when we have had people who have faced more serious matters. We have had a person who left the caucus and sat on the crossbenches because he had criminal charges hanging over him that led, after he left this place, to him going to prison. So it is not the first time. Why was there not a big kerfuffle then? There was a majority government. Suddenly the rules have to change, because we find ourselves-as a result of the will of the people at the last election-with a minority government that has been very effective in the way that it has legislated and very effective in the way that it has pursued policy matters through its committees. That is the only reason. And we have outside people saying, 'Oh, if it were a majority parliament he would have been out of here already.' I do not think he would have been. We would have been going through due process and, until the due process found that, for some reason, he was not qualified to stay here, that would have been the end of it. It is not only the actions of individual members that give this place an image problem; it is the way we react to them. I think that is the spirit in which the member for Lyne proposed this, and I am disappointed that the opposition has not- (Time expired) Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (16:19): I thank the member for Lyne for proposing this matter of public importance. The member for Dobell owed this parliament an explanation in the form of a statement. He acknowledged as much, and he gave one. Having offered to do so, he owed this parliament a statement of the truth: the simple, unadorned truth-not elaborately constructed plots, not fanciful alternative explanations and not highly implausible, highly dubious, unbelievable conspiracy theories naming people under parliamentary privilege. Just the truth, plain ain't the first taint. and simple. The government argues that the parliament has no role to play in dealing with the serious findings of Fair Work Australia against the member for Dobell. These matters are not mere accusations, nor are they rumour from the world of the union movement. They are official findings by an independent investigator of a quasi-judicial government agency. There was an investigation of more than three years, resulting in a voluminous 1,100-page report that included 156 specific findings against the member for Dobell. Included in that report is a finding that the member for Dobell, at a time when he was a member of this place, provided 'information that is false or misleading' to the investigator of this quasi-judicial government agency. The findings go to the heart of the member for Dobell's legitimacy in this parliament, as the investigation found that he misused $270,000 of union funds to support his election to this parliament. His very presence in this House is based upon what the investigator found to be acts of dishonesty. The member for Dobell must now address the further serious questions arising from his statement to the House yesterday and the discrepancies between it and his previous statements at various times. This matter of public importance asks how the parliament should respond. The member for Dobell must now clear up these questions which go to the heart of whether he misled the parliament yesterday. Given that the independent investigator found that the member for Dobell provided him with information that is false or misleading, the member for Dobell must explain why there are serious discrepancies in the version of events in the evidence he gave to Fair Work Australia and with his statement to the parliament and with some of his previous public statements, including interviews. One of the key planks of the member for Dobell's statement yesterday-and I will use this as an example-was that the video surveillance footage from the brothels that put charges on his credit card would fail to show him attending the premises. He demanded, 'Get the video surveillance footage,' and therefore we were invited to conclude that it could not possibly have been him. Note: at no time did the member for Dobell deny using prostitutes paid for with union money. What the member for Dobell did not answer was the finding that the majority of credit card charges related to escort services provided off site-not at the premises of prostitutes, not at the brothel. His statement failed to address the crux the Fair Work Australia findings against him that he used the Health Services Union credit card to pay for prostitutes. Yes or no? He has still not denied it. If the member for Dobell is innocent, as he claims, he should make a clear, unambiguous statement that at no time has he used the Health Services Union credit card to pay for prostitutes, whether at a brothel, at his hotel or under any other circumstances. He has not done that. The member for Dobell must also explain the findings that payments for prostitutes were transferred between credit cards in his possession and why he authorised the payments and the transfers between the cards, despite claiming to know at the time of a long standing conspiracy underway to frame him by fixing him up with prostitutes. His claim of a grand conspiracy-this elaborate sting operation-to set him up with prostitutes also directly contradicts his previous claim in August last year: The union reached a settlement with another gentleman who paid back $15,000 in relation to use of credit cards at an escort agency. radio That claim was flatly denied by the alleged gentleman and later proven to be false after an audit of the union's finances. It was revealed that the $15,000 repaid by the gentleman in question related to an unauthorised pay rise. The member for Dobell's statement to the House reeks of recent invention, for he made no mention of this grand conspiracy against him during his statements at the time. He made no mention of Mr Marco Bolano, whom he identified yesterday as the leader of what had to be a 'Mission: Impossible' team that undertook this most mysterious of conspiracy plots. The member for Dobell must explain why he can claim Mr Bolano began his alleged covert vendetta against him even though Mr Bolano claims not to of have started work at the Health Services Union until many months after the first charges for prostitutes appeared on the credit card accounts of the member for Dobell. The member for Dobell's allegation that Mr Bolano has been complicit in a conspiracy that has included what must have been illegal conduct-if the member for Dobell is to be believed-is a very serious allegation indeed. The member for Dobell has raised these allegations of alleged dishonest and criminal conduct by Mr Bolano, and he has a responsibility to substantiate these claims with at least a shred of evidence. None was provided. Another key plank of the member for Dobell's statement yesterday was that these alleged conspirators must have cloned his mobile phone to spoof calls to the escort agencies. The member for Dobell cannot stand in the parliament and make such outlandish claims without providing any evidence to support them. According to security experts consulted by various media organisations overnight, this cloning requires highly sophisticated techniques, equipment that is illegal in the hands of the public and would require a very high level of technical knowledge-like a government surveillance agency-as well as access to the member for Dobell's mobile phone and use of that mobile phone at the same place as the member for Dobell used it before and after the alleged cloned calls, because the records show that he was making calls at about that time. Not one shred of evidence was provided by the member for Dobell to support this allegation that somehow the members of the HSU are operating a high-tech illegal surveillance operation-the likes of which the CIA would be hard pressed to do. The member for Dobell may as well declare that aliens hacked his phone and then challenge others to disprove his hypothesis. Another claim in his statement yesterday, relating to the reporting of the saga, was that Fairfax journalists published 12 articles without seeking his response. Yet Sydney Morning Herald investigative reporter Kate MCClymont has rejected this claim and last night detailed extensive attempts to contact the member for Dobell and also revealed that he has sent her text messages on occasion complimenting her articles. Ms MCClymont described his claim that Fairfax made no attempt to contact him as crazy-yet this is what he said to the parliament. The parliament deserves an honest explanation. The parliament is not becoming judge and jury on this matter. Indeed, what the parliament deserves is a statement that is neither false nor misleading. And I find it hypocritical beyond description for the government to accuse the opposition of abandoning the presumption of innocence when the only judgments made against the member for Dobell have been by the Prime Minister and her government. The Prime Minister said in late April that 'a line has been crossed', and then she acted to suspend the member for Dobell from the Labor Party. Clearly, the Prime Minister passed judgment upon the member for Dobell and, on her version of events, concluded that he was no longer a fit or proper person to sit in the Labor Party parliamentary caucus. If he is entitled to the presumption of innocence, why not invite him back into the Labor Party until he has had his day in court? After the member for Dobell's statement yesterday, the Prime Minister said overnight: 'I made a decision and I explained at the time about respect for the parliament and there was accumulation of issues here'-so much for the embrace of the presumption of innocence. The Prime Minister passed judgment upon the member for Dobell as being unfit to sit within the federal Labor caucus. She has found him unfit to be preselected for Dobell as the Labor Party's candidate at the next election. If he is entitled to the presumption of innocence and entitled to his day in court, invite him back into the Labor Party caucus and preselect him as the member for Dobell for the next election. This is hypocrisy on a grand scale. The Prime Minister passed judgment on the member for Dobell and found him unfit to remain in the Labor Party; yet Labor simultaneously argues that the parliament cannot examine or scrutinise his statement in debates. Four times Labor voted to gag debate on the member for Dobell's statement and conduct. This parliament deserves an explanation. (Time expired)",49
125,Mr WILKIE,IMPORTANCE," This place matters. This place has the power to make decisions that will see people live or die. This has place has the power to make decisions that will allow people to prosper or to go broke. We should be leaders in the community. The behaviour in this place by all of the members should be absolutely beyond reproach. How sorry is it, then, that so many Australians are currently appalled at the behaviour in this parliament of politicians and of politics? I suppose this is not new. In fact, some analysis done by the Australian National University between 1993 and 2010 of the public's perception of the qualities of politicians shows the quality of knowledgeability falling from 36 to 21 per cent. The quality of strong leadership falls from 30 to 15 per cent, halving. The quality of honesty more than halves, from 19 to nine per cent. The quality of trustworthiness falls from 16 to nine per cent and the quality of inspiration falls from 13 to nine per cent. Those figures that I have quoted are from 2010. I would hate to think what the public's view is of this place and those in it right now. There are obviously many reasons for this. Some people believe the problem is that we have a hung parliament, a power-sharing parliament. But power-sharing parliaments are in place in many countries where they work very well and they are not seen as the source of all of the country's problems. In fact, this power-sharing parliament has proven-despite all of the predictions and all of the commentary-to be remarkably stable, productive and reformist. No, the problem is the behaviour of people, not the numbers in this place. Neither side of the chamber is beyond guilt in this regard. There is no doubt that some of the decisions of this government have mightily disappointed people and in part account for the poor showing of the government in the polls. Dear to my heart, of course, is the reneging on the deal for meaningful poker machine reform back in January. But the opposition is also guilty of bringing this place into disrepute. I think behaviour of the opposition has been overly negative and destructive and regrettably short on policy details. Now we have the behaviour of the Speaker and of the member for Dobell. So what should we do about the alleged behaviour of the Speaker and the member for Dobell? I think that dealing with those two is the easiest problem this parliament has because, at the end of the day, we must let proper process run its course. That is all we need to do. Let proper process run its course. This is a time for cool heads. This is the time for the members of the parliament to show true leadership and cool heads and let proper process run its true course. Let us not forget that both the Speaker and the member for Dobell should be accorded the principles of natural justice. They are genuinely innocent until proven guilty and they remain that way unless and until they are able to stand in a properly constituted court where they can defend themselves and where they may or may not be found guilty of an offence. Let us not forget that, according to the Constitution, the Speaker and the member for Dobell are eligible to sit and work in this place, and that remains the case in law by the Constitution of this land, until they are found guilty of a criminal offence punishable by 12 months or more in prison or unless they become an undischarged bankrupt or face some other matter such as a pecuniary interest with the Commonwealth Public Service. The point I am pursuing is that, according to natural justice and the Constitution, the member for Dobell has a right to sit in this place and to go about his work. Let us not forget that under the Crimes Act it is actually a serious criminal offence for anyone to intimidate to the extent of interfering with someone's political liberty. I go so far as to say that some members in the community, and even the in this place, could stand accused of intimidating to that degree. More broadly, a number of parliamentary mechanisms might be brought to bear to help us through this difficult period. The obvious one is that we should be having a parliamentary debate about the findings against the member for Dobell by Fair Work Australia. I condemn the government for at every opportunity delaying the member for Dobell making a statement and, more recently, doing whatever it can to prevent a parliamentary debate about the findings against the member for Dobell. It is wrong and it is lousy politics. This whole matter could have been addressed long ago if the member for Dobell had been allowed to stand up and have his say. We could put a lot of the issues currently on the boil to bed if the government allowed a parliamentary debate about it. I think it is to the credit the opposition and to the crossbenchers that we have done what we can to bring on such a debate. Yes, there may be a case for references to the Privileges Committee and, on the face of it, there are charges to answer. The Privileges Committee would be an appropriate place to look into some of those accusations. I am pleased to have seconded the member for Lyne's motion that seeks to censure the member for Dobell. I note that the member for Lyne has done entirely the right thing, focusing the censure not on the allegations or the findings against the member for Dobell before he entered the parliament but on things that he has done since entering the parliament which this parliament should find unacceptable, in particular the time it has taken him to publicly respond to the allegations against him and the allegation that he has not cooperated fully with Fair Work Australia since he has been a member of this place. I do not agree with suspension and I will not support any move by the opposition to suspend the member for Dobell. While we might censure him for specific behaviour during his time as a member of this place, I believe that to suspend a member is ultimately to pass judgement on and to sit as judge and jury of him. That is not our role. Hopefully, as a result of this kerfuffle over the member for Dobell and perhaps with regard to the Speaker, we could look more broadly at other things that we could do. Some people say that the constitutional threshold that you are not eligible to sit in this place if you have been found guilty of any offence punishable by one or more years of imprisonment is too high. I do not know, but why not have a debate about it? Why not have a discussion about it? Twelve months might be good. Maybe it should be two years. Maybe it should be three months. But of we should not be afraid to have a discussion about it. If after a discussion we think it is set at the wrong place then the government should consider trying to bring about changes to it. What about other indiscretions that might be added to the list? The member for New England quite rightly explored in his speech this afternoon that perhaps there are other things a member might do that should mean he or she is ineligible to sit in this place. I think there should be a code of conduct, and for the life of me I cannot see why, after all of the attempts to have such a code, there is not one. What are we afraid of in this place? The member for Isaacs has identified some problems and difficulties with some of these mechanisms, but surely we have the goodwill and the nous to solve those problems. There is no logical reason why we cannot have a code of conduct. And what on earth has happened to the integrity commissioner? This is a rather historic document now that I have: it is my eightpage written agreement with the Prime Minister over the establishment of a parliamentary integrity commissioner. It still has not been done and it should be done. In closing, most of the people I am mixing with on the street are sick to death of this issue. They are sick to death of the fight and the argy-bargy that is going on in this place at the moment. They want us to just sort it out and move on. They want the government to get on and run the country and they want the opposition to get on and prove it is a credible alternative government. I think that is what we should now be focusing on. Mr STEPHEN JONES (Throsby) (16:39): I welcome this matter of public importance that has been brought to us today by the member for Lyne. I think, in an unusual precedent, it is supported by all members of this place. It is a measured and principled approach to matters of current public controversy and it enables members of this place to set out the proper role of parliament when questions are raised about another member of parliament, particularly when those questions go to potential criminal proceedings. I start at the outset by stating that I am deeply distressed, as I am sure every member of this place is, by the findings that were recently handed down in a report by Fair Work Australia into the affairs of the Health Services Union of Australia. I am deeply concerned as an Australian and I am deeply concerned as a member of this place, but I am also deeply concerned as somebody who has dedicated over 15 years of his life to trade union movement of this country, a movement whose values and principles I love and whose best traditions I seek to uphold. Anybody who holds those values and who has that deep affection for those traditions cannot look on with anything but deep concern about the misuse of members' money and the abuse of processes such as have been alleged to have been found in the Fair Work Australia report. But the issue not whether or not we condone the behaviour that has been found by Fair Work Australia. Of course that is not the issue before us today. I do not think there is one member of this House that would condone that alleged behaviour. The question is not even whether we are convinced by the statement that has been recently given in this place by the member for Dobell. I am sure there are many people in this place who were convinced by the statement that was given by the member for Dobell and many people who were not convinced by it. But that is not the question for us in this House today. The question that we must consider is what the role of parliament is, and that takes us straight to the Constitution. Make no bones about it, the matters that are being debated in this matter of public importance and the matters that have been strewn all over the pages of every newspaper in this country for the last few months and have been raised in just about every motion for suspension of standing orders and other motions before this House by the member for Sturt go straight to the heart of the Constitution. There is a great danger in the strategy that has been proposed by those opposite. It goes to who gets to decide who sits in parliament. Make no bones about it, the whole strategy that is being directed by the those opposite is about who gets to decide who sits in parliament. We should be under no illusion about what is driving those opposite. What is driving those opposite is an attempt to force the resignation of the member for Dobell. That is what is driving the opposition's every breath, their every strategy, their every tactic in this place-to try and force the resignation of the member for Dobell. This has been admitted quite recently by the member for North Sydney in a Press Club address. It has in fact been admitted by the member for Sturt, with his numerous attempts to have the member for Dobell excluded from this House. That is what is at the heart of their every strategy, and we should be careful about that. I have always adopted the principle, as a law student, a practising lawyer and a trade unionist, that what we permit to be done to the least of us is what we condone for those we revere. At this point in time it might be allegations made against the member for Dobell, but this parliament has had before it a great number of controversies, whether controversies about race, about gender, about sexual orientation or about political values. They are the proper debates that should be had in this place but, if we as a collective of men and women representing different electorates and different political persuasions are able to come in here and form a majority, the effect of that majority being to subvert the electors of a particular electorate by excluding their member of parliament from sitting in and voting in this place, we are tearing up the Constitution. That is what we are doing. We are subverting the democratic right of electors to determine who they choose as their elected member of parliament to sit in this place and participate in debates and votes of this House, which determine the laws of this land. Have no doubt about it, and I say this to all of those in this House: what we permit to be done to the least of us is what we condone for those we revere. There is a grave danger in the strategy that is being adopted by the opposition in relation to this matter. Upholding the Constitution is normally the role of conservatives, who stand in this place and say they uphold the Constitution. I stand here today as one of the few members in this debate who have said, 'It is our role parliamentarians to uphold the Constitution.' I will go to some of the suggestions which have been made by the member for Denison. There may be some value in some of the suggestions that he has made. The framers of our Constitution ensured that there was a separation of powers which distributed power within the Commonwealth and between the various arms of parliament. They framed a Constitution which ensured that parliament was elected by the people, to make the laws; that the executive was elected by the parliament to administer those laws; that the courts were established by the Constitution to ensure that this parliament operates within its constitutional powers; that the laws that are subsequently made by this parliament are upheld and do not infringe citizens' rights vis-a-vis the Constitution; and that when citizens have objections or concerns about their rights they have a place to go to to have those rights determined by an independent court of law. Courts themselves have expertise governed by the rules of evidence, which do not apply in this place. Those rules of evidence and rules of precedent have evolved over many centuries to ensure that both the defendant and the prosecutor are accorded every fairness that should be accorded to them. There are rules and precedents that do not apply in this place, and that is why we have established courts, to adjudicate upon the sorts of allegations that have been made against the member for Dobell. Let us be frank: those allegations of one sort or another could be made against any one of us. Allegations were made against a member of the Liberal Party only yesterday concerning his affairs before he became a member of parliament. It is not the role of this parliament to adjudicate upon those. Although we might all have our opinions, it is the role of a properly constituted court as under our Constitution to determine and adjudicate upon those disputes. It is important that parliament stays within its constitutional confines, it is important that courts stay within their constitutional confines and it is important that we as members of parliament stay within our constitutional confines. It maintains not only a balance between this parliament and other parliaments within the Federation but also the liberties of each and every Australian citizen. Some suggestions have been made during the debate that we should alter the rules around which a member of parliament can be ejected because of their behaviour-whether the current two sanctions are sufficient and whether bankruptcy and certain criminal convictions are sufficient. I agree that a debate on these issues is a worthy one for us to have but, ultimately, it is not for members in this place to adjudicate on whether the current constitutional provisions are sufficient. It is for the people of Australia, through a properly constituted referendum, to determine whether or not we should alter our Constitution. If members of this place believe that that is a worthy matter to take the people of Australia, then so be it. We can have a debate about that. But it is not for us solely to determine that. That role lies with the people of Australia. These are important matters but, as the member for Denison has observed just now, there are many who do not live and breathe the affairs of this place and who must scratch their heads and wonder about the amount of time that these matters have occupied in this place. They may say they are important, but they may wonder whether they are the most important things that we should be occupying our parliamentary time with. I for one believe we should be spending a lot more time debating the economy, the future of our industries, the future for our young people, skills and education, and our place in the region. That is not to diminish this matter of public importance, but I think we have spent enough time talking about it today.",53
126,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE," Order! The discussion on this matter has concluded. NA Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 1) Bill 2012 Report from Federation Chamber Bill returned from Federation Chamber without amendment, appropriation message having been reported; certified copy of the bill presented. Mrs ELLIOT (RichmondParliamentary Secretary for Trade) (16:50): I present corrections to the explanatory memorandum to this bill. Ordered that this bill be considered immediately. Bill agreed to. Third Reading Mrs ELLIOT (Richmondto Parliamentary Secretary for Trade) (16:50): by leave-I move: That this bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. Tax Laws Amendment (Medicare Levy and Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2012 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Mr TONY SMITH (Casey) (16:51): The Tax Laws Amendment (Medicare Levy and Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2012 was introduced on 10 May. It is a bill that is introduced every year following the budget. It is entirely non-controversial, unless my friend on the other side has a different view. It is a bill that merely indexes the Medicare levy and Medicare levy surcharge lowincome thresholds for individuals, families and pensioners. Every year this legislation is necessary to ensure that those thresholds are maintained in real dollar terms-that is, so they are not eroded by the CPI. The Assistant Treasurer introduced this bill, as I said, just couple of weeks ago. The explanatory memorandum outlines the increases in those thresholds that are CPI linked. I will run through them very briefly. For individuals the threshold will be increased from $18,839 to $19,404. For families, the threshold will be increased from $31,789 to $32,743 and from $2,919 to $3,007 for each dependent child or student. In a similar vein, for pensioners the increase is from $30,439 to $30,451. As I said, this is a non-controversial piece of legislation. It is required with every budget. I have had the pleasure of carrying this bill on behalf of the opposition every year we have been in opposition, I think. It is normally my friend from the other side, the member for Blair, who speaks on behalf of the government but on this occasion I notice it is the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer. I commend this bill to the House.",58
127,Mr RIPOLL,BILLS," It is a pleasure to be also speaking on the Tax Laws Amendment (Medicare Levy and Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2012. As we heard from the member for Casey, this is a bill that comes to the House every year after the budget. It is a procedural bill in the sense that it just moves the low-income thresholds for the calculation of the Medicare levy surcharge for low-income earners in line with movements of the consumer price index. Of course it needs to be done every year to adjust those thresholds to ensure that people are not unfairly charged a higher levy in the case where their incomes would just creep over that threshold bracket. So in line with those movements we are adjusting those, and data on this has been adjusted every year since 1996. It does receive bipartisan support. It is good to see in this House, particularly in this area, that bipartisan support is given. Some a financial impacts are carried with the bill, but they are ones which are obviously good in terms of adjusting people's costs of living, making sure that we do not contribute to people's extra costs of living through any surcharge that they might receive. The Medicare system and the Medicare levy surcharge have operated very well in this country for a very long time, and they are based on the ability of people to pay. It is a fair and equitable system reflecting that people contribute either directly through the Medicare levy or through the Medicare levy surcharge if they are high-income earners. We also take into consideration household incomes. People who have the ability to pay also contribute privately through the private health insurance system. There is a very generous rebate for people who fall in those categories. It is part of a broader scope of work that this Labor government has done in the area of health, which as a particular portfolio area covers a wide scope of things, whether it is ensuring the long-term sustainability of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, whether it is the long-term sustainability of the Medicare system, whether it is the long-term sustainability of our hospital systems or whether it is-also very important to note in this opportunity provided by this bill-the long-term sustainability of the private health insurance system. So all of those systems combine to make sure that we actually have and maintain in this country a health system that is first-class, employs best practice and is best in the world by any measure-a health system that is all-encompassing and really does give people here in Australia access to a standard of health care that is the envy of every other economy. I think it fits in well with all of the that we are having in this place at this particular time, when there is global turbulence around global economic matters and when there are pressure points being applied in so many different economies. You will see those pressure points being reflected back onto the health system, back on people's capacity to pay and back on the levies and surcharges that they might pay in other countries and other jurisdictions. But the good news here is that at home, locally, for people's budgets when they sit around the kitchen table, we have made sure-and we are thankful that we have the support of the opposition-that there is no bracket creep in this area and that people pay only the levies that they rightfully ought in terms of making sure they are covered for their medical expenses. I commend the bill to the House and commend the minister for the work that he has done.",59
128,Mr BRADBURY,BILLS,"Lindsay-Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (16:58): I would like to thank the members who have taken part in the debate on Tax Laws Amendment (Medicare Levy and Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2012. This bill increases the Medicare levy low-income thresholds for individuals and families in line with increases in the consumer price index. The individual threshold amount is to be increased from $18,839 to $19,404. The level of the family income threshold is to be increased from $31,789 to $32,743. The Medicare levy lowincome threshold for pensioners below age pension age will also increase from $30,439 to $30,451 so that individuals in this cohort do not pay the Medicare levy when they do not have a tax liability. The low-income threshold in the Medicare levy surcharge provisions is similarly increased. This change ensures that a low-income member of a family will continue to be exempt from the debates Medicare levy and the Medicare levy surcharge. The increases apply to the 201112 year of income. I commend this bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading",60
129,Mr BRADBURY,BILLS,Lindsay-Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (17:00): by leave-I move: That this bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. Skills Australia Amendment (Australian Workforce and Productivity Agency) Bill 2012 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.,60
130,Ms LEY,BILLS," I rise today to speak on the Skills Australia Amendment (Australian Workforce and Productivity Agency) Bill 2012. This is a bill that seeks to establish the workforce and productivity agency in accordance with an announcement made by the government in their 2011-12 budget. This agency will take over from Skills Australia and will expand the mandate of Skills Australia. By way of background, as I said, the agency was announced in the 2011-12 budget, and the budget indicated that the new agency would develop sectoral workforce development plans, undertake research, consult industry and disseminate information on workforce planning issues. The agency would also have responsibility for administering the national workforce development fund, a fund worth a total of $558 million over four years and incorporating the $200 million critical skills investment fund announced in the budget. So this bill is giving effect to a budget announcement, but the Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations announced in September last year that the government would bring forward the work of the agency. An interim board was appointed and it commenced on 1 October 2011, nine months ahead of schedule. In a speech to the National Press Club the minister attributed the urgency of the new arrangements to 'rapid change in key industry sectors and workforce pressures exerted by the 'patchwork economy'. I am trying to give the House a sense of the patchwork nature of the introduction of this bill and these measures. A minister made an announcement. Like a lot of the government's announcements, it was designed to give the impression that, No. 1, the government cares about you and your future, and, No. 2, it is doing something to make that future more pleasurable and productive-in this case, in the area of skills. But the coalition's concern about this bill is that, while there is a lot of fluff and activity around the edges, when you drill down, what is really going to change in this area? In any case, how can the government create the productivity and jobs that it talks about so often? The Prime Minister rattles off skills, job creation, productivity et as if these things are happening in the Australian economy with a wave of her magic wand; but those who understand economics know that it is a productive, confident small business sector that enables people and organisations to invest, to look to the future and to have the courage and the faith-two things they do not really have when it comes to this government. To go back to Skills Australia: it was, as we know, a creation of the Rudd Labor government. Just four years on, Labor looks like it believes it has already passed its useby date. Skills Australia was a core component of the government's Skilling for the Future policy, which had a total price tag of $1.9 billion, with Skills Australia costing $19.6 million to set up. I think it costs about $5 million a year to run. This bill appropriates $25 million over three years. You can already see with this succession of ad hoc announcements and the way things are being cobbled together that there is some empire building going on. Clearly the government is indicating with this bill, this initiative, the speech by the minister in the Press Club last year and bringing the whole agenda forward nine months that nothing is really quite working and that Skills Australia has not achieved what it was set up to do. Its mission in its own words on the Skills Australia website is: To provide independent and high quality advice to ensure the government's investment in education and training promotes the development of a highly skilled workforce, increases workforce participation (especially among less advantaged groups), meets the needs of industry and increases Australia's productivity. That is an enormous, sweeping scope. I am not particularly critical of Skills Australia. I have met with them on several occasions, and they have produced some good cetera documents. They have produced some good research and have highlighted the challenges facing a diverse and changing economy in terms of its productivity, its future and its employment participation. They have been a good small organisation dedicated to this research and with the level of expertise to do these things. So it has done a very good job and has provided comprehensive advice to government. The failure does not really lie with Skills Australia; it rests with the government-a government perhaps unwilling to heed the advice provided by Skills Australia in publications such as Australian workforce futures: a national workforce development strategy and Skills for prosperity-a roadmap for vocational education and training. Both of these are highly comprehensive documents making practical and achievable suggestions to boost skills and, ultimately, employment; yet the government prefers to focus on what makes for the best media grab as opposed to what makes a sound platform for our nation's future economic development. This is a government that will be remembered for its training debacles. There was the highly vaunted Productivity Places Program where 31.8 per cent of job seekers dropped out prior to completing their courses. I would like to know whether the government has any expectations for improved completion rates for these courses. I could speak all day regarding the failings the Productivity Places Program. However, I will keep it short and restrict myself to reminding the House about the rorting of the program by some providers and the fact that there was no consideration given to just how many security guards and certificate II qualified retail assistants the economy needed at that time. Let us face it: this government has let down job seekers-and not just with foolhardy programs such as the Productivity Places Program. Thousands of job seekers have found themselves forced onto a training treadmill at the behest of this government. With the virtual abolition of Work for the Dole, job seekers are being pushed into training for their mutual obligation activity. Yet these courses are not leading to real employment outcomes. The point has been reiterated by Andrew Forrest, in particular, regarding Indigenous Australians, some of whom have multiple certificates yet have failed to find real jobs. We need a training system that provides Australians with real job prospects. This new agency sees another three members added to the existing board of Skills Australia-or formally added, because they were actually added in September last year-and of course additional funding. But I turn to the membership of the board to note that the unions are represented with two members. There is no representative from the training sector, and this point was remarked upon by training providers in their submission to the Senate inquiry. Where this new agency really differs from Skills Australia is that it will have responsibility for the administration of a $558 million Workforce Development Fund plus a $20 million fund to allocate to unions and employer organisations. So, again, the government has managed to find a slush fund for their union friends. Given the recent and highly publicised mismanagement of union of funds, I find it outrageous that they would be so blatant about funding their union cronies. I turn now to the National Workforce Development Fund. This $558 million fund is intended to provide a co-contribution for training. The government intends that this fund will train 130,000 people, with an estimated allocation of $4,292 per person. The National Workforce and Productivity Agency will supposedly identify the key areas of skills shortage for the direction of these training dollars. I am concerned, however, that for some employers the required contribution may still put training out of reach. If you are a small business and you are asked to make a 30 per cent contribution-I think that is the requested contribution under these rules-to the training effort, it just might be too much for you as a small business. It might not be too much for a much larger business to put in their required contribution of 50 per cent, but I do not see this as being particularly small business friendly. Given that there is a forecast training shortfall of more than 250,000 skilled employees over the next five years, it will be an increased challenge to ensure a match between skills expansion and work opportunities. It is vital that training produce the skills that industry is prepared to This will not happen if the agenda is warped by the government having to keep its favourite stakeholders happy. On the topic of training, I raise something that many business owners have raised with me as I have travelled the country. Many do not see the need for their staff to spend months undertaking entire certificate-level qualifications. Instead, their preference would be for the employee to undertake certain skills sets-modules or components of various courses. We do need to give far greater consideration to flexibility in training, and employers should be able to tailor the training needs of their organisation as best suits them. This may also grant us a greater capacity to improve productivity and go some way towards meeting the forecast shortfall of 250,000 skilled employees by focussing instead on the particular skills sets they need to undertake their work. So, while I recognise that the OECD measurements are made on the basis of qualifications completed, there does need to be a recognition within the measurement and within the datasets which are looked at and which feed into government policy that there is not always a need for a complete qualification and that in up-skilling or simply getting the required skills for a job you may not need a completed qualification. When the government demands entire qualifications, I have some sympathy because that, as I said, is the OECD measurement request. But they need to do better; they need to be able to demonstrate what is really going on in the training market. The Senate inquiry submission from the Queensland government highlighted that there is evidence that the purchasing of training by both the states and the Commonwealth is fragmenting skills investment and duplicating effort and that pay for. this government could even consider specifically earmarking funds for the states. Again the Labor government's current arrangements show just how cosy the Labor government is with the union movement and how well it is looking after them with the proceeds of the funds allocated under this bill and the Skills Australia mandate. The Queensland government made a very good point, because if a Commonwealth government and a state government both allocate taxpayer dollars for the training effort-the qualifications task-the absolute No. 1 requirement that we as the custodians of those dollars should have is that the training task not be fragmented and that taxpayers get good value for money. I have heard examples as I have travelled around and talked to state training authorities-and I pay tribute to them. While I recognise the need for a federal body of this type, state training authorities and training and skills organisations know what is going on in their own states, and they provide valuable information-and, of course, they provide it to the Commonwealth as well. But I have heard stories of these organisations saying, 'We turned around and saw that, under one of these Commonwealth federal programs, money had been allocated to something we knew nothing about and we, unaware that federal dollars were flowing also, might have been sending money in that direction.' On the ground, that does not work. It does not work for the employer or the training provider, it does not particularly work for the consumer who is going and doing the studying and it certainly does not work as value for money for taxpayers. Much of the funding from the Workforce Development Fund that will be administered under the legislation is old funding in a new guise. There was, for example, the $200 million from the Critical Skills Investment Fund. The fund was short-lived, but the money has been folded into this fund. Of course, when a government has such abysmal economic credentials, it has to find money somewhere to make announcements and grab that feel-good media opportunity. What could be better than rolling over a newly created fund and making it look like new money? This government does seem to hope that the electorate has limited memories of this sort of thing and does not realise that it is not all bill. new. With the Workforce Development Fund, the government is attempting merely to reuse and recycle. I certainly hope that this agency will help boost our national productivity and create real employment opportunities. Unemployment is tipped to increase to 5.5 per cent in the 2012-13 budget outlook. Regrettably, as with its misunderstanding of the needs of the vocational, education and training sector, the government has done the dodgy on employment services providers and the newly unemployed by slashing almost $200 million from Job Services Australia. The majority of this $200 million consists of savings from slashing assistance to the newly unemployed, or those classified in the jargon as stream 1. In August 2011, 24,718 stream 1 job seekers had been unemployed for 12 months or more. This figure will only worsen if Labor cuts the funding to those job seekers. Everybody recognises that, while the government may describe the unemployment figure as 'notionally lower than some others', the figures are quite resistant and it is quite difficult if you are unemployed to get a job. Therefore if you have been out of work and you are a stream 1 client of a job services provider you have already been out of work for at least 13 weeks, and so to pull back on the resources to get stream 1 clients back and engaged in the workforce quickly could well work out to be a disastrous mistake. I am concerned that Labor are condemning Australians to languish on welfare unnecessarily. Their failure to new support a system of early intervention is to the detriment of those who need assistance in finding a job. I also believe that this government's track record in overspending and under-delivering is a real concern. I am also concerned by the language and the announcements surrounding this particular We cannot let this government get away with talking up its own unemployment figures when we consider the disastrous figures for youth unemployment. There are areas in my electorate in western New South Wales where youth unemployment-that is, unemployment among 15to 19-year-oldsis about 25 per cent. There are areas in the northern suburbs of Melbourne where youth unemployment is closer to 41 per cent. No government can ignore those figures, yet in the last budget we never saw youth unemployment announced, mentioned or tackled-not once. The rate is, I think, 40.8 per cent in Broadmeadows, and there are areas of Western Sydney where it is up towards 30 per cent. I will take this government seriously on its economic credentials on jobs when it takes seriously the shocking level of youth unemployment in this country. To go back to the bill itself and make a few remarks, I did mention that Skills Australia is transitioning to the new agency. It has announced in its business plan how it will do that it will include having consultations with stakeholders, developing operational procedures and setting up systems to support the administration of the fund. Let us just hope that there is not too much bureaucratic staffing to no particular end or too many announcements et cetera around that particular part of the transition to by the new fund. It is only a matter of adding some members to the board, changing the name and changing some of the tasks. The Parliamentary Secretary for Higher Education and Skills described the rationale for the proposed new agency in her speech to parliament. She said that it consisted of two points: industry and union partners had called for an increased focus on workplace productivity and better linkages between skills funding and industry needs, and Skills Australia had recommended a new partnership approach to workforce development involving government, industry and enterprises. They are fairly innocent statements. I wonder why the entire program had to be brought forward by nine months because of some urgent productivity agenda, which was not particularly well identified by the minister at the time. When the Senate committee considered this bill they received nine submissions. Overall, some of those submissions were quite welcoming of the amendments, but I think we should drill down and look in a bit more detail at what those submissions and the committee's then considerations tell us about this bill. They noted that there was a shift in focus from training to workforce development. I think that is just a question of language, as is the change of name of the particular body and the expanded membership of the body. A nine-member board is quite large and could in some circumstances be considered unwieldy-but maybe not in this case. There is a new role in providing research and analysis and a new role in the provision of advice on Commonwealth funding. I note that the Australian Chamber of Commerce as well as Industry and Restaurant Catering Australia argued in their submissions that the new requirement for employee representation should be matched a requirement for employer representation. That is really quite important because the bill says that, in making up the new board of the Workforce and Productivity Agency, the membership has to have certain qualifications and characteristics. The members of the board must have between them experience in academia, the provision of educational training, economics, industry-and critically but not unsurprisingly-the representation of employees. The ACCI submission, while not particularly arguing with that, did wonder why this final requirement for the representation of employees was not matched with a similar requirement for the representation of employers. The bill requires, I acknowledge, that there be industry representation. But industry representation is not defined. I think that unions would describe themselves as representative of industry, and, if we have those who represent employees on the board, we should also have those who represent employers. The recommendations from the Chamber of Commerce and Industry and from Restaurant and Catering Australia were that this proposed paragraph be changed from specifying the representation of industry to specifying the representation of employers so as to add clarity and resolve to an apparent inconsistency. I am not holding my breath that that will happen, so I simply ask the government that, when they move ahead, they bear that statement in mind and that, accordingly, the industry representation on the board be very much focused on the needs of and the environment facing employers, particularly today. In its submission, the Australian Council for Private Education and Training called for a training sector representative in the membership of the agency. One of the things specified was that the board member was required to have experience in educational training, but that does not amount to specifying a training provider-someone who is at the cutting edge of providing training in the real world. I think that is a huge missing level of expertise that we are not demanding as a requirement of a member of the board of this new body. The proposed new agency will continue to have the same functions as Skills Australia in providing advice to the minister on Australia's current, emerging and future workforce development and workforce skills needs. The bill proposes two additional primary functions. These are: to provide advice to the minister on improving the productivity of the Australian workforce; and to provide advice to the minister on the allocation of Commonwealth funding, including through the National Workforce Development Fund, to address Australia's workforce development and skill needs and improve its productivity. So this board and this agency will have quite widespread powers if they recommending how to allocate the funding in the National Workforce Development Fund. The New South Wales Department of Education and Communities, in noting that, also noted the potential for duplication and overlap in this function, given that the Australian Productivity Commission also undertakes research on productivity. So if this body is required to advise the minister on productivity needs in the Australian economy, or how best to maximise those, why would it not make use of the Productivity Commission? Is duplication? Is there overlap? I do hope not. In advising on allocation of funding, which was the second task that I mentioned, the agency will provide 'advice on the allocation of Commonwealth … funding including the National Workforce Development Fund'. But the 2012 budget papers state that the agency will be responsible for administering the National Workforce Development Fund, which is a very direct role in allocating funding-much more direct than the wording of the bill suggests. It is worth noting that the government needs to correct that inconsistency. General advice on the allocation of Commonwealth funding, as this bill says, is incredibly broad and general, and we have to remember that there are other agencies and institutions that are well equipped to do this; we have to be careful about giving any particular agency powers that are too widespread. The submission from the New South Wales Department of Education and Communities points out that the use of the word 'including' leaves scope for the agency to provide advice on Commonwealth funding more broadly, and it is not limited to providing advice on this fund. That is an inconsistency that should be are corrected. There is a new, additional function, which is to 'assess research relating to improving the productivity of the Australian workforce'. The wording of this function again differs from what is in the budget papers because, while the budget papers stated that the Australian Workforce and Productivity Agency would undertake research, the bill refers only to the assessment of research. So we need to be careful. We have increased the funding to this organisation, we have changed its name, we have widened its scope, we have increased the board there membership and we have given it, it seems, quite widespread powers, and the empire is beginning to build. We need to be careful that we did not continue to allocate scarce government dollars and scarce government resources to functions that could well be performed by other agencies. In fact, I make the point that these functions should be being performed within the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations. To have the Skills Australia body, soon to change its name, sitting to one side-why are we not confident in our Public Service that we would not task some of the smart graduates that joined the Public Service with some of this research and some of this assessing of research and with coming up with some ideas? It would make for a public service that has good career pathways, is an interesting place to be, and attracts the best and brightest graduates. But if we take all of those sorts of tasks away from the rank and file public service and put them out in statutory bodies or authorities to one side, is not giving a very good message about the quality of our Public Service. I have a great deal of faith in the quality of our Public Service, having been a member of it years and years ago, and I know we have some really smart people there. I talked about the financial implications and the need to be very cautious about those costs increasing. In conclusion, I say that bill seeks to formalise arrangements that have been in place since late 2011. The coalition does not seek to oppose this billfrom 1 July the Australian Workforce and Productivity Agency will replace Skills Australia-but I say, on behalf of the coalition, that we will be watching very closely to see that this does not become yet another clumsy, inflexible organisation that is dishing out money to favourite people in favourite circumstances while ignoring sound, sensible advice from state and local agencies that really understand what the skilling and the workforce needs are of the people they represent in their varying and diverse parts of Australia. I thank the House.  Before commencing my speech, Madam Deputy Speaker Rishworth, can I say it is an honour to be speaking in front of you in the chair. I do not think I have done that before. I rise to voice my strong support, like the previous speaker, for the Skills Australia Amendment (Australian Workforce and Productivity Agency) Bill 2012. This is a bill that will improve long-term national workforce planning and development with the creation of the Australian Workforce and Productivity Agency, and by doing so it will help address skills shortages across the country. As anyone who looks around the country knows, there are tough times in some patches of Australia. Some parts of Australia-particularly those focused on tourism, like North Queensland, and other it parts-are doing it a bit tough, while obviously other parts are experiencing boom times, particularly those connected with the resources sector or servicing the resources sector. This legislation is a plan of action that builds on the strengths of Skills Australia and ensures that government, industry associations, industry skills councils, the unions-who have a proud role to play in this-and employers all work together to achieve the best outcome for industry. This bill recognises the vital significance of skilled workers in our country by taking action to give industry a stronger voice, and making sure our investment in training is going where it is needed most. I now address a different Deputy Speaker, Mr Mitchell, whom I am appearing before for the first time as well. He looks a little bit different to the previous deputy speaker, but it is an honour, nevertheless, to be appearing before him. I cannot overstate the importance of skilled workers. Despite the efforts of the rump of a few Work Choices warriors opposite, the reality is that Australia will never ever compete with Asia, Africa, South America and even some Eastern European nations when it comes to low wages. Skilled workers have built Australia and they are desperately needed as we take advantage of a booming resources sector. This has been a proud part of Australian culture. In fact, some might say that what makes Australians who we are is that, arguably since the Harvester case of 1907, we have always given priority to every worker receiving a decent wage. It is funny that when you travel around other parts of the world where productivity is nowhere near as high as ours, you see a lot of half jobs. When I was in the United States last year, I saw jobs we do not have in Australia, half jobs or even threequarter jobs. That is why they have so many people who are employed yet living in poverty. I guess the United States never had its own Harvester case. We know we need more workers for the new jobs expected to be created over the next five years. Modelling commissioned by Skills Australia shows that from now to 2015 Queensland will need an additional 156,000 people with qualifications at the trade level-that is, certificate III or IV. It also shows that Queensland will need an additional 104,000 people with diploma qualifications by 2015. Despite it being a tough time to draw up a balanced budget and deliver a surplus, the Gillard Labor government is facing this challenge head-on with strong investment in skilling workers for tomorrow's jobs. Over five years this government will commit $15.6 billion to drive training and skills development across Australia. Compare that to the last five years of the Howard government when only $9 billion was spent. When you compare those amounts you clearly see the difference in the commitment to workers by a Labor government and a coalition government. The Gillard Labor government has offered Premier Newman more than $1.8 billion to help reform and improve the training system. We are also helping thousands of workers across the Sunshine State-the state that used to be known as the Smart State, but has now gone back to being the Sunshine Stateto undertake further training to meet the skills required by industry through the National Workforce Development Fund. In addition to this, the MySkills website will be expanded, allowing people to get the information they need concerning training and employment opportunities. Like the MySchools website that has been accessed by millions and millions and millions of Australians, and the MyHealth website that is starting to be accepted as a way to access and assess information given to government, we will have the MySkills website. We are also giving $18.3 million to establish three Australian skills centres of excellence. This government is doing what is necessary to break down the barriers so all Australians can obtain the qualifications they need to create a better future for themselves. Obviously the Labor Party is proud of this. We are the party of opportunity. That is why we value education for all, not education just for the privileged. We believe in education for all. I need not look any further than my own electorate to see the benefits of a strong vocational education and training system. I am proud to say that located in Moreton are the Salisbury and Acacia Ridge campuses of SkillsTech Australia. I was recently at SkillsTech Australia in Acacia Ridge with Minister Evans. This is Queensland's largest TAFE institute dedicated to trade and technician training in automotive, building and construction, manufacturing and engineering, electrotechnology sustainable technologies. The automotive workshop is fantastic. They even let me drive a big truck, even though it was on rollers so it did not leave the workshop. have also done some incredible things in powering the workshops and training facilities through lots of solar panels on roof. The institute offers more than 120 training programs for people of all ages including traineeships and apprenticeships, school based programs, preand postapprenticeship programs, diplomas, advanced diplomas and licensing programs. Delivery models include face-to-face teaching, workplace based learning, videoconferencing and learning-all the new ways in which we engage with people and educate them. SkillsTech Australia provides six training centres, with the largest at Morton and Acacia Ridge, now training more than 10,000 students annually. In 2010-11, SkillsTech Australia recorded 170,058 enrolments across all programs, including 377 onshore international students and more than 1,000 offshore in Papua New Guinea. SkillsTech Australia achieves consistently high completion rates. In 2010-11, the overall completion rate across all training modules was 95.82 per cent with 165,739 completions recorded, a completion rate to be proud of. Earlier this month, SkillsTech Australia was named the 2012 registered training organisation of the year at the Manufacturing Skills Queensland awards. SkillsTech Australia also took home the manufacturing vocational education and training teacher of the year and manufacturing Indigenous student of the year awards. On top of this direct recognition, Aluminium Boats Australia director was awarded the industry champion award on the night and SkillsTech Australia delivers all and training for ABA in their workplace. The high-skills approach to training people is coming out of two sites in my electorate, and I have another great They vocational education facility in my electorate, the Yeronga campus of the Metropolitan South Institute of TAFE. the Recently the Metropolitan South Institute of TAFE announced that it would be the first TAFE provider in Queensland to deliver bachelor degrees. This demonstrates Metropolitan South's continued determination to offer innovative training solutions for Queensland students in Moreton. Yeronga TAFE has had a few hiccups because of the emissions from its esmokestacks, but it still has a bright future. Skilled workers are good for Australia and gaining skills is also good for Australians. Having the chance to develop skills makes it easier to find work at any stage of life. The more skills people have, the more likely they are to be employed and work in higherpaying jobs. On average, wages for those without a certificate III qualification are at least around $180 per week lower than those for workers with a certificate III or above qualification. Some workers are missing out on nearly $10,000 in extra wages a year. So these Australians could be earning an extra $400,000, on average, over their working lives if they improved their skills to a certificate III qualification or higher. Australia is taking steps to give many Australians a better job, a better pay packet and better job security-and job security is emerging as a particular concern. Nevertheless, Australia will need more skilled health and community workers, engineers, IT specialists and construction the workers. I am hoping that many of them will be trained at facilities in my electorate. It is imperative that we have the training in place now to deliver these workers in the future. This bill follows calls from industry and union partners for an increased focus on workplace productivity and improved links between skills funding and industry needs. That is what this bill is aimed at doing, and thus I commend it to the House. Mrs PRENTICE (Ryan) (17:37): I rise today to speak on the Skills Australia Amendment (Australian Workforce and Productivity Agency) Bill 2012. The coalition will support this bill and I understand that the general premise of the bill is supported very broadly across the training and skills sector. However, this piece of legislation is not perfect, and I would like to take this opportunity to discuss some of the problems with that is particular bill. Firstly, I note that this bill will create new Australian Workforce and Productivity Agency, which will replace and take over the previous work of an organisation set up by the Rudd government in 2008, Skills Australia. Based on the fact that they are replacing Skills Australia so soon after its implementation, clearly there were issues from the outset with that organisation and they have been recognised by the Gillard government. However, this government is notorious for coming up with short-term, bandaid solutions that do not address the substance of issues affecting this country. If this legislation is passed, the government will be successful in 'vanishing' the name Skills Australia, but not in dealing with the problems and inefficiencies that surrounded that organisation. The agency was budgeted for $25 million in the 2011-12 budget, which will enable them to oversee the administration of the $558 million Workforce Development Fund. This is to pay for up to half of training costs in the form of a co-contribution for the upskilling of existing workers. The other half is to be paid for by businesses themselves. In order to facilitate this process, enterprises will identify areas where there are specific workplace redevelopment needs and apply for funding to train new workers and retrain existing workers. The role of the new agency is to identify areas of importance and, as such, areas worthy of funding under a competitive application process. The current round of funding, which will be worth $50 million dollars, involves three key priorities: (1) $15 million for the resources sector and other areas where the effects of the current resources boom are impacting training and skilling; (2) $15 million in support for regions where there are significant structural reform challenges, with two priorities being the manufacturing and the tourism sectors; and (3) an additional $20 million for upskilling and skills augmentation across the general economy where the agency sees fit. Anyone who has been studying the Australian economy over the last decade knows that there have been significant issues in training and the procurement of skilled Australian workers, such that companies have often looked to bring overseas workers into the country on temporary business 457 visas. This is particularly true for the mining and resources sector. Many constituents in Ryan have raised with me their concerns that it is unfair to Australian workers, that this sector-which does employ so many Australians-with the ongoing resources boom, is not investing enough in upskilling Australian workers first. I understand their concerns and the concerns of many thousands of workers across Australia. I appreciate that by bringing in workers on 457 visas we are adding to the skill base of Australians. These foreign workers are bringing in their skills and, indeed, are adding quite significantly to the future of the Australian economy. However, they are only doing so in a bandaid capacity, and many will depart this country, never to return. I lament this situation because things could have been done better, both by the Australian government and by the mining industry. The $30 million dollars provided could go a long way in ensuring that funds are directed to those areas where a monetary incentive is required to encourage a business to invest. There is expected to be a training shortfall of more than 250,000 skilled employees during the next five years, so it will be a very large challenge for the board and the agency to match skills expansion with work opportunities appropriately. For example, just under 130,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost since mid-2008, and many workers will require retraining. This will be a huge task for industry and the agency. However, there are two elements of this bill that make me worry about the board's representation and consequent effectiveness. Firstly, in addition to the $558 million funding figure, there is also $20 million which can be allocated to unions and employer groups. Again, this current, unioncontrolled, Labor government cannot devise legislation without including a significant carrot to its union mates. The agency also sees an expansion in the number of people on its board from seven members to 10 members, but still does not ensure appropriate representation on that board. I ask the government: why have they still not created a specific position for a representative of training organisations? These groups will no doubt be working very closely with the agency's board-yet, according to this Labor government, those people out on the ground actually doing the training do not merit representation. In their submission to the Senate committee, the Australian Council for Private Education and Training queried the government and noted that they would be: … pleased to work with Government to nominate a representative that has an in-depth knowledge and understanding of the training sector. Given that ACPET is an organisation with over 1,100 members-a national organisation delivering many programs in vocational and educational training-I look forward to the government working with ACPET to resolve their concerns. Another very significant issue this legislation creates is the continued overlap of bureaucracy and funding levels among multiple and varied training organisations and skills councils at the state level. The coalition is very concerned that this government, rather than providing workable solutions to the skills shortage, is simply directing funds to initiatives which have seen poor results to date, and, at the same time, redirecting funds from one training initiative to another. At one point, this Labor government redirected funds from the Critical Skills Investment Fund to the Workforce Development Fund, after which Senator Evans announced the amalgamation of the funds in 2011. Ultimately, this government pretends that there are large increases in funding in the aggregate, when really all they have delivered is a redirection of the funds. It is quite confusing for the industry. For this fund, there is $558 million in funding, $101 million for a national apprentice mentoring program and a further $223 million for other support programs and wage-subsidy policies. There are other federal government programs, like funding for 30,000 new places in the Language, Literacy and Numeracy Program. This not only creates many layers of bureaucracy to deal with; it also confuses those in the industry, who have to work out where to apply-and what to apply for-at the myriad government agencies and offices. As the Queensland government noted in its submission to the Senate committee, states and territories are the predominant drivers in skills and training investment. This is particularly through the technical and further education departments, a segment of the vocational, education and tertiary sector and which are run primarily by each state government. The Queensland government noted that there is evidence that the duplication of skills training funding is 'fragmenting skills investment' and such duplication results in 'misalignment of training with local skill needs and industry requirements'. While there is scope for a national agency to have a more economywide perspective on what skills may be required as the economy evolves, there is a concern that this agency will be too far removed from the coalface to provide an accurate assessment of the workforce needs. Practically speaking, we must ensure that the agency will be producing value for money with their investments in skills training. It certainly true that states in Australia have a much greater capability to cooperate with their local communities to ensure that skills requirements are being met. I hope at the very least that this agency will collaborate with state skills councils to gain access most accurate, on-the-ground knowledge. It would be remiss of me not to mention the two taxes proposed by this Labor government which go a long way to discounting any possible benefits of the Australian Workforce and Productivity Agency. Every member of this House knows what I am talking about-the Labor government's minerals resource rent tax and the carbon tax. The first priority of the Workforce and Productivity Agency will be workers in the mining industry. I mentioned that the mining and resources sector has had difficulty in up-skilling enough Australian workers for their industry due to the significant cost of retraining. Taxing the so called super profits of the mining industry and imposing a devastating carbon tax serves as a double whammy to that industrythousands of jobs and billions of dollars of investment in mines and related businesses are at risk. They combine to serve as massive disincentives to international investment in the industry in the first place, lowering the general demand in the employment market of Australian workers. And if that is not bad enough, taxing their profits means mining companies effectively have less available funds to retrain employees and other Australians. This is yet another negative unintended consequence of the mining and carbon taxes, a consequence this government still does not understand. The second priority of the $50 million funding round is for industries with significant structural reform challenges, with the two priorities being manufacturing and tourism sectors. The two main industries that is will be affected by the Gillard government's disastrous carbon tax will be those exact industries-manufacturing and tourism. I echo the words of the American President's top manufacturing adviser and Chief Executive Officer of Dow Chemical to the Company, Mr Andrew Liveris, who said in March: Carbon pricing in isolation puts the country on its own rising prices on energy-intensive industries such that it creates a disincentive for investment. Mr Liveris knows that the carbon tax will damage an energy-intensive industry like manufacturing and puts this industry on the back foot in terms of international competitiveness. The $30 million for the mining, manufacturing and tourism industries is merely a bandaid attempt to cover up the hardship that they will have to face in the future. If the government truly supports these industries, they will rescind the mining and carbon taxes. The coalition has made that promise to the Australian people, and the Prime Minister and her government must do the same. To conclude, there are clear issues with this bill, issues which this government has pretended to fix by merely rebranding Skills Australia. The $558 million available is significant funding for the upskilling and retraining of Australian workers, but the creation of a new Workforce and Productivity Agency creates a new layer of bureaucracy for businesses and skills training organisations. I agree very broadly with supporting Australian workers, but, again and again, this Labor government devises legislation that could and should be better.",60
131,Ms RISHWORTH,BILLS," I am very pleased to rise today in support of the Skills Australia Amendment (Australian Workforce and Productivity Agency) Bill 2012 to establish the Australian Workforce and Productivity Agency to improve national, long-term workforce planning and development to address the skills and labour shortages, and contribute to improved labour market participation and industry and workplace productivity. I find it odd hearing the opposition's issues with this bill, one being that, heaven forbid, employees should have a seat at the table. It is important that the vast majority of employees out there who require upskilling and who will benefit from this training should not have a seat at the table. That is the criticism from the opposition. I find it an odd situation but I will leave the opposition to nitpick on the sidelines, while this government gets on with the job of pursuing a skills agenda. I am very proud of what this government has done with our skills agenda, because skills are critical to our future prosperity. Skills are central to ensuring that we have the workforce needed to deliver innovative, high quality services and products that will power our economy in the Asian century. In a changing economy, skills also build resilience. We heard the member for Farrer talking earlier about the Work for the Dole program and other schemes of the previous Howard government, but I have to say that our government has been focused on many different avenues to ensure that people get skills. We do not see a one-size-fits-all solution such as Work for the Dole. We want to see a variety of solutions, a variety of opportunities, to provide skills for many, many people. Skills do provide and build resilience so that workers do have the flexibility to change jobs, to apply skills in different contexts and continue to learn. For individuals, higher skills means more opportunity. I heard the member for Farrer scoffing at people getting skills, but higher skills do mean more opportunity, more choice and higher wages, leading to a better life for those people and their families. To businesses, a skilled nation means that they can get workers with the right skills to ensure that their business remains competitive and that they can take advantage of new opportunities. Indeed, 1.4 working Australians do not have the necessary skills for entry into the key growth sectors of our economy. The ABS estimates that these workers earn up to $10,000 less than their skilled peers. Skills Australia estimates that in the five years up to 2015 Australia will need an additional 2.1 million people in the workforce with VET qualifications. In my state of South Australia alone the ABS data estimates that 300,000 people are missing out on the opportunities that come with higher skills. It also shows that South Australia will need an additional 30,000 people with diploma qualifications by 2015. It is incredibly important that this government respond to the need for skills in our economy. Certainly it has done this. The key areas of growth are going to be in the technical and service areas. Information released by the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations has pointed to a variety of occupations that are needed specifically for South Australia. These include various types of managers, professionals and technicians across construction, engineering, automotive, food trades, mining, electrotechnology, telecommunications trades, skilled animal and horticultural workers and health professionals. The department points out that there have been various shortages and difficulties in recruiting to these professions. Since the day this Labor government was elected we have been committed to skilling up Australia-and not just in giving it a bit of window dressing, like the previous government did, when lot of the traineeships were used to subsidise wages rather than to ensure that Australians had the skills that would give them better opportunities. The previous government masked and window dressed, but we do not want to do that. We want to ensure that individuals are able to create a better life for themselves-a better job, a better pay packet and better job security. The government's most recent package, Skills for all Australians, will further turbocharge training in this country. It aims for an additional 375,000 students to complete qualifications over the next five years. To achieve this we need to ensure that vocational education is accessible to more Australians. That is why I am very proud to be part of the government that has committed $1.75 billion over five years for new skills reforms through the national partnerships agreement with the states. This is in addition to the money that has already been committed by the Commonwealth and delivered to the states. I am very proud that this package will give all Australians access to a governmentsubsidised training place at least to certificate III level. Prerequisite courses will also be covered, including the training to provide help with literacy and numeracy, so ensuring those who have been previously cut out of education and upskilling can get access. This package will mean that there will be more providers and more places offering subsidised opportunities to skill up more Australians. The package will be critical in opening the doors to many who have not had these opportunities before. The national training entitlement will be available to Australians from post school to the point where people enter into the aged pension, ensuring that no Australian is left behind when it comes to the opportunity to learn skills. For the first time, working-age Australians will be guaranteed access to a government-subsidised training place Ensuring that upfront fees are not a barrier to entering training is also critical to equitable access. As I mentioned previously, South Australia is in desperate need of people with diploma-level qualifications. Therefore I was incredibly pleased-and this is something I have been talking about since I attended university-that a deferred loan scheme will now be available not only to university students but also to VET students who are studying diploma and advanced diploma courses. As with university fees, VET students will not be required to pay income-contingent loans upfront; they will be able to defer until they are earning a decent income. This was, unfortunately, missed when it was announced after the last COAG meeting, but it is a serious reform that will once again open the doors to many young people in my electorate. But it is not just young people in my electorate who will benefit from this; I meet many older people who have decided to change what career they pursue. They do want to upskill but have not had the money. I have heard from many people who have said: 'If only I could defer this payment and if only I could get access. When I get a job I will be able to pay it back'. Now, this government is delivering the opportunity for these people to skill up. The skills reform National Partnership Agreement with the states comes, as I said, in addition to the $7.2 billion that this government has made available to the states and territories over the next five years for VET system. In total, therefore, the federal government will be injecting close to $9 billion dollars over the next five years to improve the training opportunities and so allow Australians to get the skills they need. It is vital not only that training is easier for people from all walks of life to access and afford but also that the quality of the training provided is of high quality. I think this is a very important point. We need to make sure that the skills training that is being delivered is delivered in a high-quality way. That is why the government is working very closely with industry and employers to develop training solutions that get real results for Australians. Employers must be able to trust that they will be hiring trained graduates with the skills that meet the highest industry standards and requirements. The government has already established the Australian Skills Quality Authority to promote high standards for our VET providers. As part of the new national partnership agreement reforms announced at the recent COAG, the government has pushed for further improvement in quality and will require all states and territories to implement independent assessments over the next two years. Strict criteria will be set to ensure that only quality providers with an established record can access public funding, and the states will be required to implement strategies to improve the quality of vocational education and teaching. The federal government also plans to implement the My Skills website, which will also improve access to information and support informed choice. All these reforms are critical to the quality of education provided. I have seen in my own electorate some of the investments into skills that are really making a difference. One of the real the concerns in my electorate under the previous government was that so few young people could access skills at school. We know that the previous government brought in their Australian technical colleges. There were 25 around the country, but they were not really easily accessible by the thousands of students who want to attain a VET qualification or a vocational education while at high school. So I was very proud to stand at the 2007 election and say that we were not going to make vocational training an exclusive right for only a few people in this country; we were going to roll out trades training centres to schools where the students were and where they could take an alternative path. I am so pleased now to see those rolling out in my electorate. We currently have six in operation, and a number of others have been announced. Willunga High School, Reynella East High School, Southern Vales Christian College's Aldinga campus, Wirreanda High School, Seaford 6-12 School and Hallett Cove R-12 School all have training centres, and all are cooperating together as part of Southern Adelaide and Fleurieu Trade School. They are exchanging students and specialising in trades and really networking up. I think it is a great model that gives students from my local electorate an opportunity while at school. The academic side of school with your normal subjects may not be the path they want to go down. I have seen some wonderful, engaged students who have chosen to finish year 12 but have done it while also doing vocational education. I was pleased to recently open the Hallett Cove trades training centre. This is a really exciting initiative that now provides an opportunity to gain qualifications in plumbing and electrotechnology. It is working with industry to deliver its program, so it is a great example of industry, school education and federal government assistance that is really delivering, once again, some great opportunities for young Australians in my electorate. The amendment bill in the House today seeks to replace Skills Australia from 1 July 2012 with the Australian Workforce and Productivity Agency and improve long-term workforce planning and development to further address skill and labour shortages and contribute to improvements in industry and workplace productivity. I think it is important to note while you are listening to the opposition speakers-they did not quite make this clear-that the move does have the backing of industry and employee representatives, who have been urging an integrated approach to tackling the skills shortage and productivity challenges. The agency will have broader scope than Skills Australia through the bill, enabling it to provide government with advice on allocation of Commonwealth funding. Further, the functions of the agency will be broadened to providing government with advice on improving productivity. It will the assess research on improving productivity and analyse funding available to address workforce skills, workforce development and workforce productivity. In conclusion I say that I think this is an important bill. It is part of a massive package that this government is delivering in skills. In moving around my electorate, I found it clear that the previous government fell asleep at the wheel when it came to skills, and it has taken the election of this government to really turbocharge skilling up Australia. I think there are so many exciting opportunities, including the deferral of loans in a HECS-style system for people studying for diplomas and advanced diplomas. This is a critical reform, as are our many others. I commend the bill to the House. Mrs ANDREWS (MCPherson) (18:04): I rise today to speak on the Skills Australia Amendment (Australian Workforce and Productivity Agency) Bill 2012, which is set to replace Skills Australia with the Australian Workforce and Productivity Agency. Skills Australia currently provides the government with advice on Australia's workforce shortages and demands. The new Australian Workforce and Productivity Agency will assume most of the work being done by Skills Australia but will have an expanded mandate. This expanded mandate will mean that the new organisation will be responsible for the administration of the National Workforce Development Fund as well as provide the relevant minister with advice on how to improve productivity in the Australian workforce and where to allocate Commonwealth funding. The new organisation will also have access to a $20 million pool of funds that can be distributed to unions and employer groups, but at this stage the accountability regarding the distribution of these funds is unclear. Although the primary task of both Skills Australia and its new successor is to provide evidence as to where shortfalls exist, these shortfalls are already being identified by industry and the department, as well as a variety of other stakeholders, so there appears to be some duplication in responsibility for the work undertaken by the agency and the department. What is further concerning is that Skills Australia and various industry skills councils should have been in a position to make determinations as to current and future skills needs but, because the AWPA has now been granted responsibility for this task, these changes only indicate that these organisations were not given the opportunity to do so. This bill before the House increases the ever-expanding bureaucracy that the Labor government is creating. The bill also increases the number of board members that will sit on the AWPA to 10, including the chair-three up from the seven currently prescribed for Skills Australia. Whilst unions, employers and skills councils are represented on the board, there is minimal direct training expertise. I would see it as critical that there be a board member or members with significant direct training experience. Training is vital to the the next generation of Australia's workforce as well as to our current generations. Although representation by industry groups and union organisations provides an insight into the current demands of businesses as well as the interests of employees, it does not provide government with information on how we go about providing workers with the vital skills needed to get the work done and the processes and the measures that can be utilised to do so. Considering the central role that training plays in developing and maintaining workforce productivity, I am surprised that there is no direct training representation on the board. This view is also supported by the Australian Council for Private Education and Training, which said in its submission to the Senate inquiry into the bill: ACPET believes that it is appropriate that the training sector also be represented as part of the Australian Workforce and Productivity Agency membership. … Such an appointment would add valuable expertise to the Australian Workforce and Productivity Agency as it develops advice for the government. Nonetheless, the government has not seen fit to make such an appointment to date. However, I do hope that this will be rectified as a priority. There is also a possibility that the functions of the new organisation may in fact overlap with others. The New South Wales Department of Education and Communities, in its submission to the inquiry, said: There may be value in avoiding the potential for duplication and overlap between the work of the Australian Workforce and Productivity Agency and other bodies that include the Productivity Commission. The Productivity Commission is required by legislation to undertake on its own initiative research about matters relating to industry, industry development and productivity. Thus productivity achieved through workforce development could be seen to be part of the success of Productivity Commission's role. Further, the Queensland Department of Education and Training, in its submission, states: Having significant training delivery administered nationally risks duplication of training effort on the ground and potential misalignment of training with skills needs and industry requirements. Put simply, there is already evidence that the purchasing of training by states and state industry bodies, the Commonwealth and Commonwealth industry bodies is fragmenting skills investment. There are two concerns here. Firstly, duplicating the work done by specifically designed organisations such as the Productivity Commission can only lead to poor productivity, wasted time and potentially much less action. Secondly, if there is already fragmentation of skills investment why doesn't the government address this issue rather than pressing forward with what amounts to merely window dressing? The importance of training in the workforce cannot be expressed enough. Providing our workforce with the tools of the trade has a twofold benefit. The first is personal growth and higher skill training and the second is increasing productivity in the workplace. Training provides individual workers with the ability to supplement their skills and to grow professionally. It gives them the ability to complete their work in a more productive fashion as well as increasing their employability. Further, productivity is a major benefit that arises from training the workforce and it ultimately benefits business and the community as a whole. It is clearly essential that measures are taken to increase productivity across this country. By increasing the ease of access to training and the opportunities for training workforce we can consequentially assist in increasing productivity in industry and therefore increase our wealth as a nation. The VET sector, which contributes heavily to the training of our workforce, is a vital part of our national economy. I have spoken many times in this place about its importance to Australia and noted the significant contribution many institutions make in their local communities. On the Gold Coast alone there are over 160 registered training organisations providing training in a variety of forms-from hospitality courses to apprenticeships in construction related fields. These training organisations are vital to ensuring the health of the VET dependent industries which the Gold Coast has traditionally relied on. They include tourism, construction, manufacturing and, more recently, mining and resources. The number of students in the Gold Coast VET sector rose by over 4,000 between 2006 and 2010, and that clearly demonstrates the health of this industry on the Gold Coast. However, we do need to make sure that the training that is being provided and that is being undertaken now is relevant to industry's future needs. There is no point in students undertaking training if there are likely to be limited or no job opportunities for them in their discipline in the future. So we have to be quite structured and quite focused about the training that we are developing and offering now to our students so that at the end of their training they do have a reasonable prospect of gaining employment in their chosen area. Unemployment is an issue on the Gold Coast. Unemployment statistics for March 2012 show that the Gold Coast as a whole had a 6.7 per cent unemployment rate compared to 2.9 per cent in March 2008. The southern Gold Coast, where my electorate of our MCPherson is located, had a 6.7 per cent unemployment rate compared to its March 2008 rate of 2.8 per cent. Based on these numbers, unemployment on the Gold Coast under the Labor government has risen by 3.9 per cent, or 12,600 people. But it is not only unemployment that needs to be addressed. We also need to address the issue of underemployment in Australia. In February 2011, out of the 11.4 million people employed 916,400 were identified as being underemployed, which is a representation of about eight per cent. There are many workers who are available to work additional hours. They may be additional part-time hours, casual hours or overtime hours. They would be accessing those hours but, at this point in time, there are no opportunities for them to pick up those additional hours and access that work. There are also women who would be employed on a part-time, casual or a full time basis if there were opportunities available for them. But it also seems to be somewhat limited. That is a statistic that is not necessarily borne out by a lot of the ABS unemployment data at the moment because it represents the underemployment figure. Many of Gold Coast locals are indicating to me that they believe that the underemployment rate could be as high as twice the unemployment rate I mentioned before. To address this issue we really need to strengthen the local economy on the southern Gold Coast and to provide businesses with incentives and opportunities to grow so that they in turn provide more opportunities for their existing employees and for potential employees. Identifying these workforce shortages and areas in which productivity can be raised help to ensure the strength of many industries and the national economy. But the risk of duplicating the functions of current agencies present some reasons for concern. Duplicating efforts will only lead to waste and they will not see any real results. Real action needs to be taken to reduce workforce skill shortages; real action needs to be in training not only today's workforce but also the workforce of tomorrow.",73
132,Mr LYONS,BILLS," I rise to speak on the Skills Australia Amendment (Australian Workforce and Productivity Agency) Bill 2012. In the 2011 budget, the Australian government announced the creation of an industry-led workforce and productivity agency as part of its Building Australia's Future Workforce initiatives. package is about providing greater opportunities for Australians to develop their skills, train and get into the workforce. It rewards work through improved tax incentives and provides new opportunities to get people into work with education, improved childcare and employment services. The Building Australia's Future Workforce initiatives also introduce new requirements for the long-term unemployed, disability support pensioners, young parents, jobless families and young people. A key focus of the package is to improve education and skill levels across the labour market to ensure Australians are equipped with the skills required to thrive in an innovative and sustainable economy. These initiatives invest over $3 billion in a new approach towards delivering the skilled workers the economy needs and ensuring that more Australian have the opportunity to share in our nation's prosperity. The Skills Australia Amendment (Australian Workforce and Productivity Agency) Bill 2012 implements a critical will aspect of these reforms, establishing the Australian Workforce and Productivity Agency, which will replace Skills Australia from 1 July this year. The new agency will work closely with industry to ensure the National Workforce Development Fund delivers training outcomes that meet the needs of industry, workers and the economy. taken The AWPA will work to place industry at the centre of the national training system, giving them a strong voice in the development of policy and industry skills funding. The agency will be an authority on workforce development policy. The agency will have a central role in advising the Australian government on the allocation of funding for the new National Workforce Development Fund, which will contribute This some $558 million to the upskilling of Australia's workforce and will create some 130,000 industry focused training places. The Skills Australia Amendment (Australian Workforce and Productivity Agency) Bill 2012 will make several important changes to the Skills Australia Act 2008. These include: changing the name of the existing Skills Australia body to the Australian Workforce and Productivity Agency; broadening the object of the act to include the provision of advice on the allocation of Commonwealth industry skills and workforce development funding; broadening the functions of the body to allow for a stronger research, analysis and advisory role, and to specifically address improvements in Australian workforce productivity; expanding the size of the body from a total of seven to 10 members, including an independent chair; and expanding on the current membership criteria to reflect the transition to a union industry-led body. The main aims of the Australian Workforce and Productivity Agency will be to ensure that skills and labour shortages are addressed, to improve long-term workforce planning and contribute to improved industry and workplace productivity. establishment of the AWPA is a demonstration of the Gillard Labor government's continued commitment to its workforce. We are determined to increase the number of skilled Australians in the workforce and create a more responsive training system that produces workers who have the skills to meet the challenges of a changing economy. Thanks to the responsible fiscal management of the Labor government, Australia emerged from the uncertainty of the global financial crisis and the recent natural disasters with one of the world's strongest economies. The government's stimulus package helped support growth and protect jobs and businesses. Of course, Australia's economy is undergoing something of a transformation. Structural changes in the economy mean that we must act now to train the workers who will take on the jobs of the future, and this is exactly what the AWPA will do. Jobs for more highly skilled workers are growing at 2.5 times the rate of other jobs. Indeed, 83 per cent of all Australians with a certificate III qualification or higher have a job as compared to only 57 per cent of those who left school early. This demand for skills cannot be met by the current workforce. The Skills Australia Amendment (Australian Workforce and Productivity Agency) Bill 2012 takes a big step in addressing this problem by ensuring that there is an organisation in place whose role is to meet the training needs of both workers and industry. Within this role, the Australian and Workforce and Productivity Agency will have several important tasks. The agency will not only advise the government on expenditure priorities for the National Workforce Development Fund but also drive engagement between industry, training providers and government on workforce The development, apprenticeships and VET reform. They will act to promote workforce productivity by leading initiatives for the improvement of productivity, management innovation and skills utilisation within Australian workplaces. The AWPA will conduct skills and workforce research, including into the future of work and working life in Australia. This will be achieved through collaboration with industry associations, industry skills councils, unions and employers and will see a practical approach to training that will meet the needs of sectors, regions and small businesses in our changing economy. There is absolutely no doubt of the value of a skilled workforce to a transforming economy like Australia's. An educated, productive workforce is an essential part of the government's plan to meet the challenges of the future. Skills also make a huge difference on an individual scale. They provide the opportunity for a new start, a better job and higher pay packet at the end of the week. Labor believes every Australian should be supported to reach their potential through education and training. The fact is that 4.1 million workers do not have a postschool qualification. The establishment of the Australian Workforce and Productivity Agency will increase the opportunities available to them to gain the higher skills they need to ensure they do not miss out on the higher skilled, higher paying jobs of the future. The Gillard Labor government recognises the difference that education and training make not only to the economy but to individuals and their families. Between the 2008 and 2010 financial years we have invested more than $11.1 billion in skills funding, significantly more than the $7.2 billion invested in the last three years of Howard government. This investment in skills funding works side-by-side with the government's high reform agenda, which has seen an additional 150,000 students enrolled in universities throughout Australia. There has also been an increase in the number of apprenticeships, with a 14 per cent rise in the numbers in the 3½ years to June 2011. In total, that is 462,000 trainees and apprentices in training-almost 60,000 additional people getting a trade for the future and the highest figure ever recorded. Labor has also committed $2.5 billion dollars over 10 years for Trade Training Centres in Schools to boost year 12 attainment and address skills shortages. Indeed, I have seen the benefits of these first hand in my electorate of Bass, with trade training centres up and running in both George Town and Scottsdale and a third on the way at St Patricks College in Launceston. I am thrilled that students in Bass will benefit from the next instalment of $986,500 a in the Australian government's $2.5 billion program to help schools build and upgrade trade training facilities. The investment in the trades training centres is giving students in Northern Tasmania and all over Australia more choice to find a career that suits them and also ensuring local businesses can access a workforce with the latest skills. These figures prove that the government is working to meet the challenges of the 21st century by building an educated and skilled workforce and ensuring that there are opportunities for all Australians to experience the benefits of work. It was fantastic to hear in the budget that the federal government is helping 260 workers across Tasmania undertake further training to meet the skills of industry. Labor is negotiating with the Tasmanian government to provide HECS-style loans for the local students studying for a diploma or advanced diploma, allowing TAFE students to study now and pay later. Federal Labor is also negotiating with the Tasmanian government to provide a subsidised training place for local people wanting to gain new skills up to certificate III, which will also roll out from July. The strong economic position of the Australian economy provides the opportunity for more individuals to participate in the workforce. These opportunities ensure that the benefits of work can be enjoyed and shared by all. The establishment of the Australian Workforce and Productivity Agency through the Skills Australia Amendment (Australian Workforce and Productivity Agency) Bill 2012 is an essential element in the government's plan to create a highly skilled workforce that is ready to take on the jobs of our future economy. I am confident that the AWPA will be a driving force in the development of policy and industry skills funding, as well providing training outcomes that meet the needs of industry, workers and the economy. This bill makes a number of changes that will ensure the agency can fulfil its role in improving long-term workforce planning and development to address labour shortages and to deliver practical, industry-led workforce strategies. I look forward to seeing the positive outcomes and benefits that the training and upskilling provided by the AWPA will create for Australian workers and their families. In a time of a transforming economy the government is providing for the future of all Australians by providing access to the training and education they will need in a highly skilled future. I commend this bill to the House.",79
133,Dr STONE,BILLS," I too wish to talk about the Skills Australia Amendment (Australian Workforce and Productivity Agency) Bill 2012. It was announced in the 2011-12 budget just the other night that the Australian Workforce and Productivity Agency will be a new agency subsuming and replacing the existing work undertaken by Skills Australia. Skills Australia was set up by the Rudd Labor government in 2008. So just four years later we have to wonder why it has found itself under the spotlight, being substantially changed in terms of its mandate. I guess it is because we did not have much action and there was not much to show for those first four years. There is a substantial injection of funds into this new agency-$25 million was budgeted for the 2011-12 financial year. What we have to hope is that this new agency is not simply another training for training's sake exercise. Too often in Australia we have seen the unemployed, especially the Indigenous unemployed or others with a disability perhaps, put in front as of course after course with no prospect of a job ever at the end of the training period. Too often we are told that there are massive skills in demand in Australia and that there are thousands of jobs not being filled. In rural and regional Australia in particular, we have a crisis in farm succession and in finding enough agribusiness workers. We are told that there are more than 2.5 jobs for every graduate from a college which trains individuals in agricultural science or agribusiness related courses, yet the industry cannot find those Labor 2.5 graduates for every job. So there is a real problem in Australia in that there are not enough trained individuals to meet the real opportunities in our economy; and, indeed, there are not enough individuals who are given a chance to retrain, given that they are locked into parts of Australia where there are few jobs or they are locked into areas of work which will not have much of a future after the carbon tax commences on 1 July. I have already seen in my electorate, for example, hundreds of food manufacturing jobs disappear. Individuals have been made redundant because of the additional costs to be imposed in the food manufacturing sector come 1 July. I am referring in particular to the most recent job losses from the Murray Goulburn Co-operative. Recently Coca-Cola Amatil announced job losses, and the workers at Heinz at Girgarre were told to go elsewhere when the company decided to shift offshore to New Zealand-which, of course, has only a tiny carbon tax compared to that which is to be imposed in Australia. There will be a lot of new job losses coming through the system when our economy is made less competitive after 1 July, so we are very much anticipating that an enormous training effort will be required in this country-perhaps one of the biggest new training efforts that the country has ever seen. We know that there are a lot of disengaged youth, particularly in rural and regional Australia. In my area, up to 30 per cent of our young people are not employed. I wonder, though, how simply increasing the size of the board of Skills Australia from seven to 10 members is going to make a huge difference. There is a new emphasis on these members coming out of the trade union movement. The trade union movement has done a lot of things in the past, but one of things it is not renowned for is retraining. We have a requirement for 250,000 skilled employees over the next five years, yet we know that the membership of the union movement is contracting across all sectors. So it is interesting that the Skills Australia board is to be boosted by more membership from the trade union movement, and it is interesting that a substantial part of the funding is to be allocated to the unions themselves. I want to see the funding go to agencies or organisations such as those that Andrew Forrest has identified in Western Australia. He understands that unless there is the prospect of a job at the end of the training experience, the individual is not going to be quite so well engaged. The individual who perhaps has never worked before, or who has faced a lot of discrimination because of race or because of poor Australian standard English-speaking skills, is best engaged when he or she knows that there is a real job at the end of a training period-a job they want to do and a job that is accessible to them geographically. When I was Minister for Workforce Participation, I was very proud to launch Goal 100. This was in Whyalla and it was very much the brainchild of OneSteel. They had a massive problem with local skills retention and in finding new skilled workers for their expanding mining tasks in that region. There were 79 graduates who received five months of training. This program was one of the first of its kind in Australia. It took some quite long-term unemployed men and women-some Indigenous men and women among the group-and gave them real work-related skills so they could enter various mining sector jobs in the region. It also gave them a great deal of personal development support. Some of these individuals had very difficult the lives where they had to, for example, spend a lot of time caring for sick family members or had experienced family dislocation. Some had experienced alcohol and drug issues in the past. One of the conditions of the training was that the graduates be drug-free during their training period, and this was very successfully achieved by the 79 who graduated after five months of training. Those graduates knew that they were not going to march around to the Centrelink to see what was possible for them to apply for; they knew that they had an excellent job waiting for them. In fact, most of them had already had some experience in the jobs which they were to step into, having graduated from the training program. The night of their graduation was electric with anticipation, expectation and pride. Families were there, cheering on their graduates, some of whom had not completed their secondary education and some of whom had never before succeeded in completing any qualification or even had one offered to them before. Not only was I at the graduation of the Goal 100; I was also at the launch of the program in the same TAFE facility-the South Australian TAFE facility in Whyalla. There was some nervousness and apprehension at the launch of the program. I was there with the local mayor and councillors as well as the Whyalla Economic Development Board Chief Executive Officer and OneSteel executives. There was a quite rugged mix of workers sitting there, aiming to train and get a job. For many of them it was very exciting, but they were also apprehensive. The fact that the 79 graduated and walked into work was living proof of the effectiveness of what Andrew Forrest aims to do with his programs targeting Indigenous workers in Western Australia. Andrew Forrest has said that for every job filled, go unfilled due to the lack of job-ready Indigenous applicants for the work that is out there in the more remote parts of Western Australia. He knows the importance of training which includes theoretical and hands-on experience-real experience-and a job offer at the end. Too often in Australia we simply reach for a 457 visa to bring in skilled workers from overseas. We think that it is a quicker, easier and cheaper way to fill the gaps in our skilled workforce. It is not a clever way to go, because, as I mentioned before at the beginning of my remarks, more than 30 per cent of our youth are unemployed in parts of regional Australia. In parts of Indigenous Australia, where most of the population is in rural and remote areas and the people are our first Australians, unemployment is over 80 per cent. So we have to make sure that someone such as Andrew Forrest, who has established four vocational training and employment centres-or VTECs, as he calls them-in Western Australia, is given every support from this federal government. He has called on the government to set up another 25 of these VTECs across the country. I strongly support what he sees as an essential way to go-where your training is in relationship to a real job and your training outcome, if you graduate, is real employment. I found this was the case when I was congratulating those graduates in 2006 and 2007 in Whyalla. We have to be serious in Australia about the fact that a lot of our regional training organisations are not very adequate. Many of them are now supervising students and offering courses which are not at all rigorous so that people who do not have sufficient skill graduate. I made a comment on this in parliament just yesterday. I mentioned the two fact that apprentices are paid only some $6 an hour and they are not receiving the TAFE sector training that was once expected to be very much a part of their apprenticeship. They are allowed to be fast tracked. Instead of spending four years in an apprenticeship, work they can finish now in some two years via what is often called competency based accreditation, where someone from a registered training organisation simply observes them on the job-perhaps standing at a building site where they are able to point to some scaffolding or some piece of plumbing or tiling work or concreting. A photograph is taken of the outcome and a box is ticked, and that apprentice is then told that they have competency in that particular aspect of the trade. This is not good enough for Australia, which has to have not only people with certificates or qualifications like diplomas or degrees but also the knowledge and skills behind those diplomas, degrees or certificates. There has to be confidence that, through the training that they have been given, the individual will be able to work competently in an industry sector and be able to rise to be a master tradesperson or a selfemployed person employing others and in turn offering training themselves. At the moment many people have real concerns, which was expressed through the Senate inquiry submission from the Queensland government. It was highlighted that training purchased by the states and Commonwealth is often fragmented, that there is duplication of effort and that there is poor quality in outcomes for those who undertake training. Even the ACTU have been critical of the government's approach to addressing the skills shortages, where, too often, you simply have an offshore recruitment drive rather than address the unemployed queuing for an opportunity to gain an income and get off welfare. The new agency that is now to be funded is the Australian Workforce and Productivity Agency. Let us hope that the co-contribution arrangement, with business paying making according to their size contributions up to 50 per cent, will mean that those businesses demand a better outcome from this agency than they got with Skills Australia. Let us hope that, if someone receives a certificate III level or a certificate IV level in aged care, for example, that they do come out of that training genuinely skilled and with work waiting for them. One function of this agency is the identification of skills needed in the future. We are told the resources sector will be a priority 1, with $15 million to support skills development in that area. I would argue that equally important to the resources sector is food manufacturing. We pay a lot of lip service to manufacturing, but food manufacturing is the biggest employer in Australia when it comes to value adding from plough to plate. There is $15 million to support organisations and regions that are facing structural adjustment and reform challenges, particularly in the manufacturing and tourism sectors. I would hope that those funds go into the regions. Finally, there is a catch-all of $20 million to support upskilling and skills deepening across all sectors of the economy. Twenty million dollars is not very much. Let us hope that the money gets spent appropriately and wisely and that it is targeted properly and that behind the training there are real jobs. Debate adjourned. NA Privileges and Members' Interests Committee Reference",82
134,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES," The Speaker has agreed to the following statement which I make to the House in relation to the matter of privilege raised by the honourable member for Sturt. Earlier today the honourable member for Sturt raised as a matter of privilege that, in his statement to the House on 21 May 2012, the honourable member for Dobell deliberately misled the House. The honourable member for Sturt provided detailed information in relation to the statement by the honourable member for Dobell and the reasons that he believed the honourable member had intended to mislead the House in making the statement. Deliberately misleading the House is one of the matters that can be found to be a contempt. While claims that members have deliberately misled the House have been raised as matters of privilege or contempt on a number of occasions, no Speaker has ever given precedence to allow such a matter to be referred to the Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests. To establish that contempt has been committed it would need to be shown that: (1) a statement had in fact been misleading; (2) the member knew at the time the statement was incorrect; and (3) the misleading had been deliberate. There needs to be prima facie evidence of these matters to establish a case for precedence to be given to a motion. The Speaker has considered the principal information provided by the honourable member for Sturt. He understands that this matter is surrounded by conflicting views. However, the matter of deliberately misleading the House is a very serious one and rightly there should be prima facie evidence that the House has been misled and that the misleading has been deliberate. While it does not seem that a prima facie case has been made out in terms of the detail that Speakers have always required in relation to such allegations, the Speaker understands the concerns many members have about the matters raised by the honourable member for Sturt. While in accordance with the practice of the House, precedence as of right to a motion for this matter to be referred to the Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests cannot be given, it is still open to the House itself to determine a course of action in relation to this matter.  Opposition Business) (18:45): by leave-I move: That the following matter be referred to the Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests: Whether, in the course of his statement of 2012, the Honourable Member for Dobell deliberately misled the House. I wish to speak briefly to the motion. I do not think I need to canvass the issues that were canvassed at two o'clock this afternoon. I think they are all on the record in the Hansard and in the general public firmament, and the documents that I tabled have obviously been considered by the Speaker. I accept the Speaker's ruling that no matter of this kind has ever been referred before or given precedence. I am grateful to the Speaker that he has indicated in the statement that it is a matter of great concern to the parliament and that, therefore, if it was possible for this to be referred to the Privileges Committee by leave, then such a motion should be moved and, if supported, it would go to the Privileges Committee. I am grateful to the Leader of the House that he has indicated to me that he has given leave and is prepared to allow this matter to go to the Privileges Committee without division. Obviously the argument that the opposition has put on this matter time and again, but particularly today, is that it is uniquely in the power of parliament to determine its own actions and whether its privileges have been breached. Charging a member with misleading the House is one of the most serious charges that anyone can make of either opposition or government. I do not do it lightly. I do believe that the Privileges Committee is the correct forum to determine this matter and, therefore, I commend this motion to the House.",85
135,Mr ALBANESE,COMMITTEES,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and of Transport) (18:47): The government will not be opposing this motion. I think that the Speaker's statement before the House with regard to this matter is pertinent indeed. The Manager of Opposition Business raised the 21 May issue of misleading the House. Of course, that is not the charge. The charge is whether the House has been deliberately misled. To establish that that contempt has been committed, three things need to be shown: (1) that a statement had been misleading; (2) that the member knew at the time the statement was incorrect; and (3) that the misleading had been deliberate. I note that no Speaker has ever given precedence to this matter and therefore that precedent is not being established by this ruling and I think that is very important. I think it is critical that, whilst we debate these issues surrounding allegations against the member for Dobell, we are very careful that we do not establish precedents that would change the nature of the way that this parliament operates and change the nature of the way that the separation of powers operates. It is my view, however, that the Manager of Opposition Business's motion, were it to be not supported-and the government could have, of course, not supported this motion even being brought on. I indicated earlier today that the government would allow leave because I did not want it argued that the government was somehow seeking to block a proper consideration of these matters by the Privileges Committee. The statement says, in accordance with the practice of the House, that precedence as of a right to a motion for this matter would normally be granted by the Speaker. It is open to this House to refer the matter, and if the motion of the Manager of Opposition Business is carried of course that will occur. But I do note the Speaker's statement that a prima facie case has not been granted. I do note that no Speaker has ever granted precedence. In this fine Westminster House there are quite often disagreements as to statements, as to economic policy, as to whether there is a $70 billion black hole or not in the opposition's funding, whether climate change is anthropogenic or not. A whole range of statements are made that are contradicted by the two sides of the House. That occurs every single day. What the government wants to indicate here is this: the fact that we are permitting this motion to be moved, by leave, by the Manager of Opposition Business should not establish a precedent whereby we say that, when disagreements arise as to what facts are, they should be the subject for a reference to the Committee of Privileges. That indeed would be abuse of that process and would undermine the very functioning of this parliament. We go further and say thatwhen it comes to matters which are quite rightly, because of the seriousness of their nature, subject to potential legal action, either criminal or civil-the idea that this parliament should sit in judgment undermines the rule of law, undermines the separation of powers and indeed, under other circumstances whereby the convention that these matters would only be considered if the Speaker were to grant precedence, is of some concern indeed. It is of some concern because in the future a majority government should not use the fact that it is a majority government of whatever political persuasion to determine that matters should be referred to the Privileges Committee or to determine outcomes of these matters. That is why we have these conventions. We have these conventions so that the Speaker determines these things separately from partisan politics. I am confident that the Committee of Privileges will also consider these matters separately from partisan politics, and I would certainly encourage the members to do so. Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP (Mackellar) (18:53): I wish to speak to this motion and note that I am the formal seconder of the motion. I am very pleased that the Leader of the House has agreed that the motion as moved by the opposition will proceed to the Privileges Committee. I think everybody in this House knows how serious a matter of privilege is. It is not something that is taken lightly or in a frivolous manner, and I think that the material that was outlined by the Manager of Opposition Business earlier today, when he moved his original motion, did place on the record many of the questions that need to be investigated and dealt with. But the question, in the terms of this motion, of whether, in the course of his statement of 21 May 2012, the honourable member for Dobell deliberately misled the House, is one that certainly must be addressed by the Privileges Committee. Question agreed to. Skills Australia Amendment (Australian Workforce and Productivity Agency) Bill 2012 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.",86
136,Mr HUSIC,COMMITTEES," I have long advocated in this place and elsewhere that education is the key to opportunity and opening the door to prosperity for so many people, particularly from the electorate I am proud to representprosperity for individuals as well as prosperity for the nation as a whole. Labor understands that skilling Australians provides a crucial boost to productivity. That is why we have invested so heavily in school education as well as vocational education. The bill we are debating today, the Skills Australia Amendment (Australia Workforce and Productivity Agency) Bill 2012, seeks to amend legislation, making the agency Skills Australia more responsive to industry needs through a new partnership approach to workforce development. Skills Australia is an independent statutory body, providing advice to the Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research on Australia's current, emerging and future workforce skills needs and workforce development needs. Skills Australia was established by the Skills Australia Act in 2008, which specifies that members be appointed by the minister and must have experience in academia, the provision of education and training, economics and industry. Skills Australia was intended to be the body that had its finger on the pulse of industry to better inform the government on national skills priorities, areas of workforce shortage and reforms to the national training system. However, industry groups and BILLS unions felt that Skills Australia was not ideally positioned to fulfil its mission and requested the government improve the link between the funding we provide for skills and the needs of industry as well as workplace productivity. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Australian Industry Group all argued for a more integrated approach to tackling the country's skills and productivity challenges. Skills Australia also recognised that, more than any other education sector, the training sector connects learning with the labour market, the workplace and community development, so in this context the government is seeking to replace Skills Australia from 1 July 2012 with the new Australian Workforce and Productivity Agency. The aim of the agency will be to improve long-term workforce planning and development, to address the skills and labour shortages facing the country and to contribute to improving workplace productivity. In May 2011 a new $558 million National Workforce Development Fund, designed to upskill Australia's workforce over the next four years, was announced in the budget. The new agency will work closely with industry to ensure the fund delivers training outcomes that meet the needs of industry, workers and the economy. The bill proposes broadened functions that will give the agency a stronger research, analysis and advisory role and specifically provides for it to address improvements in Australian workforce productivity. The revised functions will also ensure the agency can advise the government on the allocation of the Commonwealth industry skills funding, including the National Workforce Development Fund. It will have the ability to advise the government to direct funding to areas of critical industry need. This is an issue I would like to come back to later in my contribution to this debate. The bill provides for an expansion in the size of the agency compared with the current size of the Skills Australia membership and a revision and expansion of the current membership criteria. The new agency will be a fully representative body that represents industry, employees and employers and will allow the agency to meet its significant skills and workforce development agenda from July this year. It will build on the strengths of Skills Australia. It will collaborate with industry associations, industry skills councils, unions and employers to achieve its new functions. Rather than establish this agency from scratch, the government has rightly recognised that Skills Australia possessed a range of strengths, and what it has sought to do in this bill is to retain those and to the effective governance structure and the legislative framework of that body remain. Stakeholders are quite right to expect industry and unions to play a bigger role in setting the skills agenda. This will increase the likelihood of us training young Australians to perform jobs where there are known shortages and to a standard that industry requires. A perfect example of where industry has played a key role in determining where skills funding should be spent is in my electorate of Chifley at the Loyola Trade Training Centre in Mount Druitt, for which this government contributed $9 million. From the very beginning of the planning for this centre Loyola Senior High School was engaged with local industry to determine where the greatest skills shortages were and how industry could best support the skilling of young people. For example, it had close negotiation and consultation with the National Electrical Contractors Association to help determine how to fast-track or attract more students into electrical apprenticeships. It has also worked with the Motor Traders Association and others to ensure that, when students do go on and pursue further training within the trade training set-up, there will be jobs locally to support them when they leave. From this industry engagement, Loyola Senior High School chose to develop courses and build facilities to train students in automotive, carpentry, commercial cookery, hairdressing, electrotechnology, shopfitting and metal fabrication. Having toured through the facility itself, I was impressed to see what has been achieved by the school in a short space of time. It was exceptional. Students at the Loyola Trade Training Centre are building skills that are in high demand in Western Sydney. One industry which has impacted ensure enormously and positively on the skills education of young people right across Australia is commercial cookery. Students have been learning to cook in schools for a great number of years and most schools would have had limited kitchen facilities for those purposes. When vocational education first ventured into the schools sector, commercial cookery made the easy transition. However, the industry had concerns about the skill level of teachers and the currency of those skills, as well as the suitability of facilities where this cookery was being taught. This resulted in a significant overhaul of these facilities, in which this government has invested some $1.2 billion. Again, I have been fortunate to see first hand some of those amazing commercial kitchens at the trade training centres in the Chifley electorate. Loyola, Evanside and Tyndale trade training centres all boast fantastic kitchens, with equipment that could be found in any restaurant in Australia. In March the Deputy Prime Minister visited Doonside Technology High School to officially open the Evanside Trade Training Centre and I had the pleasure of inspecting the new and refurbished facilities, including their commercial kitchen. We all enjoyed the fruits of their labour, which was equal to catering that I have experienced anywhere else. In the past, students who had completed a school based apprenticeship, accounted for the first year of a commercial cookery apprenticeship, often required significant upskilling because they had had no prior exposure to much of the equipment found in restaurants. The restaurant and catering industry has significantly greater confidence in the skills that students build at renewing schools because of their involvement in both course delivery and industry placement. Mr Jack Joyce, Principal of Tyndale Christian School in Blacktown, has proudly told me of the achievements of some of those students. Chantelle Bills earned second place in the High Flyers Program, run by Kenvale Hospitality College and Radisson Hotel Sydney. From her studies at Tyndale she gained a scholarship to study at Kenvale while working at the Radisson Hotel. Another student, John Victor Suwa, was announced Hospitality Student of the Year in the Western Sydney area by BREED Local Community Partnership, the organisation which facilitates work placement of these students. The students have gained employment in some of Sydney's best restaurants. Aleu Kuek now works in the kitchen of 360 Restaurant, Sydney Tower and received a promotion within three months. James Milazzo got apprenticeship with Tetsuya's world-famous five-hat restaurant. There have been some tremendous achievements as a result of the investment in trade training centres in my area. I am delighted that students will have the opportunity to progress and continue in their careers as a result of this very important reform. I mentioned earlier that, as part of the reforms we are talking about today, the agency-the Australian Workforce and Productivity Agency-that we set up will have the ability to advise the government to direct funding to areas of critical industry which needs. I want to take a few moments to talk about ICT skills in this country. We have an enormous opportunity based on two things to drive further growth of ICT. Principally through the roll-out of the National Broadband Network we are completely this nation's technological infrastructure. On top of this we have an economy that is growing, that is strong and that is well ahead of most advanced economies at this point, given the state of economic conditions across the globe. We need to use this time to invest and strengthen the economy into the years ahead. While we certainly gain a lot from our resources sector, it is worth noting that in this country the internet generates almost as many jobs as mining. So ICT will be very important to this country in the years ahead. I note that Skills Australia has been looking at a number of areas-particularly the resources sector, the defence industry, and the green skills and energy efficiency sectors-and has developed sector-specific skills needs plans. However, it is worth pointing out that the Australian Computer Society have released in the last few months details about skills needs in the ICT area. an They have been warning that we are facing shortages in ICT industry professionals. They note, in particular, declining ICT university enrolments, a drop in skilled migration, an ageing workforce and community misconceptions about the opportunities and rewards associated with ICT careers. Alan Patterson, of the Australian Computer Society, said: We should be very concerned about sustaining the momentum of our vital $100bn digital economy. Australia's digital economy is an undeniable force for productivity and value-add for every other industry sector, providing communications, social media platforms, data management and transaction capabilities that drive our economic performance. And further: The critical role of ICT professionals in enabling our digital economy means that the highest policy priority must be directed at education and workforce planning … He has highlighted some important statistics that I think are worth bringing to the House. At least 14,000 new ICT jobs will be created this year alone, and at least an additional 21,000 through next year, but we do need to find skilled people to fill these positions. Australian Computer Society's statistical research shows that university enrolments in ICT are currently less than half of what they were a decade ago, and that is despite a small recovery last year. As a percentage of the total student body, ICT students are continuing to decline. That pronounced decline is also evidenced in the VET sector, where a decade ago 75,000 people received an ICT qualification. By 2010 this had declined to 46,000. We certainly need-and the ACS calls for this-greater recognition of Australia's ICT community as an industry sector and more research to understand why, despite the ever more compelling nature of ICT, there are not enough students choosing ICT as a career. We need improved coordination between business, government and particularly in the smallto medium-sized enterprise area, the SME area, where the majority of ICT professionals work. Obviously the other area that they have picked up on is improved ICT governance to support business capacity to capture the ever-increasing number of people using the internet. They have put some very important points forward that would compel further work and give further impetus for greater support in this area. I certainly back their calls there. processing I had the opportunity to speak at the graduating ceremony of the University of Western Sydney's School of Computing, Engineering and Mathematics in late April. In my contribution to those students that would be going out into a growing digital economy in Australia. I highlighted, too, that one of the ambitions we should have, particularly for Western Sydney, is opening up ICT corridors where companies can be able to research, develop products and potentially drive growth in export earnings for Australia right out of Western Sydney, to be able to work with the University of Western Sydney to be able to open up those corridors. But to do so we obviously need the skills and the talent of people to be there. Given the concerns raised by ACS, given that demand exists but we are not meeting that demand as quickly as we can, we do need to accelerate work in this area. I certainly am looking forward to working with US in this particular area of trying to open up further ICT corridors in Western Sydney. In the meantime I support the changes contained in this bill. I am confident they will produce a better skilled, more productive workforce. I commend this bill to the House.",88
137,Ms HALL,COMMITTEES," The Skills Australia Amendment (Australian Workforce and research, Productivity Agency) Bill 2012 is very important legislation. It is not controversial legislation, but it is legislation that is about Australia's future and Australia's place in the world. This legislation establishes the Australian Workforce and Productivity Agency, which will replace Skills Australia, and that will be from 1 July this year. The creation of the AWPA was announced as part of the government's 2011 Building Australia's Future Workforce package. The bill contains eight proposed amendments to the act to establish AWPA and broaden the objectives and function of the act. The name 'Skills Australia' was removed from the act and replaced with 'Australian Workforce and Productivity Agency'. It establishes Skills Australia as continuing in existence as the AWPA, and the act is broadened to allow AWPA to provide government with advice on the allocation of Commonwealth funding. The functions of the body are broadened, with the addition of new functions to allow the AWPA to provide advice in relation to improving the productivity of the Australian workforce; the allocation of Commonwealth funding, including the National Workforce Development Fund, which is about addressing Australia's workforce skills-and I will be talking a little bit more about that I move further into my speech; workforce development; and workforce productivity needs. It is also about assessment of research relating to improving the productivity of the Australian workforce and analysis of funding available to address Australia's workforce skills shortage, workforce development and workforce productivity needs. Skills Australia was first established in 2008 and commenced operation in April that year. It was one of the Rudd government's initiatives to address the skills shortage. The agency also has the responsibility for administering the National Workforce Development Fund. The fund is worth $558 million over four years and incorporates a $200 million Critical Skills Investment Fund, which was announced in the 2010-11 budget. I note that the Parliamentary Secretary for Higher Education and Skills is in the House. She has made some very strong comments on the role, the function and the need for the change. In her second reading speech, she highlighted the fact that industry union partners had called for an increased focus on workplace productivity and better linkage between skills funding and industry needs. I think that is also supported by employers, businesses and industries. I speak very frequently with businesses within my electorate as well as workers and unions, and I know that that is something that they really believe is needed. Skills Australia, in its national workforce development strategy, recommended 'a new partnership approach to workforce development at the government, industry and enterprise level', and I see that that is what will be happening once this legislation is enacted. I thought it was worth taking a little look at the skills agenda and I thought I would look at the skills agenda for New South Wales. The figures that I will put to the House tonight are based on ABS data. It is estimated that 1.2 million people in New as South Wales alone are missing out on the opportunity that comes from having higher skills. Research shows that in New South Wales there is a strong demand for motor mechanics. When I first started working in the employment area some 20-odd years ago there was a skills shortage for motor mechanics then and, no matter what has happened over the ensuing period, that workforce shortage has never been addressed. I see that the legislation that we have before the House will put in place proper research mechanisms, create the partnerships that are needed and will help address that long-term shortage of motor mechanics. Chefs and cooks I notice are also on the list, and that has been another area in which there has been a long-term shortage. Other occupations that appear on the list are: sheetmetal trade workers, metal fabricators, building associates, construction estimators, automotive electricians, fitters, metal machinists first class, plumbers-and we all know how difficult it is to find a plumber if one is needed-panel beaters, electricians, air-conditioning and refrigeration mechanics, and cabinet-makers. For some of those areas, such as panel beating, there has been a very long-term shortage and some of those areas have new shortages. Modelling commissioned by Skills Australia showed that from now to 2015 New South Wales will need an additional 180,000 people with qualifications at trade level or certificate III or certificate IV It also shows that New South Wales will need an additional 144,000 people with diploma qualifications by 2015. There is a $180 difference per week in the mean average wage when you compare a person with a year 12 qualification and those holding a certificate III qualification, according to the ABS data, meaning that some workers are missing out on nearly $10,000 in extra wages a year. One of the main objectives of the Gillard government is to address those shortages. parliamentary secretary and the minister responsible have been working on this, and this is one of the tools to address the shortage. I would like to step sideways and pick up on an issue that the member for Chifley was talking about-that is, trade training centres. He highlighted some of the activities of those centres in his electorate. I would like to report to the House that the previous Howard government set up a system of Australian technical colleges. One was set up in the Hunter. It was poorly resourced; it did not have the necessary linkages and partnerships that this government is so committed to with the local community. Many of the students who attended that Hunter ATC found out that what they had been promised was not delivered and so left. The ATC in the Hunter struggled along in that period. On the Central Coast the situation was even worse. There, money was allocated to set up an Australian technical college, but unfortunately it never came to fruition. When the Rudd and Gillard governments were elected they set about resolving that issue. Rather than duplicating an existing state system or setting up something that really did not fit in with the needs of industry or young people seeking to undertake training and really did not cover all the skills that were needed, they adopted a very innovative level. approach. They chose to locate the ATC in the schools of the Central Coast. They combined that with setting up trade training centres in those schools. Three of the schools in the Shortland electorate on the Central Coast benefited from that-Gorokan High School, North Lakes High School and Lake Munmorah High School. Those three high schools now have state-of-the-art training facilities, because of the innovative approach that was adopted by this government. Along with the location of those trade training The centres and ATCs within the schools there has been a concerted effort to build partnerships with local employers in an area with very, very high youth unemployment. It has adopted a very lateral approach to addressing: firstly, skill shortages; secondly, the ability for young people in particular to train; and, thirdly, putting those people who attain the skills in a position where they can find employment. The whole approach of this government has been to put in place the right sort of training opportunities for young people and for people seeking to move from one occupation to another; putting in place programs and courses that will connect people with the types of jobs that are needed. This will help them to develop skills and help to address the skills shortages that I highlighted-and by no means was that a complete list of skills shortages. This legislation builds on the strengths of Skills Australia which, as I mentioned, started in 2008. It works in collaboration with industry associations, industry skills councils, unions and employers. It works that way to ensure that a practical approach is adopted-an approach that really looks at business needs, regional needs and the needs of those people who are looking at getting the skills. The AWPA will advise the government on expenditure priorities for the new NWDF. It will drive engagement between training providers and government on workforce development issues, apprenticeships and VET reforms. I see that as one of the most important roles that the new body will perform. It is imperative that we do have engagement between all these bodies because it is only by engagement, planning and research that we will end up with the results that are needed to provide us with the skilled workforce that we must have in Australia. It will provide those people who are seeking employment in the future and those people who are looking to change occupations with the opportunities to develop the new skills that they will need to be successful in the future. The fact that workforce research will be undertaken by the AWPA is a very important element of this new body and an important element included in this legislation. I commend the legislation to the parliament. It is good legislation; it is legislation that is for the future and it is legislation that is about putting Australia very competitive position globally so that we have a workforce which has the skills that are needed for us to have a strong economy.",91
138,Ms BIRD,COMMITTEES,"Cunningham-Parliamentary Secretary for Higher Education and Skills) (19:25): I take the opportunity firstly to thank all the members who spoke on the Skills Australia Amendment (Australian Workforce and Productivity Agency) Bill 2012. A skilled, educated and productive workforce is at the heart of the government's plan to build a new economy to meet the challenges of the future. Skills are the lifeblood of a modern economy-especially an economy such as ours, which is undergoing significant transformation. Skills allow for adaptation to new technologies, for more efficient work practices and for greater innovation. A highly skilled workforce also means higher quality, more profitable goods and services and the ability to remain globally competitive as a nation. The number of jobs requiring higher skills is growing rapidly, but the number of available workers with the skills to fill these jobs is not keeping pace. As we drive growth in the system we need to ensure that we target our skills training effort to areas of industry demand. This is about training to meet the needs of industry. With these goals in mind and with this bill, the Commonwealth is establishing the Australian Workforce and Productivity Agency with an industry-led board. For the first time this will give industry the capacity to engage directly and constructively with Commonwealth and state governments on current and future skills demands and how best to meet them. This new board will play a central role in directing substantial Australian government investment in skills and workforce in a development under the National Workforce Development Fund. This funding, matched by co-funding from employers, will be directed to areas of training that are critical for meeting industry needs and will provide more than 130,000 training opportunities for job seekers and people who are employed but who need to learn new skills. This agency represents the government and industry working together. Taxpayers' dollars are being leveraged to deliver more training, and for their investment employers are able to demand the skills and training they need for their workforces. In addition, the new agency board will improve Australia's long-term workforce planning and development to address skills and labour shortages and to contribute to improvements in industry and workplace productivity. It will collaborate with industry associations, industry skills councils, unions and employers to ensure that workforce planning is based on a shared, practical approach that meets sectoral, regional and small business industry needs. This is critical if as a nation we are to plan effectively for the future and the transformation of our economy. I note the strong support for this new agency among industry leaders as well as governments, as all have an interest in its success. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading",94

Bill read a third time. NA Member for Dobell The Clerk: Pursuant to standing order 106(c), the following notice of motion has been received from the member for Lyne: That this House censure the Member for Dobell for the: (1) length of time taken to publicly respond to issues under investigation from 2003-2006, and the damage this has done to public confidence and trust in the Parliament of Australia; and (2) lack of full co-operation by the Member for Dobell with state and federal investigatory bodies, and the damage this has done to public confidence and public trust in the Parliament of Australia. It is seconded by the member for Denison. NA National Vocational Education and Training Regulator (Charges) Bill 2012 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.",95
140,Ms LEY,BILLS," I rise today to speak on the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator (Charges) Bill 2012. This bill seeks to enable the Australian Skills Quality Authority, which I shall now refer to as ASQA, the national VET regulator, to impose a cost recovery model on registered training organisations for compliance audits and substantiated complaint investigations conducted by the regulator. The national VET regulator commenced from 1 January 2011, with responsibility for registering and monitoring national VET regulator registered training organisations. The regulator is established under the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Act 2011, which the coalition supported, and it has the power to examine quality concerns in all areas of the VET sector. National VET regulator registered training organisations must comply with the registration standards Censure at all times. So that is the main act, and this is a subsequent proposed act. We in the coalition will not be supporting this proposed act. The national VET regulator was established on a cost-recovery basis, and the main act entitles it to charge fees for registration. This act has moved away from the language of fees, which is a bit mysterious, and just talks about charges, particularly the ability of the regulator to charge for compliance audits and investigation of complaints about registered training organisations. Some fees apply from 1 July 2011; others will progressively apply in line with the regulators' implementation path to full cost recovery by 2014-15. So this bill is to authorise charges for services that are not application based-that is, the fees for registration-but which are instead for additional monitoring activities. This bill talks about these additional monitoring activities. The regulator is financed by parliamentary appropriations of approximately $95 million between 2011 and 2015, but it is funded on a progressively cost-neutral basis. Charges for the additional monitoring activities are part of the regulator's cost-recovery arrangements. Current estimates anticipate that these charges will amount to $2.1 million in 2012-13, rising to $5.4 million in 2013-14. That is a considerable amount of money that will be raised by these additional monitoring activities, and it will be raised from the registered training organisations themselves. We in the coalition have serious concerns about this. Before I get to some of the specifics, I say generally that we have already established a VET regulator. It does not work very well because not every state has signed up to it. This bill does not say exactly what the fees charged will be; only that they will be made by legislative instrument. It does not say to what extent they can be recovered, but it acknowledges that they will be quite high-an hourly rate, I believe, of at least $110, and that is just basis. If a complaint is substantiated, then an organisation has to pay. My question, just off the top of my head, is: what if it is only partly substantiated-who pays, and how much? This is the government saying, 'We're here to help. We've set up a regulator because that's what we really like doing: regulating, controlling, saying that one size fits all and determining how you in the small business sector run your business and your lives. We've set up a regulator. We're not going to tell you exactly how much it charges, but we want the parliament to approve a bill that says it can charge pretty much what it likes, because we've had a consultation.' I have not seen the details of this consultation, but I know that small businesses, if asked to say how much they are prepared to let the government recover from them from compliance activities that they are being monitored under, are hardly going to put up their hands and say, 'Yes, we're happy with anything, including if we have an overseas partner in our organisation'-and we know the importance of overseas education; everyone in this place knows that-'and the national VET regulator wants to go overseas.' The bill before us talks about 'reasonable costs'-meaningless reasonable costs. Before we know it, members of an organisation are going to be travelling overseas to check out the veracity and the bona fides of education partners that domestic organisations wish to partner with. In a hugely competitive international education market, imagine the disadvantage it is going to put Australian RTOsregistered training organisations-under. That is just one aspect. I know that the government is going to say that they are happy for the registered training organisation sector to proceed unregulated and unencumbered by any constraints on its as a activity and let loose to provide dodgy training. That is an old argument. We recognise the need for a regulator; we support the regulator; it is coalition policy that there be a national regulator. But I will in my further remarks alert the House to some alarming increases of costs, which really should not surprise anybody. You put a national regulator in place, allow it to recover fees and give it carte blanche. I mean no disrespect to the good public officers who work for compliance and regulatory organisations, but have we ever heard any of them say, 'I don't really need to be here, because everyone's doing a really good job'? No, they will tell you all of the problems in the sector and how, if they had enough resources, they would be out there checking and maintaining quality in a much more rigorous fashion. They tend to come from the perspective that people are doing the wrong thing. The coalition comes from the perspective that people generally do not do the wrong thing, but small business is struggling under the weight of the added cost burdens being imposed by this government, not least the carbon tax. We have no intention of supporting a bill that will impose an additional regulatory burden-no intention at all. The coalition supports the concept, as I said, of a VET regulator-no question. There are about 4,500 registered training organisations in Australia. Particularly where they operate in multiple states and territories, a national regulatory body makes perfect sense. Regrettably the system that we now have is not exactly what was intended, as two states, Victoria and Western Australia, have decided to retain responsibility for the regulation of their domestic VET sector, and Queensland is yet to pass legislation referring their powers and no date for the transition has been set. So ultimately ASQA has not got off to the best start. In addition to this, COAG agreed that ASQA would be established on a cost recovery basis, initially funded by partial cost recovery. But, as I outlined to the House, that is ramping up pretty quickly to full cost recovery. Previously the cost burden was borne by the states. So, at a time when business is already struggling under economic uncertainty and the threat of increased operational costs, they are going to have to dig deeper to fund their own audits. Section 7 of this bill states: If the National VET Regulator conducts a compliance audit of an NVR registered training organisation's operations, a charge is payable for: (a) the costs and expenses incurred by the Regulator in conducting the audit; and (b) if the audit is conducted outside Australia in whole or in part-any reasonable expenses incurred by the Regulator relating to the audit or part of the audit. ASQA themselves acknowledged in their submission to the Senate committee that reported on this bill that, for most RTOs, the proposed fees and charges will be an increase on what they have paid in the past. This is because most state and territory governments have subsidised the cost of regulation. Okay, I acknowledge it was a COAG agreement that organisations will pick up the tab. But there was a submission from the National Meat Industry Training Advisory Council which talked about the rapid increase in the costs of establishing as an RTO. This council sought advice from its RTOs as to their response to this legislation. One of them stated that moving to ASQA had already seen their audit costs increase from $3,000 to $17,000, and full cost recovery based on earlier modelling would push that up to $32,000. So it has gone from $3,000 to $32,000 under this fabulous piece of legislation. So the reality for many providers is a far cry from this vague acknowledgement of additional costs in ASQA's own submission to the Senate inquiry. Drilling down into their proposed fees we discover the following. Based on the average salary for a compliance officer, and making allowances for costs and overheads, ASQA indicates that the hourly rate would be in the vicinity of $111 an hour. You can see that for yourself in ASQA's submission to the Senate inquiry. Additional cost would be incurred where various subtasks were completed by other employees within ASQA. For a small business, $111 an hour is a very costly audit. Tradesmen charge a lower call-out fee. Couple this with travel costs and many RTOs, particularly those in rural and regional Australia, could really struggle to afford these charges. I note from a media article in yesterday's Fairfax press that the cost of a domestic airfare from Sydney to Mount Isa exceeds the cost of an airfare to Los Angeles. If costs like these are going to be passed on, then there would be providers forced out of business. We understand that large training organisations can to some degree absorb costs or manage certain efficiencies. But this is not just about the effect on small business, difficult though that is. This is about recognising that not every RTO is big, multipronged and across all states. There are some specific niche skills that one or two people do very well, and if they want to, or have to, set themselves up as an RTO, with all the wealth of experience they may haveI am just thinking from my aviation background of people who consult on human factors in aviation accidents or certain aspects of air crash investigations outside the main body or who build the capacity of airlines to cope with the regulatory environment that they face; a lot of these organisations are small and nimble and light on their feet and light in terms of their staff-under this regime, they are just going to say, 'We won't bother.' At the heart of our concerns is the impact that this cost recovery model will have on small business-the ones who have been given a very raw deal by this government. The high cost of doing business under Labor is breaking them-and passing on the cost of compliance audits might be the final straw. As I looked through the submissions to the Senate inquiry in depth, there was a constant theme from providers and their stakeholders. The submissions received by the inquiry reiterate the concern within the sector as to the lack of transparency with potential fees and charges and the impact that could be felt by, in particular, the smaller rural and regional providers. I gave also the example of an overseas provider, or a domestic provider who partners with an overseas provider, because that is a really good way to attract international students to Australia. In their submission to the Senate inquiry, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry pointed out that a cost recovery model could lead to two outcomesinsufficient monitoring of the quality of training delivery and/or fees, including fees for audit that are so high as to limit the participation in the training market of small business training companies. These increased costs further evidence the red tape that is stifling productivity and development in this country. The coalition acknowledges, as I said, that the intergovernmental agreement makes provision for states to continue to assist in meeting these costs. However, if they are not required to help reduce the end cost to the provider, it is my guess that they will not do so. The Queensland government made a rather useful, short, sharp and very much to the point submission to the inquiry, noting certain aspects of the bill. But it did say that, as an observation only, it adds complexity to the VET legislative framework to introduce an entirely new bill to provide for these charges. What was the reason that they could not be provided for under the original bill? Or are they just sort of being slipped in behind it because they would not have looked acceptable? That is my own observation, not the Queensland government's, but it is curious that we had to have a whole separate bill. The Queensland government says that this bill, as opposed to the main act, does not require the minister to obtain the agreement of the ministerial council before making a determination in relation to the amount of a charge. 'The fact that the bill provides for the minister to make a legislative instrument without the oversight of the ministerial council is actually inconsistent with the tone of the intergovernmental agreement for regulatory reform in vocational education and training.' The Queensland government goes on to make the point that the currently published Australian Skills Authority fee schedule does not include any advice about what audits, if any, are included in the registration fees. The draft fee schedule and charges attached to the cost recovery impact statement did provide, with regard to registration fees, that this fee includes the cost of one post-registration audit, either 12-month monitoring or a compliance audit. There is an inconsistency, which I think the government does now need to clear up. Does the registration fee actually provide for a compliance audit, the first one that an organisation may have to face, or will they now be hit under this subsequent legislation with another fee for just such an audit? The Queensland government also notes that the national VET regulator may at any time conduct a compliance audit of an NVR registered training organisation's operations to assess whether the organisation continues to comply with the VET quality framework. It sounds like an innocent statement, 'at any time conduct a compliance audit', but that could be an onerous regulatory burden on an organisation. This really does allow the VET regulator quite substantial power for when, how and how much it does and charges and inserts itself into the process of an RTO's operations. I reviewed the original second reading speech by the parliamentary secretary, who happens to be sitting at the table here today, on behalf of the minister who is in the other place. Again, I was alarmed by the language used: The main method by which ASQA monitors compliance is by conducting … audits. … investigates complaints … This bill will enable ASQA to recover … costs and expenses associated with these additional monitoring activities. ……… It is necessary for ASQA to conduct compliance Quality audits to ensure ongoing compliance with the VET Quality Framework and identify issues relating to the quality of VET. ASQA conducts a risk assessment on all registered training organisations (RTO) and this risk assessment is used to determine whether to conduct a compliance audit. Providers who have been assessed as high risk will receive more rigorous monitoring by ASQA. Compliance audits require a significant regulatory effort. This bill provides that, where the ASQA undertakes such an audit, a charge is payable … outside of Australia-any other reasonable expenses incurred. Audit compliance charges will represent the resources required to effectively audit a provider. If an organisation is struggling and not quite sure how it is going to fund next year's budget, what does it do? It ramps up the fees. So we may well find that providers are paying a component of overhead running costs for an organisation, which, under accounting practice, you could quite reasonably attribute to the exercise of an audit. As I said, I am very concerned that is just going to get away-like so much of this government's legislation when it comes to charging small business. Private providers, which are struggling under the current set of economic circumstances they are facing, will find that the government has carte blanche to charge them what they like. I want to note briefly that a provider electorate of Farrer came to me in the last week to say that they made an application to ASQA for one additional course, a certificate III in financial services. They lodged their application in 2011. On 26 April they received a request for additional evidence, which they provided. They asked how much longer they should expect to wait for registration and they were told three to six months. A basic registration for a certificate III course could take almost a year for the regulator to approve? How could a business that is making money from providing this service or providing training to jobseekers in conjunction with a job service agency operate in such an environment? When I hear stories like that I do not know the full circumstances and I intend to discuss this with ASQA-I do not have any confidence in this organisation. I do not have any confidence that it is not going to seek to undertake significant extra regulatory activity in order to provide the dollars it needs to administer its affairs and pay a staff of public servants. I am really not confident at all, and I would like to reiterate that the coalition will not be supporting this bill imposes additional red tape and cost burden on Australian small business.",95
141,Ms HALL,BILLS," I am not surprised the opposition is not supporting the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator (Charges) Bill 2012 before us tonight because the one thing that this opposition does is oppose everything. It does this not look at anything from a common sense point of view. The other thing that does not surprise me is that when regulation relates to the business side of the equation, the opposition oppose it, but when regulation relates to the people that are undertaking those training courses, the opposition supports it. So it is a very one-sided in my approach to operating registered training organisations, which is what this legislation is about. It is about ensuring that training organisations comply with the provisions of their contract to make sure they do they what they say they are going to do. What this legislation does is put in place cost recovery in providing the audits that are associated with it. It is very simple. It is not about targeting small business. It is not about making the life of small business difficult. It is about ensuring that small businesses that provide training actually provide the training they are supposed to provide. I know that practically every member in this House will have been confronted with a constituent that has been enrolled in one of these training courses only to discover that it does not deliver what they have been told it will or that the course is padded out in one way or another. Under the Howard government some really ludicrous situations existed. We had training organisations enrolling unemployed people. They would do the course, be placed in a job for about a week and then would no longer be employed. They would then be recycled back and do the that training again-the training, the job, the training, the job. All the time these training providers were milking the system; they were taking money away from the system. I want to put on the record here that that is the exception, because most registered training organisations are there because they believe in providing good, high-quality training to Australians who need skills to fill the positions that are available in the community and give Australia a skilled workforce. This legislation before us tonight will enable the national VET regulator, known as the Australian Skills Quality Authority, to recover reasonable costs and expenses associated with additional monitoring activity. The previous speaker was not at all happy with the term 'reasonable'. Her objections were very one-sided. If 'reasonable' relates to something that she supports, she will accept it; if 'reasonable' does not fit in with her picture of the world, she will not. There will be fees and schedules put in place with this legislation. If 'reasonable' fits in with regulation in relation to ensuring that the business delivers what it says it is going to, she objects to it. But if 'reasonable' fits in with reasonable compliance for an unemployed person to undertake training and if they do not fit in with the requirements, then she objects very strongly to it. I think on this side of the parliament we have a much more balanced approach. We accept that business plays a very, very valuable role in training and providing services, and we also accept the fact that there is a need for reasonableness to be associated with those people who are undertaking training. The cost-recovery arrangements are consistent with the Australian government's cost-recovery guidelines, and include fees and charges for the regulatory activities undertaken. The main method by which ASQA will monitor ongoing compliance of RTOs is by conducting compliance audits, which is a very reasonable way to ensure that RTOs are doing the right thing. The RTOs that are at high risk-high risk in terms of their long term performance-are the ones that will be assessed on a more ongoing basis. There has been widespread consultation on the legislation. As the previous speaker indicated, the Senate has looked at the legislation. The speech from the member of the opposition really showed that she has no understanding of the way RTOs work and no understanding of the system that is in place. She really needs to go and visit some of these RTOs. She needs to talk to people who undertake training. The first thing that is important is that the training provided is quality training. The next thing that is important is that there are linkages between the training and employment. Also, the government needs to be confident that these RTOs are doing the right thing. The new national VET regulator will have the power to examine quality concerns in all areas of the VET sector and exercise its responsibility based on a robust framework of the legislation and standards. That is what I think should be the expectation of this parliament and the expectation of the Australian people. Providers must comply with registration standards at all times. Noncompliance jeopardises registration, and so it should. For any member of this House to argue that an organisation that does not comply should be allowed to continue operation in the way it currently does is not really considering the interests of our workforce. The bill empowers ASQA to charge for monitoring activities additional to application based activities, including compliance audits and complaint investigations. This will act as an incentive for providers to improve quality, and that is something that we on this side of the House are very keen to see happen. It is all about the quality of training. When you provide quality training then you skill people up so they can fill the skill shortages that exist in the community. There are many skill shortages that remain. If I look at the Skill shortagessummary for 2011 I see that employers only filled 62 per cent of their vacancies and attracted 1.7 suitable applicants per vacancy. That is slightly higher than the 61 per cent of 2010. The hardest occupations to recruit in were engineering professions, automotive trades and construction trades-areas where RTOs can provide a very valuable role. But as a government we need to know that the role played by the RTOs is based on providing the skills to address the shortages that have been identified, that they are providing quality training and that the people who undertake the training will be able to find employment at the end of it. This is one of the most important areas of government, so it would be irresponsible for it not to be regulated, not to be monitored and not to have cost recovery in place. I urge those on the other side of this House to move away from their oppositional position. I urge them to look at the legislation, see what it is about and see how monitoring, ensuring compliance and undertaking audits can prevent abuses of the system. You need regulation to ensure that the right thing is done. The majority of RTOs do the right thing instinctively, because they are committed to the development of skills and to training. But there are some that are not, and there is a litany of examplesparticularly those that came to light when the Howard government was in power. We need to ensure that that situation does not go unchecked. This legislation goes together with a number of other initiatives that have been introduced by the government. It is very good legislation and it should be supported by all members of this House. Mrs ANDREWS (MCPherson) (20:01): I rise to speak on the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator (Charges) Bill 2012. I have spoken in the past about the creation of a national vocational education and training regulator, due to the need to maintain consistency across Australia. If every state were to operate its own system with its own regulations, the difficulty in ensuring compliance amongst the almost 4,500 VET operators, and ensuring that each student is receiving a quality education, would become exponentially greater in the years to come. With the introduction of legislation to that effect, the new Australian Skills Quality Authority has assumed the role of the registration and monitoring of registered training organisations from state and territory bodies. It does so through undertaking compliance audits and investigating complaints about registered training organisations. In past speeches to the House, I have stated that the government has introduced a supposed national system, which at this stage is still not operating nationally. I note that Western Australia and Victoria have still not signed up to the framework, whilst Queensland's parliament still has the legislation before it. So how can this be a national system when three states are missing from the framework? The obvious conclusion is that it is not, and that any truly national system cannot exclude any state, especially those that, combined, account for almost 12½ million of Australia's total population of over 22 million. The coalition in the past has been generally supportive of the creation of the Australian Skills Quality Authority, as there has been a definite need to ensure consistency across the country. Nonetheless, there has always been the concern that the organisation would be based on a cost recovery basis. This is compared to the previous systems operated by the states and territories, where registered organisations were instead given subsidies or financial support from their relevant government for registration and regulation costs. Because of this difference between the old and new systems, many registered training organisations will find themselves having to pay more for compliance than they used to-something that they may not have factored into their operating costs and would be of major concern to them. With increasing costs needing to be accounted for, it is likely that some providers may need to put up their fees for students or, alternatively, they will have to cut services so that they can simply provide the services in the first place. The Council of Australian Governments agreement that was struck between the Commonwealth and the states with respect to the Australian Skills Quality Authority states that the states will maintain the ability to provide financial support or subsidies to registered training operators. This is not mandatory but rather a choice by the states and territories. Given that many states are trying to rein in their budgets from former bad Labor governments, it cannot be known whether these sorts of measures will definitely be implemented. Another concern is the discretionary power of the minister to set the level of charges to be imposed on registered training organisations. Introducing a cost recovery model for the Australian Skills Quality Authority may potentially harm smaller and regional providers in the long term. As the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry stated in its submission to the Senate inquiry: … whilst ACCI supports reasonable fees to training providers as a market mechanism, we do not support the notion that ASQA has to be recovery body. The submission goes on to say: training The regulatory and audit approach should not be inhibited by a cost recovery model, as to do so could lead to one or both of the following two unsatisfactory outcomes:  Insufficient monitoring of the quality of training delivery  Fees, including fees for audit, that are so high as to limit the participation in the training market of small business training companies. The concern that is highlighted here is that, if cost recovery is not adequately supplemented by the federal government, there is a possibility that the costs recovered may not be sufficient to maintain the costs of enforcing compliance. Further, the model may lead to the charges of registered training organisations being increased to such a point-to maintain the Australian Skills Quality Authority's costs-that it would lead many registered training organisations to opt out of the training market altogether, and it would inhibit new providers from entering the market. This will affect competition in the market and ultimately leave students worse off due to a lack of choice of training provider and the range of courses that are offered and available in their area. The Australian Council for Private Education and Training submission noted another concern regarding section 7 of the bill and the costs incurred by the regulator. ACPET queried as to whether, as stated in the bill, 'costs and expenses incurred by the regulator in conducting the audit' would include travelling costs to where the registered training organisation is located or, in the case of some institutions, to the multiple locations where it is based. If this were the case then the viability of having VET institutions in rural and regional areas diminishes due to the cost burden not only a cost placed by the charges imposed by the cost recovery system but also because of the need to pay travel expenses for auditors and officials, which, depending on where they may be travelling to, could easily account for hundreds of dollars. Many of the concerns addressed in these submissions reflect those of registered training organisations in the VET sector. By increasing the costs on small providers, it places them in a much more difficult position to provide quality services. The priority of these providers is to give a quality education to their students and prepare them for the workforce, but they cannot do that if inadequately resourced due to large overheads. The VET sector not only supplies the future workforce with the tools of the trade and the current workforce with the ability to re-skill and improve their productivity but also provides thousands of Australians with employment. By limiting participation in the training market, we remove the ability of both domestic and international students to choose where they want to go to receive an education. That point has in the past been made by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Clearly, it is the right of all students to be able to choose where they want to go, and we should be supporting that rather than making it harder for them to do so. The contribution made by the VET sector and the educational sector as a whole to our national economy cannot and should not be underestimated, with education being Australia's fourth largest export and contributing $5.9 billion in 2009-10. Thousands of Australians pass through educational institutions every year and thousands more international students come to Australia to take advantage of our worldclass education system, both at school and in tertiary and VET sectors. All these things need to be considered when developing education policy and they should not and must not be placed in jeopardy. I will not go as far to say that the cost recovery model and the current system in place does so, but it does raise questions as to what is the best way to ensure consistent compliance nationwide and how we support the VET sector in growing and continuing to provide world-class courses to both domestic and international students. In summary, there are numerous concerns that have been raised by stakeholders with they are regard to the changes that will be implemented by this bill, and many of these need to be addressed. The current system cannot continuously be called a 'national' system, as I have stated, if a large part of the nation does not currently subscribe to it. Although I am supportive of a national regulatory system to ensure compliance and quality education throughout Australia, this system still has a long way to go before it can achieve its intended objectives. Debate adjourned. Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Obligations and Prudential Standards) Bill 2012 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.",100
142,Ms GRIERSON,BILLS," I rise to speak in support of the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Obligations and Prudential Standards) Bill 2012. This bill introduces additional powers for the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, APRA, to create prudential standards. It amends the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 in order to expand the duties for registrable superannuation entity licensees. It applies new trustee duties to RSE licensees who offer a MySuper product and applies duties to the directors of corporate trustees. The additional powers provided to APRA will enable the authority to make prudential standards in superannuation which will improve the clarity and certainty of prudential regulation by providing further detail on the prudential matters as set the enabling legislation. This is consistent with APRA's current ability to make prudential standards in the finance industries appropriate and is a sensible application of their experience to a different industry sector-the superannuation industry. The new prudential standards can apply to an APRA-regulated superannuation fund, connected entities, specified classes of super funds or any individual fund or connected entity. 'APRA has successfully established prudential standards in banking and insurance for many years,' the authority's Ross Jones said on 28 September 2011, 'and the establishment of such standards in superannuation will provide clear benefits to the superannuation industry as a whole and to its members.' I agree. This legislation is about extending peace of mind to all Australians and ensuring the responsible management of their superannuation funds, which they will reply upon in their retirement. The ability to make prudential standards will give APRA greater flexibility to essentially adapt to industry developments as they happen and give the authority the ability to provide regulated entities with clearer more suitable legal requirements, tailored to their unique needs. This industry is far too complex in nature for a one-size-fits-all approach. Current regulations governing the superannuation industry are certainly not flexible enough. They are unable to be amended in a prompt manner in order to respond to the various changes that occur within the industry. The diversity within the superannuation industry and the varying character and size of entities demonstrates the need for flexibility, which is what we are introducing with this bill. As disallowable legislative out in instruments, prudential standards must adhere to the Legislative Instruments Act 2003. This would include suitable and superannuation industry stakeholder consultation, ensuring that there is a degree of transparency and adequate process when it comes to making any changes. This bill will also require that trustees who elect to offer a MySuper product meet the new stringent obligations to support and ensure that the financial interests of its members are put first. This is a common sense and fair approach. It is the same approach that we adopted in the financial advice legislation, which is soon to be debated in the House. Trustees will have increased responsibilities for default members, the members who more often than not delegate majority of the responsibility for their superannuation through the trustees. Furthermore, under this legislation APRA must also be satisfied that a trustee will comply with new enhanced obligations and that individual directors comply with the enhanced obligations when authorising an RSE licensee to offer a MySuper product. The duties required of fund trustees will and be expanded to: give priority, first and foremost, to the interests of beneficiaries where any conflicts arise; develop strategies for insurance and risk; and require trustees to give regard to valuation information, potential and expected tax consequences, and costs in investment strategies. These measures are all designed to ensure that responsible, informed decisions are made and that fund boards are managed in an effective and accountable way. Our government is committed to protecting the money that hard working Australians have accumulated over their working lives and providing certainty for them in retirement. Under this legislation, the duties required of individual directors will be further clarified and separately identified. Directors must act honestly, exercise appropriate care and management of funds, and give priority to the interests of beneficiaries. While this all seems a common-sense and rational approach, best practice within the industry is not always evident. These reforms are necessary reforms. Certainty is required. As a federal Labor government, we strive for the betterment and protection of working Australians and their families, and this legislation is about ensuring that their entitlements-their superannuation-is looked after well. As with the vast majority of bills that this federal Labor government has put forward, this bill is about fairness and protecting working Australians. It was a federal Labor government that first introduced compulsory superannuation savings in 1992, and it is again a Labor government that is building upon that legacy. We are committed to strengthening superannuation through the minerals rent resource tax legislation, which has now passed through the Senate to fund our historic increase to the superannuation guarantee, from nine to 12 per cent, a change that will benefit 8.4 million employees across Australia. According to BT Financial Group, within 10 years, Australia's superannuation pool will double from $1.4 trillion to $2.8 trillion. This is too significant an amount of national savings to take a halfmeasured approach when it comes to industry regulation. As Minister Shorten has highlighted, for the majority of Australians superannuation is their second greatest source of wealth after their home. However, all too often Australian families do not know all that much about the people they have entrusted with this considerable asset. Australians should not have this unnecessary burdenthis uncertainty-hanging over their heads throughout their working lives. They should be assured that governance across the superannuation industry is of an adequate standard with quality assurance measures in place. They should be assured that money they have earned through fair and honest work in their lifetime, saved away and growing for their retirement, is being looked after adequately in a prudent and responsible manner. As good governments like ours know, it is always important to keep up with developments in industries and to initiate appropriate reforms. It is necessary that governments review operations within key areas such as the superannuation industry. The Stronger Super package represents our Labor government's response to the review into the governance, efficiency, structure and operation of Australia's superannuation system-the Cooper review - which was first handed to the government in 2010. As the review found, standards of governance have not managed to keep pace with developments within the superannuation industry. Among several key findings in the Cooper review was the finding that trustees and directors of trustee boards had difficulty in understanding the nature of their roles and the expectations placed upon them. The review also highlighted the rate at which conflicts of interest could arise due to the consolidation of the superannuation industry. For these reasons, it is important that we keep governance measures up to scratch and assist with the modernisation of this important industry, protecting national wealth and securing Australians' retirement. The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Obligations and Prudential Standards) Bill 2012 follows and builds upon the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (MySuper Core Provisions) Bill 2012, introduced in November 2011. It is the second component of legislative reform that our government is introducing to implement our MySuper and governance reforms as part of Labor's Stronger Super package. These were first announced by Minister Shorten, the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation, and I am very pleased to witness the ongoing work towards delivering these reforms. I note that there are two members in the House who have very much been part of audits and audit committee work with the Taxation Office, where we saw too many times that standards were not being upheld and that peoples' savings were at risk. Extensive industry, employer and consumer consultation have informed the development of these improvements. This is best practice and our government is to be commended for its engagement with industry stakeholders. With these reforms designed to achieve the protection of and assistance to the growth of member superannuation entitlements, who could actually say 'no' to greater returns or greater security for working Australians in their retirement? In my electorate of Newcastle, there are over 15,627 lost superannuation accounts worth $60 million waiting to be found. Of course, that data is now available for the whole country-and it is staggering. Along with many of my colleagues, I have done all that I can to inform constituents of the Australian Taxation Office's SuperSeeker website, to help them find and reclaim their lost super. But this figure is just one small indication that there remains the need for continued reform in superannuation. There is a need for people to be informed about the decisions they make in regard to their superannuation, and certainly there is a requirement for the people who manage superannuation funds to keep communicating with their members. Labor's commitment to reforming and modernising the industry aims to assist with these important tasks. I look forward to the government building on these superannuation reforms, with subsequent tranches of legislation due in the near future. These will include reforms to arrange the transition of member accounts from existing default superannuation products to MySuper products, prohibit the deduction of commissions from MySuper member accounts, introduce new rules for the payment of performance based fees by RSE licensees to investment managers relating to the assets of a MySuper product, introduce rules for the fair and reasonable allocation of costs between MySuper products and each choice product within a super fund, create additional governance measures relating to selective service providers, enhance data collection and data publication powers for APRA and create new disclosure requirements in relation to MySuper and choice products. Our government's agenda when it comes to superannuation is clear. As the minister has highlighted previously, superannuation assets in Australia are expected to reach $6.2 trillion by 2036. We are protecting the retirement savings of working Australians and their families. We are ensuring that their funds are managed responsibly and managed fairly. Our Labor government is strengthening superannuation with these many reforms, and I would say that many of these reforms have come from the work of some wonderful committees of this parliament. I congratulate all the backbenchers who work very tirelessly on committees to bring about reforms and hope that governments will respond to their recommendations. Of course, that is exactly what has happened in this case. We are also lifting compulsory super from nine to 12 per cent through the minerals resource rent tax. Historically and contemporarily, we are the party that stands for stronger super. A multitrillion-dollar industry is far too significant to be taken lightly. Stronger super is what our government is committed to delivering and I therefore commend this bill to the House.",104
143,Mr BRIGGS,BILLS," I rise to speak on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Obligations and Prudential Standards) Bill 2012. I agree in part with the member for Newcastle, on the point that she made that Australians expect that their superannuation will be managed in accordance with the most appropriate modern corporate governance standards. That is where I diverge from the member for Newcastle. The current climate, with what has occurred and is continuing to occur in this place and outside it, raises the necessity for us to reconsider whether this bill does enough, particularly in light of many of the recommendations in the Cooper review which have seemingly been ignored or, at this point, passed over by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation. I think it is time for us to reconsider because-and the member for Newcastle made this point-there is over a trillion dollars in Australian superannuation. A large portion of that, of course, is held in industry super funds, and in recent days we have seen several examples of concerns raised about the governance of industry super funds. This is an area where the minister is strangely silent in relation to industry super funds and the recommendations of the Cooper review. The first of the examples I refer to is a contribution yesterday in this House by the now Independent member for Dobell, where he said: Shemeaning Kathy Jacksonsat on the board of HESTA, collecting board fees for many years, rarely attending meetings. But when the union decided the board fee should go to the union, she left the board. The second examples are two stories which appeared in the Australian newspaper. Last Friday there was an article by Hedley Thomas headed 'Unionist took cash from developer amid $30m super investments'. There was a follow-up story in the Weekend Australian by Hedley Thomas which was headed 'Strategy doubts as union super fund gets burnt'. Those stories raised several very concerning allegations about the use of workers' money which has been invested in industry superannuation funds. We know from the statement by the member for Dobell yesterday that there are concerns that have come to light, I think to the surprise of nearly all members of this House. The extent to which workers' money has been used for inappropriate activities that has come to light has surprised all of us. In that sense, I think it is an opportunity for this parliament to reconsider the strength of this bill, and I call on the minister to indeed reconsider the strength of this bill and to reconsider whether he should look more this deeply at the Cooper recommendations in relation to directors' obligations when it comes to industry super funds. We know we have hit upon a bit of an issue because, when the Leader of the Opposition was reported to have made comments in the coalition party room earlier this year in relation to this issue, the following day the person who had benefitted more from industry super funds in their life than anyone in this country, Mr Garry Weaven, was reported as rejecting the comments as: … mightily insulting and a slur on the employer groups equally represented on fund boards alongside union officials. What's his implication: that the employer associations are being duped? It's like a return the worse days of 1980s bigotry. Indeed, it seems to me that, when there is a reaction from someone who has benefited so much from the current regulations relating to the matter, given what we have heard about the HSU in recent times, the HSU disease may have had a far wider effect than what people could possibly imagine. Therefore, it raises questions as to why the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation has not acted more quickly in relation to some of the recommendations made by Mr Jeremy Cooper as to the obligations of directors when it comes to industry super funds. My colleague the member for Bradfield, who has been raising some of these issues in a very considered fashion in recent weeks, wrote in the Financial Review: Of the 16 self-branded “industry super” funds, less than half disclosed fees paid to individual directors in annual reports. We also know that, contrary to good corporate governance standards, directors can sit on multiple boards, and we know that does occur. We know that the Secretary of the AWU, who spoke at the Press Club today about his fantasies of taking Australia back to some socialist operation, sits on multiple boards, as does the former secretary of the ACTU and several others. We know that when Cath Bowtell, who was the Labor candidate in Melbourne, lost the last election to the member for Melbourne, she was then appointed CEO of an industry super fund. So there are quite a number of issues relating to the operations of industry super funds and their directors which are conveniently forgotten in this bill. My erstwhile colleague the member for Bradfield also made a point in relation to this matter in another article he wrote in the Financial Review late last year, where he to said 'in the federal cabinet reshuffle on Monday' the new Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations 'retained his responsibility for financial services and superannuation.' He continued: This only makes sense if you understand the attraction to successive Labor governments of using the compulsory superannuation system to increase the power, influence and financial position of the union movement and its key personnel. Given what we have heard in recent days, weeks and months about the questionable practices of some registered organisationsor one registered organisation in particularin use of their members' money, it raises an increased need for us to reconsider what Jeremy Cooper recommended in that review. There is a litany of examples and much evidence around which says that this issue needs to be looked at with greater consideration. I refer to another example, which relates to an article, on 17 July 2011, in the Sunday Telegraph, referring to the former head of the Electrical Trades Union, Mr Bernie Riordan. At one point I think he was president of the New South Wales Labor Party. He was being sued by his own members over $1.8 million in fees that he allegedly pocketed while serving on four boards connected with industry superannuation funds. Interestingly, he also had those claims settled just days before being appointed, coincidentally, to Fair Work Australia. In recent days we also heard that one of the people who the member for Dobell mentioned yesterday in his long statement-50-odd minutes worth- Mr Michael Williamson, of the HSU, continues to sit on industry super fund boards, even though a series of allegations have been made, including by the member for Dobell, about some of those issues. This bill is conspicuous in its silence when it comes to dealing with the issues that Cooper raised in relation to industry super funds. It is the opposition's very strong view that these issues should have been addressed at some length some time ago. As Lyndon Baines Johnson famously said, 'Power is where power goes.' That is exactly what we suspect is going on in this respect. The member for Newcastle just repeated at length that the Labor Party 'stands for good corporate governance when it comes to superannuation', but that is not backed up by the facts. The regulations relating to the industry super fund network and the directorships in that respect are of course very different to what you would expect with a retail fund. Different standards operate with respect to Mr Weaven's allegation against the Leader of the Opposition, of course we include all members of those boards. We say that good corporate standards should be applied to all representatives, whether they be employer representatives or employee representatives. I say again that some of these accusations, allegations and evidence that were presented in the Fair Work Australia report which was tabled just two weeks ago have raised to a new level the possibilities and suspicions about how money can be misused in these organisations and associated entities. In that respect we think this bill is too weak and that it should be addressing those issues which Cooper raised, rightly, in relation to directorships of industry super funds. For instance, the Cooper review recommended a range of reforms relating to the governance of superannuation which have largely been ignored: that disclosure of conflicts of interest be mandatory, that directors properly disclose remuneration in line with the provisions that apply to publicly listed companies, that there be appropriate provision for independent directors on superannuation funds boards, and that directors who want to sit on multiple boards must demonstrate to APRA that they have foreseeable conflicts of interest. As I said earlier, we now know that some very senior trade union officials and employer officials also sit on multiple boards. In fairness to Minister Shorten, after much pressure from the shadow minister for superannuation, Senator Mathias Cormann, he finally made some announcements in relation to this issue on 27 April, long after Cooper had found and long after this bill had been drafted. As I say, it was very scant compared to what Cooper demanded. In that respect, the direct decision that the and, Prime Minister made, for the first time, allocating portfolios for ministers, which bucketed together the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation cannot be overlooked. That is the first time it has happened. Departments have never been linked before. The excuse given, of course, was that that minister had been responsible for that portfolio for some time. Indeed he had been responsible for that portfolio for some time. But it does just seem a coincidence that the minister who is responsible for regulating trade unions and registered organisations is now also the minister responsible for regulating one of the big income-earners for those organisations. I would put to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and to the parliament, that there is an inherent conflict in those positions. The Prime Minister should address that conflict because the two should not run together-they have got two very different considerations. I do not think I am the only person who perceives this conflict. I finish on this point: the coalition supports the best corporate governance structure and regulations that can possibly be in place to protect people's superannuation. It is important for our country that we have a strong savings arrangement for people to look after themselves in their retirement. As our population gets older, we must ensure that people are able to take care of themselves in the best way possible. It is not just through superannuation, of course. It is through a range of their own investmentstheir own home and so forth. But they must be in that position. So we do support, of course, the best modern corporate governance standards. We are concerned that this bill is not doing enough. It is not doing enough to address what we see are inequities, are differences between the standards that are applied to other superannuation funds and those of industry superannuation funds. And we know, because of what has been reported by the Fair Work Australia report in recent days, that there has been a range of misuses of hard working union members' money in respect of the HSU. We do not want to see the HSU disease inflicted on the industry superannuation network. It is a time for us to pause; it is a time for us to give greater consideration to what is in this bill. I urge minister to give reconsideration to the recommendations that Mr Jeremy Cooper made, to amend this bill, to make the appropriate changes, to crack down on ever increasing amounts of stories about misuse of workers' money and misuse of the superannuation money, and to do the right thing in this bill so that we can all have guarantees that our industry superannuation funds are governed in a modern and appropriate way.",108
144,Ms BRODTMANN,BILLS," That was an interesting contribution from the member for Mayo. It would be interesting to have a chat with him about what he thinks about industry super funds, actually, and what he sees as being the appropriate composition of a management board for a super fund. I wonder if it is white, Anglo Saxon males that were educated at Geelong Grammar. The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Obligations and Prudential Standards) Bill 2012, that we are debating today, is another example of Labor's commitment to ensuring we have a fair, regulated superannuation industry in Australia-a superannuation industry that Australians can have faith in as they work hard to save for retirement. Superannuation is a Labor Party policy through and through. It was a Labor government that first introduced the compulsory superannuation guarantee, and it is a Labor government that is now reforming super to ensure the retirement savings of Australian workers are better protected. The Gillard Labor government is committed to strengthening super, and we are doing this through a historic increase in the superannuation guarantee from nine per cent to 12 per cent. Around 8.4 million Australians will benefit from the increase in this superannuation guarantee. For example, a 30-year-old on full-time average weekly the earnings will now be around $108,000 better off at retirement. We are also working to make superannuation concessions fairer for up to 3.5 million low-income earners. Overall, our historic super reforms will lift retirement savings by $85 billion over 10 years and $500 billion by 2035. But it is not just this increase in the superannuation guarantee that will benefit Australians in retirement. Labor will also provide an annual contribution of up to $500 into the superannuation accounts of workers earning less than $37,000, from 1 July this year. The majority of the people that that will benefit, 60 per cent, are working women, working mums. Next year we will also get rid of age limits on contributions for time since the introduction of compulsory superannuation. We are also going one step further by creating a new low-cost superannuation product called MySuper, which is what this bill centres on tonight. The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Obligations and Prudential Standards) Bill 2012 is the second tranche of legislation implementing the government's MySuper and governance reforms. The first tranche of legislation was introduced to the parliament on 3 November last year as the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (MySuper Core Provisions) Bill 2011. This latest bill implements the next stage of the reforms by amending the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993. This bill is a critically important element of the government's Stronger Super reform package and will help to improve the governance and supervision of our superannuation system. The bill also introduces the power for the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, or APRA, to make prudential standards, which is in line with our banking and insurance industries. Ultimately this bill is important because it complements the government's reforms to boost superannuation savings. Australia should be able to have confidence in those managing their money and in the regulatory framework. As I said, at the centre of this bill is MySuper, a new low-cost and simple superannuation product that will replace existing default funds. MySuper products will have a simple set of product features, irrespective of who provides them. This will enable members, employers and market analysts to compare funds more easily based on a few key differences. It will also ensure members do not pay for any unnecessary bells and the first whistles they do not need or use. Superannuation funds will still be able to offer different products and will not have to offer a MySuper product, but only a MySuper product will be eligible to operate as a default product. What this means is that a fund's default product must meet the MySuper standards to continue to accept contributions from employees who have not exercised choice and nominated a fund. I believe that this will encourage the industry to become more competitive and that people who benefit most will be young workers. We know that in order to maximise your retirement income it is important that your super fund, particularly if it is a default fund, is a low key, high performing fund. This legislation will maximise retirement incomes by making sure that only those super funds that deliver and continue to deliver for their members will be able to be included as a default fund option in modern awards and enterprise agreements. It is estimated that 4.5 million Australians will hold a MySuper account once this legislation is fully implemented, and those people have the potential to be $40,000 better off in retirement. MySuper has been implemented in response to the Cooper review, a comprehensive review of Australia's superannuation system by the former deputy chair of the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, Jeremy Cooper. The final report highlighted that not everyone wants to make a choice about their superannuation and often default members are not adequately protected and will find themselves paying for services that they do not necessarily need. Although I am a strong advocate for financial literacy, particularly for women and particularly when it comes to superannuation, I do believe there needs to be adequate regulation of the industry to protect the retirement savings of workers and encourage more confidence in the superannuation industry. Recently I held the first of what I hope to be a number of financial literacy seminars for people in my electorate. It was run by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer and we held it at the Tuggeranong Seniors Centre. The seminar was very well received; it was a pilot seminar; and it provided an opportunity for people to learn about the scams that are out there now. I have spoken in this House many a time on the scams my family and my husband's family have experienced in very minor ways and the scams experienced by people in my community. It was a really good opportunity for us to talk about these scams and educate the community on the scams and what to avoid-if it looks too good to be true, then it probably is. There were many good, positive take-away messages from that seminar and I look forward to conducting more in the future. The Cooper review also found that superannuation governance standards have not kept pace with developments in the industry. It suggested there were difficulties for trustees and directors on trustee boards understand what is expected of them. It also found that, as the industry consolidates, it becomes more integrated, leading to more conflicts of interest. And that is why we are focusing on reforming the governance and supervision of our superannuation system. By giving APRA the power to make prudential standards in superannuation, it will have greater flexibility to effectively adapt to industry developments. It will also have the ability to provide regulated entities with clearer and more tailored legal requirements. This bill will also strengthen our response to the Cooper review by imposing new obligations on trustees that elect to offer a MySuper product, in particular compelling them to promote the financial interests of members more thoroughly. By introducing this tranche of legislation, the government is making it clear that trustees should have increased responsibilities for default members who generally delegate all aspects of their superannuation to them. APRA must be satisfied that a trustee will comply with the enhanced trustee obligations and that individual directors of corporate trustees will comply with the enhanced director obligations to authorise an RSE licensee to offer a MySuper product. These duties for individual directors will be clarified and separately identified, and will include acting honestly, exercising appropriate care and giving priority to the duty to, and interests of, beneficiaries. This change addresses the concerns raised by the Cooper review that accountabilities in the system had become obscured by the corporate trustee structure, and will clarify the standards expected of directors of corporate trustees. These changes, which will improve governance and supervision in the superannuation industry, are especially critical given the Gillard to government's historic commitment to increase the superannuation guarantee to 12 per cent, which, combined with existing growth, is expected to see super assets reach $6.2 trillion by 2036. As we raise the bar in areas such as financial planning, it is fair that we ensure there are improvements in other areas of our superannuation system, including in the operation of the funds themselves and the conduct of trustees. The Gillard government's reforms will make our superannuation system stronger, more efficient and will help to maximise retirement income for Australian workers. It is in our national interest to encourage more Australians to save more for their retirement and to understand how their superannuation works. I often see and often have conversations with women-and they are all women-coming into my electorate office or I meet them in mobile offices or just down at the shops who are really doing it tough. Many of them are in their late 50s or early to mid 60s; they feel compelled to continue to work and they are worried sick because often they are in the private rental market and they do not have enough superannuation to sustain a comfortable retirement. They realise that they will probably be on superannuation for a couple of years after they retire and then it is on to the pension. When I am talking to groups of young women, I always underscore the importance for them to plan for their super and plan to put money away throughout the course of their life. If they plan in advance-when they get married or in their early 20s-and they understand the ebb and flow of their career changes and how their finances change, they can plan to ensure they have a comfortable retirement and the appropriate superannuation. One of the things I am keen to do is to conduct a series of seminars-originally they were directed at women, but there has been a lot of interest from men too-about how to read superannuation statements. understanding what is actually in your statement you can then work out how much money you have, and you can then go and speak to a financial planner or do some homework and some research through the range of online resources-particularly government resources-and work out, 'All right, I need this amount of money for my retirement. How am I going to plan to make sure I have that money for that comfortable retirement?' Superannuation is a subject that is very dear to my heart, having spoken to these women who are really doing it tough and who realise that they do not have enough superannuation. That is why I am constantly underscoring, particularly to young men and women, to plan for their retirement and to do that through superannuation. As you can see, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, we have a very clear plan when it comes to superannuation and helping Australians save more for their retirement. But there is an onus on the superannuation industry to facilitate higher retirement savings through greater efficiency and lower fees. We are assisting lower paid workers and also helping older workers who want to contribute more to their super. We are raising the superannuation guarantee for everyone, which will have a huge impact on the nest eggs of 8.4 million Australians. Unfortunately-and we heard a bit of it tonight from the member for Mayo-those opposite think superannuation is the greatest con job ever. While Labor is getting on with the job of increasing the superannuation guarantee, those opposite have no plan because they want to scrap the mining resources tax, which is funding this historic rise in super. The coalition originally opposed Labor's introduction of compulsory super in 1992, By and I do believe that they remain a threat to the future retirement incomes of Australians. They still do not have a superannuation policy because they do not believe in it; it is as simple as that. Thankfully, the Gillard Labor government is committed to superannuation in Australia and is working hard to strengthen and improve this important economic policy. And it is working hard to ensure comfortable retirements for all Australians. This latest tranche of legislation will help make our superannuation system more efficient, transparent and fairer for the millions of people who have put their faith in it, and I commend the bill to the House. Mr VAN MANEN (Forde) (20:54): Before I get into the substance of the bill, I would just like to correct something that my colleague from Canberra has just touched on. The mining resource rent tax was never, ever going to fund the three per cent increase in superannuation contributions. It was going to fund a reduction of one per cent in the company tax rate. But, as we have seen from the budget that has just been handed down, that has been done away with. So now the three per cent superannuation increase is going to be entirely paid for by employers, and they are not going to get any tax offset all. It is wonderful thatMs Plibersek: You should have supported the tax cuts! Mr VAN MANEN: It is not a tax cut.",111
145,Mr Baldwin,BILLS,"Always against the employers! Mr VAN MANEN: Yes-always against the employers. Ms Plibersek: Why did you vote against the tax cuts? Mr VAN MANEN: You produced a pretty good budget that is punishing small business, so you have nothing to hang your hat on in that regard. In 2010 the IPA put a report out, Keeping super safe, and in that they made the comment that some 12 people control approximately $190 billion out of $220 billion in assets in the industry super fund network. It is this web of cross-shareholdings and directorships that would not be tolerated in the retail super fund network. There is also a lack of transparency and information on the investments and their relevant strategies. Industry super funds also make up, interestingly, some 84 per cent of award default funds-a significant and powerful financial position. This bill before us tonight is about addressing some of the issues raised in the Cooper review. But, again, the focus of this piece of legislation is more directed at the retail super fund market than at holding the directors and shareholders of the industry super fund network accountable. And, as I have just touched on, it does not deal with some of the issues that I have just raised from this report. But the bill does seek to increase obligations on superannuation fund trustees and directors generally, and more at specifically for MySuper trustees. It gives APRA the power to issue prudential standards in relation to prudential matters related to superannuation, and it contains provision for additional statutory duties for trustees of super funds-specifically MySuper trustees, where they must promote the financial interests of beneficiaries' returns in particular. They must assess annually the sufficiency of scale, or so-called scale test, and include in their investment strategy an investment return target and a level of risk for MySuper fund members. Just these three points in and of their own raise a number of questions. In particular, how is the investment return target set? What is the appropriate level of risk for MySuper fund members? Who is going to determine those? And what are the consequences for the trustees and directors of those MySuper funds that do not achieve those targeted rates of return or exceed the level of risk? Trustees of registrable superannuation entities must give priority to the interests of beneficiaries where conflicts arise. I think that probably is a much bigger risk in the industry super fund network than in the retail network. An explanatory memorandum makes mention of the fact that trustees must act fairly, but who defines what 'acting fairly' is? They are supposed to exercise the same degree of care, skill and diligence as a prudent superannuation trustee would. Who defines what a 'prudent superannuation trustee' is? They must have regard to valuation information, expected consequences and costs of their investment strategies, and offer a range of options sufficient to allow members to choose a diversified asset mix. Well-run funds already do all of these things to maximise the returns for their members. They must have an insurance strategy and meet additional duties in relation to insurance. They must formulate, regularly review and give effect to a risk management strategy, and maintain and manage the financial resources to cover operational risk. These are all sound ideals. The covenants of the default rules for the trustee governance in the super funds are similar to model rules for a company, and they would replace the existing, differently worded covenants contained within the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993. It is always worthwhile to support things that are going to simplify regulation and make it easier and clearer for our trustees of super funds or in any manner of business to do their job. Schedule 1 of the bill also sets out a series of new covenants and obligations that will apply to individual directors or corporate trustees and imposes a personal liability on directors by deeming them to be parties to the governing rules of the trust. Schedule 2 introduces the power of APRA to make prudential standards. As Australia's prudential regulator, APRA already has the power to issue prudential standards in relation to authorised deposit-taking institutions, life insurance companies and general insurance companies but, to date, not superannuation funds. The current powers for APRA do allow it to issue guidance material on expected standards. However, these materials are not legally binding. I think APRA has a reasonable track record over the years, and I think this is a sensible step in giving it this additional power. According to this amendment, the prudential tax standards will then be determined and drafted by APRA and they will become legislative instruments within the meaning of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 and will be disallowable by parliament. The Cooper review into Australia's superannuation system in 2010 recommended that APRA be given these standards-making powers. Additionally, the Cooper review made a range of recommendations relating to governance of superannuation, which has largely been ignored by the government. The recommendations include-and I have probably touched on these already-that disclosure of conflicts should be mandatory, that directors must properly disclose their remuneration in line with provisions that apply for publicly listed companies, that there be appropriate provision for independent directors on superannuation fund boards, and that directors who want to sit on multiple boards must demonstrate to APRA that they do not have any foreseeable conflicts of interest. The coalition strongly supports genuine attempts to improve corporate governance and transparency for directors and trustees of super funds, as well as improvements and enhancements to prudential standards in superannuation. As has been mentioned in a number of contributions tonight already, superannuation is one of the key pillars that Australians use to accumulate wealth to fund their retirement, so it is important that that money be properly looked after. However, we do not support this bill in its current form, because it imposes a vague annual scale test on superannuation trustees which would be impossible to administer in practice. The coalition has serious concerns about the new scale test provided in this bill, which requires trustees of superannuation funds: … to determine on an annual basis that there is sufficient scale, in terms of assets and beneficiaries, such as to not disadvantage the financial interests of beneficiaries relative financial interests of beneficiaries in MySuper products in other RSEs … Who is going to determine what sufficient scale is? Industry experts such as the Financial Services Council have indicated that such an external comparison would be impossible to conduct in practice, as a trustee will not have sufficient knowledge of other registrable superannuation entities to meet this test. The scale test is based on a presumption that larger funds invariably provide lower fees and higher returns to members. There is no evidence to indicate that this presumption is correct in all cases. The scale test, if implemented in its proposed form, could be another potential source of advantage to the larger superannuation funds because they already have existing scale, and their ability to gain significant additional scale is then almost enshrined in law. The scale test would create a significant new barrier to entry for new funds by making it more difficult for them to achieve the required scale from the outset, which would lead to a reduction in competition in the superannuation market. It may also lead to further consolidation and mergers of super funds that are driven not by an assessment of the overall best interests of the members but by concerns about meeting this technical and arbitrary test. Already industry groups have submitted that a better alternative would be an internal test based on a finite list of factors rather than the open-ended and poorly defined external test that the government has proposed. The government should withdraw this provision and embark on a proper consultation process with all participants in the superannuation industry to achieve a more appropriate and more workable outcome than the current flawed proposal. The coalition will move an amendment to remove proposed sections 29VN(b) and to the 29VN(c) of the bill, which impose the scale test. With MySuper not due to commence until 1 July 2013, we believe the government has ample time to engage in meaningful consultation with the industry if it wants to introduce a more practical test. This would assist in preventing potential negative consequences for members of affected superannuation funds. In addition to the scale test, we are also concerned about a new provision in the bill which may impose personal liability on directors of superannuation fund boards for meeting the collective obligations of the trustee board by introducing a series of new covenants for directors and deeming individual directors to be parties to the industry governing rules of the super fund. Section 52 of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 imposes a series of statutory obligations or covenants on trustees of regulated super funds. These covenants or obligations are exercised by the board of directors or the trustees, acting in a collective manner. This bill proposes to replace existing section 52 with a new section containing enhanced statutory covenants that will be imposed on all regulated super fund trustees, including MySuper trustees. The bill also contains a new section 52A which extends the covenants to individual directors of super funds. There is no equivalent provision in the current SI(S) Act. The new section would make individual directors personally liable for any breach of covenants by deeming them to be parties to the governing rules of the fund. The coalition strongly support enhancing and clarifying the law relating to the obligations of super fund trustees and directors. We also support introducing provisions that clearly deal with conflicts of interests of directors of super funds and ensure that, at all times, directors of super funds put the interests of fund members ahead of any other interests, including their own personal interest. However, there are some strong concerns about the mechanism that the government has used to attempt to achieve this. The bill attempts to introduce covenants that are imported into governing rules of every single super fund and then tries to bind directors to these covenants by deeming each director a party to the governing rules of the fund. The provisions of section 52A appear to reverse the long standing convention that boards of directors are jointly or collectively liable for decisions made by the board, including a trustee board, and that the directors are only personally liable if they breach their directors' duties, including their duty to act with reasonable care and diligence at all times. The provisions are so broadly drafted they may not provide certainty for directors who are trying to faithfully execute their duties that they are complying with the law. In conclusion, the coalition will closely monitor the impact of these new obligations on directors of super funds when they come into force and will act to address any issues that may arise. The government continues to ignore many of the sensible and important corporate governance recommendations of the Cooper review because the government continues to put the interests of its mates in the union dominated funds ahead of those of Australians in the superannuation system.

146,Mr FLETCHER,BILLS," I am pleased to rise to speak on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Obligations and Prudential Standards) Bill 2012. This bill amends the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act and purportedly increases governance standards for superannuation funds. Unfortunately, as is often the case, the reality is somewhat different from the promise. In the brief time available to me this evening I want to focus on three aspects of the bill which, in the coalition's view, are deeply troubling. The first is that the government has cherry-picked a small selection of the governance reforms recommended by the Cooper review and has conveniently neglected reforms which do not suit the agenda of its union mates. Secondly, the scale test, which is one of the centrepieces of this reform, does not make good sense in economic logic or day-today practice. Thirdly, the provisions which impose additional obligations on directors are illconceived and go too far. Let me turn to the first point, about the extent to which the government has cherrypicked certain changes recommended by the Cooper review into superannuation and has ignored other key recommendations, including the recommendation that the disclosure of conflict of interest should be mandatory and the recommendation that the so-called equal representation model should no longer be mandatory. Of course, I need hardly add that the equal representation model is code for union officials having a privileged role in the governance of superannuation funds. Another reform recommended by the Cooper review which is ignored in this legislation is that, where the equal representation model continues to apply to a superannuation fund, at least one-third of the directors on the board should be independent. In light of the scandalously bad state of governance recently revealed in the Health Services Union, and the flow-on implications for superannuation funds, these governance issues are of urgent importance. Let me remind the House that the government's problems with the Health Services Union are so severe that the Australian Council of Trade Unions has cut its ties with the Health Services Union. Yet until recently a significant number of Health Services Union directors have been appointed to the board of major superannuation funds, and several Health Services Union officials remain directors of major superannuation funds. Let me remind the House that Health Services Union boss Michael Williamson, a man against whom very serious allegations of corruption have been made, was until recently a union appointed director of First State Super, a fund with some $30 billion under management, funds which are there to provide for the retirement incomes of current and former New South Wales public servants. Just last month the chairman of First State Super complained that he had no power to remove Mr Williamson as a trustee of that fund despite the very serious allegations which had been made about Mr Williamson's conduct. Other Health Services Union officials on  Mylan, who is still on the board of First State Super. He is the assistant secretary of the Health Services Union of New South Wales and was recently described in the Australian as a long-time Williamson loyalist. Rosemary Kelly and Lloyd Williams, two other HSU officials, are both directors of HESTA, which has $18.3 billion of funds under management. Those who listened carefully to the member for Dobell's statement yesterday would have noted with interest his allegations about another HSU official, Kathy Jackson. The member for Dobell alleged that she was recently on the board of HESTA but stepped down once it became the policy of the union that directors fees needed to be paid to the union. I have not tested whether the allegation is correct or not, but it is an interesting insight into the attitude of the member for Dobell, a former union official, about the way positions on superannuation fund boards are broadly seen as prizes to be handed out to union officials. It is curious indeed that a union whose affairs have become a byword for mismanagement, corruption and failure of governance is in a position, by reason of design features of the superannuation system put in place by the Keating Labor government, to appoint its officials to the boards of major superannuation funds with responsibility for many billions of dollars. As the chairman of First State Super complained last month, if the conduct of the directors proves to be problematic or if there are other reasons why it might decide to remove them from the board, there is no capacity to do so because the appointment to the board is wholly in the gift of the relevant union. This is not specific to the Health Services Union. This is a systemic issue. There are dozens of superannuation funds in Australia which have up to half of their directors appointed by a union. That means that if there are flaws in governance, if there are flaws in the organisational culture in those unions then there is a real risk of those cultural flaws being transmitted to the superannuation funds. That is a matter which should be of great concern to the millions of Australians, most of whom are not associated with unions at all, most of whom are not union members, who have their superannuation savings invested in these funds on which union appointed directors sit. You would have thought that this bill before the House, dealing as it does with the governance of superannuation funds, purporting as it does to give effect to the recommendations of the Cooper review, would have dealt with the recommendation in the Cooper review to deal with the so called model under which union officials have a privileged appointment position on boards of superannuation funds, the so-called equal representation model. You would have thought that this would have been the perfect opportunity to give effect to the recommendation of the Cooper review that the equal representation model should no longer be mandatory. But Minister Shorten has chosen not to implement that recommendation. I note in passing that Minister Shorten is a former union official and a former union appointed director of a superannuation fund. I note that Minister Shorten was quoted as saying about the Fair Work Australia report into the Health Services Union scandal that he was 'appalled'. I am reminded of Captain Renault in Casablanca who was 'shocked' to discover that there was gambling going on. Let me turn to the second issue I want to raise, which is the scale test. This bill purports to impose a so-called scale test, which is fundamentally misconceived. It would impose upon directors a black letter law obligation each year to determine if there is sufficient scale in the fund-that is code for saying that the fund is big enough such that members are not disadvantaged. It is a bad idea for three reasons: it is deeply anticompetitive and serves the interests of the big funds while making it harder for smaller and newer entrants; the idea that scale is an absolute good is wrong; and the test as drafted is unclear, impractical and unworkable. Firstly, it is deeply anticompetitive to we will put into the legislation a criterion that the big funds can automatically meet and that the small funds are at a systemic disadvantage in meeting. It is hardly surprising in this context that the scale test has been pushed by the Industry Super Network, the lobby group that represents large industry funds such as Australian Super. Again, I remind the House it was a predecessor organisation of Australian Super that the present Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation was formerly a director of. I also remind the House that two other members of the parliamentary Labor Party, the minister for climate change and Senator Doug Cameron, were also former directors of Australian Super. In other words, there is a real concern that the policy agenda of the big funds is being pursued by this government. It is interesting that the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees, which represents the trustees of super funds across the board including industry super funds, is opposed to the scale test. They told the joint parliamentary committee: While accepting that scale may provide benefits to members, AIST confirms the position we put before the Committee. That is, the pursuit of optimal net returns to members having regard to risk considerations and the safe stewardship of members' benefits should the overwhelming obligation upon trustees … and this obligation should not be clouded, diminished or distracted by other considerations including scale. The second reason why the scale test is a bad idea is that it is simply wrong that scale is an absolute good when it comes to investing money. It is well accepted, in fact, that investment funds that are too big compared to the size of the market will effectively be precluded from taking up many investment opportunities. They cannot easily invest in small companies because the size of the investment stake they need to make as a say proportion of their large fund would swamp the size of the company they were trying to invest in. This is a well acknowledged problem in the whole area of funds management-that is, when the fund becomes too big certain investment opportunities, particularly in smaller companies, are precluded. And that is just one instance of the general proposition that to claim that scale is an absolute good, and that that is an uncontested matter such that should be put into legislation, is fundamentally ill conceived. Thirdly, the test as drafted is unclear, impractical and unworkable. As the financial services counsellors pointed out, it means that directors will be required to make a comparison with other superannuation funds when they may very well not have available to them the relevant information about the other funds. The nature of the agreement between a fund and its service providers may not be publicly known. So it is very bad policy indeed to put into legislation a provision which is so poorly drafted that in practical terms it is very difficult for directors of a trustee company to know what they have to do to comply with it. The ill-judged provisions in this bill seek to impose additional obligations on the directors of a corporate trustee as well as upon the trustee itself, for example, the duty to act honestly in all matters concerning the superannuation entity and a whole range of others. They all sound very worthwhile in principle. But when we consider the practicalities, one of the issues which is troubling is that the Cooper review essentially recommended that there ought to be the merger of the office of director and the office of trustee. The government correctly rejected that recommendation because of the confusion that would result, and yet this bill is now taking up that suggestion again. One of the things that is very troubling about these provisions is that they potentially make directors of a corporate trustee personally liable to beneficiaries. They materially deviate from the position in the current Corporations Law in which the obligations of a company are not ordinarily ascribed to directors. They will undoubtedly make it more difficult to recruit high-quality it directors to the boards of superannuation funds, because they will find themselves bearing specific obligations which are not borne by directors under the general corporate law. So these provisions have been very poorly thought through. There is a great deal of angst about them amongst what might be called the community of professional directors. The coalition has stated that we will be moving amendments designed to remove the provisions which result in this additional liability. I am sorry to have to tell the House that this bill, like much of what this government does, is not what it purports to be. This bill is purportedly motivated by a high-minded intention to improve the governance of superannuation funds, and as a principle that is one we can all sign on to. I strongly endorse the comments made by members of the House on both sides that superannuation is an extremely important savings vehicle. But it is very hard to overlook the clear fact that this bill fails, and conspicuously fails, to address the most important of the reforms which were recommended by the Cooper review, particularly reforms designed to break the union stranglehold on industry super funds. And the reason is undoubtedly the fact that the present minister, and those who put him into his position, like the current arrangements. The scale test is bad policy. There are key aspects of this legislation we oppose.",118
147,Mr HAYES,BILLS," Since the former speaker has outed the minister, the member for Maribyrnong, and Senator Doug Cameron, as being for my trustees of Australian Super, I suppose I should declare an interest in this matter: I am actually a member of Australian Super. I have certainly no inhibition in being part of industry superannuation. It has certainly served this nation well and many of the workers out there. In 1984 I was part of the campaign at that stage when I was an officer of the Australian Workers Union campaigning superannuation for blue-collar workers. At that point in time those that had superannuation tended to be in the whitecollar sector or public servants. The application of superannuation was a direct trade-off for a productivity increase. As opposed to a four per cent increase in productivity the union movement subscribed under the award based deal for a three per cent payment to superannuation. It was the first time award based employees had general access to superannuation. What followed, of course, was that in 1988 the Labor government brought in superannuation for all workers. That was three per cent of paid rates to all Australian employees. That was revolutionary. I thank the member for Bradfield in saying that superannuation is a good thing, and collective savings are a good thing. But go back and have a think about it: superannuation was opposed by those opposite at that stage. Superannuation now represents $1.3 trillion which is under management in this country. This is a great Labor initiative. As a consequence of those initiatives industry funds have flourished. But in terms of securing proper management, that has got to be an ongoing thing that causes all of us have an interest. We want to make sure that not only are the funds well managed but also that the members are being appropriately serviced in the modern, dynamic environment in which we live. The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Obligations and Prudential Standards) Bill 2012 is the second tranche in the legislation implementing the government's MySuper governance reforms. Trustees that elect to offer MySuper products will have to meet the new obligations, in particular to promote the financial interests of members. The government has decided to for introduce enhanced trustee obligations for trustees of funds that offer MySuper products, recognising that trustees should have increased responsibilities for default members who generally delegate all aspects of their superannuation to them. Further, APRA must be satisfied that the trustee will comply with the enhanced trustee obligations and that the individual directors of corporate trustees will comply with the enhanced director obligations to the authorised RSE licence and offer a MySuper product. These are pretty significant things. It is going to ensure that there is a default position for all Australian workers who do not go out there, particularly in the casual sector, and elect a product. The product that their superannuation will go into will be one that subscribes to those principles of MySuper. The duties required of a superannuation fund trustee other than a SMSF will be expanded to give priority to the interests of beneficiaries. Where conflicts arise, the former strategies for insurance and risk will have regard to the valuation and information, expected tax consequences and the cost of the investment strategies. This is actually imposing those responsibilities directly on to the trustee and APRA must ensure that that does occur. Trustees not complying with those requirements are not satisfying the conditions of MySuper and therefore are in a position of being in default of their responsibilities. These things are very important, particularly, as I say, where you have a situation where $1.3 trillion is now under managed funds. This is something that our economy is well and truly benefiting from and will continue to benefit from. It is not a matter of how we entice directors to invest in things such as national based infrastructureDebate interrupted. NA",121
148,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT," Order! It being 9.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Frazer, Miss Sarah Clark, Mr Geoffrey Mrs MARKUS (Macquarie) (21:30): Tonight I would like to pay tribute to a beautiful and intelligent young woman who was taken too soon and unnecessarily: 23year-old Sarah Frazer was finally about to fulfil her dream. She was on her way to study photography at university in Wagga Wagga. She wrote to her aunt on her Facebook page: My car is pretty much all packed up except my bed linen and a few loose ends. Her car was packed. Sarah was on her way, on a new adventure that should have seen this beautiful and adventurous young woman achieve her dreams. She left her home in Springwood in the Blue Mountains on 15 February. The world was her oyster. But her dependable car, loaded with all her possessions, failed Sarah when she needed it most, breaking down along the way. With no other option, Sarah pulled to the side of the road. She Hume Highway just two kilometres south of Mittagong. The shoulder along this stretch of road was not very wide, but she pulled over as close to the guardrail as possible. Despite parking against the safety guardrail, Sarah's car remained stranded out in a 110-kilometre per hour lane, leaving her directly in harm's way. Passing cars and trucks that were travelling at high speeds had to swerve to get around her. Sarah knew it was not safe, but her car had stopped working. It was loaded with everything she owned. What was Sarah to do? Sarah called roadside assistance for help. Because she was in an unsafe location they advised that they would need to send a tow truck to move Sarah and her car to a safer location. She waited for close to an hour and half as trucks and cars came up behind her at high speeds and swerved around her. Eventually a tow truck and well-regarded Southern Highlands local, Geoff Clark, rushed to Sarah's aid. Sarah and Geoff prepared the car for towing. It was not safe, but Geoff was committed to helping Sarah move her car from that dangerous location. It is believed that the truck driver may simply have seen the two vehicles too late, but Sarah and Geoff died instantly. The deaths of these two innocent and treasured people is a tragedy that could have been avoided if the breakdown shoulder had for been wide enough to allow Sarah's car to be completely out of the high-speed lane. I have had the honour of meeting with Sarah's parents, Peter and Judy Frazer. These two people, who lost their precious daughter so soon and suddenly, have made a commitment to make the roads in New South Wales safer for everyone. This tragedy and the loss of their beautiful daughter have inspired them to take action and to submit a petition to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly requesting that roads across New was on the South Wales be audited. The petition requests that the New South Wales Legislative Assembly introduce legislation requiring that all major roads, highways and freeways have breakdown lanes and road shoulders that meet the Austroads standard of 2.5 metres. In this way, the life-and-death risks faced by drivers, passengers, first-call services and emergency services will be mitigated. The petition also requests that the New South Wales Legislative Assembly enact 'slow down move over' legislation requiring drivers who see flashing hazard lights on a roadside vehicle to slow down to half the posted speed limit and move into an adjacent lane, away from the vehicle displaying the flashing hazard lights. This will minimise the risk of injury and death for drivers, passengers and the first-call service and emergency service personnel who are providing assistance and protection to the driver and to their passengers. Sarah's parents are neither unreasonable nor bitter. In the words of her father, in a letter written to my office, Peter states, 'It would seem common sense to expect that federally-funded roads should require shoulders wide enough for a vehicle to break down and be out of harm's way.' Last week the New South Wales Liberal government promised improved highway safety, accepting the petition for wider breakdown lanes. The petition, which I am proud to signed, had 23,000 signatures-1,000 for every year of Sarah's life. The New South Wales Minister for Roads and Ports, the Hon. Duncan Gay, has publicly agreed to have Roads and Maritime Services undertake an audit of major roads, highways and freeways to ascertain which sections do not meet the Austroads specifications. I call upon the federal government to review the federal guidelines when providing funding for roads infrastructure, so that tragedy will bring about real change with regard to how roads are built. We need to work towards ensuring that the federal government provides funding for road infrastructure only in circumstances where all roads and highways meet the Austroads standards. A fundamental expectation of the Australian community is that our highways will provide safe passage for our families. I believe it is our duty, one way or another, to ensure that our roads are safe. Tonight I wish to honour Sarah's parents, Peter and Judy Frazer, for their commitment, for their passion, for their love for their daughter and for their bravery. Robertson Electorate: Health",123
149,Ms ONEILL,ADJOURNMENT," I rise this evening to highlight two very significant developments in health within my electorate, and that is the start of works on two very vital projects. The Central Coast Regional Cancer Centre and the Woy Woy sub-acute rehabilitation unit are the two key pieces of infrastructure that I am very pleased to be speaking about this evening. Both of these projects are being delivered thanks to significant investment in regional infrastructure for the health sector through this federal government and directly through the national health agreement struck between say I Prime Minister Gillard and the New South Wales state government. Without the determination of the Prime Minister to strike a national deal on health, I think it is fair to say that these much-awaited projects would still be in the 'planning and promises' stage rather than in the building and delivering phase. The two projects, the Gosford cancer centre and the Woy Woy rehab unit, will provide essential health services for the Central Coast community. I really cannot stress the point enough that these two new facilities will make life so this much easier for so many people on the Central Coast. As a Labor Member, I am only too well aware of the additional burden that cancer sufferers on the Central Coast have had to bear. They have had to endure the challenges of travelling to either Sydney or Newcastle in order to receive their treatment. During the time that I was door-knocking prior to the election and in the time since I was and have been overwhelmed by the generosity and courage of people who share their stories of the experiences that they have had and, in their recovery, the energy and passion that they have invested in making sure that other members of our community do not have to suffer the difficulties that they have suffered. They have committed their lives to making sure that they make a better lot of it for everyone else. I think that that is a great indication of the character of the electorate of the Robertson, which I am so proud to represent in this place. Similarly-though not in terms of cancer in particular-I have heard many stories of struggle from many elderly people who were impacted by the closure of the Woy Woy rehab unit by the previous state government. I heard stories of pensioners being forced to catch a myriad of buses and trains to travel from the peninsula, in the southern part of the Central Coast, to Wyong Hospital on a daily basis to visit their partner. For cancer patients and rehabilitation patients alike, these stories of struggle will no longer be the case because of this government and its commitment to get these two vital health facilities up and running. As a member of parliament I have been very proud of the efforts of our community to convince the government of the merits of these projects. Dare I say, I do not think the rehab unit would have ever got off the ground again without the power of the peninsula at the helm. There are a number of people that have fought and lobbied governments of all persuasions to make this happen, and I have been honoured to work with them to see their dreams, and the dreams of thousands of other coasties, come to fruition. First, I would like to commend Kathy Smith and Mark O'Dwyer of Cancer Voices Central Coast for their tireless work in bringing a regional cancer centre to the coast. I was only thinking of Kathy Smith this morning. Having delivered that project, she is now lobbying for significant improvement in palliative care, and I commend Senator Claire Moore for the excellent breakfast that was held this morning in the Great Hall to deal with another vital issue that is of consideration, certainly for this government. Kathy has been a terrific advocate for families and patients who are living with cancer, and I am very proud to have someone like her working for us on the Central Coast. The team behind Woy Woy Hospital and bringing the rehab facility back to life should also be very proud of their work and all they have done for the people of the peninsula and the coast at large. Even after being told by the state government that it was impossible for a resuscitation of this rehab unit, Ivan Kinney never gave up. He never let the dream go and never once thought that this vital facility could not be brought back. I also want to acknowledge the hospital auxiliary for their passion and commitment to the community based and community minded Woy Woy Hospital, especially Phyllis Thomas and the secretary, Olivenne Barron, and committee members Rhonda Finch and Patricia Harding for their great contributions. It is a tremendous testament to the people power of the peninsula and the passion that so many in our community have for better health services. Once again, it is an honour to work with these dedicated Australian citizens and see the great work being done in Robertson and across the Central Coast for so many others who will benefit from this investment in infrastructure. It is a signature of the Gillard government. Hinkler Electorate: Medical Services",124
150,Mr NEVILLE,ADJOURNMENT," In prefacing my remarks tonight I would like to thank the government for two grants to my electorate: one for an oncology cancer unit in Bundaberg-a $5 million project-and one for a $5 million extension to the cardiac facilities at the Friendly Society's Hospital. is quite a recent unit, which I had the honour of opening a year or so ago. So I suppose I am singularly lucky in the Hinkler electorate that in Bundaberg I have two private hospitals and a base hospital and in Hervey Bay I have a private hospital about to be built-a $100 million hospital-a state hospital and also a day surgical hospital. With that in mind, things look very bright in my electorate. But I think sometimes we take for granted that the provincial cities are the be-all and end-all of medical services and forget that we need to extend those services right out into even the most remote areas-and we all know the stories of how difficult it is to get doctors into really remote country areas. But then there are other towns that are not cities but are pivotal towns, hub towns, that play an important part in community life. One such town is Childers. Childers is well known, of course, for that dreadful backpacker fire, but it is an absolutely beautiful town, sitting up on the top of the red ridge with its leopard tree lined main street, with a mixture of very modern and colonial shops. It is quite a beautiful place, and it is matched by an equal amount of spirit amongst the people of the town. What I have seen emerge there, especially in the last five years, is a new style of medical community. I had the privilege this last week to open a new radiological facility and to commission a CAT scanner. A CAT scanner in a town of 6,000 is quite unheard of, but two people in Childers, Jim Burstow and his wife, Clare Fitzgerald, and their team of professionals decided to do that in Childers. They also offer a full range of radiological services, including X-ray and ultrasound. That has meant that Childers has become a hub for places like Gayndah, Biggenden, Torbanlea, Howard and It Woodgate, with all those smaller communities coming into Childers. So here we have a town of 6,000 with facilities that some provincial cities do not have and in fact all those that do have them have only got them in reasonably modern times. We need to realise the necessity of modern medicine at the doorstep of people's lives. We do not look to the effects that remoteness has on people in country towns. When you see people like the Burstows going to the trouble of doing this, you are filled with admiration. It was a great honour to open their new premises and to commission this new tomography machine. I once again thank the government for investment in my area. I like to be bipartisan about health services. I think they are very much appreciated and it gives two levels of great health care in the electorate of Hinkler. Hindmarsh Electorate: Glenelg Football Club",126
151,Mr GEORGANAS,ADJOURNMENT," I rise tonight to celebrate the success of the Glenelg SANFL Football Club's new lights at Gliderol Stadium, which were partly funded by a $190,000 grant from the federal government. I have lived in the western suburbs of Adelaide my whole life and, way before I entered politics, I always followed the SANFL. I have been a big fan of local footy. In fact, I am actually the No. 1 ticket holder for one of the clubs, West Adelaide Football Club, which I have followed all my life. As the current member for Hindmarsh, people constantly talk to me about the good work that these local footy clubs are doing in their communities and Glenelg Football Club is no exception. Back in 2010, when I was down at Glenelg, I spoke to the CEO, Rob Nelson, about how the club was going, and in particular what the federal Labor government could do to help support all the good work it does in the community. That is because footy clubs have a fantastic, brilliant season. way of breaking down barriers, building communities, striving for achievement and promoting healthy, active lifestyles and an opportunity for children and teenagers to play a great, magnificent sport. So we workshopped the problem together with Rob and the then Minister for Sport, Kate Ellis, the member for Adelaide. She came up for a meeting and we discussed what we could do to help. We came up with a plan for the government to partner with a club to help them out. It turned out that one of the key problems at Glenelg Football Club was that the oval could not be used for night matches because the lighting was not good enough. Glenelg had already done a lot of groundwork and planning for new lights, but the finances needed a bit of a boost to make it a reality. That is why I was so pleased to announce an election commitment in August 2010, together with Kate Ellis, for $195,000 towards the installation of lights at Glenelg Oval. I was incredibly proud to deliver that money and attend the official switching on of the lights together with the member for Adelaide recently. Now that they are installed, the Glenelg Football Club has been able to expand its operating times and provide a more flexible schedule for use by not only football teams but also the wider community in the area, for whom it will be a great asset. That is important because one of our priorities is supporting sport better into the future than it has been in the past, whether that be at school, state or elite level. I just want to read out an article written by Tim Williams that appeared in my local paper, the Guardian Messenger, on 10 May 2012, because it sums it all up. The title of the story was 'Bays crowd figures up' and it goes on: GLENELG Football Club says night games have boosted home crowds by 35 per cent so far this More than 5800 fans watched the Bays defeat Sturt under lights on April 27. That followed a crowd of more than 6000 for the Tigers' first night match against West Adelaide in March, while almost 5000 turned up for the clash against South Adelaide last month. Glenelg chief executive Rob Nelson said the dub was ""absolutely delighted"" with the response to night football. ""People are coming for the spectacle,"" he said. ""You walk around on a Friday night and see a lot of teenagers walking around in Glenelg merchandise in a safe environment. It's opened up our club and our team to a broader demographic."" Mr Nelson said extra lighting had been added to the scoreboard after complaints from fans that it could not be seen clearly during the first night game. Rob has since written to me to tell me: ""We believe this increased patronage to be largely as a direct result of night football"" ""We have not had any reported incidents from any match so far as a direct consequence of night football. The new sports lighting has enabled a safer environment for our senior teams and junior development teams for training. We have already been approached to run a charity event under lights later this year such is the interest This is a great outcome. It is a great outcome for the Glenelg Football Club and a great outcome for the Glenelg area. It means more families are joining the local footy community, more people are getting access to the grounds, and the club is better able to engage with philanthropic ventures, like the proposed charity event. I take this opportunity to congratulate all the players, the staff and the volunteers at Glenelg on this fantastic achievement, although it probably meant quite a few late nights for them in planning and preparing and weekends of work. What a fantastic outcome for the Hindmarsh community. (Time expired) Macarthur Electorate: Everyone Can Dance Grech, Ms Tara",126
152,Mr MATHESON,ADJOURNMENT," I want to take this opportunity to congratulate more than 120 members of my community who took part in the Envy Personal Training Winter Charity Challenge last week. These locals braved the cold to take part in training sessions over four days to raise more than $6,000 for a local charity called Everyone Can Dance. Everyone Can Dance is a notfor-profit organisation based in my electorate that supports young people in Macarthur who live with a disability. The group organises social and respite outings for people with disabilities and aims to help them overcome obstacles to become active and equal participants in their community. Today I would like to pay tribute to the president and founder of this charity, Tara Grech. It is hard to believe that Tara is just 24 years of age. She was only 20 when she started organising events for charities to support people living with Down syndrome, autism and cerebral palsy in the Macarthur area. It started off with a disco for children with a disability to raise money for several charities including the Cerebral Palsy Alliance and Autism Spectrum Australia. In 2010, when she was 22, Tara decided to start her own charity and registered Everyone Can Dance, which now supports many families in my electorate. When Tara started the charity she asked local parents what their needs were, so she could cater for families in Macarthur. She said the main issues bought up by local parents were socialisation and respite to give parents and carers a break from the 24/7 care for their children. So Tara started holding art classes for people with a disability aged five to 30 to give parents a break. She is now extending her programs to include parent support meetings and workshops while their children are taking part in the activities. Tara had a big inspiration to start this charity. Her brother David, who is now 22, lives with cerebral palsy. Doctors told David's family that he would never walk and would not be able to live a normal life like other children, but he proved them all wrong. David goes to the gym every day and he even drives a carwhat a fantastic achievement. He lives every day to the fullest and is an inspiration to other people in my community who live with cerebral palsy. Tara said she was driven to help local families after David had trouble getting involved in sports and other social events because organisers were worried about insurance. He was apart from the community, not part of the community. This is why she wanted to start a charity that would give people living with disability the chance to socialise with others and take part in a range of fun activities. As you can imagine, Madam Deputy Speaker, Tara is very passionate about her cause, especially the need to raise awareness in my community so that everyone will be treated equally, whether they have a disability or not. Tara said her main goal for the charity remains the same today as it was on day one-to improve socialisation for people living with disability and respite for their parents or carers. While art classes and social outings are currently available, Tara also wants to implement a program with local sporting groups to help them include people with disabilities in their sports teams and clubs to help combat obesity. This is a young lady with a very big heart who has dedicated her life to helping those less fortunate be more confident, self-reliant and involved in our community. Of all of Tara's aspirations there is one I admire the most. That is her goal to improve community acceptance and perceptions of people with disability. By breaking down these barriers Everyone Can Dance is enabling people living with disability to interact and participate in community events, to be more confident and independent in any field they pursue and to live full and rewarding lives. The charity raises funds through donations, fundraising events, membership and sponsorship. Events like the Personal Training Winter Challenge on the weekend will help the charity to organise supervised outings and events and provide individuals and their families with support services. I attended the final day of the charity challenge on Saturday and was very impressed by the number of people who took part. Rob Mann and his team from Envy Personal Training organised the event and did a great job bringing so many people and businesses from my community together. It was great to see people from all walks of life and many different fitness levels take part in the challenge. From teenagers to senior citizens, fitness fanatics to the not-so-fit myself, small business owners and many local residents-they all had a great time competing for a great cause. This was a fantastic example of my community coming together to support each other, and I felt very proud of all their efforts. Even the local media was represented in this charity challenge by Krista Thomas from C91.3FM, who put in the hard yards for her team and gave some of the blokes a run for their money. Local photographer Sharon Robertson also donated her time to take photos for the charity. Sharon is a lovely lady who is well known by my community for her involvement at many community charity events across Macarthur. This is why tonight I have done one of my favourite things in this parliament and praised the generous spirit of giving that is alive and well in the Macarthur community. Times may be tough, but the people of Macarthur are always willing to help those less fortunate than themselves, and that is something I am very proud of. I would also like to thank the following local businesses and individuals who supported this event: Landcom, Simmons Painting and Decorating, Platinum Personal Training, Splashbacks with Glass, DNM Designs, Camden Valley Inn, Naked Tan, 21st Century Pest Management Services, Club Cycle, Sports Spirit Narellan, Liz's Hair Stop, Ultimate Paintball and Pat Farmer. (Time expired) Chifley Electorate",128
153,Mr HUSIC,ADJOURNMENT," Last month I announced the winners of the Chifley Young Leaders Awards at a ceremony in Mount Druitt. I initiated these awards last year to recognise the positive contribution young people made to the local community over that year. I hope the Chifley Young Leaders Awards like encourage young people to start thinking about the issues that matter to them-not just within school but also outside the classroom and in the broader community. Education was a big theme among our entrants this year, focusing on the value of education in cultivating learning and paving the way for future opportunities. I would like to congratulate the joint winners of this year's award, Hanan Aziz and Pascal Moussa. Hanan, 17, from Mount Druitt, had an entry which explored domestic violence from the perspective of it being a human rights issue. The judges were particularly impressed with the passion put into Hanan's entry, which opened with an expressive poem and delved into the effects of domestic violence on men and women alike. Pascal Moussa, 17, from Whalan, explored community pride and the media-critically thinking about how often the negative perception about an area is attributed to a postcode and what can be done to celebrate diversity as a community. Eighteen-year-old Blake Fry from Hassall Grove, who last year completed year 12, was awarded second prize. Blake's entry explored how an education revolution could be built through an interactive curriculum where students could step into a teacher's shoes a day through peer-led programs. His practical ideas statement also included providing smaller classes and more options for school tutoring as a form of educational enrichment. I would like to thank the judges, Majidi Warda from Blacktown Council and Cassie Scerri, a youth worker at the Ted Noffs Foundation, Mount Druitt, who had the unenviable job of sifting through all the entries and choosing the winners. Another initiative I have been proud to launch has sought to recognise the efforts of women in our community who have looked to improve the welfare and prospects of others in neighbourhoods across Chifley. I was delighted that Cassie Scerri was awarded the Chifley Young Woman of the Year for her work with the Ted Noffs Foundation implementing music, dance and art workshops for disadvantaged boys and girls. Leading Senior Constable Cerise Britton from the Mount Druitt police and Tarsa Linsdell from Housing NSW were jointly awarded the Chifley Woman of the Year for 2012. The main award is the Coral MCLean Award, which I named in honour of a tireless community worker for Chifley who last year lost her battle with cancer. Blacktown resident Bernadette Agyepong received a highly commended award for her work advocating on behalf of women refugees at SydWest Multicultural Services. The winner of the Coral MCLean Award was Rita Wright. She received this award for her work mentoring Indigenous children and their families at the Tregear Presbyterian Preschool, along with all of the support that she has given to Anglicare. It was most appropriate that Aunty Rita won the inaugural Coral MCLean Award, as she is someone who has benefited from the support and friendship that Coral MCLean, who for donated 100,000 hours of her own time to the local community, gave so many people in our area. One of Coral MCLean's lasting legacies is the Mt Druitt and District Reconciliation Group, which she helped to establish more than 15 years ago. Last Saturday I had the great honour to walk with the Mt Druitt and District Reconciliation Group at the annual Mount Druitt Reconciliation Walk. The annual walk and festival, now in its 15th year, had a number of stalls that included groups from the Mount Druitt Learning Ground and TAFE. It encompassed painting workshops, local performers, speakers and family entertainment. It is a highlight of the Mount Druitt calendar, and I want to congratulate all the volunteers who made the day possible along with the Mount Druitt Reconciliation Group. Many local cultural celebrations like the Reconciliation Walk bring the community together. The Pacific Islander Multicultural Day held a few months ago in March was organised by the Australian Samoan Group Inc., and was a fantastic day of food, arts, crafts and music. I also had the pleasure of attending the Pacific Islands Mount Druitt Action Network-PIMDAN-AGM at Mount Druitt, attended by the Samoan High Commissioner from Canberra, Hon. Lemalu Tate Simi. Many of the PIMDAN members also took part in the Chifley Pacific Islander community round-table which I hosted with my colleague the Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs, the member for Corio, Richard Marles. The round-table was a great forum to discuss ideas and feedback from a number of local community groups, with representatives from Chifley College Bidwill, the Plumpton Tongan Association, the Samoan Women's Association, Peteli Tongan Uniting Church, Blacktown Samoan Methodist Church and many others. It was a great event, and I thank them for their participation. World IBD Day",129
154,Mr FRYDENBERG,ADJOURNMENT," I rise to acknowledge World IBD Day, which fell on yesterday, 21 May. IBD is an acronym for inflammatory bowel disease, perhaps better known as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Affecting approximately 70,000 Australians, Crohn's disease and colitis are debilitating conditions that target the intestine and other parts of the digestive tract. Extreme diarrhoea, fever, weight loss and abdominal pain are common symptoms that dramatically impact a sufferer's quality of life. Often diagnosed between the ages of 15 and 35, Crohn's and colitis hit young people in their prime just as they are finishing off their schooling or beginning their career journey. With no cure and medications that can go only so far, many of those affected must resort to complex surgery to have parts of their diseased intestine removed, or commit to a life of suffering in silence. I had the privilege last week of meeting with a number of people living with Crohn's and colitis. They, together with parents, grandparents and siblings of sufferers, gave me a window into the lives of those affected by the disease. Stories of depression, dropping out of university, being unable to keep down a job and the deep fear of revealing to one's friends and employers the true state of their physical condition were just some of the anecdotes I heard at the meeting. These sufferers of Crohn's and colitis recalled the constant disruption to their everyday lives and their inability to do things that we often take for granted, such as travelling by plane, which they would avoid at all costs in the event they were unable to access a toilet. Others told me of their intense and continuous pain, which could see them hospitalised for stints of more than six months. Such a lifestyle, such a condition, could not be wished upon anyone. Also at the meeting in my electorate office last week were Francesca Manglaviti, Chief Executive Officer of Crohn's & Colitis Australia, the peak national body, and Dr Greg Moore, a director of CCA who is also a medical expert in the field. CCA has their offices in Hawthorn in the heart of my electorate. Francesca and Greg talked about the mission of CCA-namely, to educate the community about Crohn's and colitis, to generate funds for research and program development and, most importantly of all, to provide sufferers with support, counselling and a help line that receives more than 1,000 calls a year. They also talked about the challenge ahead: how to build greater awareness and understanding in the community of Crohn's and colitis and reduce the stigma which is, unfortunately, so commonplace in our community. This is not just a moral imperative for us all but also an economic one. An extensive report by Access Economics on the economic costs of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis found that these conditions cost the nation $2.7 billion a year in lost earnings, premature death, absenteeism, allocated health expenditures, informal care, out-of-pocket expenditures and a host of other financial burdens. Thankfully, the report lays the path for going forward, recommending: education programs to assist early diagnosis, including for GPs and emergency departments; better access to pharmaceuticals and biological therapies; a more targeted and focused effort on geographical areas of need for specialist care; enhanced employment programs; support for the carers; and better funded research and development. These measures and other important steps like direct funding for the CCA and financial assistance for specialist IBD nurses in every state and territory could make an immediate difference. When combined with a community-wide awareness campaign and a destigmatisation program, we could alleviate some of the silent suffering of those who live with Crohn's and colitis. You can judge the quality of a country by the size of its balance sheet and its list of achievements but, in the end, this will take you only so far. What really counts is a nation's values and its willingness to help those less fortunate in community. I know that I speak for members on both sides of the House when I say Crohn's and colitis is one such cause which is deserving of all our attention and for which we must do more. Working with my colleagues, including the members for Oxley, Bowman, Chifley, Melbourne Ports, Boothby and Denison, and many others who have joined the Parliamentary Friendship Group of Crohn's and Colitis, we stand ready to make a difference. With 70,000 Australians already affected by IBD, and that number predicted to rise by 23 per cent in just the next eight years, we cannot afford to wait. We must act now, and we must act in a comprehensive manner, for thousands of our fellow Australians are counting on us. (Time expired) Coral Sea  tonight to speak on a topic near and dear to my heart: the preservation of one of the world's great natural jewels, the Coral Sea. The Coral Sea is globally recognised as an extremely important marine region due to its unique biodiversity and World War II history. Recent international studies have highlighted that the Coral Sea is one of the last remaining areas of the world's oceans where large-scale and biologically rich ecosystems remain relatively intact. Its reef systems support tropical ecosystems rich in hard and soft corals, sponges, algae, fish communities and other sea creatures. Many globally threatened corals and other marine animals are known to live there. Many species are known to occur only there and nowhere else in the world. A vast pool of biodiversity is yet to be discovered in the region-and who knows what benefits they will bring to health and other fields of endeavour? As I am sure many parents in this chamber the with children under 10 years of age would be aware, the Coral Sea is also home to a fish named Nemo. In Australian waters the coral reef environment is an unspoiled paradise, and some of the reefs in the French controlled waters of New Caledonia also provide wonderful opportunities. The Coral Sea's historical significance must also be mentioned. It was the site of the Battle of the Coral Sea in May 1942 which turned the tide of World War II in the Pacific. We must never forget the defence personnel who perished in these waters during this significant battle; the first significant battle where the Japanese were defeated. I have had the honour of representing Prime Ministers Gillard and Rudd at the commemoration of the Battle of the Coral Sea at Newstead House in Brisbane many times since I was elected. To this day our American allies recognise the importance of this area-the Coral Sea-in our nations' histories. Both on land and at sea, the opportunity to protect such noteworthy and pristine environments do not come along in too many lifetimes. Preserving the Coral Sea is a rare opportunity for our generation and for this parliament. I have been contacted by numerous groups and many of my constituents urging me to support increased protection for the Coral Sea. In fact, just this morning I met yet again with representatives of Global Ocean Legacy Australia about the Protect Our Coral Sea campaign-and certainly Queenslanders would have seen the full-page ad that they took out in the Courier Mail on the weekend. Protect our Coral Sea is a joint campaign supported by regional, national and international conservation organisations, including the Australian Conservation Foundation, Greenpeace, the Humane Society International, the National Parks Association of Queensland, the Queensland Conservation Council, Wildlife Queensland, deep sea fishers and many others I will not list because of time constraints. It is their goal to establish a large, world-class, highly protected marine park in the Coral Sea that will provide a safe haven for marine life, which is good for deep-sea fishes, and will recognise its historic significance. The safeguarding of the Coral Sea is a matter of great importance to concerned people, and rightly so. I encourage all people in my electorate to find out about this matter so that we might help protect this international and national treasure. I also encourage all my parliamentary colleagues on both sides of the chamber to work together to protect this precious area and its fragile marine life. Finding Nemo is not enough; now we must protect his home. I also call on the Queensland Premier, Campbell Newman, and his cabinet to show support for this matter of public importance. As the minister for the environment, Minister Burke, said this afternoon during question time, 'Unfortunately, it only took Premier Newman a fortnight after saying he wanted to enforce national environmental laws to then turn around and say he wanted to tear them down.' Hopefully, this troubling attitude will not continue. I hope that Mr Newman and his government are much more reasonable about the Coral Sea than they appear to be in these early days about the environmental protection of koalas. many The Australian government is committed to improving the protection of our marine environment. I will continue to advocate for the better protection of the Coral Sea not only because of public concern but because it is the right thing to do. This is a legacy moment for our generation and for this parliament. As I said, finding Nemo is not enough; now we must act to protect his home. Far North Queensland: Insurance Industry",131
155,Mr ENTSCH,ADJOURNMENT," I rise this evening to raise serious concerns about the continued failure of the insurance industry in Far North Queensland. Some two months ago the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs tabled its second In the wake of disasters report after a comprehensive inquiry into the affordability of strata title insurance in Northern Australia. During the inquiry I heard some heart breaking stories from people in my electorate who are suffering huge financial pressures due to the skyrocketing costs of insurance, the total unaffordability of insurance and, in many other cases, the lack of availability of insurance for their properties. These are people whose homes and investment properties had, in many cases, not been affected by either Cyclone Larry or by Cyclone Yasi, yet the insurance companies in the north had determined to penalise these owners, taking absolutely no notice of ameliorating circumstances such as topographic location, the age of their homes or standard of maintenance. The report was tabled and it was a very good report. The previous speaker was involved in it, and I commend him for his outstanding efforts. When the report was tabled, I was pleased to see that it contained some substantial recommendations, including that the government: investigate the risk assessment methodologies of insurance companies; examine the reasons for the lack of competition; and check whether improper or anticompetitive behaviour was taking place. A deadline of 1 October was given to complete the reviews. At this point we are approaching the halfway point of the allocated period and I truly hope that progress is being made. Since the inquiry in late January I have continued to receive evidence of insurance quotes that have increased up to 800 or 1,000 per cent. They are the ones that can still get insurance. Many of the insurance companies are not providing any cover whatsoever in this region. One letting agent in Cairns, Linda Tuck, reported that last year the cost of insurance for a two-bedroom, onebathroom duplex with a value of around $350,000 was $941. This year she was told that the insurer, Lumley, had withdrawn from domestic property insurance for all locations above Mackay. With only two insurers willing to quote, the prices jumped to the ridiculous level of $4,803 with Vero and $4,439 with CGU. Redlynch resident Mr Ron Mason got off relatively lightly, yet his home and contents insurance has still doubled in the space of a year despite the fact that he lives on a hill well above any potential flood zone. Ron was astounded to be told that the increase was due to 'the reassessment of risk after a number of natural events', and worse, 'a commercial decision to recover losses incurred'. Mr Mason wrote to me in disgust and said: I consider myself now speaking for thousands of people in North Queensland who are becoming aware of this institutionalised financial discrimination based on localised hardship. This is far from the Australian way. In my view it is blatantly obvious that the market has clearly and totally failed. These companies are acting in a discriminatory way in Northern Australia and what they are doing is, I believe, both criminal and disgusting. There is no doubt that they are price gouging. We have to stand up and say that this is not good enough. What makes me so angry is that it is the mums and dads, small investors and pensioners who are paying the price. After the report's recommendations were released I urged the insurance companies to show some social obligation, have a heart and provide affordable insurance. I thought that would be more preferable than waiting for government intervention, but it appears that I was wrong. The review was originally on strata insurance, but now the pain has spread across all areas of Northern Australia from bed and breakfasts to rural properties and landlord insurance. The government has until 1 December to outline a way that it can bring affordable insurance into the region. At that time. I will be demanding that insurance companies who cherry-pick based on postcodes as a way of minimising market exposure spread their risk across the spectrum, otherwise I will be strongly advocating that they be prohibited from selling insurance across the country. If they do not want North Queensland postcodes they should not have the opportunity to provide insurance anywhere in this country. It is an absolute disgrace what they are doing and they need to be held absolutely accountable for these practices. Banks Electorate: Hurstville Adult Dental Clinic",133
156,Mr MELHAM,ADJOURNMENT," Last Thursday, 17 May 2012, the Minister for Health, the honourable Tanya Plibersek MP, visited my seat of Banks. Specifically, the minister was there to visit the Hurstville Adult Dental Clinic and to hold discussions with representatives from the South Eastern Sydney and Illawarra Area Health Service. The visit followed the government's budget announcement that $515.3 million would be spent over the next four years for dental health reforms. The majority of this funding will be directed at treating patients on public waiting lists. The Hurstville Adult Dental Clinic currently has two chairs which are used for up to 18 patients a day. While we were there a local mum and her family waited as one of her children received a thorough dental check. He did not seem too concerned about it, and we saw him emerge later, unscathed and with his blue toothbrush. Not far from the dental clinic is Hurstville Public School-which, coincidentally, I had visited earlier in the day-where another dental chair is available for eligible children to a dentist. Approximately 47 per cent of the New South Wales population is eligible for public oral health services. Sadly, many of these people wait for years, in some cases, for treatment. It is estimated that New South Wales will receive in the order of $110.8 million over three years to begin the process of reducing the dental waiting lists. At the Hurstville dental clinic, the Director of Oral Health at South Eastern Sydney Illawarra Health, Dr Meredith, showed us around the two surgeries, and we met one of the oral hygienists. He explained that the surgery will be expanding by two chairs following building work. Mr Terry Clout, the Chief Executive Officer of South Eastern Sydney Illawarra Health for New South Wales, spent time with me and the minister discussing public health issues. What struck me most about both Mr Clout and Dr Meredith was their obvious dedication and commitment to public health care. Mr Clout talked about his experiences working in regional and rural New South Wales in New England and the Hunter, as well as in the mid-North Coast. They are both committed to reducing health disadvantage, especially in the regions where getting dental health care is not always as straightforward as it tends to be in the suburbs. The government's funding will provide the foundation of the provision of dental services that will ensure that those most in need will get care when they most need it. Another government initiative is the allocation of $450,000 to non-government organisations to coordinate the provision of pro bono dental health services for those in greatest need. The government will increase the Voluntary Dental Graduate Year Program from 50 to 100 placements per year by 2016. An important part of the government's visit funding, and well understood by Dr Meredith and Mr Clout, is the allocation of $77.7 million over four years to rural, regional and remote areas. The purpose of this funding is to encourage and assist dentists to relocate to areas of need. Relocation grants will be available to dentists to assist in moving costs and grants for the purchase and fit-out of dental facilities. Overall, I am very impressed with the quality of care provided by the Hurstville Adult Dental Clinic, and with the dedication of those who represent it. The federal parliament has a moral and legal obligation to involve itself in the dental care of our nation. It is one of only eight referendums since federation that have passed. We have a mandate from the people as a federal government to involve ourselves in dental care. The people gave us that mandate. So the notion from those on the other side that this is an area that should be left to the states is bunkum. When you have a referendum, when you have a change to our Constitution that is so rare, you grab it. is like the Aboriginal referendum, which the national government has used to assist Indigenous people in this country, to protect them from the states at times when the states were abandoning them and discriminating against them. So I was very impressed with my visit with the minister to the Hurstville Adult Dental Clinic, and with the professionalism, the dedication and the passion of those professionals involved. I look forward to more public money flowing over the years to this area. Moncrieff Electorate: Law Enforcement",135
157,Mr CIOBO,ADJOURNMENT," I rise to raise an issue of serious importance on the Gold Coast, and that is the ongoing issue of law and order. The concern that constituents in my electorate have is what appears to be an ongoing surge in people not abiding by the law and in particular what appears to be an ongoing turf battle between organised criminals, mainly outlaw motorcycle gangs. The reality is that on the Gold Coast we continue to see too many shootings and too many bashings. In the last 48 hours there have been two further shootings on the Gold Coast and frankly I and I know the community have had enough. We are sick and tired of the way in which these outlaws conduct themselves and put fear into the community. In a tourism town like the Gold Coast perception is everything. At a time when Western Sydney is also plagued by these sorts of troubles, the reality is that people perceive the Gold Coast to be unsafe. That perception might as well be the truth and the reality is fewer tourists in a city like the Gold Coast. This comes on top of the fact that the Gold Coast is already less competitive when it comes to attracting tourists as a direct result of Labor's It imposition in the budget of a further $600 million of tourism taxes on the industry. In the last 48 hours, a volley of shots were fired on John Wayne Parr's Gold Coast gym. He is a kickboxing champion on Kortum Drive in Burleigh Heads, who owns the Boonchu Muay Thai Gym. Police are yet to  says he does not know the motive for the attack. That notwithstanding, we have had another random shooting of a small business on the Gold Coast. The night before, two 14year-old boys were terrified when someone banged on the front door of their home. One of the boys looked through the window to see who it was and shots were fired, injuring through shrapnel one of the boys when the gunman saw a person-in this case, a 14year-old boy-looking through the window. Only a matter of weeks before that, probably a mere 1½ kilometres or so from my home, two men were bashed, allegedly by bikies. One was so badly beaten with a baseball bat that teeth were found in the yard of that person's home. In addition to these attacks, we have seen continued assaults and violence by outlaw motorcycle gangs. There is no doubt that it is all tied directly the drug trade and those seeking to ply their trade in our city. The simple reality is this: people should not have to tolerate this kind of lawlessness. What is required is a two-pronged approach. I note the new mayor of the Gold Coast, Mayor Tate, called for an additional 200 police for our city. I am exceptionally grateful that the new state LNP government has its priorities right and it has already committed to having an additional 100 police stationed on the Gold Coast. That is a step in the right direction. It is an important first step as part of retaking control of our streets and providing a very strong and salient message to all Gold Coasters that we will not tolerate this kind of lawlessness. But more is required. I think it is high time, frankly, the federal government got its priorities right. It is high time that the federal government initiated a strike force and a dedicated squad of federal police, with beefed-up resources if need be, to deal with this issue in South-East Queensland, in Western Sydney and in other parts of the country where we continue to see this kind of violence seemingly taking place without any clear indication that there has been any increase in resources by law and order both at a federal and state level to deal with the issue. How long must we stand by and watch the federal government sit on its hands? How long do we have to heed the calls of the police who say that they need more resourcing? What we need is a government, like this government, to start to get its priorities right, so we stop seeing the kind of waste that we have seen from this Labor government and start to have those funds apply to something meaningful that improves the quality of life for people in my electorate, in my city and across the nation. That is what I am calling for-a dedicated squad to tackle back to organised crime with specific focus on outlaw motorcycle gangs and the thugs that operate them, who in turn infect Australian children with the drugs that they try to peddle. It is high time that this government made that a priority. Carbon Pricing",136
158,Mr ZAPPIA,ADJOURNMENT," Over coming weeks, councils across Australia will set their rates for the year ahead. With a price on carbon taking effect on 1 July, the community will quite rightly be asking what impact carbon pricing will have on their council rates. It is a question also being asked by local governments across Australia as they prepare their 2012-13 budgets. Already, exaggerated claims of significant increases to council rates, attributed to a that price on carbon, are being reported in the media. It is therefore important to look at the facts relating to the impact of a price on carbon on council rates. This issue can be complicated because councils each have their own priorities and local obligations. The issue is further complicated because in some cases, not in all, the impacts of a carbon price on landfill costs must also be factored in. I will address that matter separately. The Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal of New South Wales has examined this question for New South Wales councils and presented a detailed report on its findings. I have read that report in full. From my council experience, the findings of that report would apply equally to South Australian councils as to, in all probability, most councils around Australia. In summary, the report concludes that a carbon price of $23 a tonne will contribute a 0.6 per cent increase to council rates. That is about $3.30 yearly, or 6c per week-I repeat: 6c per week-and is less than the 0.7 per cent carbon price effect on each household estimated by Commonwealth Treasury. The reason for the lower figure is simple. Councils rely on a local government cost index which better reflects council costs than does the National Consumer Price Index. Around 40 per cent of council expenditure is on salaries and wages. Because of the government household assistance measures, salaries and wages increases would not be impacted by a carbon price. That leaves around 60 per cent of council expenditure possibly subject to a carbon tax. A detailed breakdown of that expenditure by the Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal has not only identified the likely costs to each individual expenditure area but aggregated those cost increases. It concluded that 0.6 per cent is the likely increase to councils arising from a price on carbon. Waste management costs vary greatly between councils and therefore each council will be impacted very differently by a carbon price. Waste facilities which generate less than 25,000 tonnes of emissions annually will not pay a carbon price on emissions and therefore waste management costs for councils using those facilities will not be affected. Waste facilities which exceed 25,000 tonnes of emissions annually will be required to account for those emissions and may incur a cost. However, there are two important considerations with respect to that liability. Firstly, even if a landfill incurs a greenhouse gas emissions liability, that liability does commence until 1 July 2013. The carbon price only applies to waste deposited after 1 July. Emissions from existing waste, referred to as legacy emissions, are not included for liability assessment. Furthermore, waste takes time to start decaying, and the government has set out rules which deem emissions in the first year as being zero. Therefore, there will be no carbon price liability for any landfill in the year 2012-13. Secondly, landfill operators have the opportunity to capture greenhouse gas emissions and earn money. For example, landfills may be eligible for Carbon Farming Initiative carbon credits for the destruction of methane, which can be used to offset the carbon price or sold for a profit. Landfills that create electricity from captured methane are also eligible for tradeable renewable energy certificates, which can also generate income under the Renewable Energy Target scheme. Because legacy waste emissions are excluded from any liability, it is expected that carbon farming credits from landfill waste will exceed liability on landfills in the period through to 2020. The Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency have estimated that best practice capture of methane emissions can reduce the future carbon price liability to less than $8 per tonne, or around 13c per week, to each household affected by the carbon price. Ratepayers should be asking their municipal authority what it is doing to reduce landfill tonnage and what measures are in place to capture and reuse landfill emissions. In summary, no carbon price liability will be incurred by landfill operators in 2012-13. After that, only landfills which exceed 25,000 tonnes of emissions per annum will incur liability, and all landfill operators have the opportunity to offset those liabilities by not emissions capture and reuse strategies. Finally, a price on carbon will add an estimated 0.6 per cent to council rates, and the government has factored that increase into the household assistance measures.

I also want to talk a little about the current economies in Europe face deep economic challenges sovereign debt crisis and restore growth. Developments global financial markets-the US share market May and the Australian market is down by economic instability but, because we took action jobs through our stimulus package, we are happening abroad. While some sectors of the doing very well as a nation. We have strong a huge pipeline of investment, very low debt time as promised. Let us put these facts in context. Solid outperform every single major advanced unemployment rate is 4.9 per cent. That is per cent-and far below other advanced economies. creation with around 800,000 jobs I would like to take a moment to reflect on tremendous achievement. If we had listened stimulus package, we would be in a situation were out of a job. Around 70 per cent of infrastructure which will have a long-term legacy alone, over $108 million has been invested program in improving the quality of education investment kept the construction industry going when there was a sharp downturn in other Australia and in my electorate. I heard time Education Revolution projects in my electorate communities on the lasting benefits to their also congratulations from those involved in people in the construction industry who knew this Building the Education Revolution program couch twiddling my thumbs while I looked for It is worth contemplating the difference indeed the difference that is made by that contemplating the waste that would have occurred waste I am talking about is the waste that comes we do all we can to improve support and services It also says a lot about the values of our nous of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer make the long-term investments that we need in infrastructure. This is because we know that a nation's long-term prosperity but that education life path to better jobs, to higher wages and economic environment. We can see that many as they struggle to deal with their in Europe have triggered volatility in is down by seven per cent since the start of eight per cent. We are not immune from this during the global financial crisis, supporting in a very good position to weather what is economy are hurting from a high dollar, we are growth, low unemployment, contained inflation, and we are returning the budget to surplus on growth means that our economy is expected to economy over the next two years. Our less than half the rate seen across Europe-10.9 And, we have a fantastic record of job created since Labor came to office. the government's record on jobs because it is a to the opposition, who did not support our where hundreds of thousands more Australians the stimulus package was devoted to building for our nation. In my electorate of Isaacs under the Building the Education Revolution provided to students and generating jobs.

That is the difference we have made. that has been made by the stimulus package and kind of economic policy in general. It is worth had we not stimulated the economy. The with recession-failed businesses, lost jobs and long-term unemployment. The opposition occurs in every single human activity: it hindsight to some kind of waste somewhere in There is the first kind of waste, which I have long-term unemployment-and the other kind aspects of some projects and, even there, just program as an example, only a very small proportion generated some kind of waste.

We acted global financial crisis by going into a temporary we are allowing monetary policy to play a bigger role. People listening to the bleatings of the opposition economy: it is in growth, and is going to continue run through should come as a reality check economy down at every opportunity. I see that She is one of those who talks down the advantage at every opportunity, ignoring the the strength of our economy and the skill managed this economy in the interests of working by Australians, and I think this is because understand, and indeed expect, that fairness know that those opposite have no regard for they have shown that and also from opposition, budget that they have thus far been able because one would not actually know, listening speech-such as the schoolkids bonus, something at school deal with the costs that they are facing. by those opposite. I think that emphasis on fairness is why savings that have been made in this budget, support that we have given to parents, to pensioners, loves to wallow in talking about waste, which is always possible to point with the benefit of some project. But there are two kinds of waste. just spoken of-lost jobs, failed businesses and of waste, which is some overspending in some to take the Building the Education Revolution of projects were identified as having between the two kinds of waste, I know the for jobs. We have generated jobs, and we have make sure that, when people do have a job, it is a stand for, and that is because we manage the on.

The budget gets our the nation's finances to surplus, we give decisively to stimulate the economy after the deficit and now, as the economy improves, should bear in mind that this is a growing to grow. Those indicators that I have just to those opposite, who continue to talk the the member for Indi is with us in the chamber. economy for partisan and temporary political economic indicators that on every measure show with which we as a Labor government have people.

And of course this builds on the as part of the clean energy future package allowances and pensions begin flowing over taxpayers earning up to $80,000 a year from threshold-another measure which the opposition take away; another measure which the opposition oppose. I want to finish up before commending the another shameful and misleading scare campaign ago departed from reality when it comes to change for that matter. But I am not going change; I am going to talk about the scare running.

There is only one job they at any cost-whether it is at the economy's cost, to save that job. The previous speaker went criticised us for not being egalitarian. Well, supposedly not being egalitarian, perhaps instead of the Isaacs electorate, he might decide not them. Aren't they good enough to live amongst? and his house is slightly outside the electorate. some members opposite, who talk about egalitarianism, forbid they live amongst them: 'We couldn't suburbs of East Malvern to live amongst the can put me in parliament-that's my entitlement, officials in this place who are used to an entitlement other side. So perhaps if he wants to be egalitarian, a good start, or even a little What do we see in this budget? The same care about the Australian people and Australian contribution from the member for Isaacs. We and Australian voters that somehow this government All of a sudden they are going to deliver a year. This is despite the fact that they have fact that they get all their figures wrong at they achieved these cooked books of a budget year's deficit from $23 billion to $44 billion money for projects like the NBN off the budget. When you do all those tricky measurements year and pushing it out to forward years, of thin margin. In fact, just by bringing forward the local government grants, the government the point when they are still borrowing $100 government are saying they have to increase going to achieve a surplus, or if anyone believed would not need to increase the debt ceiling they do not believe it either. And when you it very difficult for anyone else to believe sometimes you have got to remember that Wayne have sunk to as a nation-was asked about why supposedly, is going to deliver a surplus, he have news for you, Mr Swan: $50 billion is a to make investments in the nation's futurein health and in infrastructure. speak on the Appropriation Bill (No.1) 2012not comment on the previous contribution?

It is not just former union culture, it is also the patricians on the to live amongst your own people would be closer than more than 26 kilometres. deception, the same fraud, the same pretence to workers as we have seen from the see a really amateurish attempt to con the media has all of a sudden become responsible. wafer-thin $1.5 billion surplus for the 2012-13 not produced a single surplus. This is despite the every single stage of the prediction. And how have surplus? It has something to do with raising this by bringing forward spending and with having and manoeuvres of moving money into one course you are going to get some pathetic wafertwo programs, the back-to-school payments and are artificially saving $1.5 billion. But what is million a day? What is the point when the the debt ceiling by $50 billion? If they were they were going to achieve a surplus, they from $250 billion to $300 billion. The reality is do not believe what you are prosecuting, it makes it. It is interesting that when the TreasurerSwan is the Treasurer; woe, what depths we he would need to raise the debt limit if he, said, 'Well, very simply, this is no big deal.' I very big deal. The net debt, which is rising to $145 billion, is a very big deal. Your reckless Labor government is led by Julia Gillard or Combet or Mr Crean does not matter; it does election. There is one fact for certain: they debt they have amassed and squandered through have seen in 18 months this government's estimated billion. Just like that, $12 billion. If $50 billion government? In the last four years their cumulative This is a government of records-record lows when it comes to good policy but record highs mismanagement of taxpayers' dollars and borrowed funds.

It is delivering the world's biggest competitive against imports that will not stifling confidence like you would not believe, advantage of the high dollar to bring in machinery productive, that bit more competitive, at the that, because they just do not have any confidence alone what this government's budget and consumer market.

I would like to say to the Treasurer on behalf of my electorate of Stirling, that I represent, that they will be offended that living pressure.

Yet the this great local program, knowing full well that that funding. This is just another example understand what is important to my constituents. government never bothered to follow through overpass, which this year was completed solely government.

I am greatly concerned some of the vulnerable suburbs in my electorateby the way. I am greatly concerned about what have traditionally had entrenched disadvantage within them and contain many vulnerable Australia, who have arrived under our very so I am very concerned about what this cost-of-living communities. I wanted to say a few words about my portfolio Border Protection, particularly about Labor's responsibilities. Australia's border protection systematically targeted by the Labor Party are agencies that are already under unprecedented miracles with the resources at their disposal the complete collapse of any semblance of an is very difficult for me to understand why these by Labor at a time when those border protection Yesterday we had two boats arrive here illegally. arrival of 175 people, yet Customs has had a the government changed, of $750 million. It responsibilities are increasing dramatically, dramatically. Clearly that is going to make expected of them, which is to protect Australia's borders. I am at a loss to understand why every agency. As a result of the latest cuts that Customs under this budget, we are going to have fewer weapons at Australia's international airports there will be fewer staff to patrol our borders. who want to bring contraband into Australia, drugs. It is one of the reasons we have seen through our borders-because of the difficulty Labor are failing to do what I consider to be protect our borders from outside threats. In this budget alone Labor are cutting cumulative total of these cuts, including that government changed in 2007. With 314 illegal government changed in 2007, carrying over Customs are struggling to do Customs are suffering from these budget cuts also money has been cut from passenger queuing up at an international airport in Australia difficulty that you are having in getting processed further $10.4 million was taken from passenger passenger arrivals are to increase from 32 million The $34 million hit that Customs has already primary Customs sites at eight major international have occurred in this budget are clearly going continues to struggle, Labor have decided to communities, including many new arrivals to generous humanitarian program-the legal waypressure is going to mean for those responsibilities of Justice, Customs and gross mismanagement of these particular and national security agencies have been since the Labor government came to office. They strain, and they are being asked to perform and the pressures that they are under because of orderly border protection system in Australia. It agencies have been so systematically attacked pressures are so obvious for anyone to see. A day before that we had a record-breaking cumulative budget cut by the Labor Party, since has also had significant personnel cuts. So their yet their budget and personnel are decreasing it impossible for them to do the job that is Labor budget has done the same thing to this and Border Protection will be subjected to sets of eyes and ears checking for drugs and and ports. There will be less cargo inspected and This of course is a great leg-up for criminals such as illegal guns, drugs and precursors to such an enormous up-tick in illegal guns coming that Customs has in actually doing its job. a basic job for a federal government, which is to another 190 staff from Customs. As I said, the 190 personnel, is a whopping 750 staff since the boat arrivals having come since the 18,000 people, it is really no wonder that the job that is expected of them. in their border protection responsibilities, but facilitation-which means that, when you are you can blame the excessive queues and the on these very significant budget cuts.

Labor's $139 million from the AFP. In the last two budgets, stripped a massive $264.5 million worth of funding, to do its job of enforcing national security. 500 sworn police officers, a promise which Labor keep on putting off in every budget cycle. indeed, this year $25.9 million has been deferred money has gone straight into propping up Labor's submission the Australian Federal Police Association 500 sworn police officers, and I am sure it about what their failure to Perhaps the most astonishing thing the policing portfolio is that they have seen fit funding.

183,Mr HARTSUYKER,BILLS," This deception. This is a budget that achieves a meagre sound economic management. The Treasurer said bootstraps'. And he is right. This is a Labor This is a Labor budget that increases taxes This is a Labor budget that reintroduces class budget that does not seek to grow the economic saw in last year's budget, the debt ceiling is seeks to convince Australians that the budget limit of this country by another $50 billion. he will deliver a surplus and by hiding the increase No. 2 the parliament does not get a chance budget. According to the Australian Office of $227 billion worth of Commonwealth bonds on towards the current $250 billion debt ceiling. required them to raise the debt ceiling government's previous record deficit of $96 a decade to repay. I say excessive spending $100 billion a year more than the last Howard-Costello is a 40 per cent increase in the size of spending same period has been 13 per cent. The reason that the coalition knows what it meant government. We are the only party capable Only weeks ago the Prime Minister was budget for a national disability insurance budget showed that this announcement was a in this budget, although I acknowledge these budget surplus. A reduction in Public Service take us back to 2009-10 levels, is of course been a fierce advocate for our Public Service. the budget that around 1,500 Canberra based attrition and voluntary redundancies. It was fought extremely hard to prevent any budget. But I take heart in the knowledge that Under a coalition government it would be cutting 12,000 public servants and they are 20,000 jobs and razing whole departments. budget, some that disappoint me as the member knows the alternative would be a lot worse. And I benefit Canberra as a result of this budget. As I a budget that both supports and assists families to a surplus. These are the hallmarks of this the economic decisions on which we should be is a budget that is based on spin and surplus based on sleight of hand rather than this is a Labor budget, that it is 'Labor to its budget that breaks promises and makes new ones. and makes no genuine attempt to rein in spending. warfare and the politics of envy. This is a Labor pie but, instead, to reallocate its pieces. As we being increased. At the same time as the Treasurer is in surplus, they are increasing the credit card This shows that not even the Treasurer thinks that of the debt ceiling in Appropriations Bill to debate this measure independently of the Financial Management, there is currently about issue, about $221 billion of which is factored This government's excessive spending has to more than three times the Keating Labor billion that took the coalition government nearly because this government is spending more than budget. To put that in perspective, that over a four-year period when inflation for the members of the coalition speak about debt is to pay off Labor's debt when we were last in of repaying debt and generating a real surplus. promising that there would be money in this scheme. The funding announced in this year's cruel hoax on those families who were waiting for a real national disability insurance scheme. the delivery of programs, the coalition have committee of the parliament to be co-chaired of politics. This would provide non-partisan implementation of the NDIS because an NDIS nation as a whole. Why raise the NDIS straight after Labor's payments on that very debt are reaching an alarming bill would fully fund a fully implemented national demon of debt, that the interest bill that governments to deliver services. Until a coalition the interest bill will be reducing the ability people. I will speak more on the Pacific Highway would cover the cost of the complete duplication interest bill would complete the One of the real concerns about this budget is hand. There are a number of accounting tricks for next year. The first of those is to bring blowing the projected budget deficit from the I ask you, Deputy Speaker, would you believe delivered a $44 billion deficit when he was skinny margin indeed. Ironically, the plan to paid on the debt to fund it, as the money is taxpayer is again paying more for The second accounting trick that the government is to have massive cuts in the range of government Effectively what the government is doing is appropriating year or pushing it out into 2013-14. As the National Press Club, the coal sector jobs package next year and, miraculously, $220 million in hand. The best way that this government could that was not mentioned in the budget speech, tax. The Energy Security Fund is another spending going from $1 billion this year down after that. The third and largest trick the government key expenditure items off budget. The NBN off budget and NBN spending, for example, of of the current forecast surplus. Although the promise of the 43rd Parliament no such thing with spending in this budget, government wanted to be transparent with its NBN on budget. If the government wanted to would have asked for a cost-benefit analysis trying to create a project that provided value Because of this government's poor record on extended the invitation to create a joint by the disabilities frontbenchers from both sides cross-party support for the oversight and should be owned by the parliament and by the record levels of debt? Because the interest $8.2 billion and this $8.2 billion interest disability insurance scheme. That is the comes with it restricts the ability of future government is elected and the debt is repaid, of those governments to deliver to the Australian later in my contribution, but $8.2 billion of the Pacific Highway. Just one year's duplication of this dangerous road. that, as I said, it is a budget bill on sleight of that have been used to manufacture a surplus forward spending from next year into this year, original projection of $12 billion to $44 billion. a Treasurer who predicted $12 billion and promising a $1.5 billion surplus? It is a very spend this money early will increase the interest being borrowed for a longer time. The Australian the failings of this government. has relied on to claim a surplus next year programs for the 2012-13 year only. next year's funding in this financial shadow Treasurer pointed out last week at the will cost $220 million this year, $10 million the year after that. Once again it is a sleight of support coal sector jobs is by dropping the tax the tax that it does not want to name, the carbon example of a 12-month spending freeze, with to $1 million next year and $1 billion the year has played to create a surplus is to take and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation are $5.8 billion is not included in the calculations was transparency, this government has done and the NBN is a clear example. If the spending, it would have included the cost of the be transparent about the cost of the NBN, it of the project, rather than pretending it was for taxpayers' money over and above what was spent.

At this time under these difficult we can to make the economy stronger in budget surpluses, curtailing government government taxes so that there is a healthier fact this budget does the opposite. Let us go To start with, the budget continues the believe that this budget was all about fiscal government this year. But when you look at the papers actually increase expenditure by $2.2 billion in the next two months alone and an following 12 months. On a cash basis there is financial year. The government talk about fiscal in this regard, because the bottom line is that When you look at the overall aggregate unbelievable $100 billion a year more than increase in government expenditure from five What has that extra $100 billion a year delivered? all the freeways have been fixed, that there are have been addressed?

As you had the four biggest government deficits in continues that pattern. The debt ceiling will up to $200 billion, then to $250 billion, and that they need to increase the debt ceiling by the farce of the government's claim to be surpluses. Clearly, if they were running surpluses government's spending spree. They would have you consolidation. That was the mantra from the figures they tell a different story. The budget billion over the next 14 months-an extra $2 additional expenditure of $0.2 billion over the an additional $8.7 billion of expenditure next constraints but clearly they are not delivering they simply cannot control their expenditure. expenditure, the government is now spending an what it inherited in 2007.

This government increase, incredibly, to $300 billion. It has gone in the fine print of these budget papers it shows an extra $50 billion to $300 billion. This shows in control of their expenditure and running they would not need to increase the debt ceiling to $300 billion. Net debt will climb since last year's budget. By 2015-16 the government will spend $8 money just disappears. It does not go towards eight tertiary hospitals around Australia. It year in, year out. It would build the connection Freeway, in Melbourne. But that $8 billion will the year after that, just on paying the interest waste and reckless spending. It took the coalition almost a decade to pay 1996. It is now $145 billion, and still growing, that going to take us to pay off once we get rate of the surplus the government claims it Let me make a couple of other points on the At the end of the day this budget was a carbon the Treasurer in his speech and it may not running non-stop at the moment, but the 2012-13 This carbon tax will increase electricity prices increase gas by nine per cent in the first year will cost 24,000 jobs in Victoria alone, including government rates by an estimated three per cent Association of Victoria.

That is what they are doing. It own figure-it is not ours. These price increases start, because the tax will increase-it is legislated three years, and that is forecast to continue There are a couple of other items I would of the chamber we are very supportive of make this a bipartisan commitment and to have implementation. We were pleased to see that budget-$1 billion. What I am disappointed recommended $3.9 billion. So there is a $2.9 billion raising the expectations of the disability sector expectations.

Their I commend them and report to the parliament the mark in terms of their interests. The budget is that time of year when the budget is and members of the opposition really, but underneath all the heated rhetoric this is the time of year when the government gets way. In terms of the vernacular, it is where the mouth is. Spending and savings measures are set It is an obligation upon government, I would say, the opposition. They can say all sorts of things about what they would like, and in the budget without mentioning any numbers, as we saw a few weeks ago. Something that really is remarkable about difficult circumstances. We have a patchwork uncertainty, particularly uncertainty associated could lead to contagion around the world, Europe, but we are still connected to those a matter that is not always picked up by those GDP is as low as it has ever been in the last Treasurer has managed to pull off We have been able to do this because of upon ourselves.

There are spending for improved assistance for families will be $410 for every primary school child will not hear support from those on the other about this and maybe you will find some courageous and will argue against the abolition Of course, that builds on the work that childcare rebate to 50 per cent and the Paid debate they can speak for an entire 30 minutes this budget is that it is being delivered in economy and enormous international with the European debt crisis and how that and how it will affect us here, a long way from markets. We have declining tax revenues, which is on the other side. The tax as a percentage of 20 years. Despite these circumstances, the something that is quite remarkable. the strict fiscal discipline that we have imposed that any new spending must be offset by a should be limited to less than two per cent the cycle; and our determination to return the of the economy at this point in the cycle. What have been able to deliver what we said we were We have navigated our way through the to working people-benefits like the National investment for the commencement of that scheme, in my electorate and families all around discriminated against on the basis of how they will say that we have an obligation to assist made to backing in the reforms recommended the aged-care sector.

The budget contains magnificent relief, an injection of funding into the dental Labor reforms, and they are carping and doughnut. The budget initiatives mean a great deal schoolkids bonus.

Not enough is said about the build a strong economy, but that is not an end in end in itself is what that delivers to ordinary well-being, their standard of living and their that in the four years since you have been in you can say your priority is creating jobs, is to ensure that people are working and that absence of any great narrative within the budget This is an important reform, a difficult structural in a Labor way, and that is a way that says, 'We track.' There are two options. The coalition exists or go and find yourself the biggest damn bucket of sand. That is the coalition way-stick that this stuff is not happening. We reject that damage to the Australian economy and to ordinary yourself for massive economic change-and 1980s-the working people of this country will massive economic change and we will be doing it households and businesses along the way.

188,Mr SIMPKINS,BILLS," This is the into the chamber and deliver a budget speech add up. They have never added up before Economic and Fiscal Outlook in December, September 2013, when the final figures for the $1.5 billion surplus claimed by this Treasurer, expenditure forward into this financial year speak of those matters later in my contribution; with the Treasurer's constant smokescreen and has inflicted upon this nation the four biggest reduction in revenue receipts. Strangely, he never let us go through how badly this government on this nation. Speaker after speaker on the are of the government's record, so I will government because they have had some truly efforts have, of course, created a projected some two generations of the Treasurer's projected where our children and our grandchildren will have installed on our economic vehicle. Before speaking of these specific matters Treasurer's lack of credibility to set the scene. time today after being asked on two occasions protection policy, which is defined by 314 our policy a failure, and what a joke that 2001 to June 2007, 1,637 were detained at Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Evans, 705 of those detained came to Australia. That detained. In those years we averaged less than Leader of the Opposition in the second question about given that we had averaged three boats a week, the Treasurer said, 'I can certainly confirm Nauru came to Australia.' So, according to former minister said, is virtually all. No wonder Ours has been a remarkable achievement when it same time as reducing the tax to GDP ratio. The but one of the things that they are very that were delivered by the coalition, the tax to this government, it is nudging 21 per cent. We great social reforms in the interests of what I said earlier: if those opposite had been at 'Jesus, great trick with the water into wine, fifth time we have had this Treasurer walk and this will be the fifth time the figures do not and they will not at the time of the Mid-Year and they will not any time between now and financial year ahead come in. To arrive at the we have seen trickery with the movement of or delayed to a following financial year. I will however, I will take the opportunity to deal the facade he puts up about the reasons why he deficits in history. He says it is the GFC and the talks about the waste that he has allowed, so have stuffed up and inflicted generational debt government side can announce how proud they talk about the highlights of the Rudd-Gillard magic moments since late 2007. These great net debt of some $147 billion, which will take surpluses to pay off-two generations live under the handbrake that this government I would like to cover an example of the It stems from his pathetic failure in question about the Labor government's border boats and over 18,000 people arriving. He called was. During the Pacific Solution, from September Nauru or Manus Island. The former Minister for said in a media release on 8 February 2008 that represents 43 per cent of the total of those three boats a year. When later asked by the what sort of failure the Treasurer was talking a year compared to the Labor government's two that virtually all those people they sent to the Treasurer, 43 per cent, which is what the every budget prediction he has uttered has been completely inaccurate. Today the Treasurer words that are not true. It is On the government's mismanagement of our beyond even this government's pathetic forecast will rise. If the Labor government had left been paid for and 400,000 Australians with instead of just 20,000 over two years. Then billions of dollars wasted when value for administration of the BER program. The set-top there are estimates that the same result wasteful fiasco from this government. Then government's home insulation scheme, which what about a billion dollars in consultancies $300 million was wasted on the Green Loans too. And the school computer program blew associated with the failed GroceryWatch, cash to dead people and pets and other such wasteful government that, despite having the entire administer and implement programs. It is not must remember that every dollar that is generated businesses and areas of this nation and its economy. My point is that this government has had challenges. The difference is how you meet of the nation need. The reality is that if a nation's finances carefully then maybe you cannot recall on several occasions the member for Ipswich Motorway and how the Howard government government has. Clearly, if you are not afraid you can do such things. If you are prepared then you can do it all, but it is not right have shovelled money out the door, living beyond generational debt as a result. Having spoken waste and mismanagement, I will now turn to this side of the House that the government has time as a method of promoting their pretend heard from have been trying to create the budget to surplus and that this somehow management. But we all know that this year's smoke, mirrors and spin. There are three pathetically to advance in the budget-the boosting productivity and the transparency that have been created by this government promises and policy backflips. misled the House. Today he specifically said consistent with all his past work. borders this has resulted in cost blow-outs of almost $4 billion, and no doubt that figure a working policy alone then the NDIS could have profound disabilities would have been assisted there was the $1.7 billion in blow-out costs and money was not achieved due to the lack of box program cost taxpayers $308 million and could be achieved for just $50 million-another there was $1.7 billion wasted in the Labor was linked to four deaths and 200 fires. And since 2007-a record to be proud of, to be sure! fiasco, and they should stand up for that one out by $1.2 billion. Then there is the waste for clunkers, Fuelwatch, the stimulus cheques efforts. These examples show that this is a public service at their beck and call, cannot a record to be proud of, particularly when we in taxes comes from the productive people, challenges and the Howard government also had the challenges and also provide what the people government makes hard decisions and manages the afford to do everything you would like to. I Blair speaking about what I believe was the never spent the money but the current to borrow $100 million per day, as Labor does, to saddle debt on our children and grandchildren to do so. The Treasurer and the Labor government the means of this country, and will impose about this government's disgraceful effort in this budget. It comes as no surprise to those on been asking itself many questions in question surplus. The government members we have view that the government will be returning the means it now has some credibility in economic budget, like all Labor budgets, will be full of main things that the government has tried urgency of returning the budget to surplus, of costings-which are all problems and mistakes due to its actions of reckless spending, broken This Labor government desperately needs to losing face even more. As the previous coalition lost the respect of the Australian public. competent manner. This government has no economic government is willing to say and do anything, to remain in power. But what the government are smart people and can see straight through this government's actions of artificially moving and the year after. The government is trying and taking spending forward or back, out of billion each year on the Energy Security Fund, spending less than $1 million. The government NBN Co. expenditure, a real $100 billion black hole. It is well understood in the Australian government still does not have a plan to repay jobs. The Treasurer's mixed messages regarding to create the illusion that it can be trusted, confusion and the crisis of confidence throughout and the methods such as the raising of the debt further proof that this government cannot be this government expects Australians to believe out of $44 billion to a $1.5 billion surplus. yet now the government expects the citizens I question whether the government believe of the increase of $50 billion in the government's historic deception, this generational illusion Treasurer says that, despite allegedly reducing current financial year to the next, he still needs is buying the fiction, Treasurer. Regardless, the government has no credibility, does are more often than not two completely different anyone on this side if in another 15 months from actually achieved a surplus. It will come as deterioration in the budget this year and the it will have delivered a surplus of $1.5 billion. position through active and popular spending understanding of economics can see that it that Labor has not delivered a surplus since 1989-90. The government's lack of credibility also in opposition they were very happy to sit productivity figures and then make bold claims in government. However, this is just more revealed that Australia is now less productive return the budget to surplus to try to stop it speakers have stated, this government has It is no longer trusted to run the country in a plan. It is driven by self-interest. The including deals with the Independents, simply does not understand is that the Australian public the smoke and mirrors. They can see through spending out of next year and into this year to deceive the Australian public, shuffling money 2012-13. For instance, it is spending over $1 except in 2012-13, when the government is is hiding other items, such as the bulk of the community that, despite claiming a surplus, the the debt, build a stronger economy or protect the budget show that Labor's No. 1 priority is when really all it is doing is reinforcing the the community. The fiddling of the figures ceiling from $250 billion to $300 million are taken seriously. To further emphasise that point, that it can turn around a 2011-12 budget blowIt blew out to double what the government told us, of this nation to believe its $1.5 billion claim. it themselves. They obviously do not, because credit card limit, to $300 billion. This makes no sense and is without logic. The expenditure by more than $45 billion from this an extra $50 billion on the credit card. No-one and history has told us that what it says and things. So it will come as no surprise to today it is revealed that this budget has not no surprise because there has been a $20 billion government is expecting that by September 2013 It does not make sense. It has created this habits, and anyone with the slightest clearly does not add up-not to mention the fact relates to the problems with productivity.

The Australian people know that this what he predicted on each of On Monday night, the government backbencher, declared that a surplus had been delivered the last 10 years.

So Labor were happy to criticise for a quarter or even a couple of quarters and better, but that is at odds with the current and a government that has lost the trust of doing another. Labor inherited a $20 billion run up deficits of $167 billion since being per taxpayer, and to pay for this debt Labor The interest payments on their debt will be 2014-15. And yet the Prime Minister cannot faith in this government, a government so out of this government introducing new taxes in a waste and mismanagement.

223,Mr COULTON,BILLS,"Parkes-The Nationals Chief Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2012-13 and related budget. I was quite interested to listen always fascinated to know what goes on across strange that he did not mention the carbon business in refrigeration and dairy farms, refrigeration would go up through electricity dairy farms would have to pay for the electricity he mention how much the carbon tax was going fertiliser or the cost of freighting their milk, refrigeration systems-whether it be the refrigerated coolroom storage-the carbon tax was going fluorocarbons that are involved in refrigeration semitrailer will cost tens of thousands of dollars. From the outset I say that I am not going to the budget, because obviously there are things that manages the economy of the country; the education and for everything else. So I would guess is the general tone of my contribution government up here speaking about individual and other trinkets they have managed to get that the Australian people have I have just had a week in my electorate, to school students, the extra funding for conversation was about frustration over this government's the country has become rudderless and that we the cash payments, they are concerned about is that these payments are not going to make to Tassie now-and the higher Australian dollar, on Tasmania's exporters.

We have had members of the items in the budget-the beads and blankets for their own electorates-but the real tragedy is stopped listening to this government. and the conversation was not about the payments Newstart or the payments to pensioners. The loss of direction, the frustration that are losing direction. So, while people welcome the general welfare of the economy. The reality the recipients better off, because the payments will be a mere shadow of the costs of the carbon Treasurer brought down his budget, the carbon the streets of Dubbo, Mudgee, Moree, Narrabri, it is on everyone's lips.
