2,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable memwill not be in order in asking a question and reading a newspaper statement,12
3,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I ask the Minister whether, in view of the fact that the Sydney Homing Herald has now become a convert to the views of those who are against the quarantine regulations of this Government, and is charging it with seriously interfering with the interests of the State in maintaining an ineffective quarantine, the Government is prepared to relieve the people of the State by raising the embargo that has been put on thqm.'",12
4,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I have not seen the ai ticle_ referred to, but I am not of the opinion that the quarantine regulations have been ineffective It is a good thing for the public health of Australia that the disease has been confined within a restricted area, and any further action that the Government may take will be based, not on the opinion of a newspaper, but on the actual facts of the situation as ascertained by those by whose advice we are guided in the administration of public affairs relating to health.",12
5,Mr WEST,Unknown,"Althoug h the appeal to the Minister to remove the quarantine embargo from Sydney before the date fixed for the reception of the Fleet was not acceded to, can the honourable gentleman give a reason why the embargo should not be removed before the first Tuesday in November-Melbourn e Cup day?",12
6,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The action of the Department in this matter is based on considerations other than the fact that events of the nature referred to are taking place in various parts of Australia.  ceived the request from Cootamundra, Albury, or other important towns in the Hume electorate where cases of small-pox have occurred, that the quarantine regulalations shall be made a little more stringent, to prevent the further dissemination of disease from Sydney?",12
7,Mr GROOM,Unknown,No such request has been received. ,12
8,Mr WEST,Unknown,Is ihe Minister aware that more persons are suffering from the effects of vaccination and more persons have died as the result of vaccination than there are alleged small-pox patients at the quarantine station at North Sydney ?,12
9,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The question is not in order, it is furnishing information, not seeking it.",12
10,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I ask the Minister of Trade and Customs whether the proclamation issued by the Federal Governmenb, with reference to the small-pox epidemic in Sydney, has meant the salvation of the merchants of Flinders-lane, Melbourne, aud whether he thinks it fair under our Constitution that one part of Australia should be benefited while another is injured'",12
11,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I am not aware that the proclamation has been the salvation of Flinders-lane, Melbourne Statistics show that a fair volume of trade has been taking place in Sydney, notwithstanding the issue of the proclamation, which had one purpose only, and that was to preserve the public health of Australia.",12
12,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"The Prime Minister told us the other day that he had made an offer to the Premier of New South Wales, that if the New South Wales Parliament would pass a Vaccination Bill the embargo would be removed upon the people of that State. now, whether the Government have informed the Premier of New South Wales that if the New South , Wales Government will isolate small areas in connection with the small-pox the embargo will be removed?",13

16,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"On the 26th of last month the Leader of the Opposition asked a question relating to a letter ceived by the Queensland Union from an Electoral Registrar in State. I promised'to inquire into the people of Australia? matter, and I shall now read the Chief Electoral Officer's report on it , which as follows: The Commonwealth Electoral Officer for Queensland is in communication with the Divisional Returning Officer for Wide Bay, and tRe Registrar for the subdivision of Kilkivaii West in relation to this matter, with a view to guarding against the possibility of an objection being improperly lodged in respect of any name appearing on the roll. The only instruction issued is that quoted by the Minister in Parliament on the 30th ultimo, vide Hansard, No. 14, page 1570. It is the duty of the Electoral Registrar (under the provisions of section 69 of the Electoral Act), to lodge or make an objection, in writing, setting forth the grounds of objection in respect' of any name which he bas reason to believe ought not to be retained on the roll; While a registrar, in discharging his duties, I ask under section 69 of the Act, may consider any representations made to him_, in writing, Which appear to indicate that certain names should no longer remain on the roll, the Chief. Electoral Officer has issued a definite direction that he (the registrar) must in no case act on such representations until he has made independent' inquiries, through the police or postal authorities, and has fully satisfied himself in the matter. The attention of Divisional Returning Officers and registrars has been specially drawn, by the Chief Electoral Officer, to the necessitv' of _ exercising the greatest care in respect of objections on the ground, of non-residence in the division.

24,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The question is not in order. It is not in order to ask a Minister for an expression of opinion on a newspaper report of something stated to have been said by another person in another country.,14
25,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,I would like the Honorary Minister to give the opinion of the ^Government as to their being described as pawns in the game of politics ?,14
26,Mr KELLY,Unknown,The honourable member refers to a statement alleged to have been made in London.,14
27,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! As the question is out of order, it is also out of order to reply. It is not in order to ask a question founded on newspaper reports of the utterances of people in another country.",14
28,Mr KELLY,Unknown,This is purely a question of Australian electors.,14
29,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"It is a newspaper report, and, moreover, refers to an alleged expression of opinion by some one is another country, and has nothing to do with any business before this House. It does not come within the category of allowable questions. CERTIFIED ROLL.",14
30,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Will the Honorary Minister ascertain from the Returning Officers and the Electoral Registrars in every electorate the procedure which is followed by them in connection with the certified roll, whether it is available in an any person to see ?

33,Mr KELLY,Unknown,As soon as possible. DUMMY ELECTORAL CARDS.  Minister of Home Affairs tell the House of the number of dummy electoral cards put into the index cabinets in the various States ?,14
34,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I had information that this question was to be asked.,14
35,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,It is a pure rig.,14
36,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I can assure honourable members that when an' honourable member has the courtesy to let a Minister know that he is going to submit a question, it is very much appreciated. I have the information for the honourable member. It is as follows: There were 61,000 dummy cards placed in the index cabinets in New South Wales; 20,000 in Victoria; 20,000 in Queensland; 13,590 in South Australia; 32,198 in Western Australia; and 17,070 in Tasmania; total 163,858.",14
37,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Would it not be better to call them temporary cards?,14
38,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order !,14
39,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,They understand dummying better on that side of the House.,14
40,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! I have several times called for order, and each time honourable members have immediately afterwards interjected. Frequently I have had occasion to call attention to the extreme disorderliness of such conduct, and I hope it will not be repeated.",14
41,Mr KELLY,Unknown,The purpose for which these cards were inserted in the index was thoroughly explained in an answer I gave to the House yesterday afternoon.,14
42,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Has the Honorary Minister the number of dummy cards that were in the index cabinets on election day ?,14
43,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I cannot give those figures off-hand, but if the honourable member asks the. question tomorrow I shall be prepared with"" an answer. I invite the attention of honourable members to the reply I gave yesterday afternoon, when I stated that less than 1 per cent, of these cards were outstanding at the electorate for date of the election.",14
44,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,Following on that answer,14
45,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I have already called the attention of honourable members to the fact that it is contrary to parliamentary practice to put a series of questions to Ministers arising out of an answer already given.,14
46,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"My question bears very much on the answer already given, and I should-like to have the information. I wish to know whether it is a fact that these dummy cards were gathered in by order of the Chief Electoral Officer, and not of the Minister?",14
47,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member's question is not. in order, and is clearly designed to evade the rulingalready given and the practice of Parliament hitherto. A further question is only permissible to make the answer more clearly understood. A debate by means of a further series of questions founded on a reply to the first is against the practice of Parliament.",14
48,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,I desire to ask the Honorary Minister who created the dummy card system-the Minister of Home Affairs or the head of the Electoral Department 1,15
49,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"If the honourable member will look to the full answer I gave to a question yesterday, he w i ll get the in formation.",15
50,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,Will the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs kindly ask the Chief Electoral Officer if I ever gave him any instructions in regard to dummy cards ? I never heard of them.,15
51,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I do not quite gather whetlier my honourable friend wants me to ask the Chief Electoral Officer what confidences have passed between them.,15
52,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! honourable member resume his seat?,15
53,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Yes , sir.",15
54,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I will not receive any more questions bearing on that matter. I have already given a ruling on the subject, and these questions are simply attempts to get behind the ruling. These are questions arising out of an answer already given by the Minister pretty full y to a question asked without notice. ask a series of questions without notice, arising out of the answer of a Minister, is practically to raise a debate, and that cannot be allowed by means of further questions or - otherwise.  sir. On one day of this week there was on the business-paper a notice which contained a grave reflection upon the late Government. I understand altered the notice afterwards, but before it was altered it was issued to the public at large. I wish to know whether you rule that the members of the Labour cannot vindicate their character in connection with the dummy cards, seeing that the honourable member for Echuca, by a notice on the business-paper, circulated to all parts of Australia, passed a grave reflection on the late tion. I ask you, sir, whether it is not in order to try to elicit the truth in connection with the dummy cards 1",15
55,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! It w i ll be quite in order to do what the honourable member refers to, in the manner which is provided for in our Standing Orders, but it will not be in order to try to do what the honourable member wants to do now by means of a series of questions founded on a Minister's reply to a question already asked. When the question asked by the honourable member for Echuca appeared on the notice-paper, my attention was called by the honourable member for Capricornia to its character. I told him then that I had not seen the question prior to it appearing on the business-paper', but I would look into the question, and anything which was of an objectionable character, or appeared to savour of being objectionable, would be eliminated before the notice again appeared on the business paper. That was done.",15
56,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,It went out to the public.,15
57,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Agenda-paper s are circulated in the chamber mainly for the Will the information of honourable members regarding the business of the day, and are not, in the. ordinary sense, public documents intended for general circulation outside., though it is true that they are circulated within a limited area.

This embargo is ruining a good many of the potato-growers in Victoria, Administra- and, if I might be permitted, sir, for a moment, I wish to point out",15
59,Mr SPEAKER,EXPORT OF VICTORIA N,Order ! The honourable member is not entitled to make a. speech. He will have to get the leave of the House if he desires to make a statement beyond what is necessary merely to explain his question.,15
60,Mr MCGRATH,EXPORT OF VICTORIA N,I ask for leave..,16
61,Mr SPEAKER,EXPORT OF VICTORIA N,"Is . it the desire of the House that the honourable member for Ballarat should have leave to make a statement? There being no objection, leave is granted. - Mr MCGRATH - I desire to make the position clear to the Attorney-General. One of 'the reasons which brought about Federation",16
62,Sir JOHN FORREST,EXPORT OF VICTORIA N,"There were three "" Noes "" on this side.",16

68,Mr FINLAYSON,EXPORT OF VICTORIA N,What section of the Constitution would be affected? Mr W . H . . IRVINE - That is a matter on which I cannot enter into a debate with the honourable member at this stage. QUESTIONS.,16
69,Mr HIGGS,EXPORT OF VICTORIA N,"Mr Speaker, I wish to raise a question concerning the privileges of the members of this House. If you will consult the Standing Orders, you will observe that standing order 92 readsAfter notices have been given, questions may be put to Ministers of the Crown relating to public affairs. The standing order contains no limitaof tion. The only limitation which, in my opinion, can be put to questions on public affairs is that which can be put by Ministers themselves, who may demand a that notice be given. This afternoon, sir, you have refused to the honourable member for Ballarat an opportunity to a question. If ' you will turn to the following standing order, No. 93, having reference to questions which may be asked, you will see thatIn putting any such question, no argument or shall be offered, nor any facts stated, except so far as may be necessary to explain Surely, sir, you are not going to take up the position that, if an honourable member deems it necessary to state a few facts or such facts as may be requisite to his question, he is out of order. That is the attitude which you have taken Comup today. You have gone, if yon w i ll permit me to say so, farther than any the Speaker. I know of in refusing to allow a the Minister to answer a question. I refer I to the question put by the honourable not member for East Sydney, who asked, an Would the Minister of Trade and Cusof toms make inquiries as to how many deaths were taking place under vaccinahave to tion, and how manv small-pox patients Surely that is a relevant question, considering the state of affairs in Australia today t Without dwelling on the point, sir, at any great length, I think that you are adopting a very rigid practice, and one which will interfere with honourable members. I submit that if Ministers are not prepared to answer questions, they should boldly ask that the questions sliould be put on the notice paper, but you are taking up the attitude that you will not allow Ministers to answer questions.",16
70,Mr RODGERS,EXPORT OF VICTORIA N,Is this a lecture which you are giving the House ?,17
71,Mr SPEAKER,EXPORT OF VICTORIA N,Order ! M.'r. PAGE - It is a lecture on the tenance of our own privileges.,17
72,Mr SPEAKER,EXPORT OF VICTORIA N,Order !,17
73,Mr HIGGS,EXPORT OF VICTORIA N,The honourable member for Wannon is new to the House. When he has been here a little longer he will understand that the rules,17
74,Mr RODGERS,EXPORT OF VICTORIA N,I appreciate your point of order.,17
75,Mr SPEAKER,EXPORT OF VICTORIA N,Order ! The honourable member is out of order in interrupting.,17
76,Mr HIGGS,EXPORT OF VICTORIA N,"We put up with a little lecture from the honourable member for Wannon when he made his first speech, and we did not mind, because he did it in a very nice, smiling way; but he will find, after he has been here a little time, that the Standing Orders were drawn up by a Committee representing both sides of the Chamber, and acting in calm moments, and were agreed to by the House when it was not in a heated state, but i u a calm mood, and realized that it was necessary, i u the interests of minorities, that there should be standing orders, because majorities, if allowed, always get their own way. In calm and cool moments the Standing Orders were agreed to as embodying what was considered a fair code. I submit that if an honourable member asks a question, and he deems it necessary to enlighten the Minister concerned, to state facts, he is entitled, under the Standing Orders, to do so; and surely, sir, it is a privilege of the members of the House that a Minister should be allowed to answer a question if he is willing to do so.",17
77,Mr SPEAKER,EXPORT OF VICTORIA N,"W it h regard to the question of privilege raised by the honourable member for Capricornia, I desire to point out that I have not attempted to interfere with the right of Ministers to answer questions put to them, provided those questions are in order. But it is distinctly laid down by parliamentary authorities, as well as by the practice of this House, that if a question is not in order, a reply to such a question is equally out of order. 1I have ample authority under our own procedure for the course of action I have followed in this case, and the rulings given by my predecessors are well supported by abundant authority relating to the practice of the House of Commons. Irregular questions should not be answered, and debates on the answers of Ministers to questions are not permissible. As I pointed out on a previous occasion, a main- question, to be i u order, must relate to business of which Ministers have charge- to the administration of their Departments, or to matters of a public character with which they have to deal. Questions which do not come within that category .are not in order. A question must seelr information, not give it . I gave to the House only a few days ago the decisions of the most eminent iDarliamentary authorities bearing on this subject, so that it is unnecessary for me to repeat them. Under our own Standing Orders, questions may be put to Ministers in reference to public affairs, but it is the practice of this House, as well as of. every Parliament of which I know, to l i m it an honourable member' when asking a question, and especially a question without notice, to only such an explanation as is absolutely necessary to make the question clear. No further amplification is permissible. The honourable member for Ballarat was going beyond it . He was making a speech, which, as I understood it , could not be regarded as being only such a limited explanation as was necessary to make clear the purpose of his question..",17
78,Mr HIGGS,EXPORT OF VICTORIA N,"Will you allow me, Mr . Speaker, to ask whether you still rule that the honourable member for East Sydney was not in order in addressing his question to the Minister of Trade and Customs ?",17
79,Mr SPEAKER,EXPORT OF VICTORIA N,The honourable member was not in order if he was asking a question arising out of an answer given by a Minister to a question previously put and full y replied to. All parliamentary authorities clearly lay it down that such a practice is quite out of order.,17
80,Mr WEBSTER,EXPORT OF VICTORIA N,"May I ask, with all respect, sir, whetlier you have not made a mistake in determining the character of the question put by the honourable member for East Sydney? It seemed to me to be quite distinct from any question previously put to the Minister.",17
81,Mr SPEAKER,EXPORT OF VICTORIA N,"The question, as I understood it , related to a matter which had already been the subject of a reply to a question by the Minister.",18
82,Mr RILEV,EXPORT OF VICTORIA N,No .,18
83,Mr SPEAKER,EXPORT OF VICTORIA N,"If I have done the honourable member for East Sydney an in justice, I am very sorry. I shall ask him to again state his question.",18
84,Mr WEST,EXPORT OF VICTORIA N,"I have a series of . questions to put, but I shall be very lenient.",18
85,Mr SPEAKER,EXPORT OF VICTORIA N,The honourable member may ask only one question at a time.,18
86,Mr WEST,EXPORT OF VICTORIA N,"There is a rumour about, and I want to know whether it is not true, that more people are suffering from vaccination, and that more deaths have occurred from that cause, than there are alleged small-pox patients in Sydney ?",18
87,Mr SPEAKER,EXPORT OF VICTORIA N,"The honourable member, I think, has already given notice of a question of that kind. ,",18
88,Mr WEST,EXPORT OF VICTORIA N,No ; I was refused the right to place it on the business-paper.,18
89,Mr SPEAKER,EXPORT OF VICTORIA N,"The honourable member is now attempting to put, without notice, a question which I would not allow him to place on the business-paper in the form in which it was submitted. I took the trouble to amend his notice of question to put it in proper for m. A question which is not in order to be placed on the business-paper, cannot be asked without notice in the same form.",18
90,Mr WEST,EXPORT OF VICTORIA N,Where do I come in?,18
91,Mr SPEAKER,EXPORT OF VICTORIA N,"Order ! A question not seeking information, but conveying a reflection and giving information, is not in order.",18
92,Mr HIGGS,EXPORT OF VICTORIA N,"Will the Minister of Trade and Customs make iuquiries as to the number of deaths that have occurred from small-pox in Sydney, as well as the number of deaths that have resulted from vaccination in that city, and acquaint the House with the result of his inquiries at the earliest possible opportunity ?",18
93,Mr GROOM,EXPORT OF VICTORIA N,"I shall be glad to obtain the information, if it be possible to do so.",18
94,Mr HIGGS,EXPORT OF VICTORIA N,That is the question which the honourable member for East Sydney desired to put.,18
95,Mr SPEAKER,EXPORT OF VICTORIA N,"Order ! The question just put by the honourable member for Capricornia was evidently what the ltonorable member for East Sydney desired to ask; but I should like to point out to the House the difference between the two. That put by the honourable member for Capricornia asked for information, whereas the honourable member for East Sydney put his question in such a way as to give information, and not to seek it . A question put in the form, "" W h e the r it is not t r u e "" that such is the case implies au assertion that it is true, and is, therefore, not really a question seeking information, but rather in volving an assertion.

100,Mr MCGRATH,EXPORT OF VICTORIA N,On a point of order,18
101,Mr SPEAKER,EXPORT OF VICTORIA N,No point of order has arisen. I called the honourable member for Nepean. The honourable member for Ballarat will resume his seat.,18
102,Mr ORCHARD,EXPORT OF VICTORIA N,"I desire to ask the Honorary Minister whetlier it is the in tention of the military authorities to hold an encampment at Long Bay, in November and December next, and, if so, why the Liverpool Manoeuvre Area, which was resumed, at considerable cost for such purposes, is to be passed over for an area which in conirjarison possesses no facilities whatever ?",18

Later:",18
105,Mr MATHEWS,EXPORT OF VICTORIA N,I feel sure that the Treasurer did not intend any discourtesy to me by his neglect to answer my question. I should like to put it to him again.,18

110,Mr MCGRATH,EXPORT OF VICTORIA N,"I wish to ask the Minister representing the Prime whether consideration will be given to a request I have to make in connection with the South-street competitions at Ballarat. I would postpone the question but for alcoholic the fact that invitations to attend the competitions are now being issued by committee in charge of them. It is well known that Ballarat is the centre of music in the Commonwealth. All the bands of Australia will be represented there on 24th October, and as I understand that invitations to be present have been issued to Federal members, I wish to ask the Minister representing the Prime Minister if he will consider the advisability of proter of my motion posing an adjournment of the Federal Parliament over the date named, in order order. that honourable members may have an opmotion portunity to attend the competitions?",19

COMMONWEALTH - OWN ED STEAMERS. TASMANIAN MAIL SERVICE. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwiii) [3.20] - I moveTh.it, in view of the fact that the ^13,000 annually paid for the carriage of mails between Tasmania and - the mainland would pay the in terest and sinking fund on a Government-owned steam-ship line, this House is of opinion that it is desirable that the Government should .immediately establish and operate a fast steamer service between Australia .and Tasmania. To begin with, Tasmania does not possess any of the ""advantages which are enjoyed by the mainland States, for the simple reason that to all intents and purposes it two is isolated. It has no railway communication with any of the other States. The and distance from Burnie to Melbourne is 215 n miles, and that from Launceston to Melbourne 276 miles. It is 180 odd miles the from Melbourne to Stanley, the nearest port of Tasmania. The business of that State has now reached substantial proporbut though it has a population of 200,000, it is virtually in the hands or in the coils of a great steam-ship monopoly. terrestrial serpent encircles within its slimy folds the whole of the producers of that little island. Not one shilling's worth of produce can be forwarded by the a 200,000 inhabitants of Tasmania to anv part of the world, without they pav Owing to toll to this great corporation. We would' not mind paying this toll if we could get - our produce transported at the same rates as are charged for the transportation of produce from the other States. But it costs from 25 to 50 per cent, more to forward produce from Tasmania to Sydney than it does to carry it from Brisbane or Adelaide to Sydney, notwithstanding that 'the distance is some hundreds of miles less. I think that my honourable friends opposite, who have come here to represent the producers of this country, ought to sympathize with the people of Tasmania. If the Labour Government had not suffered a temporary set-back on the 31st May last, there is no doubt that we would now be establishing a fast line of steam-ships between Tasmania and the mainland. Mr . Graham, one of the eminent Ministers of Victoria, is not only in favour of fast lines of steam-ships to carry produce between the different States, but he is also in favour of the establishment of a Commonwealth line of steamers to carry our.pro-duce to the Old Country. I have no ill feeling towards the Government. They are - doing their best according to their light, but their light on this occasion is a dark lantern. They have agreed to give the Union Steam-ship Company a sevenyears' contract for the carriage of mails to and from Tasmania, and - that company a subsidy of £15,000 annually. But they have not made the company sign an agreement to reduce its fares and freight charges. challenge my friends opposite to search the history of the steam-ship lines pf the world, and to point to one which charges as much for carrying a passenger a similar distance as does this particular company. It is 215 miles from Melbourne to Burnie, and the Loongana can cover the distance in twelve hours. Yet a passenger is charged £ 2 I2s. 6d. for a return ticket.",20
133,Mr TUDOR,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Is that for the steerage?,21
134,Mr KING OMALLEY,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"No , for the saloon. If a passenger desires a .deck cabin to Launceston, a return ticket costs him £ 3 5s. Now, in the United States, where the people are almost crushed by monopolies, one can travel from Portland, Maine, to New York- a distance of nearly 500 miles-for £ 1 . A return ticket can be obtained for 30s.",21
135,Mr KENDELL,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"The volume of trade is much greater. _ . Mr KING 0 ' MALLEY : - ^ T he trade is not half as great proportionately, because the steamers have to compete with great railway lines, and the passengers have to be two nights at sea. Yet, in my day, oue could purchase a return ticket for 7^ dollars, or 30s. My honourable friends' will doubtless say that what they are doing is semi-Socialism. If it is, and the Union Steam-ship Company is a benevolent in stitution, I would sooner have the American monopolies, because they provide better accommodation, with more conveniences, and at half the cost. A Select Committee was appointed by the Tasmanian Parliament to inquire into the whole question of the freight and passenger charges made by the steam-ship companies. That Committee was appointed at the instance of Mr. Bakhap, who is now a senator representing that State. This body took a great deal of evidence, from which I propose to read a few extracts. Most of the towns in Tasmania are small, because, after all , Launceston would make only a suburb of Melbourne or of Sydney, and the same remark is applicable to Hobart. Mr . E. T. Clemons, a commission, agent doing a large business in Devonport, was examined by the Select Committee as follows : to - pay Do you consider them [the freights] unreasonably high compared with those on the mainland?-Yes ; compared with those on the mainland. Will you institute any comparison?-To give I you one clear instance, the freight from Devonport to Newcastle on chaff is 23s. bd. a ton, and from Adelaide to Newcastle it is only £1. Adelaide, it must be remembered, is double the distance from Newcastle that Tasmania is. It is a four days' journey from Adelaide to Newcastle, steaming all the time, and yet the freight ' is less than from here. Consequently, our quotations have to be from 5s - to 7s. under the mainland price to get business. A Tasmanian producer, is at a gieat disadvantage compared with the producers on the mainland. In that respect the freight rates cnarged are so high as to constitute a handicap?-Un doubtedly. This evidence in regard to freight charges was given by. Mr G. Finlayson, who is connected with a large engineering firm in Devonport. Are they reasonable or excessive?-They are very excessive. How do vou arrive at a standard of comparison?-The charges from the Old Country to Melbourne, for instance, are sometime? less than from Melbourne to here on heavy lifts. What would you call a heavy lift?-Anythin g over six tons. The present charge for a six-ton lift is j£3_5 from Melbourne to Devonport. That is only a twelve hours' run , and every one who has studied transportation knows that water carriage is always cheaper than rail carriage.",21
136,Mr KELLY,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"A r e there facilities for handling these heavy lifts? Mr KING O'MALLEY - Splendi d facilities. To continue the quotationWhat would the charge be from the Country?-About 50s. to 60s. per ton. It slightly. Vou find this a disadvantage in your - Undoubtedly . Those who start industries in these small towns find it almost impossible to compete with rivals in the big cities of the mainland. According to the evidence, a 6-ton lift that was brought from England to Victoria for £ 1 8 cost £ 3 5 to be taken from Victoria to Devonport. No wonder it is asked, "" Is this not daylight robbery?"" I shall quote now from the evidence of Mr Unsworth, of the firm of Irvine and MCEachean, one of the biggest wine and spirit merchants in TasmaniaFreight on wines and spirits until about years ago was the same as for goods-ios . ton. It was suddenly raised to 12s. 6d., when I asked the freight manager of pany for an explanation he said it was to bring it into line with the other States. That was all the satisfaction I Rot. The rates were raised on ordinary goods some little time ago from ios. to us., wines and spirits were raised 13s. 6d.; but about three or four months ago, without 'notice of any kind in any shape or form, wines and spirits were raised to 1.5s. per ton, or 4s. more than for ordinary cargo. On bottled beer we only pay the same as for ordinary cargo. It is monstrous. from England and Scotland, when the rate was jos. per ton, we used to be charged ;s. 6d., and it is now 14s: for wines and spirits. Those figures are strictly for freights ?-Yes . In connection with your transhipments from Fn^land and Scotland there has been an increase of almost too per cent.?-Yes . They used to charge 7s. 6d., and now we pay 14s. and the charges. Mr Edward Ingledew, a leading merbefore ? chant of Launceston, was examined by Mr Whitsitt,' a prominent member of ber the House, and an eminent financial This is some of his evidenceIt seems to me there is an unholy combine existing at the present time, OT shall we call it an ""honourable understanding""? Do you consider the present charges are fair and reasonable?I consider the rates of freight are too high. I will Give you an instance. In regard to chaff, prior to the rate on potatoes being raised from ios. to us., the rate on chaff was ljS. It was then put up to 16s., a shilling increase to apply to chaff the same us to potatoes. There was some trouble at the Sydney wharfs, and they raised it to 17s. per ton, maximum, 25 bags lb the ton. Straw-chaff, though perhaps 27 or 28 bags to the ton, would be charged freight as 25. If weighing 20 bags to the ton, you would declare it_ on 20, so that they cut it both ways. The existing rate now to Sydney is 18s., as against 12s. 6d. from Adelaide to Sydney. I ask honourable members if Tasmania can. work out her financial salvation when s\\& has to pay charges like these, and is in Old the hands of a trust? This Government varies have virtually entered into a contract, trade? which, for a further period of years,, leaves the trust in control of the lives,, hopes, and aspirations of 200,000 persons,, most of whom are struggling; because, in; a small place, it takes years to make afair start. The Government, instead of signing the contract to which I refer,, should have put on a line of fast, State owned steamers.",22

150,Mr KING OMALLEY,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"If one is developing and managing a great poration, he cannot take one branch only; figures. he must take the whole business.

The on Tasmanian fruit between Sydney and is 17s. 6d. per ton, whilst the freight on fruit carried from Brisbane to Sydney, the must same distance, is 9s. 9d. per ton.

152,Mr KING OMALLEY,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"I am taking the figures from the report of the Royal Commission. If the Royal Commission made a mistake, they will have to stand by it . The fruit-growers of Tasmania are called upon to pay double the freight the fruit-growers of Queensland pay. Here is another instance from the report of the Royal Commission:On 23,737 cases of Tasmanian fruit sent by one of the A.US.N. steamers in a season from Sydney to Brisbane the freight was £1.760, whilst on 46,594 cases of fruit sent from Brisbane to Svdney the freight charged was only ^1,241. So that Tasmanian growers were called upon to pay £500 more in freight tlian was charged to (Queensland growers for the carriage of exactly double the quantity of fruit. That means that the people of Queensland are charged almost a third less than we have to pay. I have no ill-feeling in the matter; I am merely putting this forward by way of comparison, and I hope the honourable member for Moreton will not think I am unfair.",24
153,Mr SINCLAIR,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,We think we are paying too much in Queensland.,24

MCDonald, the general manager of the Australian' Company, gave this evidenceWe have elicited in evidence that there is an arrangement between the various shipping companies'relative to freight charges. Is that so?Yes, we have an arrangement to run at fixed rates of freights and fares. That arrangement was arrived at after a very grave consultation in conference; the rates were fixed at that con, ference. So there is a thorough understanding. There are one or two small lines of steamers, but there is little difference ii» the freight: and I am told that the big; gentlemen have the inside of the little fellows-that they have everything that is worth having. The little fellows cannot find the capital. It is no f a u l t of theirs. If we had our Commonwealth Bank im full operation working conjointly with the States, we could do away with all this, because we could help these small producers and small business men. There is no need to plead for the big men; they can look after themselves. Wealth needs no protection; she protects herself. I.shall give one or two more instances. Mr W H . L u f f y, a well known f r u it importer of Queensland, gave this evidence to the F r u it CommissionThere was an arrangement between the companies not to trade direct?-That is right. To my mind it would be one of the best paying routes in Australia- a line of steamers direct from Hobart to Sydney, to touch at Newcastle and Brisbane. If the steamers were up to date they would lake a lot of the intermediate trade and passengers between Sydney and Brisbane. the GovernHere is further evidence. The Union Steam-ship Company, which is only about forty years old, gave their shareholders, about two years ago, 200,000 shares, besides dividends. They are now reconstructing again, and their profits have been so great that they have had again to them water their capital considerably. Last year, Huddart Parker and Company wanted £250,000 to increase their capital, and about £2,500,000 was subscribed. There are Governments in Australia who cannot today get even a little money at reasonable rates of interest to carry on their activities and enterprises. But here is a steam-ship company which, Launbeing well managed, makes such a great profit that it has no difficulty in raising capital.",24

According to the evidence in the Shipping World Year-Book, my honourable friends opposite are putting on antiquated boats. cause the Loongana could steam 22 miles an hour twelve years ago, is it to be concluded that there has been no improvement in the interval; no advancement in the science of navigation ?",26

The average receipts from passengers' fares alone amount to £1,370 per week, or £5,48 0 per month. is the magnificent proposition which the present Government have turned down.

190,Mr JENSEN,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Bass) [4.22] - I desire to support this motion. About a year ago I invited the whole of the representatives of Tasmania in this Parliament to wait upon the then Postmaster-General, with view to urging that a better mail service, as well as a better service for passengers and the carriage of produce, should be provided between Tasmania and the mainland. I contend that it is the duty of this Parliament to see that the people of the State, which is part of this great Sydney Commonwealth, shall enjoy facilities equal to those available to people on the bu t mainland to travel from State to State. Those who desire to travel, say, from Melthe bourne to Sydney, are provided by the State Governments with the quickest of transit, and we contend that it is the duty of this Parliament to see that at Tasmania is brought into line with the of the States in the matter of facilities travelling to and from the mainland. It is for this Parliament to see that the 200,000 residents of Tasmania shall have conferred upon them a public convenience of this kind, and that that public convenionly ence shall be owned by the people themI selves.

192,Mr JENSEN,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"The honourable member for Franklin and Senator Clemons, who is a member of the present Government.

The Governa ment which they are supporting propose out to give these companies a contract extenda ing over a number of years, during which boots the people of Tasmania will be in the for grip of the combine. What hope can we have of another shipping company trying to fight a combine that is well subsidized by the Commonwealth Parliament, andi. is given a long contract for the carriagei t of mails ? It is well known that freights-, l and fares in Australia today are higherthus thaii they have ever been before; but. under the terms of this contract the peopleof Tasmania will be unable to obtain any redress, since the Government have merelystipulated that as long as the present fares: and freights are not increased the company shall not be interfered with . Whata chance is there of any reduction of fares; or freights under such an agreement?' Absolutely none. On the other hand, under the terms of the contract, the fares; and freights may be increased, provided that the Postmaster-General is agreeable. If the Postmaster-General should at any time agree to such an increase, what provision is there for a reduction later on ? As the time allotted to the consideration of notices of motion has almost expired, I ask leave to continue my remarks at a later date. Leave granted'; debate adjourned. TELEPHONE LINES: COUNTR TENDERS.  move That, in order to cheapen the cost of telephone - lines, tenders should be invited for their construction in all districts where quest for .same is made, and that the district concerned should be given the advantage saving upon the departmental estimate cured. I think that every honourable'member i this House stands on common ground i regard to this matter. We all desire further the interests of our constituents by securing for them as much as we can mental in the matter of telephone extensions, and from that point of view this motion is tainly a very important one. It is also important from the stand-point of the bute large amount of money involved. Under the heading of "" n e w works,"" expended last year, on the construction and extension of telephone lines, instruments, and materials, no less than of the line ? £581,000. It would not be unreasonable to conjecture that at least one-half of that amount was expended in country districts, and to that we must add the very contrict, siderable sum which the people themkind, selves have been called upon to conin tribute. We thus have a bird's-eye view of the extent to which the people are being served by the telephone. When a me that he was prepared new line is requisitioned, the Department sends out an inspector, who, in due course, submits a report setting for t h the mated costof construction, and the same probable revenue, and upon those estiof mates the determination is based. In nearly every case, in my constituency, all events, the inspector's estimates have been such as to show that the line cannot be expected to pay within a certain period, and the people interested in it are conCrosbie. sequently asked'to pay a considerable towards its construction. I have here a typical case of a proposed line from Newister, ham to W.oodend. The departmental esworks timate of cost was £ 3 3 1 , the estimated venue deficiency £ 1 3 10s., and the public concerned were asked to contribute in cash, material, or labour, the sum of £ 6 7 , or, roughly speaking, one-fifth of the total cost of the proposed liue. In many cases, people are asked to contribute a good deal more than this. In one case also, in my own constituency, the people concerned were asked to pay 50 per cent, of the total cost of the proposed line. The. question of cost is of the greatest importance in Y this connection, and I suggest that, in order to reduce the cost of country telephone lines, tenders sluould be called for I their construction. I have evidence to submit which goes to show that, under country the existing departmental methods, the a recost .of construction is higher than it need be. If I can show that, I should be able of any to appeal confidently to honourable memthus sebers to induce the Government to adopt another method which is calculated to n lead to a very much reduced cost. I can n refer honourable members to a short line to which was desired between Strathbogie and Strathbogie North.' The departestimate of cost was £ 2 4 4 , the estimated revenue deficiency £ 1 4 8s., and the cerDepartment asked the people to comply with the ordinary conditions, and contrithe sum of £ 1 4 4 . In that case, more than half the total cost was claimed from there was the people concerned.",27
195,Mr MCWILLIAMS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"What is the length  connection with this proposed line, I had a conversation with a resident of the diswho is no. novice in matters of this because he was engaged at one time carrying out contracts under the Victorian State Government for the construction of telegraph lines. He told to construct the proposed telephone line from Strathbogie to Strathbogie North with the estisame kind of poles, and exactly on the lines as ""the extension from the town Euroa to the township of Strathbogie, and would do the work for less than half at of the Government estimate of cost.",28
196,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Who is this gentleman?  I bring these matters before the sum House in order that honourable members may decide to stiffen the back of the M in and see whether we cannot get these carried out in the cheapest way. reI visited the Department in connection with the line referred to.. I felt I had a good case, and was justified in endeavouring to have this line constructed with the least possible cost to my constituents. I put the case verbally before the Minister as clearly as I could, and in due time. I received the following reply, dated 27th March of the present yearWith reference to your inquiry on the 4th inst., on behalf of Mr D . Crosbie, Strathbogie North, as to whether the Department would approve of tenders being invited for the construction of the proposed telephone line between that place and Strathbogie, I beg to inform you that approval cannot be given for tenders to be so invited, as it is not the practice of ment to have telegraph and telephone lines erected by contract. I thought, in my innocence, that it was the province of this Parliament to determine matters of policy, and I am disposed fco think that when honourable members are made aware of the fact that the Department has adopted a method which, in the case to which I refer, would prevent a saving to the people of £120 on tlte construction of a small line, they will be behind me, and not behind the Department. I wish to impress upon honourable members that this is not by any means a singular case, but I doubt whether any other member of the House has received such a letter as that which I have just read. It certainly contains a most important statement. It should be an eyeopener to the public at large to know that, in this huge Department, which is in a position to exercise most beneficial effects in many of our outlying centres, the methods adopted stand in the way of anything being done which will reduce the cost of the construction of these tele phone lines. I have another case to submit, which I take from the Argus, and so I cannot vouch for its correctness. 1 quote the following telegram from Buninyong, which appeared in the issue of 7th June, 1913The erection of a telephone line connecting Mount Mercer, Grenville, Durham Lead, and Hardie's Hill with Buninyong, is now almost completed, and it is expected the line will be open for business before the end of this month. The residents of the districts named have subscribed the money, and, under supervision, built the line by contract work at a cost of about £130. The line is splendidly built, and flects credit on the contractors, especially as the Postal Department's estimate for the same work was over £480. By doing the work without the aid of the Government the residents have saved about £350. It will be admitted that that is a very important statement, and it should lead - honourable members to decide whether they can permit a public Department to be run in such a way and to make estimates of that kind. The big saving which was possible when the people took the matter into their own hands seems tome to reflect to some extent upon the motion submitted this afternoon by the honourable member for Darwin for the establishment of a State-owned line of steamers. I submit a further case, thefacts in connection with which I can vouch for, as it is in my own constituency. I quote the following letter to myself, dated the Depart25th August of the present yearDear Sir, Referring to your letter of the 11th instant handed to me by Councillor Speirs for reply. The Department was asked to construct a linefrom Heathcote to Toolleen, but declined doing so, as the cost would be too great. Their estimate for a tree and fence line, in which I bake it they intended to use few if any poles, was £320 2s. od. We then entered into an agreement with the Department to erect the line by private subscription, and successfully built the line-the exact cost being jfiSo 19s. 8d. The line is one 15 miles in length, and in its construction we used 331 poles, as follows :-sin . 15-feet. 79 iS-feet, and 33 25-feet. The work was all done by contract. I am quite well aware that the fact that certain districts have been able to secure telephone lines at so very much less than the Government estimate of cost may detract from the value of my motion, but I point out that the regulations under which this is managed are very complex. The matter is dealt with under regulation No. 18 of the Public Telephone Regulations. Honourable members are aware that in many country districts it is very difficult to find persons who will take the lead in matters which require some personal responsibility and involve the payment of money. Where such men can be found, these things are possible of accomplishment, but in districts that are not so fortunately circumstanced, and where there is no real leader among the people, it is found exceedingly difficult to grapple with the Department, and. to know exactly how the residents stand. The result in most cases is that the line asked for is not built. The people acit re- cept the departmental estimate; they find that it involves more than they are prepared to pay, and they do not get thenline. As so much of our prosperity depends on the work of our country people, it should be our policy to give them every facility we can. I have therefore suggested in my motion that tenders should be called for the work in every district where the people desire that that should be done. They could understand a plain specification, and it would become a mat-ter of business for some person to put in - a tender. It would be worth a man's while to do so if he saw an opportunity of making a few pounds out of the work.",28
197,Mr BENNETT,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"The honourable member - should ask that all the work should be - done by coutract.  to the length of asking that all this work should be done by contract if that is the desire of honourable members. - that course were followed, the result would be to bring into existence a number of contractors with the necessary plant and equipment. They could follow up the work, and be prepared to put in prices lower than those for which such work can be doue in a haphazard and .spasmodic way by an occasional contractor. I want to show that regulation No. 18, to which I have referred, is somewhat complex. Clause 2 readsThe persons constructing and maintaining the line shall nominate and submit to the Postmaster General the names of one or two persons as the trustees for the line, to represent them, and to receive on their account the amounts payable by the Postmaster-General, as hereinafter provided, for the use. of the line for public purposes. That involves personal responsibility, and I say again that it is not easy to get in dividuals to accept a personal responsibilit y for the benefit of all and sundry. That is why I object to the present system. Clause 6 readsThe Postmaster-General may at any lime possession of the line, paying to the owners thereof such compensation as is agreed upon. That is a provision which must impress the rjersons interested in any particular line with the idea that they cannot know where they are.",30
198,Mr MCWILLIAMS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"If a line results in a loss, the people concerned are required to keep it , but if it results in a profit, the Postmaster-General takes it over.  a representative of New South Wales stated in this chamber that the telephonic extensions in that State ' were eighteen months in arrears. That has become almost a chronic condition in Victoria in other States. It indicates that the Department is becoming water-logged. try districts. Whilst it can easily control a large numline ber of contractors, difficulty is experienced in controlling an army of men engaged carrying out telephonic construction under the day-labour system. A good deal of trouble is encountered in transferring bands of men from one district where a line has been erected to another district where a line has to be constructed. The whole thing bristles with difficulty, and I assert, without fear of contradiction, that if the telephonic construction work required throughout the Commonwealth were undertaken by private contractors, the public would get that work done for considerably less than it costs now, that it would be completed at a very much If earlier period, that the workmanship would be up to the Government standard, and that an advantage would result all round. The Department would be relieved of the responsibility of looking after individual men, and the public would benefit by getting telephonic communication at a very much less cost. I could point to a number of instances which have come under my notice in which savings have been effected by the people doing this class of work themselves. I am pleased to know that the Postmaster General is entirely in favour of the contract system",30
199,Mr MCWILLIAMS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Then why does he not carry it out?  I know that one of the most difficult things to overcome in any Department is the red-tapism which pervades it , and which was not broken down by the honourable member for Darwin, or by any other member of the late Administration. The take question of the day-labour as opposed to the contract system is one of policy, and I would like this House to affirm what the policy of the Postal Department should be. I do not intend to occupy the time of honourable members any further. The proposition is a self-evident one, and the facts which I have adduced can be easily verified. Mr MANIFOLD ""(Corangamite) [4.50]. - I have very much pleasure in seconding' the motion, and wish to bring under the notice of the Minister representing the Postmaster-General a few matters, with a view to showing him how difficult it is to and get anything in the nature of telephonic construction work carried out in the counFor . instance, there is a proposed with which I am very conversant-as was also my predecessori n running from Colac to the Carlyle River through forest country. The poles can be obtained right alongside the route to be traversed. Thus there would be no carting to be done, though there might be a little scrub which would require to be cleared. A letter which I hold in my hand from the Deputy Postmaster-General, dated December, 1911, shows that the Department is full y informed as to the reasons why this line is required. Yet it is impossible to get anything from it beyond a bald assurance that inquiry will be made. As a matter of fact, I do not get even an acknowledgement to numerous letters which I write to the Department. This projected line, which would traverse a distance of about 20 miles, according to the departmental estimate, would cost £318 13s. 9d. In the case of another line which the residents were permitted to erect for a distance of 7 miles, the cost was £ 1 4 0 . The poles of that line carry nine wires, and on the same basis the line from Colac to Carlyle River, which would carry a single wire, could be constructed for less than £200 . The Department, however, will not permit of that singlewire line being erected under contract. They will not allow the residents interested to erect it themselves. A consider° able number of electors reside in that portion of my constituency. They are separated by some distance from a railway station, and are engaged in carrying on the cheese industry. In reply to their representations, the Department has estimated that the revenue from the line would be insufficient to make it a paying proposition within eight years. It affirms that, before the line can be erected, these persons must contribute a sum of £ 2 0 0. Surely they should be given an opportunity to construct the line under contract. The undertaking, I believe, could be carried out for about £ 1 5 0 , and there would be no loss of revenue whatever. On the contrary, the revenue would increase at an enormous rate. I wish now to refer to a regulation which provides that if people wish to put a wire along departmental poles, they must pay a rental of 10s. per mile per annum for the privilege. I need scarcely point out that, in the case of a man living in a township where there is a telephone exchange, the Department erects the poles and wires for hint.",30
200,Mr TUDOR,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,He has to pay 10s. per mile per annum if he is more than miles distant from an exchange.,31
201,Mr MANIFOLD,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"But the Department will construct the line for him for a distance of 2 miles, whereas it extracts' from the resident i u the country a rental of 10s. per mile per annum. Only the. other day certain individuals interviewed the Postmaster-General, and offered toerect the j>oles required by the Department for a distance of about 30 miles. They then inquired what would be their position if they wanted to attach wiresto those poles. Notwithstanding that they had practically carried out the work of erecting the line, they were told that they would have to pay a rental of 10s. per mile per annum for the right to use the i r own poles. I advised them to put up their own poles, and to have nothing to do with the Department at all. That is the condition of affairs which obtains in the country today. The Department will take over only lines which are paying. I hope that we shall effect some alteration in these regulations. If it is impossible for the Postmaster-General to move in this matter, if he is too tightly bound by red-tape, we had better have a l it t l e "" burst up , "" and endeavour to break that red-tape.",31
202,Mr BENNETT,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Gippsland) [4.57] The construction of telephone lines in the country is a very important matter, and I am glad the honourable member for Echuca has brought it forward, so that we may discuss it fully. I agree with the honourable member for Corangamite that it is almost impossible to get construction work carried out in the country districts at the present time. Further, many lines which have been erected are in such a condition owing to the anxiety of the settlers in years gone-by to obtain telephonic communication, that the Department will not take them over. Honourable members who represent city constituencies do .not appear to realise that country residents are suffering a grave injustice at the hands of the Postal Department. There is no doubt that telephonic facilities are more necessary in rural areas than they are in the cities. In my opinion, the telephonic service should be such as to permit of the rapid despatch of the people's business. Nowadays, things move rapidly in business circles, and, therefore, it is absolutely necessary that a more lenient system in the matter of telephonic construction shall 2 be made applicable to country residents. In the Gipspland district there are many places which are separated from small centres by distances of thirty and forty miles. Every one of these places is valuable from a national point of view, and their development should be one of the main objectives of this or any other Government. Now, the first step towards the development of any district should be the establishment postal and telephonic communication. Yet the responsibility for building these services is thrown on the pioneers who are blazing the track of civilization for future generations, and who, in many cases, are expected to foot the bill for the whole cost of construction. residents were permitted to carry out the work of erecting telephones, the direction of the departmental or if tenders were called for locally, the cost of telephone extensions would be half what it is now, and the new services would be profitable from the so that there would be no penalization of the users of them. The should so alter the regulations as to allow for the calling of tenders both in the large centres of population and in the districts in which work is to be carried out. would enable the residents of districts requiring telephone communication undertake contracts for the erection of the wires, and they would probably do the work for 50 per cent, less than it costs by the present departmental and would benefit by the saving effected. '.Che other day I introduced to the Deputy Postmaster-General here a urging the construction of 15 miles of telephone, from a place out from Omeo, known as The Swamp, to the Rest, a line of communication needed for more than one reason. is not only the business centre of this part of the country, it is also the place to which settlers must go for medical and surgical attention. When an happens, or illness comes, patients'' have often to be taken 20 miles to get attention. The deputation to which I refer was told that the estimated cost of the line for which they asked was something like £260. Honourable members know that the line is not to be carried on poles, but is to be suspended from tree to tree, following the road, only fifteen poles being used in its construction. mate, therefore, appeared to me to be extremely high, and I asked what would be the probable cost of the material This, I was informed, was put down by 3fr. Bennett. the - departmental officers at £ 4 0 . The deputation said that they would construct the line if the Department would supply the material. We were informed that all the Department wanted was 10 per cent, on the cost of construction, and that if they got that, the line would be considered a paying one. The local residents could of carry out tjhe work of erecting the line for £60. up",31
203,Mr MCWILLIAMS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,It is the same story everywhere.,32
204,Mr BENNETT,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"The Government should re-model the regulations governing If local telephone construction. I am pleased to notice that the last Government Gazette under contains quite a number of applications officers, for tenders for telephone construction, though they are for long trunk lines; but I would like the local residents to be given an opportunity to erect branch country beginning, lines. I have known valuable lives to be lost for want of telephone communication. Government In many cases men who meet with accidents have to be immediately hurried in the direction of the nearest medical adviser, some one riding ahead on horseThat back to tell the doctor what has happened, and to bring him to meet the sufferer.

We have heard a lot about the required. need for non-contentious proposals.

206,Mr LIVINGSTON,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Barker) [ 5 . 9 ] - congratulate the honourable member for Echuca on having moved the motion. We know that, in the past, it has been very difficult to obtain the material necessary for telephone extensions. In my opinion, past Governments have done very well with the machinery that they had at hand, and I trust that this Government will also do all that it can to extend telephone communication into the country, j l y doing so, it will greatly assist settlement, inducing persons to live in the country who now remain in the towns. The honourable member for Gippsland is right in saying that telephones are needed in the country to get people to live there. The extension of telephone communication, and the increasing use of motor-cars, will revolutionize country conditions. honourable member for Barrier, when Postmaster-General, did everything he could for the convenience of country districts. We should indeed be proud of what has been done. If Australia makes as much progress in the next six years as she has <lone in the past six years, she will do remarkably well. In my district, in no case has a guarantee had to be called up, all the lines that have been made' having proved profitable. There is, - of course, a good deal of red-tape in departmental methods, but you will find that all over the world, and I think that you can hardly get r i d of it . When application is made for a telephone line, the first thing that the Department does is to ask, "" What will it pay?"" I agree with the honourable member for . Echuca that it would be a good tiling to call for tenders locally for the construction of lines, because local people can always get material more cheaply, and do work more cheaply, than can the Department. But the work done should be always done under official supervision, to secure something like uniformity.' I am sure the Postmaster-General keenly desires the development of Australia, and will put no obstacle in the way of telephone extensions. The other day, when I brought a deputation before him, he said, ' ' If you think that the departmental estimate is too high, submit an estimate of your own in proper terms. Do not say that the work can be done for so-and-so, but write to me, setting down exactly what you would construct it for. If you do that, you may depend that you will get all the help I can give you. If you offer to do the work, I promise to give you - I the best material and supervision."" There could not be a fairer promise than that. I feel confident that the Postmaster General will do a great deal for the development of Australia by extending telephone lines, and if he does as well as his predecessors, he will do very well indeed. In Australia we have great difficulty in - getting the material that we need. For years past we have not been able to get letter-boxes made fast enough. Our country is progressing so fast that it is almost impossible to. keep pace with its requirements, especially in the matter of telegraphs and telephones. Estimates are made today which, six months later, are found to be quite insufficient. The Postmaster-General has a tough job The ahead of him, and I hope it will always be a tough job, because it is in the interests of Australia that this great progress should occur. It was pleasing to hear the honourable member for Maranoa speaking of what has been done in regard to telephones in his electorate. I recollect when one could go miles and miles in that country without the slightest means of communication. The honourable member has been energetic, but he will never get all he requires, because his district will still be progressing, and, in addition to the hundreds of miles already connected, hundreds and hundreds of miles of country will need to be linked up. The honourable member has pointed out how many lives have been saved by the extension of telephones. I know that in my district, since we have had telephones extended to outlying districts, there has been a great change in regard to people going out to live in the country; and I venture to say there is not one man in this House who will vote against extending telephonic communication still wider and wider all over Australia. I know that every Postmaster-General from whom I have sought information in connection with this matter has done his level best with the material and money available, and the Miuisters controlling the Postal Department deserve our very best thanks in this regard.  is no doubt that there is congestion of work in regard to telephone extensions. We cannot altogether blame the Department for it ; the officers have done remarkably well i u the circumstances; bu t the trouble is that it is impossible to lay down a hard-and-fast rule to apply all over Australia. In the first place, the material must be found by the Government for these telephone services; but I think the Department could well make a concession on the rate, which would make the difference between a paying concern and one which they will nob undertake to build. The charge is now 10 per cent, on the cost of construction; but it is a monstrous charge. Some time ago I moved' in the House to try to reduce this rate.",33

They thought they were breaking their necks when they got 400 for South Australia. boxes pay the moment they are attached. The Department receive any amount of applications for them, but they have no stock of letter-boxes ou hand. The same thing applies to wire for telephones. They wait until the last moment before they order the material, but I maintain that large quantites of letter-boxes, telephone wire, and other telephone equipment, should be kept in store. There is a great deal to be said in favour of allowing the people in districts to do their own particular work, and I would not advocate one particular standard of telephone. trunk lines are necessary, a substantial line quite up to date must be erected, but there are scores of plac«s where a line that would not now be approved by the Department would serve ail the purposes required. The Department have a stereotyped specification for wire they require, but that standard is ouly needed for t run k lines. I am anxious to know the result of a telephone service recently constructed in my district. While the Departmentwere considering the matter of whether it would be a paying concern or not, the people took the matter into their own hands, and had the line put up in about twenty-four hours, and I am told that this line has passed the in spection, and that the work was done well. No doubt, a little more latitude should be given to the Deputy Postmasters General in the different States. If they were allowed to accept oilers in the localities where work is required it could be done more expeditiously. At the same time 1 agree with the honourable member for Barker that the figures relating to the telephone mileage erected during the last ten years are amazing. There was absolutely nothing done previously. There are 400 miles of coast-line in my electorate, and ten years ago there were only two places along that coast from which telegrams could be despatched; there was no telephone service at all ; but today there is hardly ten miles between the spots where one can get into telephonic communication with other districts. An y f a u lt is where where the number of the population is reasonable a service has been provided. There were no telephoues in the middle north of South Australia ten years ago, but now there is hardly a place that is not connected. The difficulty is in Ihe outlyY e t these letter- ing districts, when the Department require the. stereotyped standard of 10 per cent, ou the cost of construction, and applicants get the stereotyped replies that the work cannot be done, as the revenue will not meet the expenditure. Certainly there have been improvements in this regard from various Governments. The Commonwealth now accepts a larger proportion of the loss. I think it is 50 per cent.",34
211,Mr MCWILLIAMS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"We ask the poorest people of the community to give a guarantee.  with that attitude. In some places to which the States have buil t railways, and where huge works have been carried o u t by the States, we have had great difficulty in getting telephone services. have no doubt great improvement could be made in getting the work done more cheaply, and with greater expedition. The officers of the Department in South Australia have their hands' absolutely full in carrying out works, and the alternative is to increase the permanent staff, or to allow a lot of this work to be done by people outside the Department, the Government supplying the necessary material. I trust the Government will do all they can to be up to date in connection with the extension of telephones.",34
212,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Wakefield) [5.21] - I move, as an amendment That the words "" a request for same is made "" be struck out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word "" practicable."" In the event of t h is amendmen t being agreed to , the m o t i o n will r e a d That in order to cheapen the cost of country telephone lines tenders should be invited for their construction in all districts where practicable, and that the district concerned should be given the advantage of any saving upon the Departmental estimate thus secured. We have to keep in view the fact that there is a glut of work, aud the amendment, therefore, will make the motion a workable one. Another advantage is secured in reference to the tendering principle as against day labour, which is the - chief cause for the delay of this work in every part of the Commonwealth.  that they have not the gangs to do the work.",35
213,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"That is one of the arguments why these works should be submitted to public tendering, because if it is known generally throughout the - Commonwealth that this work will be submitted to public tendering, the advertisements will be seen by men who are specially qualified for the work, aud who are looking for it . Possibly there will be - sufiicient work coming out in every Government Gazette to enable these men, who are practically experts-and , if not, they soon will be-to-d o the work as effectively as the men in the Government Departments.",35
214,Mr LIVINCSTOX,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,There are men doing that work in South Australia now.,35
215,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Any number of them. The reason why I suggest we should use the words "" where practicable "" is that the Government might possibly desire to have trunk lines erected by their own special men, and there is no I reason why that should not be done; but outside ordinary trunk lines, any handy man can right away undertake the work, and do it as effectively as those employed in the Government Department. The honourable member for Echuca, in submitting his motion, quoted three cases to show conclusively that an enormous saving would be effected to the Department by the adoption of the contract system. Doing work by contract will get over the difficulty of the block that has existed for a long time, because of the fact that the Department have not had the gangs of men to overcome it . Another cause for delay in connection with many of these works has been pointed out by the honourable member for Grey. He spoke of the Department not having sufficient stock in hand, and he referred particularly to letter-boxes. A letter-box pays for its cost in three years, and is a most profitable t h in g ; but, despite this, applications for letter-boxes are not fulfilled for twelve or eighteen months, and even two years. The reply to applications is that the Department have no stock, and that the boxes cannot be supplied until the end of the year.",35
216,Mr LIVINGSTON,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,They cannot get them manufactured.,35
217,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"They can get them manufactured. I have been told by the Department that they have submitted so many orders, and that they have had them supplied in accordance with the number ordered; but the trouble is that, while they have submitted a certain number of orders, in the meantime applications have been received for two or three times the number.  not anticipate what will be required in the future.",35
218,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"In regard to letter-boxes, the Department admit that they have applications that it will take them twelve months to fulfil , but they admit that they have not submitted orders for the boxes that have been applied for. It is the same in regard to telephones. They say they have not the wire, and when a question is asked as to whether the wire is ordered, it is found that it has not been ordered. How can the Department get the wire if they do not order it? I very cordially support this motion, subject to my amendment, and I am quite sure that it will result, in a greater venience to the people in the back counthe try-to the pioneers of settlement. These great facilities, like railways, are instrutinually, ments of production, and I know they w i always get sympathetic support from line every farming representative in this House.",35

I heartily endorse the ideas which are contained i the motion and the amendment, and I hope that the Government will make strenuous effort to carry such a policy into Modder River. effect. I believe that the Postmastercooking; General has taken a step in the right direction, because there have already been gazetted notices asking for tenders the construction of new lines. What is wanted, as I understand the motion, that, wherever it is practicable in the construction of the telephone lines so urgently sought in .so many parts of the Commonwealth, the local people, if able friends make great mistakes. they feel so disposed, shall have the right to tender not only for the supply of poles, but also for erecting the wires, and bringat ing about a thorough-going concern. Old members of the House know that this is a perennial question. The honourable memprogress ber for Maranoa has raised it many years, and I have expressed my views on many occasions. In my opinion, the producers will have a strong inducement to go to what we might call the back-blocks, if they feel that they can get immediately a telephone connection fairs Department. with the centres to which they go, in a case of illness or emergency, or even i matter of ordering goods. When any producers are in that position, they feel that they are not altogether out of touch with the world. They realise that if they need get assistance quickly, it canbe obtained, and altogether it is an inducement to the very men whom we wish to see multiply in Australia. I do not propose to occupy any time in repeating what has been said. I merely wanted to say that, dealing a matter of such general importance, motion has my hearty endorsement.",36

It was all right when it was surrounded with the spiritual odour. I have always claimed that to suggest a reform is not to attack the individuals in a Dewith partment. Young men go into theDethe partment when they are only children. I think that twenty-two years of age is last stage at which a youth can enter, then a person can never enter the DeMost partment unless the Public Service Commissioner certifies that there is nobody there qualified.

He has not learned how to pay back wages on a Saturday afternoon or Friday night, when the banker has told him that he will not honour his cheque any further. He has not learned that science, and, therefore, he has not got to the final pivotal angle to get at the business. When a business man gets into the Department, the officers look at him a3 an interloper, and think, "" What does this fellow know "" ? A lad grows up, and becomes an official machine, and he does not know anything beyond the machine. That is not the fault of the man, but of the system. If a man attempts to make any reforms, it is said that he is turning the British Empire on its tail, and it may roll over. I sympathize from the bottom of my heart with the Postmaster-General, because I remember what I suffered. was a martyr to officialdom. We want to make reforms, aud do not care whether they emanate from our friends on one side or the other. I am behind the man with reforms. We want reforms, not only in legislation, but in administration. require to take the Departments out of the Slough of Despond, and put them on a high business plane. If we have not men here for that purpose, bring them in from outside, and give them a salary of £5,000 or £10,000 a year. I suggest to the Postmaster-General that he should send to Chicago or London. Murdoch, the architect for the Home Affairs Department, went to London, I gave him a mission. He is a Scotchman; he was born in Scotland, and trained in England, and has spent t h i r t y years in Australia. He is one of the ablest business men in the world, in my opinion. He is the only man I ever met in the Department who told me that he did not want his salary raised.",36

Chicago has the same size post-office today as it had when its population was half-amilliou.

But it is essential to decentralize the business. - The wheels - are clogged. The machine is in the quicksands, and the fault is not that of the officials, but of the machine itself. Very serious complaints are made in Tasmania, because in country districts those who wish to use a public telephone after 8 p.m. have to pay double rates. The Australian producers are the chief sufferers under such a system. I - urge the Post master-General to do something to improve the position in this respect. * In farming communities, where the homesteads are far apart, a guarantee has to be given by those who ask for a - telephone line, but is any guarantee demanded in the case of a city line ?",37

I hope that he will not reply by telling me what our Ministry did or did not do. We were in office for only three years, and could not do everything. H ad we remained in power for three years more we fihould have turned things frontwards. I wish to see the producers in the back blocks placed, in the matter of telephones, on an equal footing with the people of our cities, who haye their libraries, their theatres, their picture shows, their circuses, and ample telephone facilities. If the Minister will give country people telephone lines on the terms upon which they are available to the people of the cities, I shall be satisfied.

The Departcent, between the two prices. ment was going to send up inspector all the way from Sydney to make a report on an £ 8 job. I wired up, "" Do her at once,"" and we had her done the next day. It is these circumlocutory methods that annoy the citizens. In every little town there is a-carpenter, a plumber, and a man who can lay concrete, and when small repairs are needed to the local post-office, the local postmaster should get one of these men . to effect them, instead of the work being delayed for months, pending instructions from head-quarters and the making of reports. Postmasters have power, I think, to spend up to £ 1 0 on repairs. The trouble is that many of them do not read the regulations. There is, perhaps, a hole in the roof of a post-office, and by the time that the local officer has telegraphed to the head office, and has received instructions to read the regulations and have the repairs effected locally, rain has fallen, water has got into the building, and damage to the extent of £ 4 0 or £ 5 0 has been done. I hope that the Postmaster General will take these matters into his earnest consideration and do something. Then, Mr HANS IRVIN E (Grampians) [5.51] - I wish to endorse the remarks I that have been made by representatives had of country electorates in regard to this and question, for I am convinced that the rural districts have not received the ata tention they deserve in the matter of communication. The primary producers are the true wealth producers the of the country, and on this, a national, and not a party, question, I think both I shall some support the motion with the amend.conment of the honourable member for I have had some experience, spenot only in Victoria, but in other States, What we of the delays incidental to the carrying carout of telephone works, and of the adI ditional cost incurred owing to the failure to have them carried out by local I brought under the attention of Postmaster-General a case in which it was estimated by the Department that the erection of a telephone line-it was a much tree and fence line, but some posts g tenwere to be used-woul d cost, I think, 18s. 3d., whereas a local On one man offered to erect the line, the wires and insulators to be provided by the Department, for £ 1 5 0 . There per For the an last two years residents of Stuart M ill , who have to travel fifteen or sixteen miles for a doctor, have been appealing in vain for telephonic communication. I agree with the honourable member for Darwin that the departmental officers are willing enough, but that it is the system itself which is at fault. As to his complaint regarding the double rates charged for the use of public telephones after 8 p.m., I would remind him that it was the Fisher Government who issued the regulation providing for the closing of country post offices at 6 p.m.  service can be obtained if the revenue is sufficient to justify it .",38
238,Mr HANS IRVINE,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"In the case of a small country town the stipulated revenue is not likely to be forthcoming, with the result tiiat after 6 p.m. double rates are charged, and a man cannot get into a post-offic6 at all a few minutes after 8 p.m. I wish to see telephonic reforms, and I think it would be in the interests ot Australia to place the Postal Department at once under the control of Commissioners. Under such a system, I think that our works could be carried out far more promptly than they are at present. As a matter of fact, it took me 'nearly two years to induce the Department to take over a telephone line between Avoca and Natte Yallock, which the people had buil t for themselves, and which has paid from its inception. was eventually taken over as 'a gift,- and local residents had to guarantee that the revenue would be sufficient to cover working expenses.",39
239,Mr AHERN,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,And probably they were charged for the cost of inspection?,39
240,Mr HANS IRVINE,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"No doubt, they were. I know how these additional costs are incurred. I brought under the notice of the Postmaster-General a case on the Marnoo line, where six or eight men were doing the work of one man. Sometimes they were at work, and sometimes they were not. The M in ister, after making inquiries, I believe, had these men dismissed. Naturally those who had to provide the money to pay the men growled at the way at which the work was being carried out. I do not believe all that I hear, but the case to which I refer gives us an illustration of what ocurs under the "" man-on-thejob "" policy. The working farmer, who is establishing civilization in the backber blocks, is being made to pay [70]- 2 different work done by these individuals. I think it would be in the interests of the people to erect telephone lines in country districts without demanding any guarantee whatever.

241,Mr RODGERS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"""Wannon) [5.57] This question has been so full y discussed that I should not have risen to speak but that I prefer the motion in its original form. . It seems to me that those who ask for a line should be best able to judge whether it ought to be constructed under tender conditions or otherwise. If the Department is to determine whether or not it is practicable to invite tenders for such works, people in country districts will still be in the hands of the departmental officers in this regard.",39
242,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"If the Department cannot judge a matter of that kind, it ought to be wiped out.",39
243,Mr RODGERS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"There are sets of circumstances of which the Department cannot always have full knowledge. I had not been a member of this House very long when I received from all parts of my electorate requests for new telephone lines, whilst old propositions were resuscitated. Upon examining the figures relating to specific lines, I found that certain localities were up against the reguIt lations, and that the estimated cost was altogether out of proportion to what, i h my opinion, was a reasonable amount to allow for the building of those lines. I pointed out to the Postmaster-General that the figures in certain cases were altogether unreasonable. I saw the Chief Electrician, Mr Hesketh, in regard to two or three specific cases, and I am pleased to say that Mr Hesketh and his chief of staff in Victoria are both common-sense, practical men. I found that they had been endeavouring for some time to put forward the desirableness of having lines constructed upon what are called "" . l i g h t - l in e"" principles, and I think that many honourable members have but themselves to blame for the fact that their districts have not obtained quicker aud cheaper telephone construction. The motion, as it stands, will leave us up against the conditions that obtain today as far as the regulations are concerned.",39
244,Mr RILEY,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Does the honourable memmean that it will leave us up againis& for the in - the minimum wage ?,39
245,Mr RODGERS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Not at all. I am referring to the fact that, under the regulations at present, 20-ft. and 26-ft. telephone poles would have to be used, even in a way-back district where all that is necessary is a light line. Why not give any particular locality the benefit of local timber, which is being utilized today in fencing and in the erection of buildings? Why should not the local timber be used in such cases, instead of 20-ft. and 26-ft. poles being taken at much cost from a forest 200 or 300 miles away ? Let us revise the whole of the regulations relating to the construction of country telephone lines. The motion, as it stands, only covers in part the case that we have to meet. I would ask the mover of the motion to embrace within its terms a direction that the whole question of country telephone construction sliould be revised. I agree with the honourable member for Darwin that we want business propositions and local handling. We should adopt the system of transmitting responsibility to the Deputy Postmasters-General, and from them to local postmasters. Local propositions, combined with the adoption of the contract system, should secure for us cheaper telephone construction. . Mr FALKINE R (Riverina) [6.1] - I should prefer to support the motion in its original form. If more requests are made for the construction o.f telephone lines than can be complied with, each district should be given a fair show. I mention that, because in my electorate we have wanted a new post-office in one town for the last ten or eleven years. Recently, the man who owned the building previously occupied as a post-office gave the Department notice to quit. They did not go out when they should, although the landlord had a hotel licensee ready to come in, and when .they ultimately did go out at a day's notice, the post-office business has to be carried on in a little wooden building, which is entirely unfitted for the purpose. No site has been purchased for a new post-office in the town, and there is no money on the Estimates for the purpose, although the authorities must be aware that the district is a progressive one, and is deserving of attention. I mention this because one honourable member has told us that during the last three years fourteen post-offices in his electorate had been brought up to date. He said, further, that he had had 248 miles of new telegraph lines constructed in his electorate in 1911, and 587 miles in 1912, 172 miles of telephone lines in 1911, and 274 miles in 1912, and that altogether he had had expended in his electorate, during the three years, over £37,000.",40

247,Mr FALKINER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"No . If it had been, I should not be getting three or tour letters every day on the subject. The honourable member who gave this information is the honourable member for Gwydir, as .honourable members will see if they refer to Hansard, page 769.",40
248,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,That must have been the result of the. honourable member's efforts on the Postal Commission.,40
249,Mr FALKINER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"If I am in order in reading from a debate of this. session, what the honourable member said wasAdding together post offices ^8,344 14s. 6d., telegraphs ,£9,293, and telephones ^19,572, we have a total of £37,229 14s. 6d. spent on postal works in the electorate of Gwydir. In view of the huge increase in Post Office expenditure, I say that every electorate should be given a look in. There are many reasons why the construction of telephone lines costs a good deal of money. I do not favour what might be called a "" poddy "" line. Many lines are being constructed in my district, which is progressing from a pastoral to an agricultural district, and they will require to carry more wires than can be put on one of these stumpy lines. I am in favour of compliance with the departmental regulations as to the poles to be erected. MI . ORCHARD - What height of pole does the honourable member suggest?",40
250,Mr FALKINER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"The regulation height-1 2 feet. I hope that the ScotchAmerican, who the honourable member for Darwin suggests should be brought from Chicago is a practical man, and will do a number of practical things which should have been done long ago. In the district in which I live it has been the practice for the last twenty-three years, and I do not know how much longer, for a man to go out once a year and chop down a few suckers in one particular place underneath the telegraph lines. It takes about two days to do the work, but the trees could be grubbed up altogether in about a week, and the work would then be done for all time. Another practice which may be objected to is that of putting up poles of the local colonial pine in a green state. A man gets a contract for. repairing a line, and puts up pine poles when they are green, with the result that in a few years they rot. An y one possessing practical knowledge of the matter knows that if seasoned timber, and especially seasoned pine, is used, the poles will last for a generation. Again, where poles are used of a certain height, it has been a common practice, in repairing a line, to put up an iron pole about 3 feet shorter. If the iron pole is high enough, the old wooden pole for which it has been substituted would do very well again if the rotten part in the ground were cut off. In progressive districts that are changing from pastoral to agricultural, the Department should endeavour to anticipate the requirements of the people. A few years ago a post-office was built in my electorate, and it was hardly up before the outside wall was pulled down and the building enlarged. The Department makes no provision for the future , and I say they should anticipate the probable requirements of progressive districts.",40
251,Mr RILEY,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"South Sydney) [ 6 . 8 ] hope that, if it is decided to make the departure proposed and call for tenders for the construction of telephone lines, the Department will see that decent wages are paid to those who are engaged in the work.",41
252,Mr RODGERS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Hear , hear. We all say that.",41
253,Mr RILEY,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"If tenders are to be called for , it must be the duty of the Post and Telegraph Department to see that the ruling rates of wages are paid for the work done under the contracts.",41
254,Mr AGAR WYNNE,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,That will be one of the conditions of the specification.,41
255,Mr BENNETT,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Suppos e a farmer and his sons are prepared to do this work in their slack time ?,41
256,Mr RILEY,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"I hope that the farmer and his sons will stick to their farming, and will give men ordinarily engaged in this kind of work a chance to live. feel confident that the present Postmaster General will see that no hardship is done to the men engaged in this work under contract. I wish, with other honourable members, to see as many telephone lines as possible constructed, but I am not so anxious that they should be constructed as cheaply as possible. If the contract system is to be adopted, proper specifications must be drawn up, and if the work is to be done in the cheapest possible way the specifications will not be very strict.  a reasonable price.",41
257,Mr RILEY,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"We want a good job above all things. If we are to have lines erected too cheaply, and must then employ an army of men in keeping them in repair, they will be found to be very expensive in the long run . The Post and Telegraph Department might have done more in this direction, but what has been done under the Department has been done substantially. We must demand stability if we are to spend the taxpayers' money in paying contractors to do this work.",41
258,Mr MCWILLIAMS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Where only a single wire is to be carried the posts stipulated for are altogether too big.,41
259,Mr RILEY,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"The honourable member forgets that where a single wire is sufficient for all purposes now, five or six wires may be required in a few years' time, and the Department must look ahead. - I Mr MCWILLIAMS - The honourable member talks like a city man, and does not understand the conditions in the country districts.",41
260,Mr RILEY,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"I think I can claim to have as much experience in the matter as a man whose business it is to lift ink out of a bottle with a pen. I know something about building work, and I know that "" jerry "" work is the most expensive in the long run. The recent decision to reduce the standard height of telephone poles will enable the Department to make much greater progress in the future than has been possible in the past. I am most anxious that those who may be engaged in the work of constructing telegraph and telephone lines under contract shall be given a fair deal, and shall be required to work only the ordinary hours. So long as that is provided for, I shall be satisfied. I Mr ORCHARD (Nepean) [6.12] --It it evident from the unanimity of opinion on both sides of the House that honourable members recognise that what is suggested by this motion is very necessary. Some time ago I asked a question with reference to the delay in the construction of telephone lines which had been approved in the Nepean electorate. I make no complaint against the Department for the way they have been receiving my representations, generally I have fared well; but I do complain of delay in constructing those which have been approved. I wished to' know whether the delay was due to a shortage of staff, and, if so, whether the Postmaster-General would not see the advisability of increasing the staff, in order to avoid delay in the construction of lines within the Nepean and other country districts. I received the following answer to the question I put on the subject: The Deputy Postmaster-General, Sydney, has furnished the following information :No public telephone lines authorized by this Department in the Nepean electorate are being delayed through shortage of staff. There were a few telephone subscribers' lines in that electorate delayed through shortage of material, but they are now in hand. I can assure honourable members that no more misleading answer could have been given. I do not wish to reflect upon the Deputy Postmaster-General in Sydney, as I believe there is no more conscientious officer, but the information supplied to him by his subordinates was certainly misleading, because, in every instance where the*construction of a telephone line or telephone cabinet has been approved, the approval has been accompanied with a stereotyped footnote to the effect that the work cannot be undertaken for some time owing to the amount of work already in hand. I am sure that other honourable members must have received the same kind of answers as those which I have received. Recently, in connection with a telephone line in another portion of my electorate, when I drew attention to the I got from the Department, I had been told that it was most misleading, because some time ago an officer of the Departsame thing. ment had been in the district, and when asked the reason for the delay, he said there were forty preceding claims. When grant an honourable member asks for information of interest to his constituents he should be supplied by the Department with correct answer. In another part of electorate, at Sackville North, the matetions rial for a cabiuet has been allowed to in the yard exposed to all sorts of weather for the past three months waiting for man to come along and fit it up.",41
261,Mr THOMAS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,How about the Liverpool Manoeuvre Area ?,42
262,Mr ORCHARD,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"This is not the time for airy persiflage. Just now I dealing with the important matter of telephone construction. I entirely endorse the statement of the honourable member for Darwin, that we have behaved too generously to the cities, and too parsimoniously fo the country districts.",42
263,Mr RILEY,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,It is the city residents who make our telephone service pay.,42
264,Mr ORCHARD,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,But they would not be able to make it pay were it not for the trade which they get from the country?,42
265,Mr RILEY,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,The cities are keeping the country.,42
266,Mr ORCHARD,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Distribute d throughout the Commonwealth are men who are doing what is best for Australia. In other words, they are developing the lands of this country, and to compensate them for the sacrifices which they make in denying themselves the privileges afforded by our cities, we ought to keep them in touch with the more populated parts by granting them telephonic communication. The officials in our various public Departments aro past-masters in the art of taking advantage of any loop-hole which an amendment such as that which we are now considering may afford them. If we affirm that telephonic communication shall be granted in country districts "" where practicable,"" in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred they will say that it is not practicable. I intend to support the motion in its original form, as a meami of expediting telephone construction, and I congratulate the honourable member for Echuca upon having brought it forward.",42

Fifty motions of this kind, with these words struck out, would not alter the position. Therefore, honourable mema bers upon this side of the House should my not pay too much attention to the observaof the old birds'opposite, who are lie endeavouring to sow seeds of dissension amongst others who are not so wily and a oily as is the honourable member for Adelaide. This fact must be heeded: that the Department this year is going to cost 61 or 62 per cent, more than it will collect as revenue. Honourable members have am been talking about getting a man out from America to run the Department. Why , the first thing that he would do would be to double the telephone rates.",42

269,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"I thundered at the honourable member, for ignoring the report of the expert, who said that what he was doing would add to the cost of the Department instead of diminishing it.",43

277,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"I am answering the question which has been put to me from the other side of the House at least ten times today. I say that the expenditure upon the Postal Department this year will be £1,300,000 above the expenditure of last year.",43

Mr ROBERTS. - Heave n help the count r y when it is placed under Commissioners !  that system.",43
280,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"The reasons for this trouble are many. We have not the material, and we have not the men trained to do this particular kind of work. This Parliament is responsible for that to a very ""great extent. Everybody knows that the Department was starved for years. Now we are glutting it with money. The result is that it has not the staff trained to do this particular work, and I am afraid that we shall not get such a staff until we place business men i u charge of it to conduct it as every other private business is conducted.",43
281,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Col d water is being poured on the motion now.,43
282,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"What I am saying is in favour of the motion under consideration. If we are going to have an increase in construction works, we must have efficiency of construction. Efficiency is the very first letter in the alphabet of cheapness. The first thing for us to do is to set our house in order-to put our Post Office under men who will in fuse efficiency into its control. Meantime, we must do the best that we can. The Government are endeavouring to hand works out to anybody who can undertake them, either in the country or anywhere else. Instructions were issued months ago with that end in view. Everything that my honourable friends are asking for has already been done.",43
283,Mr AHERN,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,What about the specifications which the Postmaster-General promised us?,43
284,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"They are not yet ready. The Department is engaged on the specifications.

285,Mr WEST,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Why should not there be ?,43

' Mr FISHER (Wide Bay) [7.46] The few remarks that I have already addressed to the Committee on the subject of the Budget dealt with a statement of the Treasurer which I think is calculated to mislead the public as to the surplus left by the last Government, and the manner in which it was dealt with. I shall read the statement to which I refer, to give the Treasurer an opporThe tunity of saying plainly whether he in tended to convey to the public anything but the actual facts.

What is the history of borrowing in this Parliament? Liberal Treasurer, Sir George Turner, during the first session of the first Parliament, proposed to borrow £500,000 , but Parliament prevented him from doing so, and borrowing was stopped for a period of seven years. The next proposal to borrow came from the Fusion Government,, which introduced a Bill to authorize the raising of a loan of £3,500,000 to provide for the defence of Australia by purchasing a Navy.  in the Budget speech of 1909 the suggestion that £1,400,00 0 should be borrowed on Treasury-bills.",45

The Sydney Morning Herald of the same date saidWhen the new Government takes office it will find itself face to face with a serious problemthat of providing for a serious deficit for the financial year ending 30th June next. Sir John Forrest estimated that the Commonwealth would be about £900,000 short when it came to meet all its obligations at the end of the' year.

When we submitted the Bill for repealing the Naval Loan Act , after we came - back from the country, and after the arrangement had been made with the States by the Deakin Government, the present Treasurer said I believe this proposal to be unwise and conto the best interest of the country. I also think that the action now taken by the Government, supported by a large majority of the House, is the beginning of a system of oppressive taxation which will injure most those whom it is intended to assist. Later on, dealing with the same subject, the honourable member for Parramatta saidIt is a mistaken policy to repeal such an Act in view of the future history of the Empire in relation to Naval Defence. How can we insure any protection unless we take steps to protect our trade? If ever there was a reproductive work, the building of a navy adequate to protect Australia is, in its very essence, a reproductive enterprise. I do not hesitate to say that the flotation of a Naval Loan would have been a good thing for Australia in many ways. l i e gave other reasons, but they are all on the same line. He was against the repeal of the Naval Loan Act , because he thought we could not finance the affairs of the country without resorting to borrowing.

336,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,It was a new ligation.,47
337,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"The honourable member seems to tjhink that an island in his own State is going to die out like a battleship. An island in the centre of Sydney harbour, and equipped in every way for the particular purpose of a naval dock, will become more valuable in years to come, yet the honourable member wishes to treat it as he would treat a ship. It is with such ideas that honourable members seek to permeate the minds of the public. They have no occasion to use illustrations that are false in every way when we begin to examine them.",47
338,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Not only the island, but a lot of old boilers and old machinery.",47
339,The CHAIRMAN,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"I cannot allow the Prime Minister to keep up a running commentary on the speech of the honourable member for Wide Bay. There is a habit growing in this Chamber this session, and it is assuming very serious dimensions. When an honourable member is speaking, it is a frequent occurrence that another honourable member who thinks he has a reply endeavours to get in that reply straight away by interjection. It is impossible to carry on a debate in that way. The Standing Orders provide for any reply to be made by way of a speech, and I hope that during this debate honourable members will remember that",47
340,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Tru e to the failing of their predecessors and themselves, the present Government propose in this Budget to expend a certain amount out of loan moneys for defence purposes other than that I have already indicated of a permanent nature. I believe it is absolutely false financing in times of peace,- especially in times of abounding prosperity in regard to finance, to pay anything for defence purposes out of loan moneys. We heard during the elections ihat the Fisher Government had been revtlling in We revenue; that they did not know what to do with it ; but the revenue of the present Government is as high as was ours. They calculate it for the current year as practically the same, and they propose to spend the £2,650,000 we left them, as well as the £3,080,000 they seek to borrow. And notwithstanding all their income from revenue, they propose to expend loan moneys for defence purposes. They have introduced a bad system. It will be an evil day for this country if , ob- during times of peace and prosperous years, it pledges its credit, and, in times of difficulty and trouble, when there is fighting to be done and destruction takes place, it has to fall back on loan resources, when, perhaps, its credit is exhausted. If anything shows shrewdness or foresight in the management of a country, it is when its people conserve their energies in good times and in times of peace, so that their credit may be good when adversity arises, and they can protect themselves in that way. The present Ministers ore not doine that. They do not nrooose to do it . In the country they talked about onr extravagance, and there were misleading statements uttered quite honestly by those who were misled by their chiefs and by their newspapers, leaving a false impression in the minds of the electors. The people know better now. I wish to go back to say a word or two to the Treasurer about the in vestments. The right honourable gentleman could have given a little more detailed information about them.",47
341,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Everythin g is in the Budget-papers ,48
342,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"I am not complaining about anything being omitted from the Budget-papers; but the Treasurer was not a whole-hearted supporter of the principle of Australian notes. It is quite true that from time to time he has said that it was his own idea, and it is quite true that he has said that lie would have treated the matter very differently; but I may remind him that the same principle was brought into existence in 1893 in Queensland, and worked well through all the years until the time the Commonwealth took it over. The Queensland law provided for a gold basis of not less than 25 per cent., with a working basis practically up to 33 per cent., and we cannot find a responsible man in Queensland who believed that this basis was not absolutely sufficient as a gold margin. There are some people, of course, who will not go from home for any idea u n t il it suits their own political convictions. I notice that we are promised, in the Governor General's Speech, an amendment of the Australian Notes Act for some particular purpose. I presume it is to restore the old provision entered into when the Act was first passed. If so, I shall not be able to support it , and I hope the majority of honourable members will not support it . It is quite unnecessary. It is proposed to bring the amount held in gold back to 25 per cent, up to £7,000,000 , and pound for pound after that.",48
343,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,As the honourable . member introduced it .,48
344,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"That means that the Treasurer is going to further increase the present money stringency, because that other money is available for investment. The Treasurer also failed to point out that there is a provision in the Australian Notes Act by which the whole of the earnings from the investments are capitalized, and re-invested, and their in terest is re-invested again compoundly, so that within a very short period the reserve will be, as I think, ridiculously high, and a great loss wil l ensue to the people of Australia. The earnings from the Australian Notes Account amount to £210,000 annually. That is nearly a quarter of a million pounds of annual in terest which the Treasurer will get, and still he proposes to keep down every pound above £7,000,000 - an excessive amount. Victoria is a gold State. Somehow its people prefer gold, but the people in the more widely scattered places are far more t r u s t f u l , and have far more confidence i u their own country than have the people in the big communities. Is there a man on the Ministerial side who will say that the credit of the Commonwealth is not ample and sumcient with a not less than 25 per cent, gold backing for the Australian notes? The question has often beeu asked, "" What would you do if there was a rush for a million or two?"" We should simply pay it , and by the time they carted it away they would be glad to cart it back again. I do not believe the people of Australia would ever create any panic against the Commonwealth. They have too much sense, and I believe the Government are doing this niore to save their faces than because of their honest convictions on the question. The other Trust Funds speak for themselves. They are part of'the accumulated surplus of the previous Government, and other useful funds belonging to various trusts that have been established by this Parliament. The accusation of the Treasurer that I , during my term as Treasurer, invested too much of these funds, is unwarranted. If he had been in office, he evidently would not have placed the money at interest, but would have allowed it to remain un-interest bearing. Instead of it earning over £338,000, he apparently would have been quite content to leave it with other institutions earning nothing.",48
345,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,That is only assumption.,48
346,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Why did the honourable member complain? , Sir JOHN FORREST - I said shorterdates.",48
347,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"^-Would the honourable member like any dates shorter than a few months? W it h in fifteen months therewill be £4,245,00 0 available.",48
348,Sir JOHN FORREST,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"What about the £3,000,000 that is tied up for from six thirteen years?",49
349,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"The rest is practically all at short dates. There is £5,720,000 in the Australian Notes Account, and there is £3,448,000 in the other, and of this total of about £9,168,000 the Treasurer - says .we have £3,000,000. It is advisable amount should be invested in good securities, because it is practically the amount necessary to protect the Australian Notes Act.",49
350,Sir JOHN FORREST,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"There is the in the Treasury, is there not?",49
351,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Certainl y we have the gold in the Treasury, and we shall have that amount of money available from the Trust Funds. I think about £2,500,000 to The was invested up to 1926-no t a very long to term. The Treasurer appears to that we should have had all this money short-dated, so that if a Ministry like the present one came into office i able to distribute it all in the first three years.",49
352,Sir JOHN FORREST,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,I thought it would have been wiser.,49
353,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"If the matter had been put that way at first, I should not have raised the question; but it was put very differently. It was suggested that that money was dealt with recklessly. If the Treasurer is proposing to spend allthat money this year, what does he propose to do next year? At the same percentage rate, it will mean during the three years, after mopping up the surplus, probably £15,000,000 of added debt. If this is done, disaster will be absolutely in evitable within a few years. Boom years followed on the advent of the previous Liberal Administration. It was a case of spend everything and borrow everything.",49
354,Mr ATKINSON,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Did the member think that he £.27,000,000 this year?",49
355,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,No .,49
356,Mr ATKINSON,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,That is all vernment propose to expend.,49
357,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"I know; and the only reason they are limited to that amount is monwealth . because they cannot get any more. The show piece of the Budget is the taking over of the State debts. I saw the right State? honourable gentleman beam across the chamber, and did not begrudge him that to little pleasure, while he was announcing this policy.",49
358,Sir JOHN FORREST,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,It is a good one.,49
359,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"It may be a good one; but I would like to know which member out of this House understands it . At page 1789 of Hansard the Treasurer deals with tied up the public debts of Australia in the f o l that that lowing words: The indebtedness of Australia on 30th June, 1913, was ... £3°i>9°3,435 Of this, the indebtedness of the States, on 30th June, 1913, was £294,472,486 gold Floated in London - ... £202,408,239 Floated in Australia ... 92,064,247 £294,472,486 Government propose to introduce a .Bill take over the State debts as they mature, and relieve the States of all liability in respect argue of such debts afterwards. Provision will be made for the Commonwealth to borrow for the States, if requested to do so, but there will be no restriction on the States t would be borrowing for themselves. A sinking fund of £ per cent., vested in trustees, for the redemption of the debts will be provided. The Bill will be a very simple, and simply said 1 not in any way complicated, measure, and should, I think, meet with approval. It is said there that the Treasurer will , out of the 25s. returned to the States, be able to meet the payments on the in debtedness of the States.",49
360,Sir JOHN FORREST,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,That is as they mature.,49
361,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,In what way ?,49
362,Sir JOHN FORREST,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Because they will not mature all at once, and the population will be increasing. I did not make the statement without book. It has all been worked out, and, I believe, is absolutely correct.",49
363,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Does the Treasurer propose to retain the 25s. from the moment the Bill is passed, or from the time he takes over the debts? honourable Sir JOHN FORREST - No . would expend Mr FISHER - He proposes, when lie takes over a maturing debt for a State, to withhold from that State so much of the 25s. per head as will meet the obligathe Gotion on that particular indebtedness.",49
364,Sir JOHN FORREST,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,So much as we pay. There will be no profit to the Com,49
365,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,And the Treasurer's policy is to return the balance to the,49
366,Sir JOHN FORREST,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Yes .,49
367,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"But at the period when the honourable member takes over the whole of the New South Wales debts, for instance, he cannot pay the interest on them and all the other State debts in this way.",50
368,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Ha d not the honourable member better wait u n t i l a proposal is brought down?,50
369,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"I believe the State debts question is not a party matter. It is a matter that concerns Australia, and can only be successfully settled by the co-operation of all parties: There is not the slightest chance of doing it otherwise, and it would be very difficult to do it even that way. That is the reason'- I am asking for information on this point. It is as clear as daylight that there is not nearly sufficient revenue returned to the States at present to meet their interest bill. Sir JOHN FOBBE ST - We will meet debts as they mature.",50
370,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"The amount returned to the States is only about 50 per cent, of what is necessary to meet the total inaugurated in this Parliament. amount of interest on the indebtedness of the States. Therefore, I think that these times. this matter might have been made a little clearer'.",50
371,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"This is not the Bill , bu t only an outline. ' Mr FISHER - The thing is imposacquainted sible. The language is most carefully selected- I do not say it is evasive. Government is going to take over the debts at the date of maturity. will mean that the most distant-dated bond held by a State will be taken over by the Commonwealth, say, 60 years head of the population. hence. I now come to the policy side of the question. In my opinion, the proposal is as weak as it could be. think it will be ineffective. no help to the States, and will probably damage the credit of the Commonwealth. At the present time. I am not going into to levy upon the States. the question of the attempt of the Gosays vernment, by a subterfuge, to"" make the to redeem the obligation. payment of 25s. per capita a permanent suggestion contribution by the Commonwealth to a the States. It is a mere open and avowed declaration of policy, absolutely contrary to the statement of the Attorney-General when this question was before the Parliawealth ment before.",50
372,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,There is no deis claration of policy at all vet..,50
373,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"E i the r it means that, or it means nothing, because the. Treasurer has made a declaration of policy that the 25s. per capita will meet this obligation, and once the debts become a permanent burden on' the Commonwealth it can find the money for ever. Mr W . H . IBVINE - The whole position will be put before the House in a Bill.",50
374,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,The whole position must be put forward in a Bill . Mr W. H . IBVINE - It cannot be otherwise.,50
375,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"It can have no legal effect otherwise, but fifty Bills will not alter a policy. A Government declares its financial policy in its Budget. The policy of the present Government on this question is declared in the Budget speech of the Treasurer. the This proposal is part of the financial policy. The Government cannot have one policy in the Budget, and another policy in the Bill , otherwise a new system of responsible government is being Still , one. never knows what may happen in The Attorney-General cannot get out of his position, which is anomalous compared to that which he took up in 1909, and when he was on the platform in 1910. I am not sufficiently with his statements on the platform in 1913 to say whether he was The of the same opinion then as he was previously, when I heard him speak; and That read his words. But I do say that this declaration of policy means a permanent contribution to the States of the 25s. per Mr W . H . IBVINE - It means nothing I of the kind. It will be Mr FISHER - Not only do 1 say that, but I submit that it is inevitable because the Government is not proposing The Treasurer that the 25s. per head will be ample There is no of levying on the States at all . l l May I point out here to the Treasurer that once the Commonwealth takes over an indebtedness equal to the amount of the contribution made by the Commonto a State, he cannot go back on it ? I am sure that the Attorney-General too practical to deal with a hypothetical case.",50
376,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,The Treasurer admits that he is gambling on the population in crease.,51
377,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"The population in crease does not affect the question, because our burden, having once been created, will continue, and the compound interest on that payment will be equal to the in crease of population at any period if it is a mere matter of finance. There is another point to be considered. One wonders whether the Government, which is so much attached to a State-rights' policy, consulted the States in this matter. There is no evidence that the Government did. I believe that three State Premiers have said that they - heard nothing of the proposal. In my opinion, the better plan would have been to consult the States and all parties in the Commonwealth. I am convinced by the manner in which the proposal has been brought in that it is a placard evidencing a very laudable desire on the part of the Treasurer to deal with the matter again during his term of office. I congratulate him upon the attainment of an ambition, which, I think, has been long and very honourably held, to settle this question. In this Parliament other members have proposed schemes for dealing with the question, and I am bound to say bhat all had their origin in what I consider the most business-like proposition made by Mr Robert Harper, the late member for Mernda. I have always said that from my point of view his was the most sensible scheme. The other schemes were hybrid attempts to deal with the question, founded on his facts and ideas. I believe that this is not the way to deal with the matter. I think it will be ruinous to the Commonwealth, and not good for the States, to leave the States absolutely free to borrow as they think fit. T/his settlement of the question will not establish one borrower, because there will be seven borrowers, each with an obligation of its own. The idea in consolidating the State debts has been to have one borrower with a council composed of men drawn from the States and the Commonwealth, who, even if they could not agree on all principles, would be able to agree tjhat two loans should not be put on the London market together, that there should be no competition where it could be avoided. A council of that sort would have done good work. At the same time, I believe that the better plan would have been for the Commonwealth to pass legis- lation, in conjunction with the States, taking over the whole responsibility of the State indebtedness now, and the whole of the responsibility of borrowing on their behalf. By that means, I venture to say, there would have been established a Commonwealth stock which would have commanded a better credit than any State stocks, and would at the same time have saved money to the community. Mr W . H . IRVINE - That is the object which we all want to attain. The only question is as to the means.",51
378,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"In my opinion, the means now proposed are not good. The consideration of the question has been precipitated in a wrong way. I think it is not doing the States much credit to say that they should be brought into an arrangement without the slightest consultation with them.",51
379,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Nobod y has said that.,51
380,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"The statement has been made by Mr W at t , Mr Barnes, and, I think, Mr Cann. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Non e of them has seen the Bill .",51
381,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Surely the Attorney General does not say that the policy of the Government in this matter has not been declared absolutely by the Treasurer, and much more so than if it were embodied in a Bill? When it has been declared by the Government, the States may feel that they have been entirely ignored again.",51
382,Sir JOHN FORREST,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,They have had a long while to think over it-the e years.,51
383,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"I am not saying that they have not had a long time for reflection, but the right honourable gentleman knows that he has no power to coerce them. He can take over the State debts at any particular moment, but he cannct in any way bind the States as to their future. He can take over on behalf of the Commonwealth, if the Parliament will allow him , the whole of the responsibility for the State debts without consulting the States, but the States can go on in the same old way, and the last stage will .be worse than the first. That is what the right honourable gentleman is proposing, owing to what I call a little personal ambition. It is not like him in many respects. He would have done much better, I think, if he had acted as I have suggested. As my time has nearly expired, I must contrast the boldness of the Government on the State debts question",51
384,Sir JOHN FORREST,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"We will, give you more time.",52
385,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Thing s have been said in this House about myself and others, that I have never heard before in Parsurer liament, and I shall be under tion to any honourable member in this, or other matters, until we.have a settlement elsewhere, and the sooner the better.",52
386,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,What ?,52
387,Mr JENSEN,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"That is pointed, and very determined.",52
388,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"The bold, determined action of the Government in regard to its loan policy, and also its State debts policy, is in violent contrast with its determination with regard to the maternity allowance. On a thousand_platforins, the fist was shaken, and the Attorney-General said he hoped that this Parliament had not adopted the principle permanently. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Hear , hear.",52
389,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"The honourable gentleman hoped that the manhood and the womanhood of Australia were not going to be undermined by legislation of that kind, and yet, in the first declaration of policy which the Government make, the Treasurer says, "" We do not intend to deal with the matter this session,"" When are Ministers going to do so ? They say now, "" We are not going to deal with the matter; we are not sure that we are r i g h t . "" . To show their chagrin and their linger, they have affronted the people who have accepted the maternity allowance. They have expressed regret again and again that so many persons have taken it . What right has any one to express a regret of that kind, and so reflect on those who have taken the allowance? the law, the recipients are entitled to the allowance. It is because the law casts no reflection on any recipient that it makes some persons angry. If tained the sting of pauperism, its opponents would laugh, and hug it to their souls. It is a g if t from the nation to the recipient in recognition of a greater i.;ift which will make the what it ought to be. The Treasurer's proposal regarding invalid and old- . age pensions, in my opinion, will prove to be a mistake. I believe that the payment of the pensions to State and charitable institutions, unless the old-age pensioners are sent there by magistrates, wil l prove mischievous in many instances. wish to heaven that it would be otherwise; but I do think that the payment of the money to the charitable institutions' will not have a beneficial effect. It will benefit them for a short .time. I presume I am correct in thinking that the Treahas in his mind not only State, but no obligaprivate institutions?",52
390,Sir JOHN FORREST,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,No .,52
391,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,I think that the words convey that.,52
392,Sir JOHN FORREST,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Oh , no.",52
393,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,On l y the State institutions ?,52
394,Sir JOHN FORREST,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Certainly ; and benevolent institutions.,52

398,The CHAIRMAN,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Order 1 The honourable member's time has expired.,52
399,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"ParramattaPrime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs) [8.44] - I do not propose to occupy very much time to-night; but I do want to straighten out this .old matter, which has been .in controversy now for some months, and which has been the subject of at least a hundred speeches of my right honourable friend up and down the country, and has necessitated, I should think , ' a hundred replies. The old ghost is here. No matter how one answers the right honourable gentleman, he keeps oh repeating his statement all over Australia, and I am going to try to-night to lay this ghost once and for all . In the first place, it Under is true, as my r i g h t honourable friend says, that we did leave a deficit, three. years ago, to our successors in office. But how was that deficit composed ? Knowing it conthat additional revenue from the States was likely to augment the revenues which we were then receiving, we did overstep the constable a little. But for what purpose ? Here are the items, and honourable nation members may check them for themselves if they care to take the trouble. We placed upon the Estimates that year, for defence alone, £524,000 over and above what had been placed there by our predecessors in the previous year - We put on £388,000 extra for old-age pensions, and an additional £381,000 for the Postal I Department, or a total of £1,293,00 0 extra expenditure in that year. We did all this, aud yet left a deficit of only £450,000.",52
400,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"And the honourable member's Government got a surplus of about £600,000 from us when they came into office on that occasion.",53
401,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"But when the right honourable member talks about this deficit of ours, he always omits to tell the country that his Government increased ib by the end of that year to £1,100,000. Our deficit of £450,000 for a whole year was increased by our successors by £650,000 in six months. That is a fact which the right honourable gentleman never puts before the country. He increased the deficit at the . rabe of £1,300,000 a year.",53
402,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,What the honourable member omits to tell the country is that we concluded the year with a financial surplus.,53
403,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Of course, owing to the arrangement",53
404,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,The honourable member is attempting to mislead.,53
405,The CHAIRMAN,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"The honourable member for Adelaide reminded me of my duty last night, and I know that I have but to recall the fact to him to secure his assistance to-night in maintaining order.",53
406,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Of course, they had a surplus on the year's transactions, for the simple reason that - we had made an arrangement with the States, which gave them that year an extra revenue of £3,000,000. Who would not.have had a surplus in those circumstances? They could not spend the money, try as they might, and, therefore, they had a surplus.  - this extra revenue was coming in, the honourable member's party went for a loan .of £3,500,000.",53
407,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"The honourable member does not know what he is talking about. He is speaking of something - that occurred long before the - time to which I am referring. The complaint - made up and down the country by the Xeader of the Opposition is that, with .£3,000,000 extra revenue coming from 'this one source alone, we did not impose iresli taxation to liquidate a paltry deficit - of £450,000. But is it fair to say that - we left them a deficit at all? I wonder - what honourable member, if an arrangelment had been made to increase his income for the year by £3,000,000, at the same time that he owed £450,000, would think he was in debt at all ? That was exactly the position in this instance, and it would have been criminal on our part to attempt to liquidate the deficit in any other way than by leaving it to be squared by the extra £3,000,000 which was coming immediately from the States. The right honourable gentleman, not satisfied with taking all this money from the States, in order to liquidate the deficit of £1,100,000 at the end of the year, ante-dated by six months the expiration of the operation of the Braddon section, so as to lake from the States money with which to pay these debts.",53
408,Mr MCDONALD,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,That was the honourable member's proposal.,53
409,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Nothin g of the kind.,53
410,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,What ?,53
411,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Nothin g of the kind.,53
412,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Does the Treasurer agree with that statement?,53
413,Sir JOHN FORREST,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,The other arrangement was a different one altogether.,53
414,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"In the last half of that year the honourable member for Wide Bay, as Treasurer, only returned to the States, I think, about 2s. per head of their population. At all events, by ante-dating the expiration of the Braddon section, he took the money from the States to liquidate this precious debt of his.",53
415,Mr MCDONALD,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"r-Following the agree- ' ment made by the Deakin-Cook Government, which the people rejected",53
416,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"It - was rejected only as to one point. I have put the position plainly, and shown how thislittle deficit is to be accounted for. We made an arrangement with the States which gave our successors £14,000,000 extra revenue for the next few years, but because we did not raise extra taxation to liquidate the deficit of £450,000 we have had all this denunciation on the part of the Leader of the Opposition from every platform in the Commonwealth. A Government which leaves a deficit of £450,000 to be paid off, but makes an arrangement for £14,000,000 of extra revenue to go into the Exchequer makes, I think, very good financial provision indeed. But instead of thankfulness for such an arrangement, we have had nothing but denunciation of our ineptitude from the right honourable member who, I repeat, spent all that money, every penny of it , aa it came in , and more to boot. He had over £20,000,000 of extra revenue.",53
417,Mr MCDONALD,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"The honourable member said £14,000,000 just now.",54
418,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Over £20,000,000 of extra revenue was received by the Fisher Government during its three years of office, and for them to taunt us about a paltry deficit of £450,000 is to me the height of impudence and absurdity. They must think that the people of this country are fools if they believe that they will pay attention to such statements when all these facts are patent to them. the deficit.",54
419,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Does he lieve it?,54
420,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,He does not believe it at all.,54
421,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"You called me to order very sharply a little while ago, Mr Chairman, yet I cannot obtain order.",54
422,The CHAIRMAN,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,It is impossible for me to prevent interjections,54
423,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,The insulting member for Adelaide insults me every time that I rise.,54
424,The CHAIRMAN,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Order ! It is i m possible for me to prevent interjections. 1 can only remind the Committee of my powers, which I am loth to carry to an extreme. I have endeavoured to do my duty as fairl y as I can, and I hope that both sides will assist me and make my task a little lighter than it has been up to the present.",54
425,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"I call attention to the statement by the honourable member for Adelaide that I do not believe what I am saying. It is most in sulting, and I require it to be withdrawn.",54
426,The CHAIRMAN,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"The remark was not in order, and I ask the honourable member to withdraw it .",54
427,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"I am perfectly agreeable to abide by y"".our decision, Mr . Chairman; but I should like to explain that my remark was not addressed to the Prime Minister. A remark was made on this side about some one believing what he said, and I replied, "" He does not believe it . "" The observation had no reference to the Prime Minister; but I suppose that it is with him the case of a guilty conscience.",54
428,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"I shall let the remark pass. It adds another to the number of insults I have received, 1 come how to another matter which I desire to c2ear up. The Leader of the Opposition has accused me all over the country of making infamous misstatements concerning the spending of public money by his Government. This is what I said up and down the country, and all that I said. I quoted from the Estimates for the year ending 30th June, 1913, over the signature of "" And r e w Fisher, Treasurer,"" signed at the Commonwealth Treasury on the 31st July, 1912: Those Estimates show that the right honourable gentleman estimated to spend that year So much for £22,683,000, and that he estimated to receive during that year £20,422,000. In be- other words, he anticipated a deficit on the year's transactions of £2,261,000, which amount was to be carried forward from Trust Funds, and spent in that year in .order to square the ledger.",54
429,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,It was not a deficit at all.,54
430,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"That is the statement. I have made. I accused the right honourable gentleman of spending every penny of this money, and I repeat that the estimate here is for every farthing of it to be spent.",54
431,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,And the honourable member said that I spent every farthing on which I could lay my hands.,54
432,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,I have given the statement that I made.,54
433,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"The honourable member ""admitted the correctness of what I read just now.",54
434,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,At the time that was perfectly correct.,54
435,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,It was a fortnight after the Maryborough speech. Mr JOSE PH COOK - No such thing.,54
436,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,I shall get the date from the Daily Telegraph.,54
437,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Her e are these Estimates, in which, over the right honourable member's own signature, we have the statement that he estimated that, at the end of the year in question, every penny, including the whole £20,000,000 of additional revenue which he had received over and above that received by his predecessors, would be spent. There was not to be a farthing, let alone a penny, left in the Treasury.",54
438,Mr CHARLTON,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,What about his subwould sequent statement ?,55
439,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Her e is the statement to which I have been all along; and I am not going to be drawn off this point to deal with any subman sequent statement.,55
440,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Neve r mind any subsehonorable quent statement. This statement by Prime Minister can be easily answered when his trickiness is.over.,55
441,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"There is no trick about this; it is a simple from the present Leader of the Opposition's own Estimates. He estimated, just as we estimate this year, to spend every penny.",55
442,Mr MCDONALD,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,And the honourable member knows that the right honourable member for Wide Bay subsequently good amended that statement.,55
443,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,And subsequently I said so.,55
444,Mr MICDONALD,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,The honourable member did not.,55
445,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,I say that I did ; and my statement was reported in twenty newspapers.,55
446,Mr BURCHELL,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,What does the (honorI able gentleman say to-night?,55
447,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"I intend to say something more to-night about the famous financing of honourable members opposite. We have heard a good deal about loan moneys, and the enormous commitments we are proposing this year. It is perhow fectly true, but honourable members oppoalready site have lef t us such a legacy that whatever Government succeeded them was bound to honestly meet the obligations they left That is all that this Government have done. Moreover, the present Government amounted cannot begin seriously to interfere with the financial policy u n t i l they get proper statutory power to enable them to do so. We are here with our hands behind our backs. Everybody that.",55
448,Mr JENSEN,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"That is a strange acunderstood. knowledgement. Mr JOSE PH COOK - Everybod y but knows it . We have been made aware it for some months past now, and honourable members opposite tell us to our faces that they will not give us the sary statutory power to do this or thing else.",55
449,Mr MCDONALD,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"No decent Governtal, ment, with any sense of self-respect, remain in office under such conditions.",55
450,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,We take that referring rather as a compliment.,55
451,Mr MCDONALD,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,The honourable gentlecan take it as he likes. It is true.,55
452,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Was the right member for Wide Bay playing a the trick, then, when he advised that we should be put here ? Did he put us here with the thought at the back of hismind that no decent Government should be here under quotation these circumstances ?",55
453,Mr MCDONALD,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"No respectable men, with any sense of decency, would remain there under the circumstances.",55
454,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"I am sure that the honourable member for Kennedy is a judge of respectability and of decency, too.",55
455,Mr MCDONALD,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,I am talking politically.,55
456,The CHAIRMAN,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Order ! I call the honourable member for Kennedy to order.,55
457,Mr MCDONALD,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,I am very sorry. I apologize.,55
458,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"I am sorry that have to get these facts out, but really, t»hey must be got out. I turn again to the Estimates of the last Government, and I intend to show exactly what they proposed to do last year. We hear alt this wild talk to-night about our proposing to spend £5,000,000 or £6,000,000 more than we have revenue to meet;.but did the case stand last year ? I have quoted the figures for the ordinary revenue and expenditure. The revenue was to be £20,422,000. and I have . shown that the ordinary expenditure commitments amounted to £22,683,000. They to, to be. more exact, £2,268,354 over and above the revenue the received. In addition to that, the late Government incurred liabilities last year, tied including the £850,000 for the dock knows and other loan moneys, to the extent of £2,200,000. Let that be distinctly We have had all this gibing about loan moneys to-night, last year the late Government of spent loan moneys for the purchase of land for a post-office at Perth. Last year they spent loan moneys for the purchase of sites in London for the High necesCommissioner's office and the Commonanywealth Building. They also scent loan monev to buy land for the Federa] Capiand also to buy machinery, some of it old and obsolete, in the dock in Sydney, which will have to be replaced at the earliest possible moment.",55
459,Mr EISHEK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,That is not correct.,56
460,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,What is not correct ?,56
461,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"We took the whole thing over as transferred property. Mr JOSE PH COOK - Does the right honourable member say that that is not a debt ? If it is not, what is it ? I should correct myself, because we have not taken it over yet. That is one of the things we have to do. The obligation is there. But, as a matter of fact, we have not yet settled the terms on which that property is to be taken over.",56
462,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,The honourable gentleman need not fear. The States Governments will relieve him of it .,56
463,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"The Attorney General is considering the terms now. May I remind the right honourable member bhat out of the £850,00 0 less than £150,000 represents land, and the balance represents equipment and some of which, as we have seen, is old or obsolete, and must be replaced almost i m mediately. This is a loan obligation which the late Government incurred, and it does not lie in their mouths therefore to taunt anybody with proposing to borrow money.",56
464,Mr CHARLTON,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Does the gentlemau claim that the late Government paid more than its value for the property referred to?,56
465,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,That is quite irrelevant to the matter with which I am dealing.,56
466,Mr CHARLTON,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,The honourable gentleman has said that the machinery is obsolete.,56
467,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"I am not here to say whether too much or too little has been paid for it . While we are on this matter, I may as well indicate another point with respect bo Garde u Island. another property, which is to come over for the purposes of our Navy. also Admiralty House. We found when we took office that arrangements had been made for a valuation of these properties, which were to cost, I think, about £650,000. This was to be another of the transferred properties, and I should like to tell my honourable friends opposite that I am contesting the whole claim, and I think that when all is over, it will be found thab we have succeeded. I venture to say that if the late Government had remained in power that £650,000 of property, would have been taken over. So much for their great financing, and their great ability in dealing with financial matters. There is the fact that these obligations represent perishable things. There is only a little land included in the total, and the rest is for machinery and equipment of various kinds.",56
468,Mr CHARLTON,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Who is making the claim for Garden Island?,56
469,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"The Government of New South Wales; and for the Admiralty House, too.",56
470,Mr CHARLTON,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"They cannot compel us to deal with them, can they?",56
471,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,The late Government never contested the claim.,56
472,Mr BRUCE SMITH,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Because they were not going to pay. They were going to owe.,56
473,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Exactly ; that is the word- "" owe."" They arranged to machinery, pay interest, and then they said, "" There is no loan because this is transferred property."" The interest is provided for on the Estimates, and I should like to remind honourable members that the Estimates show that we have already a Commonwealth debt of over £7,000,000 , and that £2,850,00 0 of our present indebtedhonorable ness was incurred by our predecessors. Then they gibe at other people for borrowing, and for presuming to float a loan for any purpose. I say that our loans are ' for the same purposes as theirs. Our loans are to be for the purchase of land, which is always a good asset, and of equipment of various kinds, just as their loans were floated. Everything is right when they are in office; but the same things suddenly become wrong when they are out of office. The same transactions based on the same principles, and involving, in some cases, the same amounts, are right That is when they do them, and wrong when they are done by the party on this side. The There is total commitments of the late Government for their last year amounted to £24,815,000, notwithstanding the fact that they anticipated they would receive a revenue of only £20,422,000. Last year they proposed to spend over £4,500,00 0 more than they had revenue coming in to meet. Does it lie in their mouths, therefore, to taunt us for doing the same thing this year?",56
474,Mr WEBSTER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Yes , of course, it does, because the honourable gentleman said that he would not do it . Mr. JOSEPH COOK! - There is another point to be considered.",57
475,Mr HIGGS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,The honourable gentleman will not consider the last point. Mr JOSE PH COOK - There is nothing in it . M i . WEBSTER - Layin g underground wires with borrowed money is what the honourable gentleman is doing.,57
476,The CHAIRMAN,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Order ! I call honourable member for Gwydir to order.,57
477,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"For us to lay underground wires in new conduits, and pay for the work out of loans is wrong; whilst for them to pay for old boilers out of loans is right. There is the distinction my honourable friends make.",57
478,Mr WEBSTER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,We know the honourable gentleman is good at laying underground wires.,57
479,The CHAIRMAN,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Order ! I ask so. the honourable member for Gwydir not to interject, and he takes no notice. I do not wish to have to proceed to extremes.",57
480,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"As I said last night, the increase of expenditure must always be a relative matter'. An y country that is progressive must increase its expenditure from time to time to meet growing services. That goes without saying.",57
481,Mr JENSEN,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,The honourable gentleman never said that on the platform six mouths ago.,57
482,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"I said it before, and I say it now. I say that these growing and inescapable obligations make it imperative that business methods shall be applied to our national expenditures. I say, further, that we cannot apply business .methods to them, because we lack the statutory power to do so. I say here quite frankly to the country that, notwithstanding what my friends opposite may say, in my opinion, there is extravagance going on in the Public Departments today. I should like the statutory power to enable me to set loose upon some of the Departments those who could s if t the matter, and find out what and where this extravagance is.  man go right ahead.",57
483,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,I know what is meant by the honourable gentleman's idea of going right ahead. The fact remains that we have no Committee of any kind to investigate these matters. We have no Committee of Public Accounts. ,57
484,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"The honourable gentleman assisted us handsomely by securing a count-out when we tried to have appointed a little Supply and Tender Board. "" Go right ahead,"" says the honourable member, "" and we will put a sprag in the wheel when you do."" The present Government have been in office for three months, and they have not been the able to undertake the inquiry necessary into the methods of Government expenditure which, I admit, is today very high, and, in my opinion, will probably turn out to be extravagantly high.",57
485,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,The Government have been in office nearly four months.,57
486,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Yes , they have been in office nearly four months.",57
487,Mr WEBSTER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,They have not cut down any wages yet; but they will do,57
488,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"There is a specimen of the idle talk that goes on. That is the kind of clap-trap which honourable members opposite talk from every platform in the country, and the moment one meets these statements with a little dose of hard facts, our friends become positive marionettes all round the chamber. I have stated facts which my honourable friends cannot get over. They are taken from official documents. Here is the fact that last year the Government estimated that they would spend £ 4 , 3 9 8 0 0 0 more than they had revenue coming in to meet, and yet they now hold their skirts in horror when we propose to follow in the same wake this year. We follow in the same wake because we are helpless to do anything else. That is a perfectly frank confession. The late Government have left obligations and commitments, and any Government, having even the statutory power, which we have not, must honour those obligations and commitments.",57
489,Mr JENSEN,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,The honourable gentleman is making his followers blush.,57
490,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"A m I ? I shall say no more. I do not want to go into an elaborate defence of the Budget. I got up only to lay these ghosts once and for ever in the only way in which they can be laid effectively. I hope that we shall hear no more about it . The right honourable gentleman himself said 58 Budget. [REPRESENTATIVES.] that at the end of the year he would not have a penny out of the twenty odd million pounds extra that he had received. That is his statement with his own signature underneath it , and that is the statement which I quoted all over Australia.'",57
491,Mr WEBSTER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Did he have a penny at the end of the year?,58
492,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Of course, he did, but it was owing to his splendid financing in being at sea in all his estimates. He did not spend by £1,000,000 the amount which he estimated he would spend, and kindly skies, and a prolific and fertile country, gave him £1,300,000 or £1,400,000 more revenue than he estimated he would receive. No thanks to him surely. Of course, I remember that honourable members opposite are in league with Providence. They have said so.",58
493,Mr TUDOR,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Who said so?,58
494,Mr WEBSTER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Has the Prime Minister had a word with Providence on that point ?,58
495,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"It does not look like it , because the revenue is already beginning to slump.",58
496,Mr TUDOR,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"So it ought to when the Government give up a sum of £158,000.",58
497,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"We have notcollected that £158,000 yet, and the honourable member will be delighted if we cannot get a penny of it .",58
498,Mr TUDOR,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Do not think that for a moment.,58
499,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"The honourable member is frightened to death that we are going to collect it , but we shall collect it if his confreres in another place do not prevent us from doing so.",58
500,Mr THOMAS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,They will not stop the Prime Minister.,58
501,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Then we shall get the money, and all this talk will be shown to be so much flapdoodle, so that the honourable member for Yarra will not have a feather to fly with. He wil l not have anything more to say when we have collected that money.",58
502,Mr WEBSTER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,He is disgusted that the Government missed it when they had a chance to collect it .,58
503,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Because we were foolish enough to honour the agreement which was made by the honourable membei's own leader. We stood up to that agreement honestly. Budget.,58
504,The CHAIRMAN,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Order ! I cannot allow the honourable member for Gwydir to constantly interrupt in that way. It is most improper.,58
505,Mr WEBSTER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,The Prime Minister looks directly at me.,58
506,The CHAIRMAN,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,And I cannot allow the honourable member to reply to me.,58
507,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"I sincerely hope that before the year has run out we may get the same luck that the Leader of the Opposition had in regard to the revenue of the country. It may happen that we shall not be able to spend the whole of the money which we anticipate spending upon these Estimates. In connection with a sum of £15,000,000 cr £16,000,000, it is hardly possible to spend the whole of it within the year. No matter how perfect our machinery may be, it is almost impossible that there should not be a surplus unexpended at the end of the year, If only the revenue is as kind to us as it was to my right honourable friend, we, too, shall have a surplus of £2,250,000 at the end of the financial year, But that is nothing for anybody to take credit for. We make our Estimates, and we shall endeavour to spend the money which is set out in them. The right honourable member for Wide Bay made his Estimates. He estimated that at the end of the year he would not have a penny. I w a n t to repeat that statement. He estimated that at the end of the year he would not have a farthing - not one-eighth or one-sixteenth of a farthing - notwithstanding that he had received over £20,000,000 more than his predecessors in office. Therefore, I was justified in taking - that page of the Estimates over his signature, and telling the people of this country that these rolling millions had all been spent, and that he would have spent more if he had had it . That is a perfectly true statement to make, and it should not have caused all this pother in the mind of the right honourable gentleman. It was a simple statement of hard fact- a mere quotation from his own Estimates. I shall not pursue this matter further. I should like to get on with the consideration of the Works Estimates. They are urgent. Three months of the year have already gone, and it has always been customary to deal with the Works Estimates, and to leave the Budget debate for a subsequent occasion.",58
508,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Does the Prime Minisber expect his remarks to go without a reply ?,59
509,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"I do not care whebher they go without a reply or not. I am merely suggesting what has been done on previous occasions. is thab we may speedily geb to the consideration of the Works Esbimabes. had nob iubended to speak at all this evening but for the attack of the right honourable member for Wide Bay. He is constantly impugning my veracity, and I thought it well tp lay bhis ghost by quoting his own statements. Really there is a l i m it to human endurance in these matters. I sband by all 1 said",59
510,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Unfortunately, honourable gentleman wil l nob sband by what lie is reported to have said.",59
511,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Does the honourable member stsnd by all that he is reported to have said ?,59
512,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"I never complain of the newspapers misreporting me. matter of fact, they do not insert statements of mine.",59
513,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Do they not? They inserted a lo t of statements by the honor ible member in connection with the last elections-statement s which he wrote, too.",59
514,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,The Prime Minister had to apologize for misstatements which he made. Mr JOSE PH COOK - I am quite unaware of it .,59
515,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,I have got the honourable gentleman's letter.,59
516,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,And the honourable member wrote a misstatement deliberately. I made no statement at Port Pirie which was not in accordance with facts.,59
517,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"The honourable gentlepersonal man deliberately misrepresented me, then endaavoured to escape.",59
518,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"I indulged in no misrepresentation - My statements on record, and the facts are there. honourable member deliberately misrepreI sented the whole of the facts over his own signature.",59
519,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,The Prime Minister's statement is wilfull y and maliciously in correct.,59
520,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"I thank the Estimates. honourable member. That is the usual thing for him to say. His interjection the best of all proof that I made at r u t hcountry. f u l statement. However, the facts are on record. I have only been anxious to clear up these matters. I admit that the Estimates are high. I should like to see them lower; and I believe that a searching investigation into the Deparbmenbs, All I ask with the requisite backing of statutory power, would reveal bhat they could be I lowered without decreasing by one scintilla the efficiency Of the machinery of government. But until we get the power to make that inquiry, and set committees to work, and until we inaugurate a different method of carrying out our public works generally, the expenditure must continue to be high.",59
521,Mr EISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"I desire to make a perthe sonal explanation. I take it that the Prime Minister wishes to deal with facts. On the 31st March, 1913, I delivered my policy speech at Maryborough, which is full y reporbed in the newspapers, and in which I used these wordsIt is now almost certain that the revenue of the year will suffice for the expenditure, and As a that the surplus of £2,261,541 will remain intact on June 30 next. Now, the Prime Minister is reported in the Sydney Daily Telegraph to have addressed a public meeting on 28bh A p r i l last- a month afber I had delivered my policy speech. In his opening remarks he is reported to have said thab there was "" a nip in the political abmosphere on this occasion."" The report proceedsMr Cook went on to refer to the rolling seasons and the Government expenditure. "" They have,"" he said, "" spent every penny of revenue as it came in, and every penny more that they could lav hands on, and you have £ 8 to £10 per family more taxes than were paid three years ago, not through an increase of rates, but an increase in yields."" There is my authority for the statement which I made to-night. He repeated his allegation at Ballarat three months later.",59
522,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,I desire to make a explanation. The speech which and the right honourable member for Wide Bay has just quoted relates to these Estimates.,59
523,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"A f t e r the honourable are gentleman had had my statement. The Mr. JOSEPH COOK - To be quite candid, do not recollect having read the honorof the case able member's statement.",59
524,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Hear , hear.",59

526,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,My statements all througli have been based upon these,59
527,Mr ARCHIBALD,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,The Prime Minister is made that statement to deceive the,59
528,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,He never read my policy speech.,60
529,Mr CHARLTON,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,The Prime Minister made a statement at the end of last session. Everybody knows that.,60
530,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"I know what statement was made, and what statement was not made. The trouble is that the right honourable member for Wide Bay did not quote all I said. He only quoted one sentence.' He can quote many speeches in which I said that his Estimates were modified through no financial ability on his part, but owing to an increase in the revenue, and a decrease in the expenditure. He takes care not to quote that statement.",60
531,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,I will quote every statement thab the honourable gentleman cares to show me.,60
532,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,It is too ridiculous.,60
533,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Adelaide) [9.29] - I wish, before dealing with the general question, to make a personal explanation. The Prime Minister has charged me with having made a misstatement over my own signature, and some warm exchanges passed between us when he did so. He refers to a remark which he is reported to have made at Port Pirie, in South Australia-m y old home.",60
534,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,I am going to bowl this out if I can get the newspaper.,60
535,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"-The honourable gentleman is reported bo have said that, in spite of my warm approval of the referenda proposals at the last election, I had opposed them at the Hobart Labour Conference in January of last year. That statement was reported in two newspapers whioh support the Prime Minister in matters political. When I read it I wrote to him, and suggested that, in the circumstances, there must be a mistake, and I asked him to kindly write me anenb the matter. I received a letter from him to the effect that he had been misrepofled.",60
536,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"There is just one word wrong, that is all.",60
537,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"But what he was reis ferring to when he said I opposed the ferendums was my statement in respect the referendum and the initiative, another proposal entirely.",60
538,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"In the Hobart Conference, which I quoted.",60
539,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"What the honourable gentleman then put in as being his statement, was entirely different, of course, from what was reported as said by him. He left, eveii in his letter to me, a wrong impression. There was no proposal before the Hobart Conference that the initiative and referendum should be either inserted or baken out of the plabform, and consequently the principle of the initiative and referendum was not at issue there. What was before the Hobart Conference was a motion affirming that the initiative and referendum should be taken oub of the general platform, ,and placed in the figlibing platform.",60

542,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Now the honourable member has answered himself.,60
543,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"That was all that happened; yet the honourable gentleman has the audacity to assert that I wrote a misstatement, putting it over my signature.",60

545,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,The Prime Minisber has my letter.,60
546,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,I am going to quote it.,60
547,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"The honourable gentleman can quote it whenever he likes'to do so. I take this opportunity to offer a few words in reply to remarks to which the Prime Minister has favoured us during the past three quarters of an hour. It : is not the first time that we have had similar utterances from him, nor the first time that he has done his best to cloud the financial issue, and to gain party kudos by statements of a doubtful character. It not the first time that he has denied rereports that have appeared in his own to party newspapers, and when confronted with them here has attempted to give them an entirely different complexion.",60
548,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"It is not a matter of denying reports, but of denying the twists that honourable members give to them.",60
549,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"On this occasion the Prime Minister rests the strength of his argument on what he alleges to have been the estimates, or the intentions, of the Fisher Administration at the commencethere ment of the financial year 1912-13. Throughout the course of his remarks said that he had stated on twenty different platforms that at the start of that year the Fisher Administration had estimated to receive over £21,000,000, and to pend about £4,000,000 more than that to sum. Of course, we. have to accept honourable member's denials in this House, but, unfortunately for him, the statement that was published in al l his party papers was, not that the Fisher Adminishonorable tration had estimated to do that, but that they had done that- a very different posithat tion of affairs. He says now that his assertion was that the Fisher Administrathat tion intended to do certain things; that they were going to receive £21,000,000, and to expend about £4,000,000 more. But the newspapers-no t Labour newsmute. papers, bu t newspapers in which remarks appear carefully sub-edited, that they may be placed before the public in the most favourable light for him , and be as unfavorable as possible to the Labour party - made him say that One tliQ Fisher Administration had done certain things, namely, that had spent every penny of revenue and every penny that they could lay their hands on. Naturally, that statement caused indignation on the part of the late Treasurer, who knew it to be inaccurate. The Primo Minister, confronted by memstatements bers who know as much about the subject as he does, though perhaps not so well acquainted with certain methods, has had to shift his ground, and to say he was dealing with estimates,' not with with actualities. The Fisher AdministraThere tion did not spend every penny they could lay their hands on. Not only was statement to which objection has been honesty? taken made by the Prime Minister, but was repeated by his supporters. Not belast .ing so well acquainted with the facts he was, they took it for granted that lie said was correct, and repeated his statements throughout the Commonresolution wealth. The statement was incorrect, of and ought not to have been made. There is not a scintilla of justification for",60
550,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,It is absolutely correct. Here is the proof of it .,61
551,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"The Prime Minister has no proof of it . Could one imagine greater audacity? The honourable gentleman asserts that in the document which he has waved, the Estimates for 1912-13, is something to prove or justify a statement to the effect that the Fisher he Administration, during that year, spent every penny that they could lay their hands upon! Let us for a moment forget party politics and the gaining of exkudos. I ask the honourable member now say i u all sincerity whether there is in the that document a word, a figure, a line, or a letter to support his incorrect statement? We have an illustration at the newspresent moment of the treatment to which members on this side are ""subjected. It cannot be repeated too often there is no justification in the document that he waved for the statement he made. When challenged here in this chamber to say "" Yes,"" or "" No , "" as to the correctness of' the newspaper reports, the honourable gentleman remains If he said anything, he would exhis pose himself as having attempted, by so methods that, fortunately, few people adopt, to do in j u r y to those whose only offence-if it can be called an offence-is to differ from him on political matters. other subject. It is alleged that we have taunted the other side with indulgthey ing in loan expenditure. That statement was replied to yesterday, but it has to be replied to again today. While we may jiut our reply into the official record of the debates, that record is read only by comparatively few persons, whereas the of the Prime Minister aud his supporters are published in the newspapers, aud go forth to be read by scores of thousands of persons, honourable memthat bers on this side not being credited what they say in reply. has been no taunting in respect to indulging in loan expenditure. How could the there be with any show of reason or The whole of the public of it the Commonwealth know full well that year the Fisher Administration spent as loan moneys. They spent money which what they borrowed from Trust Funds. Yesterday, when speaking on the preliminary dealing with the' introduction the Loan Bill , I pointed out as clearly as I was able-and the Prime Minister it . understood every word of it-that no exception would be taken to borrowing if that borrowing were confined to the same methods as were adopted last year; that is, if the borrowing were confined to the Australian Notes Fund and to Trust Funds, but that exception would be taken if the borrowing were done on'the open market, because if that policy were to be instituted, it would be for the first time in the history of the Commonwealth. Exception was taken to borrowing for particular purposes, but not necessarily to borrowing money in general. As indicated in the Budget speech, the present Administration intend money to construct certain and telephonic works, and in so doing they are starting an entirely new policy; for during the past twelve years that class of work has been done out of revenue, and thus has been free from the necessity of paying interest. That was the policy carried on by the past and, had they been privileged to remain on. the Treasury bench, it was their intention to continue it; but the present Ministers have adopted an entirely new proposition. It is to that new form of expending borrowed money that is taken, and not, as was asserted by the Prime Minister a few minutes ago, to the Government generally for borrowing. depends on what they intend to borrow the money for. Certainly we did take exception three years ago to their to borrow for the purpose of building a Fleet, and, fortunately, the people of the Commonwealth took exception to it, and that particular attempt to borrow was checked. Again, when the present Treasurer was in the Barton-Turner his Government unsuccessfully to start the principle of borrowing on the open market. The Labour party were unanimous in their opposition policy. The present proposal marks the third occasion on which Fusionists, or Liberals, have attempted to indulge in borrowing, and, presumably, on this occasion, on the outside market, because we have the indication from the Treasurer that, if the Trust Funds are not sufficient, he may go elsewhere to get the money. On the two previous occasions they were checked, first by Parliament, quently by the people; and if , on this occasion, Parliament is not strong to check them, I sincerely hope it will not be long, despite the, gibes of their party' newspapers, before we go to the country again, and get another from the people as to whether these works are to be constructed out of loan moneys - whether we are to become a seventh borrower from Australia on the open Mr Roberts. money market--and , in particular, whether we are to take over the State debts in the manner suggested by the Treasurer, which, after all, amounts in a large degree to a gamble. We are to allow the money States to continue borrowing without limit , and we are to accept the whole of the responsibility for the debts incurred up to the present. However, I fear me it to borrow is merely a kite. telegraphic Sir JOHN FORREST - No ; I am in deadly earnest.",61
552,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"In the circumstances I do not propose to deal at length with that point I wish to return to the opening remarks of the Prime Minister. First of all , he admitted that there Administration, was a deficit when his Government left office a little over three years ago, and that there was a surplus when the Fisher Administration left office three and a half months ago, and then he sought to belittle the Fisher Administraexception tion by references of a general character. Let me put some bare facts before honourable members. When the first Fisher A d It ministration were rejected by the Fusion party, they lef t a surplus of over £600,000. The Fusion Government were attempt in office about eleven months, and they left a deficit of £450,000.",62
553,Sir JOHN FORREST,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Yes , that is right, for old-age pensions.",62
554,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"They were in office Ministry, eleven months, ' and during that period attempted they spent over £100,000 per month more than they received, and the fact that they left with a deficit of £450,000 is minito that mized by alleging, first, that they made an arrangement with the States, so that £14,000,000 should come into the Commonwealth revenue during the succeeding three years, and secondly, that it was essential to have a deficit in order to provide for old-age pensions-on e of the most specious statements that could possibly be made. Knowing the popularity of the old-age pensions, to providing the and subse- money for which at first a large number of the Fusionists were in bitter opposisufficiently tion",62
555,Sir JOHN FORREST,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,You will say anything.,62
556,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"The division is on remandate cord where honourable members voted against the Surplus Revenue Bill which was to provide the money for old-age pensions. However, I shall not go too far back; I shall confine my remarks to the speech of the Prime Minister. Knowing the popularity of old-age pensions, the Fusionists assert that they created a deficit to provide for the payment of the pensions, and they claim that we are to be satisfied because they made a provision with tihe States that would bring in £3,000,000 of revenue to the Commonwealth in the succeeding year. Was that provision made with the States to bring in £3,000.000 for 1910-11 because the money was not wanted ? Was ' it made merely for the f u n of the thing, so that there should be that amount of surplus in the Commonwealth revenue? Or was it made because the Ministers of the day knew that the money would be required ? Necessarily, they knew it would be required. The then Fusion Ministry had, in conjunction with the State Governments, in a secret Caucus-no t one word of the proceedings of which has ever been allowed to transpire to the publi<5-com e to a particular arrangement by which the Braddon section should be practically annulled, and that in future, instead of paying back to the States three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue, the Commonwealth should pay back to them only 25s. per head of the population - That meant, of course, that the Commonwealth revenue would be largely increased; and, believing, as they did then, that they would remain in office, they had some object in increasing the revenue becaase they intended to expend it. Fortunately, the people ejected them from office, and the Labour Administration came in . All they did was to meet the expenditure then necessary to provide for the ordinary obligations of the Commonwealth out of the revenue that they were then receiving. Where is the reason for objection, for cavilling, for complaining? Where is the reason for the talk indulged in about our colossal expenditure? Those gentlemen made provision, so they say, with the money coming in , for the obligations of the monwealth to be met in an honourable and proper way, and the money was expended by the Labour Government in such a way that, in this House, at any rate, not one fault could be found. During the whole of the three years, there is on record scarcely a division of any description called for by the party opposite against any item of expenditure. They approved of the expenditure in each year. approved, practically, of every penny that was expended; and yet, during every election, and subsequently, the Prime Minister, and others of his side, have been going up and down the country asserting that a colossal expenditure was indulged in , and insinuating that there was something radically wrong with the finances.",62
557,Mr RODGERS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Did you ever make, on the platform, such a nice, lucid statement as you have now made in the House, to show how the Liberal party had made provision in advance for your Government getting those extra millions to expend?",63
558,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Yes ; I did my very best to make it clear to them and what it meant, and to show them that we should have more money to spend in the Commonwealth. The result was shown at the elections, because the people, knowing that there would be so many millions more to spend, put the right party in to spend them. This shows that the people thoroughly understood the question. We took serious exception to the secrecy of the Caucus; and, while we had no objection to the 25s. per head being paid back to the States, we seriously objected to putting that in the Constitution, and the people took the same view. I see no reason for the Prime Minister's loud denunciations of our expenditure, when he now admits that he made the arrangement by which the money was obtained. He made it because it was essential that the money should be expended. It was not expended in any direction of which he could complain, for , during the three years, there is not on record one serious objection to our expenditure. The diatribes indulged in at the elections, and the in sinuations about something of a character which could not be very well explained, but which would necessitate very grave caution on the part of the people, were unjustified. They ought never to have Com- been made, and would not have been made had party politics in a certain direction been more clean, clear, and upright. The Prime Minister tried to deal with what we proposed to do in a particular year, and actually asserted that, at the end of the year, there was a deficit of £1,100,000. Note the curious cunning of that statement, which leaves in the minds of the public an altogether erroneous impresThey sion. The honourable member did not explain that he meant merely the end of the calendar year and not the end of the financial year. He showed that there was a deficit in the finances of the Fisher Adstatement ministration during its first year of office, not by taking one complete year, but cutting a year in two. That is a mere policy of paltry juggling with figures.",63
559,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"You evidently did not understand the explanation, or you would not talk in that way.",64
560,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Does the honourable member assert that there was a deficit in the finances in the first year of the Fisher Administration ?,64
561,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"I said that a deficit of £450,000 had increased to £1,100,000 by the end of the same year",64
562,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,B y the end of the caleudar year?,64
563,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Yes . I showed that in six months your Government had increased the deficit by £650,000.",64
564,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"It was unfair to say that by the end of the year the deficit had increased by £650,000. One would think that the end of the financial year was meant.",64
565,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,I did not say so.,64
566,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"The honourable member did not dare say it ; but the impression left on the minds of the people will be that there was a deficit of £1,100,000 at the end of the financial year. The honourable member is not justified in cutting the financial year in half in order to juggle with the finances of the Commonwealth.",64
567,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"I used the words "" six months.""",64
568,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,No Administration should be criticised in such a way; the whole financial year should be taken.,64
569,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"I rise to order. I submit that the honourable member must accept my statement, and not repeat a statement which I never made. I have denied it several times, and a well-known rule of the House is that an honourable member accepts another honourable member's correction when he makes it .",64
570,The CHAIRMAN,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"If the Prime Minister has called the attention of the honourable member for Adelaide to an incorrect statement, I am sure the honourable member will accept the - Prime Minister's explanation.",64
571,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"That is another clever, cute interruption. I have not refused to accept the honourable member's statement. I am at a loss to understand the mental conditiou of the Prime Minister. I am glad I have drawn from him .the fuller that he referred to the calendar year. I understood him to refer to that. by And because I object to a reference ""of that description, which is neither fair nor warranted",64
572,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Why do you not quote what I said? It is perfectly plain.,64
573,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"The honourable gentleman said that at the end of the year there was a deficit of £1,100,000. That is chopping our financial year in two for the purpose of creating an impression which ought not to be created. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - I say that I said no such thing.",64
574,Mr RILEY,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Do you give it up now? - Mr ROBERTS - No , because we have this sort, of thing regularly.",64
575,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"We do get it regularly from the honourable member, who never does state a case properly.",64
576,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Le t me try again. At the end of the year the honourable gentleman said there was a deficit of £1,100,000, or an increase of £650,000 over what we inherited. '",64
577,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"That was in the first six months, and in the succeeding six months you liquidated it by withdrawing the money from the States.",64
578,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"If the honourable gentleman prefers the statement "" in six months "" instead of "" at the end of the year,"" we will accept it as such, and I say again to the honourable gentleman, what he himself knows, that it is an entirely unfair method of debate and of assertion. In the case of many businesses there are times, say, in the middle of a month, or a quarter, when there is an overdraft. But when the balance-sheet is made out the situation is entirely different, and the man at the head of a business or a corporation, just as in the case of a country, must finance accordingly, knowing precisely what the situation will be. Does the honourable gentleman mean to say that it would be fair for me to take an ordinary business firm which today may have an overdraft, because that is the course of regular business, and say that the firm is insolvent ? Practically that is what the statement of the Treasurer amounted to-that there was something wrong - What we pointed out was that at the end of the year when i.he Fusion party went out of office - practically within - two months of the end of the financial year - they lef t a deficit of £450,000, and it was being increased every month. The Prime Minister desires to cut a year in half in order to create an impression which ought not to be created. At the end of year that the Fisher Administration was in ' office there was-a surplus; some millions more had been expended, in that year than in the previous year, and the extra millions came in because of an arrangement with the States. During the last elections, what were the statements marie broadcast? That we had these extra millions of money by depriving the States of them. That was the regular assertion until persons began to believe that the Fisher Administration had, during the three years, spent £18,000,000 more than they ought to have done by .robbing the States. Some honourable members on the other side actually used the word "" r o b . "" There was no taking - or robbing from the States, but .merely the expending of the additional revenue which came to the Commonwealth as a result of the financial arrangement unanimously agreed to by all the State Governments and fixed lip by the Fusion Administration . At the recent elections, the Fusion party implied that they were going to indulge in a policy of economy. There was no - direct statement to that effect, but the innuendoes in reference to the great expenditure previously indulged in led the public to believe that some sort of saving was to be effected. When our honourable friends have full control of the finances, they bring in a Budget, and we find that they intend, not only to spend the money they receive, the surplus that was left by the previous Administration, and so much of loan money, but to expend this year a total sum of £27,200,000, or some million pounds more than was expended last year by the Fisher A d ministration. Then we have the lame, impotent, deplorable statement coming from every honourable gentleman on the other side, that this expenditure is due to the commitments that we made, and that they cannot get out of the difficulty.",64
579,Mr RODGERS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Is there one item which you would expunge or reduce?,65
580,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"I asked that quesand tion of the honourable member for Parrathey matta six months ago, when he was deing nouncing the heavy expenditure of the Fisher Administration. When he, from every platform, referred to "" this carnival of expenditure)"" when the Treasurer talked of "" this financial debauch,"" when the Attorney-General spoke of "" this torrential expenditure,"" I asked the first them that question repeatedly.",65
581,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"This is a Parliament, not a theatre.",65
582,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"I thank the honourable gentleman for the intended insult. When our honourable friends opposite were making these statements before the electors, I asked them that question repeatedly from every platform. Of course, while their statements could get into thousands of newspapers, the self-same journals deliberately suppressed what was said by Labour men, and when they did not suppress they distorted. They complained then about what they alleged to be "" to r r e n t i a l "" expenditure, and I asked, "" Which item wil l you cut down if you get the opportunity? "" They were as dumb as it was possible for human beings to be. They would not answer my question. It would not have paid them to answer me. They were deceiving the electors.",65
583,Sir JOHN FORREST,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,You answer it now.,65
584,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Will they blame me if I follow the example which they set four or five months ago ? Certainly not. They scarcely dare do that, though there is little that they will not dare do. Their statements led the public to believe that some sort of economy was to be practised; that the ' finances were going to be straightened because, of the allegation that they were not straight. Now that they have complete control, and can do just as they like, have they proposed to cut down the expenditure in any direction? Is there one item on which they propose to do that? Not one. They have increased the total expenditure. They propose to expend £27,200,000 this year. They have not the courage to come forward and say that the expenditure is justifiable; that, no matter what Ministry might occupy the Treasury bench, they would have to in cur the expenditure. They have not the courage to say that that is their policy, that they intend to pursue it . But seek to get behind a screen by saythat they are only incurring this expenditure because they are committed to it by the previous Administration . Only yesterday, they brought forward a proposal to commit the Commonwealth to the expenditure of another £400,000 to which it was not committed by the previous A d ministration-a n expenditure which they said, only on the 12th August, in the Senate, they would not undertake. The interval between that date and the 10th October has provided ample time for honourable gentlemen opposite to change their minds, and now they propose to commit the country to that additional expenditure. In the Estimates there are other lines with which we shall deal when they come before us in detail, showing clearly that these commitments have not been made by a previous Government, but are undertaken by the present Government of their own volition. But, quite apart from that, they do propose an expenditure to which they are not committed, and in which there is no necessity for them to indulge, if it be not their policy. Why have they not the courage to tell the public that it is their policy, that they intend to spend the money, and that all their statements to the electors during the recent campaign in respect to "" torrential "" and other expenditure were false, misleading, and unjustifiable, and ought never to have been made? That would be an open, upright, and honourable course, but apparently it is not to be taken. The Prime Minister said that we took over the Cockatoo Island Dock; so we did. He is careful not to say that he disagrees with that act. I challenge him now to say that he does not approve of the policy.",65
585,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,I say that it was a dishonourable thing to do after promising this Parliament that you would consult it first.,66
586,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"The honourable gentleman does not dare say that he disagrees with the policy. He dare not say that the amount agreed to be paid for bhat property is one penny too high. He will throw gibes at us about old boilers, since he thinks that such statements will remain in the minds of some of the people, and he is prepared bo talk about obsolete machinery, although he knows that he is misrepresenting the position in doing so, because the condition of all the machinery was taken into account in determining the amount to be paid. These statements about old boilers, however, will remain in some minds, just as when you strike a man ou the point he will remember it . The Prime Minister is a pastmaster in the art of making insinuations that will remain in the public mind, and serve to overcloud the real issue. The true issue in bhis case is whether he disagrees with the taking over of the Cockaboo Island Dock. The Prime Minister dare not say that he disagrees with it , and he dare not say thab we promised to pay for the property a penny more than ought to be paid for it . Those, after all, are the two chief factors to be considered, rather than the question of whether any one boiler in use at the dock is ben years or twenby yeirs old. The Prime Minisber, however, prsfers bo deal wibh comparatively trifling items, knowing that he can in that way mislead some of the public. The Cockatoo Island Dock was taken over in conformity with our naval policy, which, I am afraid, is now in very bad hands from at r u ly Australian point of view. The dock was taken over at a valuation made by independent and competent men. The individual members of the late Ministry had nothing whabever to do with the matter, and had the dock been taken over whilst honourable members opposite were in office, there is no doubt that the valuation would have been made by these self-same gentlemen, against whose honour and inbegriby there is not even a breath of suspicion. Ib was necessary to take it over, and we took it over because we were a Ministry of action rather than a Minisbry of mere promises or misrepresenbabion. We believed honestly and conscientiously in the establishment of an Australian Navy which should form an integral part of the Imperial Navy should the necessity arise for their working togebher. I fear, however, thab that policy is nob to be pursued. There are indications of a regrettable characber which point to that conclusion. Returning bo the question of commibments, I would remind the Commibbee that while the Government propose to expend money on the Naval Bases at Cockburn Sound and Westernport, they are nob committed to that expenditure. The Prime Minister will not say that they are. He knows that these works need nob be carried on by bhem if they are not in accordance with their policy. As a matter of fact, for some peculiar reason the presenb Governmenb have stopped the expenditure on the Naval Base at Cockburn Sound. This proves conclusively that so far as the works there are concerned, their statement about being committed to them is false and inaccurate. Here may I point out that we are told that they have stopped the expenditure at Cockburn Sound because they wish first of all to obtain the opinion of an expert as to what should be done there. It seems. singular that this expert is to report upon the proposed Naval Base at Cockburn Sound, and also at Westernport, b ut that, whereas the works at Cockburn Sound have been discontinued, those at Westernport are still being carried on.",66
587,Sir JOHN FORREST,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,The vernment only began the expenditure at Cockburn Sound just about election time.,67
588,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"That statement is inaccurate. The work was undertaken at the earliest possible moment, and the few men engaged there could have had no effect upon the elections. Mr BURCHELL:-There were never more than 180 men employed there.",67
589,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"The honourable member for Fremantle, who naturally takes an interest in this question, has had the Ministry quite recently on the horns of a dilemma. They cannot explain why they have stopped the works at Cockburn Sound, whilst at the same time they are continuing operations at Westernport. They Cannot explain why the expert who is coming out is not to be allowed a free hand in the case of the Westernport Naval Base, just as he is to have a free hand in regard to the Naval Base at Cockburn Sound. Is it that the Ministry dare not stop the works at Westernport?",67
590,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Does the honourable member wish them to be stopped?,67
591,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,No ; and I do not desire that the works at Cockburn Sound shall be stopped.,67
592,Sir JOHN FORREST,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,The member knows nothing about the matter.,67
593,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,It may transpire before long that the right honourable member knows a little too much about it .,67
594,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,I know a deal more than any one else in this House knows about Cockburn Sound.,67
595,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Le t the right honourable member be careful, for there is an instance in the State records of his having stopped expenditure in a particular direction because it did not please him, notwithstanding that an expert of undoubted knowledge and ability had reported in a certain direction. Perhaps in the circumstances we can appreciate more full y now the statement of the Prime M in ister that the expert is coming out to do what they "" want him to do."" They say that they will be guided by his report. If they are to be guided by his report as to the suitability of Cockburn Sound for a Naval Base, why should they not be guided by his report regarding Westernport ? We shall deal with this matter, more lengthily, however, when the items come before us.",67
596,Sir JOHN FOBREST,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,It is a disgraceful statement.,67
597,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"I shall deal with the Fisher Gomatter now if the right honourable member will cease grumbling. He invariably grumbles when these matters are brought forward. I note his mental attitude in respect of Cockburn Sound, and intend to watch it very carefully. I have referred to this matter only to show that, so far as the Naval Base at Cockburn Sound is concerned, we have not committed the present Government to any expenditure, as shown by the fact that they have actually stopped the expenditure there. We shall find that the position is the same in regard to scores of other items-that if the Government disapprove of them, they need not indulge in the particular expenditure relating to them, but they are going to do so, and I fear that they may land us in financial chaos unless the devout wish of the Prime Minister that Providence will be as good to them as He was to the previous Administration is realized. I do not know whether Providence differentiates be'tweeu Administrations, but certainly the revenue does not seem to be coming in as rapidly as it came in last year. I sincerely hope, however, that the revenue will continue to come in freely, and that the Government will not be embarrassed as long as they remain in office. I trust that we shall always be able to honourable meet the just and ever-increasing obligations of the Commonwealth. I deplore, however, what was done at the recent elections, and the attempt by the Prime M in ister to-night to cloud the real issuegood to make it appear that there was something wrong with the finances during the last three years, when he knows that there was not, and that every penny of expenditure the late Government indulged in was justifiable. The honourable gentleman did not complain of one penny of that expenditure, but he did seek to leave a false impression on the minds of the public. I shall have an opportunity to deal further with the finances when the Estimates for the several Departments come before us. What is said on this side may not have much effect on honourable gentlemen opposite; but we shall at least be able to place the position clearly before the community. I say that when the first Fisher Administration l e ft office they left a surplus of £650,000 . The Fusion Government then held office for eleven months, and left a deficit of £450,000, and in each of the three succeeding years during which the second Fisher Administration remained in office there was a surplus, and when they l e ft office three and a half months ago they left a surplus amounting to £2,652,000 . Further, I say that, at the beginning of the financial year 1912-13, when it is said that the then Treasurer proposed to spend more than he received, it must be remembered that he proposed to spend the surplus he had himself accumulated. Owing to the promise at the outset of a lean year, in order that there might be continuit y of construction of the Navy, and the other defence proposals, and continuit y of expenditure upon telegraphs, telephones, and post-offices, it was reasonable that the Government should spend the surplus they had accumulated. That is what they proposed to do.",67
598,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,That reminds me that the statement was frequently made during the elections that the late Government paid for the Fleet as well as leaving a surplus.,68
599,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"So we did. over £3,000,000 .",68
600,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"There £1,000,00 0 on the Estimates this year for the Fleet.",68
601,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"We proposed to expend, during a year which at the outset promised to be lean, the surplus we had accumulated during the good years. Fortunately, the revenue came in in sufficient volume to obviate the necessity of spending the surplus, and we left it in the Treasury for the present Government. We did not, as alleged by the Prime Minister, spend every penny we could get our hands upon. I come now to the last statement of the Prime Minister. has said that during the elections statements were made to the effect that the Fleet was paid for. He seeks to deny that, and says that, on this year's Estimates, the Government have provided for an expenditure of over £1,000,000 more upon the Fleet. Why does not the honourable gentleman make a full statement? Why does he not say that there is in the Trust Fund over £1,000,000 to meet the expenditure on the Fleet?",68
602,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Because the money is not there. Mr - ROBERTS - There is sufficient in the Trust Fund to meet the obligation.,68
603,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,There is not. - ,68
604,Sir JOHN FORREST,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"I think there is only £702,000 in the Trust Fund.",68
605,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,I do not know what is there now; but when the late Government l e ft office there was sufficient money in the Trust Fund to meet the expenditure on the Fleet for this year.,68
606,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,The honourable gentleman is entirely wrong.,68
607,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"The construction was delayed, and the money was not paid. We paid about £3,000,000 .",68
608,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"There is over £1,000,000 yet to be paid on the Fleet.",68
609,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Then the expenditure was greater than £3,500,000 .",68
610,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"No ; we have not spent £3,500,000 on the Fleet yet.",68
611,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"I know that there is on the Estimates this year a vote of over £1,000,000 for the Fleet. The Treasurer has corrected me by saying that there is in the Trust Fund £702,000 to meet that expenditure. That is a very nice balance to have in hand. Mr. JOSEPH COOK:- It is part, of the surplus. We paid Mr ROBERTS - Certainly .",68
612,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Therefore , the late is over Government did not pay for the Fleet and leave the surplus.",68
613,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,The surplus was paid into the Trust Fund to meet the obligations entered into.,68
614,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,The statement to which I refer was that the late Government left a surplus after paying for the Fleet.,68
615,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"No ; I never saw that statement, and I frankl y admit that if it was made, it was incorrect.",68
616,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"It was made all over Australia. He Mr ROBERTS - I did not see it , and I took a very great interest in what was said during the elections in the different States. What was really stated was t h at we l e ft so much money in the Treasury, and that to meet the Fleet obligations there was so much money l e ft in the Trust Fund. T t is not riffh t of the Prime Minister, in the circumstances, to say that the Government have been called upon to provide over £1,000,000 for the Fleet this year, without, at the same time, saying that there were so many hundreds of thousands of pounds in the Trust Fund to meet that obligation. That is the full statement which should have been made in the circumstances. I do not propose this evening to touch on the subject of the State debts, and one or two other subjects. It was not my intention to speak at all to-night, and I should not have done so but for the extraordinary statement made by the Prime Minister. The honourable gentleman has, happily, failed once again in the attempt he made. When the State debts proposal comes before us I hope to be permitted to say a few words on what appears to be an attempt to gamble on the increase in the population. The Government's scheme, if put into force, is calculated to financially embarrass the Commonwealth, as, even at the outset, it proposes to gamble on the in crease in the population. I have heard the warning against counting one's chickens before they are hatched; but the Treasurer is going to count the children before they are born. If he considers that a safe way to finance, the right honourable gentleman is welcome to it.",68
617,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"I suggest that we finish for to-night, and start with the Works Estimates tomorrow.",69
618,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Before we wish to make a personal explanation. 1 want to clear up the Port Pirie matter, as the honourable member for Adelaide has dragged it in again to-night.",69
619,Mr ROBEBTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,The honourable gentleman started it .,69
620,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"I did it , and it is time that it was cleared up. The honourable gentleman is acquiring a reputation in this House for making statements that are very inaccurate. statement was that I purposely misrepresented him at Port Pirie. What I did at Port Pirie was, in speaking of the effect of the Caucus, and the way in which a man had to subordinate his opinions in the Caucus to the Caucus. I quoted this statement of the honourable member for Adelaide at Port Pirie, and I wish the honourable member for the district were present to hear this, because he has often referred to the matterMr Roberts opposed the. motion[71] That is the motion for the initiative and referendum.",69
621,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"No , it is not. Now, let the honourable gentleman be accurate.",69
622,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,The motion was .that the initiative and referendum be placed on the fighting platform,69
623,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,That is better.,69
624,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"It related to the initiative and referendumMr Roberts opposed the motionWhy ? The reason was not a reason for shifting the proposal from one platform to the other, because the report continuesas he had come to the conclusion that the referendum was a Conservative weapon.",69
625,Mr ARTHUR,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,The honourable gentleman said so to-night.,69
626,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"He did say so tonight. Let us see what followed. The honourable gentleman wrote me a letter to sayYou are reported in the Register as having said at Port Pirie, "" Mr Roberts, at the Hobart Conference, had opposed the referenda principles, but was now boosting them up."" I did not use that language, and the report from it I quoted was similar to the report in the Port Pirie Labour newspaper. He evidently sent the same report to both newspapers in Adelaide.",69
627,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"There is no Labour newspaper at Port Pirie. . Mr. JOSEPH COOK - There is a newsfinish I paper there which favours my honourable f r i e n d - I forget the name of it and it was a Labour man who wrote that report, I believe.",69
628,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"The Prime Minister ""believes""!",69
629,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,I am told so. Does the honourable member say that it is not start not so?,69
630,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"I say that he is not a Labour man, and that it is not a Labour His newspaper.",69
631,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"However, he made the mistake of writing "" referenda "" instead of "" referendum."" That is the distinction. That is the only point on which I was misreported. The honourable member, of course, makes a mouthf u l of it , as he does of everything. He wrote to me as follows: Dear Mr Cook, You are reported in the Register as having said at Port Pirie, "" Mr Roberts at the Hobart Conference had opposed the referenda principles, but was now boosting them up."" It is further reported in the same paper that "" y o u produced an official copy of the proceedings of the Conference, and read the passage which contained Mr Roberts' objection."" There must be some serious mistake. I shall, therefore, be glad to hear from you before you leave Adelaide. To that, I wrote as follows: In reply to yours of yesterday's date, I have to say it is a case of misreportmg. The reference was not to the "" referenda,"" but to the "" initiative and referendum,"" and your remarks reported on page 25 of the official report of the Hobart Conference. So far so good. I made a mistake in that reply, in that I did not quote what the honourable member said here, because, if I had done so, he could not have written the letter which he did. In the South Australian Register of 26th May last, the honourable member wroteA reference to page 25 shows that I did not oppose the item. He had come to the conclusion that the referendum was a Conservative weapon. Yet he says that he did not oppose the item. Could there be a greater or more deliberate misrepresentation of the facts?",69

633,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"The official report of the Hobart Labour Conference saysMr Roberts opposed the motion, as he had come to the conclusion that the referendum was a Conservative weapon. The reason given there is a reason against the referendum. He ''opposed the motion, as he had come to the conclusion that the referendum was a Conservative weapon."" Is that an argument against the shifting of the motion, or against the principle of the referendum?",70
634,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Agains t the moving of the motion.,70
635,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"The member "" had come to the conclusion that the referendum was a Conservative weapon "" - in other words, that it was a Conservative principle. He, therefore, was against the referendum. Y e the says distinctly in his letter to the RegisterI did not oppose the item, but merely suggested a re-arrangement of its position upon our platform. If the honourable member was not opposed to the referendum, seeing that he regarded it as "" a Conservative weapon,"" I do not understand the meaning of the English language.",70
636,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,I desire a personal explanation. remain silent under these misrepresentations. They are too common. I am familiar with every word that is contained in the official report of the proceedings of the Hobart Labour Conference. We do .not endeavour to hide what is done in those conferences. They areopen to the public. I refuse to remain silent under these misrepresentations. They are too common.,70
637,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"They are the honourable member's, not mine.",70

I sent an ordinary letter to him saying that there must be some mistake, and that I would be glad to hear from him. He replied to the effect that he had been misreported. I regret that he is so often misreported.",70
639,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Is that not an obvious misreport?,70
640,Mr ROBEBTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Now , page 25 of the official report of the proceedings of the Hobart Labour Conference does not indicate that I opposed the principle of the referendum, as the Prime Minister seeks to make out.",70

I took exception to the item being placed upon our fighting platform.",70

654,Dr MALONEY,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Melbourne) [10.41]. - I wish to bring under the notice of the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs an in sult that has been placed on every politician in the House, and a stigma that has been put on 2,760,216 electors of Australia. This is not a party matter. Sir Almroth Wright, the director in medical charge of the department of therapeutic inoculation at St. Mary's Hospital, London, who may be a brilliant scientist, but who, in my opinion, is lacking in common sense, and has acted with discourtesytowards a large portion of our people, has said thatThe woman voter in the colonies is only pawn in the game of politics, and of the tunist politicians who have enfranchised her. Remembering the great men who helped .to give women the right to vote for the making of the laws which they, equally with men, have to obey-Si r John Forrest, Sir Edmund Barton, Mr Deakin, Sir George Turner, Mr Kingston, Mr Justice O'Connor, Sir Willia m Lyne, and others, including every member of the last Administration and of the present Administration-som e notice should taken of this statement. I should be very veys his opinions. pleased to hear that the Government Opsee its way to send a protest to the gentleman who has made it . An y one who likes can read the noble words of Mr Deakin shall - the n Prime Minister-uttere d when there was not time to pass a resolution to help - our fellow-citizens under the English flag, but I shall quote a resolution passed on my motion on 25th November, 1910, which is a complete answer to They kept the stigma that has been placed on members of this House, not one of whom but believes in women's suffrage. I moved1. That this House is of opinion that the extension of the suffrage to the women of Australia for State and Commonwealth Parliaments on the same terms as to men has had the most beneficial results. It has led to the more orderly conduct of elections, and at the last Federal elections the women's vote in a majority of the States showed a greater proportionate increase than that cast by men. That has been so throughoutI t has given a greater prominence to legisia-tion particularly affecting women and children, although the women have not taken up such questions to the exclusion of others of wider significance. In matters of Defence and Imperial concern they are proving themselves as far-seeing and discriminating as men. That sentence was put in at the express COOK) prodesire of that great and good m a n , Mr .

That a copy of the foregoing resolution be cabled to the British Prime Minister. Mr Fuller had the honour of seconding the motion, which was carried unanimously, and a similar resolution was passed in the Senate by fifteen votes to four, two of those who voted against it not being now in political life. I have nothing to say in detraction of Sir Alm roth Wright's greatness in science, but when he attempts to besmirch the fair fame of every Australian citizen, I think a I voice the opinions of every member of opporthe House in saying that we resent it strongly.",71

656,Mr WEST,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"East Sydney) [10.46] This afternoon there appeared to be some misunderstanding as to a question which I desired to ask regarding the small-pox outbreak in Sydney. In asking it , I the debate. had no desire to infringe any standing order, though you, Mr Speaker, ruled that I must not ask the question. subject on which I wish for information is of great importance, and the flippancy with which I was treated by the Minister is not creditable to him in the high office that he holds. When the proclamation quarantining Sydney was first issued, I told him that the course which he was taking was unnecessary, and I still hold that opinion, as do the citizens of Sydney. What I wanted to <;et from him this afternoon was an expression of opinion as fo whether there are not more persons in Sydney now suffering from the effects of vaccination than there have been victims of small-pox quarantined at North Head, and whether there have not been more deaths from vaccination than from the epidemic? I wished also to ask the Minister whether those well qualified to give an opinion have not stated that there is no need for the quarantining of Sydney, and that there is no likelihood of the epidemic spreading. I wish to know from him whether that opinion had not been expressed by the Board of Health of New South Wales. Replying to the honourable member for Gwydir, the honourable gentleman said that the matter was entirely in the hands of the Board. The Board, however, has expressed the opinion that there is no need for the further quarantining of Sydney, and that it is quite prepared to take the responsibility of recommending the removal of the quarantine without fear of bad results.' In the beginning, the Sydney newspapers stood by the. Minister, defending his action in quarantining Sydney. I thought at the time that they had more care for the interests of the party they support than for the interests of the State, and I still hold that opinion. A fortnight ago there appeared this paragraph in the press",72
657,Mr SPEAKER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,The honourable member must not deal with the quarantine As proclamation.,72
658,Mr WEST,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,I wish to read an expression of opinion to the effect that there is no further need for the quarantine.,72

660,Mr WEST,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"This has occurred within the last few days, and since I gave notice The of my motion. This is what appeared in the Sydney Morning HeraldThose who are best qualified to speak do not now fear an increase in virulence. Even if we accept the dictum that it is true small-pox, it is not by any means the serious disease that we have been accustomed to conjure up under that name. Indeed, it would seem that many patients at the Quarantine Station at North Head have suffered much less than others who have been inoculated with cow-pox. To the lay mind, at least, an attack of small-pox such as we are now experiencing would, in many cases, be a less trying preventive against the real and deadly form of small-pox than vaccination is. At any rate, whether this be so or not, the fact remains that we are taking drastic steps to stamp out a disease that is far less deadly, as well as far less painful, than scores of other diseases, while, in the meantime, the whole of the business interests of the community are in jeopardy, and may remain so for months, or years, to come if the authorities continue obstinate. Dr Robertson went to Sydney with Dr Cumpston, and returned to Melbourne with Dr Cumpston, and, I presume, he had some influence on the Minister when the proclamation was issued.",72
661,Mr GROOM,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,I never saw Dr Robertson.,72
662,Mr WEST,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"It is very obvious to the ordinary man that Dr Robertson's name must have been mentioned. Let me quote Dr Robertson's report, which appeared a few days ago in the Melbourne papers, dealing with notifiable diseases to the 30th September lastThere were more cases of typhoid than at any time last year. There were 62 cases of pulmonary tuberculosis over the whole State, resulting in 25 deaths, and there were 40 cases in the Adjournment. metropolitan aiea with 20 deaths. Theie weie 185 oases of diphtheria, 8Q being in the metropolitan area. These diseases are far more dangerous than the skin disease at prevailing in Sydney, for which the medical gentlemen in Sydney say there no name. They say it is about the or fourth cousin to small-pox; but as have no proper name for it , they have continue describing it as small-pox. we see such a number of deaths in Meladdress bourne from tuberculosis, and when there the roll. are no deaths in Sydney from the present epidemic, and no possibility of deaths, I cases months ago. think the people within 15 miles of the Post Office in Sydney are quite justified in asking for the removal of the prorather clamation that has been so long in force.",72

699,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,I am told that there Do not give are hundreds of cases.,74
700,Mr GROOM,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Months ago some cases were brought under my notice, and I had I found that i a some instances there were two persons of the same name on the roll.",74
701,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"He does not want to damn the Electoral Registrars, but to damn the Government.",74
702,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"On a previous occasion pointed out the trouble which will arise s out of this inconsiderate and hasty action. Shearers who are away fro m their homes four, or five, or six months will have little opportunity of replying to a circular within twenty days after the posting Of course, persons who never shift out of a spot may escape, but after I do not say my own experience there is no guarantee of that they will. They may be able to keep their names on the roll, but persons who , chance indeed if notices are sent out made at a particular period. The men and of women who will suffer are the best men ill and women in this country. Those who not an are prepared to leave their homes and reasonable go elsewhere developing the country are likely to suffer, because of what I call an out a extra-Executive statement made by the Attorney-General that something like this to be done in order to bring about what they please to call a ' ' cleansing the rolls.""",74
703,Mr ATKINSON,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Was not the period 1 of twenty days mentioned in the notices sent out previously from time to time?,75
704,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Yes ; it is nothing fresh.,75
705,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,The honourable member is looking up to the press gallery to see that it is all right.,75
706,Mr ATKINSON,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,I am not doing anything of the sort.,75
707,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,That is an insinuation; there is nobody who looks up there as much as you do.,75
708,Mr ATKINSON,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,I thought he was referring to me.,75
709,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"The circular says that unless the recipient replies within twenty days after the posting of it, his name will be struck off the roll.",75
710,Mr ATKINSON,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Has not that always been the case?,75
711,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Of course it has.,75
712,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,That is a fault in the drafting. I do not say whether it was the act of a previous Government or not.,75
713,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,It was right when they did it ; it is all wrong now. That is all the difference.,75
714,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,The honourable gentleman is so eager to defend the Attorney General that he will not allow the facts of the case to be brought out. The difference between the present Administration and the previous one is that the former is attempting to set aside the law.,75
715,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Nothin g of kind.,75
716,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,I say that the sum of 6s. is not demanded in the case of an objection being made.,75
717,Mr KELLY,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,It has never been manded where the Electoral Registrar thought that there was reasonable ground which it comes? for objecting. Nobody knows that better than does the right honourable gentleman. It is not honest to insinuate anything diflerent.,75
718,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Not in one case, but in hundreds of cases, has the money been demanded. In a case like this, unless the objector showed reasonable ground, the Electoral Registrar ought to have manded the money.",75
719,Mr KELLY,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Do you know that only in one instance, to the best of my recolhas lection, has the 5s. been paid up to the present time?. It is not honest to make these insinuations.",75
720,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,That makes it all the worse.,75
721,Mr KELLY,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,That is during the time you were in office.,75
722,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"I presume, only in one instance.",75
723,Mr KELLY,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,It was simply a dead letter.,75
724,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"It is a dead letter to this extent, that the very fear of losing the 5s. made the people who otherwise would have objected very chary lest they should be penalized. Does the Minister not know that an objector gets back the money if the objection is a reasonable one? An objector is only penalized if his objection is made without reasonable ground. What complaint can be made on that score? I have no doubt that there are plenty of cases where an investigation has been made. The wording of this circular is anomalous. It readsI f you fail to answer the objection within twenty days from the posting of this notice the objection will be determined, and your name will be struck off the roll, but no notice of the decision on the objection will be sent to you.",75
725,Mr KELLY,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,The notice has never been altered.,75
726,Mr GROOM,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Sectio n 72 of the Electoral Act readsOn receipt of the answer of the person objected to, or after the expiration of twenty days from the posting of the notice, the Returning Officer shall determine the objection, and if it the appears that the person objected to is not qualified or entitled to be enrolled on the roll, shall strike out his name.",75
727,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Does not the Minister of Trade and Customs see that every perdeson who receives a notice of this kind must he careful to keep the envelope in,75
728,Mr KELLY,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"That provision is in the Act, and you left it there for three years.",75
729,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"That is not the point. We are dealing with the question of protecting the public. The honourable member for Ballarat has pointed out to me that a stamp date appears on the back of a notice. The notice I hold in my hand deis dated the 22nd, and the post-mark is the 26th. A person carelessly reading a notice of that kind may conclude that he twenty days in which to reply, whereas he has only seventeen days, because of the delay in posting and delivery. I do not wish any one to think that I believe members of a Government, or any one else, with the exception of a rare few, would desire purposely to keep people off the rolls. But, because of a fear of corruption in regard to the compilation of the present rolls, there has grown up a feeling that would induce people of strong partisan views, not only to say, but to do certain things which they would not attempt to justify in public. It is for that reason that I think it absolutely necessary that a deposit of 5s., as required by the law, sliould be insisted upon in all cases. The Registrars, who are not highly remunerated, cannot personally in quire into every objection. They must accept the information supplied to them, and act upon it , unless they have reasonable grounds for believing that an attempt is being made to improperly strike a name off the roll. There are ten times ' too many of these circulars being sent out, and many industrious people, who have lived in the same place for three or four years, are being notified that their names will be struck off the rolls unless by letter, or in some other way, they make good their claim to enrolment. The names of these people should not be struck off, and I hope that the Government will prevent electors being annoyed by the receipt of such intimations when they ought really to be protected.",75
730,Mr MCGRATH,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Ballarat) [11.12] - I have received several circulars similar to that which the Leader of the Opposition has brought under the notice of the House.,76
731,Mr KELLY,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Sen d them in , and they will be looked into.",76
732,Mr MCGRATH,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,The trouble is that I get only a few of the many that are being sent out. In some cases quiry is being made prior to these notices of objection being issued.,76
733,Mr KELLY,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,To what area does the honourable member refer?,76
734,Mr MCGRATH,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"I have, for instance, received the following letterDear Sir,-Enclose d receive a sample of how the rolls are going to be purified. I arrived in Creswick on the 8th day of September, 1869, just 44 years ago, and I have never been a month out of it since. My daughter is in the '42nd year of her age, and is in the same posit i o n that I am in, namely, that our names are objected to being on the roll, not having resided in Creswick a month The letter is signed "" Daniel Grant, North Creswick.""",76
735,Mr KELLY,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Who sent out the notice of objection?,76
736,Mr MCGRATH,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"The Registrar at - Ballarat, who has to depend upon the Deputy Registrar at Creswick.",76
737,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"I h e honourable member ought not to say that, unless it is a fact within his own knowledge.",76
738,Mr MCGRATH,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"I have seen the Electoral Registrar, Mr Wright, about the matter. He has. to take the word of the Deputy that full inquiry has been made.",76
739,Mr KELLY,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Who is the Deputy?,76
740,Mr MCGRATH,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,I do not know his name.,76
741,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,The fact that the honourable member does not know him makes his position all the stronger.,76
742,Mr KELLY,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,But he is making a charge against him,76
743,Mr MCGRATH,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"I have been to the Chief Electoral Officer, and these names are not to be removed.",76
744,Mr ROBERTS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,A Deputy Registrar need not make any inquiries. He has only to have reasonable ground for believing that an objection is a good one.,76
745,Mr KELLY,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"They have been specially directed, under departmental instructions, to make inquiry and satisfy themselves.",76
746,Mr MCGRATH,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Libera l organizations in Ballarat have organizers going about solely with the object of obtaining information for the Electoral Registrars. That is the work for which they are engaged.,76
747,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,That has always been done on all sides.,76
748,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Not by our party.,76
749,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Yes .,76
750,Mr MCGRATH,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"I cannot blame these organizations, in view of the public inforno in - mation given by the Attorney-General. They are simply following his advice. In formation is being supplied by them to the Registrars, and upon that information they are issuing"" these notices of objection. Without any inquiry whatever these notices are being sent out. I know of a case in which certain people who had resided in the same district for years received notice of objection, but said at once, "" We have not been out of the district for years, so that this notice is an absurdity."" They took no notice of it , and I suppose their names have been struck off the roll. They did not bother to reply. But we do not want to have struck off the rolls the names of those who are legitimately entitled to be rolled.",76
751,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Peopl e who do not reply to a notice of objection deserve to have their names struck off.,77
752,Mr MCGRATH,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"The Prime Minister, as one who has-sprung from the ranks, knows that manymen would sooner do a hard day's work than write a letter. Why should people who have resided in the same district for years be obliged to write letters to justify their enrolment, and Bimple. merely because some persons think fit to send in information to the Registrar with the evident intention of having their pure and simple. names removed from the roll.",77
753,Mr KELLY,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,At the last election perable sons who had received notices of enrolfondly ment were found not to have heen enbeing rolled.,77
754,Mr MCGRATH,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Detective s were employed in Ballarat for weeks in making insurely. quiries concerning the charge which the Honorary Minister has just made, and for? - they reported that in every case, save one, they found the persons enrolled.",77
755,Mr GROOM,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"I had specific cases where notices of enrolment were sent sons who found that they had not been enrolled, and I brought them before the gestion. Department. Mr KEI.LT - The honourable member ought to have too much self-respect to be slinging about these charges. Mr MoGRATH - We know how these cases occur. When a card is received it has to he noted, and a reply sent - If the imputing postal officials are unable to deliver the circular in reply, it is returned Department and duly noted.",77
756,Mr GROOM,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"I presented to tihe Dethe partment a case in which a lady at Brisbane received notice of enrolment, subsequently found that her name was on the roll.",77
757,Mr MCGRATH,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,That might been due to a clerical error.,77
758,Mr GROOM,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Quite so. Then why suggest corruption where there may be honest explanation),77
759,Mr MCGRATH,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"I should not do so but for the remarks made by the Attorment. ney-General, and the fact that the Government are breaking the law by failing to enforce the requirement as to the lodgdishonest ing ef a deposit of 5s. with each objection.",77
760,Mr KELLY,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,We are not breaking the law. There has been no change. [72],77
761,Mr MCGRATH,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"If the Ministry will ennot take action, then we, as a party, ought to take action every day in order to direct public attention to this matter.",77
762,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"ParramattaPrime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs) [11.19] - In the last sentence uttered by him, the honourable member for' Ballarat has unwittingly told the House exactly what is behind thia agitation.",77
763,Mr MCGRATH,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,What is it?,77
764,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Politics , pure",77
765,Mr BURNS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,On your side.,77
766,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"It is politics, Every one of these things which they can get hold of honormembers bring in here as proof, they imagine, of enormities that are perpetrated by the Liberal Government.",77
767,Mr MATHEWS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"That is our duty,",77
768,Mr FINLAYSON,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,What are we here,77
769,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"What is the honourable member here for? He is here to act uprightly, and not dishonestly, as out to perhis interjection suggests.",77
770,Mr FINLAYSON,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,It is more than a sug,77
771,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"-The hon-Table member is not here to act dishonestly, as he now suggests he ought to do.",77
772,Mr BURNS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,I rise to a point of order. Icalledask that the Prime Minister should be upon to withdraw his statement - dishonesty to the honourable to the. member for Brisbane.,77
773,Mr SPEAKER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"I did not understand Prime Minister to attribute dishonesty .to the honourable member for Brisbane; and but if the honourable member for Brisnot bane takes exception to the remark made by the Prime Minister, I have no doubt have that it will be withdrawn.",77
774,Mr FINLAYSON,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,I take no objection.,77
775,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,The honourable an member for Brisbane has himself said that he is here for the purpose of exposing these enormities of the Liberal Govern,77
776,Mr FINLAYSON,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Certainly .,77
777,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"I say that is a statement to make, and it is an infamous statement into the bargain.",77
778,Mr SPEAKER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,The honourable member is now distinctly out of order.,77
779,Mr WEST,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"The honourable gentleman should try and be dignified, for once.",78
780,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"I am to be dignified - while this political dirt throwing going on all round. We have the statement of the honourable member for Brisbane, of all others, that he is here for the purpose of exposing what he says are the enormities of the Liberal Government. These enormities consist in sending out the ordinary notices. There has been no change made of any kind.",78
781,Mr MATHEWS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Oh , yes, there has. .",78
782,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"There has been no change made at all. Yet we are told by the honourable member for Ballarat that it is the purpose of honourable members opposite now to get hold of every one of these notices and bring them to the House, in order to expose what the Libera] Government are doing. Very well, now that honourable members have told us that, we shall know what notice to take of their protestations. They can bring their notices along, and I tell honourable members opposite that I , for one, will not take the slightest notice of their statements. The Government will do what they can in the Department to administer the Electoral Act honestly, and to try and secure a cleaner roll than we have now. That is our duty. If honourable members like to throw these innuendoes around and make charges that have not a tittle of justification, they are bound to recoil ultimately upon their own heads.",78
783,Mr MATHEWS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Ministers ' ideas of making the rolls pure is to wipe out Labour voters.,78
784,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,Her e is another wild and whirling statement.,78
785,Mr SPEAKER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,I ask the honourable member for Melbourne Ports to withdraw his statement. It is not in order for an honourable member to impute improper motives to other honourable members.,78
786,Mr MATHEWS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"I did not reflect upon the Prime Minister, but upon the Ministry.",78
787,Mr SPEAKER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,That is not in order.,78
788,Mr MATHEWS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"I withdraw the statement, if it is not in order.",78
789,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"I Bhould first make inquiries to learn whether the notices were not due to an honest mistake before I brought them to this House to make charges such as honourable members opposite now make on the strength of them. There is neither reason nor fairness in their conduct. The right honourable member for Wide Bay toned his remarks down towards the close of his fs speech, and left it to those behind .him to make all sorts of charges and allegations, based upon what, ho doubt, when the matter comes to he investigated, will be found to be a simple and honest mistake. That is a kind of political warfare that cannot be regarded as fair in any sense.",78
790,Mr FISHER,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,What about the Creswick case?,78
791,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"I say that the Creswick case needs inquiry, that is all. What more can we say ? But I do object to these insinuations that beneath every one of these notices there is some deep and dark-laid plot.",78
792,Mr MATHEWS,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Hear, hear! That is correct. ;- in iw",78
793,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BUSINESS OF POSTAL,"Then , I have no more to say, hut that I will treat these statements with the contempt they deserve. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 11.25 P- m",78
