9,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,But what happened last night?,13
10,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I desire to a make no reference to that. But alluding to it for only one moment, I do say that whatever the Liberal Government did did not do last session, we never put motion to the House such as that proposed by the Prime Minister last night.",13

12,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,We never subthat mitted such a motion to the House.,13

14,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I would advise the honourable member to study the term3 the of the motion submitted by the Prime Minister. It is a record for this Parliament or any other that I know of.,13
15,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! I ask the honourable member not to discuss that mat,13
16,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I submit that these matters of privilege must be disdiscussed whenever that is necessary in the opinion of the member who feels that hia inprivileges are being impugned - The question of privilege having been raised, it is for Mr Speaker to explain his decision, and then after honourable members have expressed their points of view, it is for of the House to finally determine whether the question is one of privilege or not. If an honourable member may not rise to a question of privilege or submit a point of by order, all our privileges are gone. We helpless and limp under the absolutely autocratic ruling of any Speaker we happen to have in the chair at the time.

17,Mr WISE,Unknown,"Gippsland) [12.57] - Fo t be having been a member of the last Parliament, and not having been present last night when the trouble out of which this to motion has arisen occurred, I think I may the be able to discuss the matter on the abstract motion, apart altogether from its surrounding circumstances. It is not the . privileges of honourable members that cause trouble; it is the abuse of them. We repeatedly find in Parliament honourable members rising at the wrong time on a point of order, and the Speaker is supposed to have to listen to those points. Very often we ""hear Mr Speaker saying, "" That is not point of order,"" and in nine cases out of ten the honourable member who has raised it knows that it is not a point of or order. But he achieves his purpose by a raising a fictitious point of order to express something he desires to say. When he is ruled out of order, it is a common to occurrence for him to then raise a question of privilege. Mr Speaker says no question of privilege is involved, but the honourable member who has raised it suffers no penalty for having abused his privilege.",13
18,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,Unknown,"You that the honourable member for Richmond abused his privileges, though you were not present to hear what took place.",14
19,Mr WISE,Unknown,"That interjection shows how thoroughly biased the honourable member for Elinders is. I had not in mind last night's incidents at all. I was referring to numberless instances that have occurred in this Chamber since I have been a member. This motion seems to me to be altogether wrong. The mover of it seems to confuse two things. First of all there is the ruling, and then the reasons for the dissent from that ruling. I do not think any one is going to say for a moment that an honourable member has not a right to express his reasons in his own language, but surely an honourable member's only right of dissent is to dissent from the actual ruling that has been actually given by Mr Speaker.",14
20,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,Unknown,"He a r , hear 1 there is one tribunal to decide what that ruling is.",14
21,Mr WISE,Unknown,"We know that very often, particularly in the circumstances which I can imagine to have existed last night, ruling is given by Mr Speaker at a when the House is in a state of excitegiven ment, aud many honourable members do not hear clearly what the ruling is. More than once I have heard Mr Speaker contradict an honourable member, and say, "" That was not my ruling.""",14
22,Unknown,Unknown,Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.SO p.m.,14
23,Mr WISE,Unknown,"I shall conclude in a few words what I desire to say in regard to this matter. If the House were to prove of this motion it would place itself in a very dangerous position. The only right possessed by an honourable member business-papeT. understanding order 287 is the right to dissent from the ruling actually given by Mr Speaker, and not from what he thinks last Parliament. was the ruling given. If an honourable member sets out incorrectly the ruling given it is open to Mr Speaker to say, obstruct. "" This is not my r u l in g ."" If the notice of motion did not set out the ruling actually given, the result would be that we should spend a lot of time discussing a ruling that had not been given. In answer to an interjection the honourable member for Flinders said that it would be for the House to say whether or not the ruling was correctly assume stated in the motion. Surely that is a most extraordinary position to take up. In other words, the honourable member says that the Appeal Court is to be asked to decide first of all what the decision of the lower court was. and then to say whether that decision was right or wrong.",14
24,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,Unknown,That is what it always does.,14
25,Mr WISE,Unknown,No .,14
26,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,Unknown,The Appeal Court decides as a matter of interpretation what the decision was.,14
27,Mr WISE,Unknown,"That is another point. This is a matter, not of interpretation, but of fact. The honourable member, in reply to another interjection, said, I think, that if the terms of a ruling were wrongly stated in the motion of dissent, the House would reject the motion. But the effect of rejecting the motion would be to uphold the ruling set' out in that motion, so that, if it were incorrect, we should have on the records of the House And a ruling that might be ridiculous, and which was not given by Mr Speaker. We find ourselves in this way beset with many difficulties. The only position open to us, I think, is to f all back upon the old a rule that any honourable member may time move a motion dissenting from a ruling by Mr Speaker. If we do that, all will be well. But if we depart from that rule, we shall open the door to endless obstruction by any party which thinks fit to obstruct the proceedings of the House by embodying in a notice of motion to dissent from a ruling by Mr Speaker all sorts of statements as to what that ruling was. We might spend the whole of next day in discussing a ruling never given unless the Government thought fit apto deny honourable members the privilege of dealing with the matter by putting the notice of motion at the bottom of the",14

32,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,Unknown,M o s t of us are confirmed sinners in that respect.,14

34,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"Wimmera) [2.33] - I have no desire to refer to last night's cident except to say that I appreciate the loyalty of the Leader of the Opposition, and the honourable member for Richmond, who, whilst I was addressing the Chair, interposed to preserve my liberties and the privileges of the House generally. The motion submitted by the honourable member for Flinders, I submit, is well within the terms of standing order 287. If the effect of the standing order is to give to Mr Speaker the absolute right to decide whether a motion to dissent from his ruling is in accordance with the actually given by him, it seems to me that it requires to be amended. If the motion submitted by the honourable member for Flinders is rejected, then it will be held that the whole matter is within the decision of the Speaker. I submit that the standing order simply lays upon any honourable member who objects to a ruling the obligation of presenting to the Chair the terms of his objection.",15
35,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,The ruling must be identified in the motion.,15
36,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,There is something wrong about the position if Mr Speaker is to be the sole judge as to whether or not a motion disagreeing with his ruling does or does not correctly state that ruling.,15
37,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,Surely he should be the judge of what he said.,15
38,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"The House ought also to be in a position to know, just as well as Mr Speaker himself, what was the ruling given by him. As it is, the contention of some honourable members opposite seems to be that Mr Speaker is the sole judge of the position, and may determine the question before the House itself, the supreme arbitrator, has had an opportunity to consider it . If this motion is to be rejected, then the Standing Orders should be narrowed down in the direction I have indicated.",15
39,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"Riverina) [2.38] I wish to debate this question without any reference to the regrettable proceedings connected with the last sitting of the House. The motion submitted is divided into three parts. W it h the first two divisions, every member, I think, will be in agreement. We are all agreed that every honourable member is entitled to dissent from a ruling by the Speaker. The honourable member for Flinders, however, goes on to lay down the principle that it is for the honourable member obi n - jecting to determine what shall be the terms of his motion of dissent. When a ruling is objected to, the notice of motion dissenting from it must be handed in in writing, and my experience extending over many years is that it is the invariable practice for the Speaker, if he considers that the notice of motion does not set out what his ruling actually was, to immediately call attention to that fact. The House has a knowledge of what actually transpired, and, when the notice of motion is read out, can ruling say at once whether or not the ruling has been correctly stated. If an honourable member were permitted to set out what he thought to be the ruling given, we might have an abuse of the privilege.",15
40,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Suppos e Mr. Speaker declined to tell the House what his ruling actually was, then an honourable member could submit ten notices of motion and have every one of them refused.",15
41,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"I cannot recall one instance, either in this Parliament or in the Parliament of New South Wales, where the practice I have mentioned has been departed from. A motion dissenting from the ruling of the Speaker is different from one to dissent from a ruling by the Chairman of Committees, since it is not determined immediately. It is set down for consideration on the following day, when there may be present honourable members who were not in the House when the incident took place, and who consequently know nothing of the circumstances. If the Speaker were deprived of the right to have his ruling correctly stated in the notice of motion of dissent, then honourable members might be called upon next day to uphold or reject a ruling that had never taken place. In the interests of good order, is it not desirable that it should be decided, as sonu as a notice of motion is handed in to dissent from Mr Speaker's ruling, what shall be the subject to be debated upon thnt motion next day?",15
42,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,How are we to get to know that?,15
43,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,Honourable members know exactly what has occurred.,15
44,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The member for Richmond gave his interpretation of the ruling, and Mr Speaker gave another.",16
45,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"I do not wish to allude to the proceedings of the last sitting of the House, except to say that I was not present when the incident in question occurred, and that I sincerely regret that it should have taken place.",16
46,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,The suggestion made by the honourable member that when a notice of motion to dissent from Mr Speaker's ruling is handed in the question of what was the correct ruling should be decided at once would not get over the difficulty mentioned by him as to the absence of certain honourable members. Several honourable members niight not have been present when the incident occurred.,16
47,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"But under this motion honourable members who were present when the ruling was given would be deprived of the opportunity of saying whether or not the ruling was correctly stated in the notice of motion. An entirely false version of the ruling ' might thus be put before them next day for their final decision. Surely that is not equitable or just. We have had a long line of illustrious gentlemen occupying the position of Speaker of this House. The late lumen ted Sir Frederick Holder, when the wording of such a notice of motion did not convey the ruling actually given, invariably called attention to that fact as soon as the notice of it was handed in, and required it to be amended before being placed on the notice-paper.",16
48,Mr BOTD,Unknown,- A very wise course to pursue.,16
49,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"But under this motion that power would be taken from Mr Speaker, and we might have an abuse of the privilege.",16
50,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Is this the honourable member's point-that Mr Speaker, when he considers that a notice of motion to dissent from his ruling does not vey what he said, should correct it .",16
51,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"My contention is that as soon as the notice of motion is cause submitted Mr Speaker should have the power to say whether or not it correctly order. states the ruling given. Honourable members having been present at the time know what the ruling actually was. I am speaking calmly and dispassionately, speak, honourable without any reference to the proceedings which gave rise to this motion. In the interests of the orderly conduct of the proceedings of the House, I urge that it would be exceedingly unwise to take away from us the power to determine really what took place, and what question should be debated when the notice of motion comes on for discussion.",16
52,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,What has the honourable member to say with regard to the question of privilege?,16
53,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"The r e can be no doubt that every honourable member is entitled to rise to a question of privilege, but it is the rule that when an honourable member is called to order he shall resume his seat until Mr Speaker has stated his case, whatever it may be.",16
54,Mr ROUGERS,Unknown,"But when Mr Speaker, instead of explaining what is his ruling, calls on another honourable member and refuses to hear the honourable member who has risen to a question of privilege, what is the position?",16
55,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"May , Rovrinot, and other authorities will support m y contention that this power has been held by the Speaker from time immemorial. If a Speaker abused his rights and p r i v i leges, then the House concerned would deal with him, and protect the rights and privileges of honourable members generally.",16
56,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,Unknown,This is the only appeal that honourable members have from Mr Speaker.,16
57,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"That is so; but we have to consider the method of the appeal, and to see that it is based on just premises, whether it shall be on what really took place.",16
58,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,Unknown,The question is who is to judge?,16
59,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"I am not in disagreement with the honourable and learned conmember in regard to the other point. I do not think it would be wise that a motion of this kind should be carried, bei t would lead to the abuse of p r i v i lege rather than to the maintenance of",16
60,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Richmond) [2.46] I have hesitated a good deal about speaking on this motion, but having decided to it is my intention not to vote if the question goes to a division, because the present proceedings arose out of action that I deemed it my duty to take last night, and my feelings have, to a certain extent, been disturbed by what then occurred. As there is a certain amount of misapprehension in the minds of the last speaker and of others who have addressed themselves to the motion as to exactly what transpired, most of them not being in the Chamber at the time, I shall, with your permission, Mr Speaker, having expressed my deep regret at what occurred, state exactly how I viewed the position at the time, and why I wish to support the motion now under discussion. It will be remembered that last night the honourable and learned member for Flinders moved an amendment on the motion for the second reading of the Commonwealth Bank Bill . That amendment was in very wide terms, indeed in wider terms than the motion before the House. honourable member for ""Wimmera was proceeding to address himself to that amendment. The proof of the Hansard record of his speech shows that every sentence he uttered was in some way related to the Committee of inquiry which it was proposed by the amendment to appoint. You, sir, ruled the honourable member out of order, and I rose to a point of order, which I stated sis follows:I rise to a point of order. 1 submit that the honourable member for Wimmera is perfectly Sn order in covering the whole subject of the argument. amendment, and in speaking upon each of its three divisions, provided that he addresses remarks to them. I submit that, notwithable standing what the honourable bave covered in his speech on the second reading of the Bill, he is permitted under our Standing Orders to speak at length on -"" control and development of the Commonreplied, wealth Bank,"" and to adduce reasons in connection therewith to support the reference the Bill to a Select Committee. The honour and able member is also at perfect liberty - at length to "" the transfer to the Bank of the orable .member for Wimmera."" 'management of the note issue,"" and to show how that would affect the note issue. with respect to ""the relations of the Bank - the State and other financial institutions,"" honourable member may refer to the relations of the Bank in any wav he pleases.",16
61,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,-Will the honourable ber state his point of order?,17
62,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"My point of order is that honourable member for Wimmera is quite order in discussing at length the different secin the motion before the House. lions of the amendment, and it is not possible for you, sir, under the Standing Orders, to limit debate on those three sections. That was the point against which Mr . Speaker ruled. I dissented from the ruling in these terms:I desire to disagree with Mr Speaker's ruling that the honourable member for Wimmera is out of order in referring to the control and development of the Commonwealth Bank, the transfer to the Bank of the management of the note issue, and the relations of the Bank to the State and other financial institutions, when speaking to the amendment moved by the honourable member for Elinders on the second reading of the Commonwealth Bank Bill. I admit willingly that there was a technical flaw in the phraseology, but it appeared to me then, as it does now, that I was at liberty to state the terms of the point of order which I had raised, and against which Mr Speaker had ruled. I do not remember exactly what transpired immediately afterwards, but the Hansard report shows that there were several interjections, and that Mr Speaker made an The explanation. I then rose to a point of order, which Mr Speaker heard. I stated the opinion that I was at liberty to set down in my own language the terms of ray dissent from the ruling which I understood that he had given on the point of order that I had raised. Mr Speaker then saidThe honourable member will discover after he has been in the House a little longer, though he has been here long enough to know it now, that he is not the sole judge in this matter, but somebody else is. I did not give a ruling similar to that which he has stated.",17

65,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Kalgoorlie-Minister of External Affairs) [2.56] - On e cannot help feeling a littl e sympathy for the honourable member for Richmond in the circumstances in which he found himself last night, and in which he remains today. But his chronological recital of the facts, though interesting, did not embrace the main features of the episode which has been brought under review by the motion now before the House. He did not grapple with what I regard as the essential point. That is, has an honourable member the right, in appealing from the Speaker's decision, to misinterpret it , and to place before the House an issue which that ruling did not raise ? If an honourable member was entitled to attempt to obtain the decision of the House on a misinterpretation of a ruling, our proceedings would eventually become chaotic. On that point the remarks of the honourable member for Gippsland were convincing. The proposition of the honourable and learned member for Flinders is that a member has the right to place his own construction upon a ruling, and to ask the House to give its decision on that construction.",18

69,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Surely not. The Speaker is entitled to have his ruling accurately stated - In cases of this kind the House has to decide whether the r u l ing of the Speaker was in accordance with the Standing Orders and practice of Parliament, not whether a member's statement of that ruling was or was not correct.",18
70,Sir WILLIAMIKVINE,Unknown,"That is the main purpose, but the House must determine the question, of fact. No doubt the House will accept, and pay respect to, even if it does not accept, the Speaker's statement as to what he did rule.",18
71,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Does the honourable member say that the Speaker is bound to allow an issue, which is not correct, to go before the House?",18
72,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,Unknown,"If it is honestly put, yes. It is for the House to determine if it is correct or not.",18

There is another point raised by the honourable member for Flinders, and I should like him to review it on the principle that sometimes second thoughts are best. understood the honourable member to contend, and I believe he is right in contending, that when an honourable member rises to a question of privilege, he is bound to be heard at any stage of the proceedings. That, I believe, has been the practice of this Parliament so far ; and in this regard I am quite at one with the honourable member for Flinders. But the honourable member went further, and admitted that the Speaker eventually had to be the judge whether the point raised was a matter of privilege or not.",18

From ocular demonstration, I should say that the honone orable member for Richmond was in that frame of mind that the Speaker was warranted in assuming that he was really not desirous to ventilate a question of privilege, but was merely using another means to take points of order which the Speaker had previously refused to listen to.",19
99,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,You would judge a man before he speaks?,20

I do not see that any good can come of pressing this motion to a division, and I hope it will not be pressed that far. Apar t altogether from the merits of the matter, we are now approaching a season of peace and good will, and I think that the usual good feelings entertained at this time of the year would be considerably promoted by the honourable and learned member withdrawing the motion.",20

This is merely carrying out standing order 287; and, of course, we have to follow vilege, the standing order. But the motion goes much further. It seeks to compel lest the Speaker, whoever he may be, to the always accept such a motion when it is presented. That cannot be done, for the reasons which have been pointed out by the honourable member for Gippsland, and I may say that this is not the firstoccasion on which the point has arisen in the Federal Parliament. Without mentioning the names of any of my predecessors concerned, I may say that, on several occasions, it has beerk ruled that such a. motion was not in accordance with th<v I do not wish ruling given, and, therefore, could not be accepted. This has been done by myself before now, and also, as I say, ' by my predecessors. Further, the Speaker has, on similar occasions, reminded themover of the motion that it could be amended. I do not intend to read the quotations from previous rulings that I have here, but I can assure honourable members that what I have stated is the effect of them. Perhaps the most try in g duty that devolves on the occupant of the position I now fill is that of maintaining order, more particularly when feeling is running high on both sides of the House. Of course, when honourable members are in a good humour, much latitude may be allowed, the Speaker knowing that he has complete control; but when, as I say, feeling is running high, it becomes necessary on his part to be very careful. When, points of order are taken, not once or twice, but a dozen times, it becomes evident to the Speaker that a strong hand is required; but, unfortunately, the Standing Orders do not set for t h exactly what he must do under the circumstances. The Speaker is thus compelled to use his common sense in carrying out his most i m portant duty of maintaining order with in the Chamber. Without desiring to cash any reflections in reference to what took place last night, there seemed to me to be no. finality as to the number of points of order likely to be submitted. To such an extent was that the case that I , as head of the* House, desirous, of conducting the busideness in a proper way, came to the conclusion that it must be stopped. No doubt, honourable members who were affected bywritmy exercise of control felt more or less, aggrieved, but my duty, however painfull it might be, was obvious. The honourable, member for Richmond on four separate* occasions tried to press a question of p r i and, of course, if there is one matter more than another deserving of the f u l consideration it is a question affecting; privileges of honourable members. But when quite a number of points of order had been raised, and further points of order were still coming, with an evident desire to get behind the ruling of the Speaker by raising the question of privilege, it became my bounden duty to take strong steps, and I did so. I took the course which I believe to be the correct one under the circumstances, and it is now for the House to decide whether I am right or wrong.",20

I had risen to speak to the second reading of the Bill . Then, following upon the few remarks that I made, the proof says, "" Bill read a second time."" I ask whether the amendment of the honourable member for Flinders was put? My recollection is that, there was only one question put to the House. I understood that it was the amendment, and not the second reading, that had been put, and that you, Mr Speaker, having come from the a sick bed, and having been performing your duties in the House for many hours, the scene that had just occurred having is overstrained your nerves, were being relieved by the Deputy Speaker. On this account I was rather slow in starting, I venture to say that, through m y been ruled out of order, honourable a members lost the opportunity of hearing as a brilliant and forensic effort.",21

If the Minister has no knowledge of the facts, will he make inquiries to see if they are correct; and if he finds them to be correct, will he endeavour to ascertain who has been responsible for poisoning the water ?",22
118,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"So far as I am aware, the Defence Department have no information on the matter; but I shall urge the Minister to cause inquiries to be made, so that, if there has been any criminal act on the part of any person in that district, we may endeavour to sheet the offence home. TERMS OF MOTION OF SUSPENSION. Mr. JOSEPH COOK: (Parramatta) [ 3 . 2 8 ] - I rise to a matter of privilege. I regret to say that it has to deal with the terms of the motion relating to myself carried in the House at the last sitting. The terms of that motion are unprecedented.",22
119,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I understood that there was to be an end to this matter. The honourable member sent me a letter this morning, which I acknowledged as graciously as I possibly could. I trust that the honourable member will not attempt to revive the question. I think that we all desire that it should be entirely terminated. The motion which was carried by the House, whatever its terms were, had nothing to do with me.",22
120,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I feel that it is my duty to refer to this matter.,22
121,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member may make a personal explanation.,22
122,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"No . I raise this as a matter of privilege. For the first time in its history the House has transferred to the hands of Mr Speaker the penal power which always resides in it. The incident is closed, so far as Mr . Speaker and I are concerned; but my point is that Mr Speaker does not exercise the penal power of the House. Quite properly, when anything offending his dignity occurs, he makes his appeal to the House, and the duty then lies with the Prime Minister to take action; but whatever is done has to be done by the a bit of House, and whatever apologies have to be made, have to be made to the House. That has been the invariable practice. For the first time in our records the right honourable gentleman, the Prime Minister, framed a motion which transferred back to you, sir, that penal power which, under the Standing Orders, resides in the House. That is my point, and it is a very serious one. Under the terms of this motion, as any one can see, instead of exercising the penal powers of the House when appealed to by you to do so, the Prime Minister simply transfers the unfortunate culprit back to an offended Speaker to do with him what he chooses, when he chooses, and how he chooses. And this motion, if you care to exercise it , sir, PRIVILEGE. would permit you to compel me to remain out of the House for the whole of the Parliament, irrespective altogether of what the attitude of the House towards me might be.",22
123,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I rise to a point of order.* The righ t honourable member for Parramatta is reflecting upon a decision of the House. In my opinion, this matter is not one of privilege. The right honourable member will have an opportunity on some other occasion of challenging the action of the House last night, but he cannot intervene at this stage.",22
124,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,In what way will I have an opportunity?,22
125,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,By giving notice of a motion that the resolution agreed to by the House be rescinded.,22
126,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"In my opinion, the honourable member for Capricornia is right, but I thought that the right honourable member for Parramatta desired merely to make a personal explanation, and I allowed that course to be followed in order to get this incident closed. I now ask the right honourable gentleman not to pursue the matter any further. If the right honourable member wishes to take exception to any action of this House it must be taken by direct motion.",22
127,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The fact remains that the Prime Minister, in moving this motion last night, took a course which to me is purely offensive, and I do not think that I deserve such treatment at his hands.",23

129,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Wide Bay-Prime M i nister and Treasurer) [3.35] - Through you, Mr Speaker, I desire to say to the Leader of the Opposition that in submitting the motion which has been referred to, I put it before the House verbally, and on the spur of the moment, with a view to modifying rather than accentuating any reflection on the right honourable member. The motion was moved in answer to the call from the Chair, and I assure the Leader of the Opposition that the idea of offending him was never in my mind. On the contrary, I regarded that form of motion as a simple and easy way of enabling the right honourable member to return to the chamber during the closing hours of the sitting. NA COMPANIE S.",23

In order that Messrs.

As one who has had a long aud intimate acquaintance witn the honourable member for Darwin, I know that he is accustomed to deal with big things. In this proposal he is not far away from what is actually taking place. It was at our own suggestion that the Bank of England accepted bullion and gold deposited here, and gave a credit of 97 per cent, in London during a period of the war when they were not at all anxious to ship it . The question of a great In ternational clearing house is an important one. I hope that such an institution is going to be established somewhere convenient to us, and the possibility is one that should not be left out of account.

They do not reflect any credit on the Australian horse, and, in my judgment, they will not do justice to the men who are going away, possibly to face death upon them. Will the Prime Ministerand I address this question to him in the absence of the Assistant Minister of Defence-tak e into consideration the desirability of doing something to make an improvement in this respect ?",25
147,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"In regard to equipment of every kind, including the supply of horses, it has been the aim of the Government, and expense has not been spared, to supply the very best to our Expeditionary Forces. Horses, however, have been a source of trouble from the beginning of time, and are likely to be. We have all read the story of the two deacons who deceived each other in the matter of a horse.",25
148,Mr FLEMING,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister a further question relating to the very important matter of the horses supplied to the Expeditionary Forces. Among the horses in the parade yesterday, there were some really first class animals and a lot that were moderately good; but there were some which, to any man who has an eye for a b it of good horse flesh, are a positive menace to those whose lives will depend upon them. These are just the class of horses that are sure to be a positive danger to the men when they get into difficulties. Very little judgment could have been displayed in selecting them. One would PAPER. naturally think that the best horses would be picked out for yesterday's parade. If that course was adopted, t of then' I can only say that - our soldiers and must be very badly horsed.

165,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Wide Bay-Prime M in ister and Treasurer) [4.10] - I move That the House do now adjourn. This has been in many respects an eventf u l session, and, to those on this side of the House, a tragic one. This, unfortunately, is no new thing with us. speak on behalf of every member of the Parliament when I say that we deeply deplore the death of the late Minister of External Affairs. In him the Commonwealth lost a distinguished citizen, but his memory will remain with us. I thank honourable members on both sides for the great courtesy which they have shown to Ministers and to myself in the consideration of the business of a very difficult session. The session has been an unusual one, financial measures of the gravest importance having been dealt with, and dealt with speedily. I express the hope that certain transactions which have taken place during the past few months will greatly tend to a closer association between the Commonwealth and the States, in matters material and financial, and that this association will greatly improve our credit, both here and elsewhere. I am sorry that the Leader of the Opposition is not now in his place, because I wish to thank the Opposition for the assistance which it gave in the passing of measures which the Government thought it their duty to bring forward in the interests of the country. I express regret for an untoward occurrence which arose last night, but I assure honourable members opposite, one and all, that I am far from harboring animus or personal feeling against them. We on this side recognise the honest endeavour of the Opposition to give effect to its political views, as we on this 3ide of the House do the best we can to give effect to our views. To you, Mr Speaker, we owe a debt of gratitude, because yours is at all times a difficult position to fill. The Speakership of a representative assembly is an office of high honour, and at times circumstances must arise which make it most difficult to hold the balance even. When two parties look at a question from different points of view, and feeling runs high, it is easy to think that a presiding officer is not doing his best, but it has become the tradition of this Parliament to make ready and willing acknowledgment of the impartiality and ability of your services. To the Chairman of Committees I make similar reference. He has fulfilled our highest expectations, both as Chairman and Deputy Speaker. In the officers of the House we have a body of men who know no politics. They are always ready to supply us with information, and to give us I what help they can in all our difficulties, without regard to our political views. To the Clerk, the Assistant Clerk, and all the officers that attend on members, we are very much indebted. Some may say that they only perform the duties for which they are paid, but they perform those duties in such a way that it makes it a pleasure to have transactions with them. Long may this state of things continue. Then we have Hansard. One fails to realise what we should do without Hansard/ It must astonish many honourable members to discover from Hansard how much clearer they are in their speeches than they themselves imagine. Be that as it may, we have in the Hansard Staff a perfectly impartial body of men, without political or party ties of any kind, to make a record of our proceedings; and although some of us may, perhaps, be inclined to say hard things sometimes of Hansard",26
166,Mr RODGEES,Unknown,That is only when it is a little over twelve months old f,27
167,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Whateve r we may sometimes say about Hansard, it is an invaluable record, and also a help to new members and others who desire to know something about the history of our country. This Parliament is the only place in the world where Australian interests as a whole are discussed- a point that it is well to remember-and the history of the country is largely embedded in the Hansard volumes, though I must confess it might prove difficult to extract it in its proper order and sequence. Australia is a great country, destined to become still greater, and, from a national point of view, its national history can only be discovered in our record here; it is all the more important, therefore, that we should have the able staff at present at our disposal to make that record. I take this opportunity to say, in reference to the unfortunate episode of last night, that in the action I then took there was no intention to humiliate any man-fa r from it . My desire i u wording the motion as I did, and as it was accepted by Mr Speaker, was to as make it as easy as possible for the Leader of the Opposition to be with us again; and I am only sorry that the right honnow orable gentleman is not here to hear say so. I wish every honourable and every officer of the House an able recess; and I trust we shall return refreshed and vigorous to our work-th Opposition f u l ly primed with facts figures to show how unsound the present Administration is, and the Government equally primed with facts and figures, to prove that any change in the Adminismore of our members. tration could lead only to mischief and disaster.",27
168,Mr JOHN THOMSON,Unknown,"Cowper) [4.22] - In the unavoidable absence of the honourable member for Parramatta, I have to express, on behalf of the Opposition, appreciation of the remarks of the Prime Minister on the occasion of the adjournment over the Christmas - season. The right honourable gentleman has referred to the assistance given the Government by the Opposition, I can only say that this session has unique in the history of this and most - other Parliaments. We met immediately after the outbreak of a war which has embroiled practically the whole civilized world ; and those charged with the adciate ministration had the right to rely on whole-souled support of the Opposition in all the many important measures rendered necessary by this great crisis. At such a time, there should be no such thing as party; we should all be imbued with the one object of doing everything that we consider necessary for the proholiday tection of the lives and property of people, and the best interests of the country generally. I am quite certain that, were the positions reversed, the members of the Labour party, as Opposition, would be equally willing anxious to render the Government of day every assistance in their power. Of course, the Opposition, in reference other measures which have been before us, have exercised their right of critiwhich cism, and we should have been wanting in - public spirit and in appreciation our duties as representatives had we been prepared to resist proposals which we have for a long time opposed, both of Australia. inside and outside Parliament. The opposing parties, however, have carried on their controversies without loss of nity to the Chamber as a whole, and there is no reason why we should not part with the best of feeling towards me one another. We shall, of course, continue to have differences of opinion on member certain measures, but I am sure we enjoyall have in view the one object, namely, the ultimate betterment of the e people. I endorse all that has been said and in regard to the valuable services rendered by the officers of the House. It is unfortunate that at almost every recess we have to regret the loss of one or I hope that the great strain, mental and physical, imposed upon honourable members is not a contributory cause to this loss. I sympathize with you personally, Mr . Speaker, in the onerous duties that you are called upon to perform, and regret that during the session you have not been in the fullest enjoyment of good health. On behalf of the Opposition, I express the hope that when Ave resume after the recess we shall find that you to have greatly benefited by the holiday. and In Mr Chanter, the Chairman of been Committees, we have one of the oldest parliamentarians in the House, and, with his knowledge of procedure, he has proved his capacity for the position he now holds. We all, I am sure, apprethe impartial and skilful services the rendered to Parliament by the clerks, the Hansard Staff, and others, and I hope they, too, will benefit by the recess. I observe that, as time goes on, there seems a tendency to make the recesses somewhat shorter, and last year, having regard to the election, we had practically no at all. It is not, however, with the the idea of holiday only that I speak, but now that the Commonwealth is enlarging its sphere of usefulness, it is becoming more than ever necessary that honourable an members should make themselves conand versant with the country, and that, of the course, can only be done when Parliament is not sitting. I trust that it may to be possible for representatives of the Government to visit my own district, has been somewhat neglected, in my opinion, and if they do, I shall be of glad to offer them what hospitality 1 not can, and assist them in gaining some knowledge of the resources of that; part",28
169,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I have to thank the digPrime Minister and the honourable member for Cowper for the kindly remarks they have made regarding the officers of the House, Mr Chanter, and myself.
