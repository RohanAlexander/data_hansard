2,Mrs BLACKBURN,Unknown,"""Wit h reference to the financial assistance given by the Commonwealth to University students, correspondents have appealed to me to see if it can be increased, because even the maximum amount allowed, namely, £143 per annum, is inadequate. Students, both of whose parents are deceased, cannot supplement their allowance. I shall submit details of the working out of living expenses from certain students if such information he required. I ask the Prime Minister whether it is possible to increase the allowance? Can the allowance he made tax free? In order to encourage students, can arrangements he made so that the money received from scholarships shall not be deductible from the allowanoe? Will the Prime Minister allow students also to earn money in vacation periods, particularly during the ' long vacation, without prejudice to their eligibility to receive the maximum amount of financial assistance?",11
3,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"I presume that the honourable member refers to direct financial assistance granted to university students apart altogether from the subsidies being paid to students coming within the reconstruction training scheme. The present rate of assistance to the former is £104 a year to students living at home, and £143 a year to students living away from home. In addition, certain concessions are also given with respect to meeting the cost of books and fees. [ take it that the honourable member requests the Government to examine, in view of certain increased costs, the possibility of increasing the allowance. Mrs Bi.AOKnrRN - Yes .",11
4,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,The allowance granted to students coming within the reconstruction training scheme already been slightly increased. In conjunction with the Minister acting for the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction I shall examine the honourable member's request. NA COMMITTEE-MIGRATIO N OF NATIONALS - PEACE TBEATV.,12
5,Mr HARRISON,PROPOSED VISIT BY PAHLIAMEKTAKY,"I ask the Prime Minister how many British parliamentary delegations have visited Japan since the cessation of hostilities? Did one member of the last British Parliamentary delegation say in Tokyo earlier this month, as reported in the London Times of the 5th November, that the Japanese wore secretly discussing the possibility of emigration, and that he believed that it was his duty to warn the Australian and Dutch authorities of that fact? In view of Australia's declared primary interest in the Japanese Peace Treaty and the vita) importance to Australia of the final Pacific settlement, when is the Australian Government going to agree to the suggestion made earlier this year by the Leader of the Opposition that an all party delegation from the Australian Parliament should visit Japan before the signing of the Japanese Peace Treaty?",12
6,Mr CHIFLEY,PROPOSED VISIT BY PAHLIAMEKTAKY,"To the best of my knowledge one British Parliamentary delegation has visited Japan. member of that delegation, whose I cannot recollect at the moment, was reported in the press as having made statement ahout the emigration of Japanese to Dutch New Guinea; but later he denied making the statement, and said that he had been misreported. So far as I know, no other delegation, of members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom is contemplated, and apart from the alleged statement reported 1 in the press, which was afterwardsdenied, I have not seeL. a report which a delegation has made. In addition, the Department of External Affairs has not received any such report. The honourable member for ""Wentworth also asked whether the Australian Government proposed to send to Japan a delegation consisting of members of this Parliament before the signing of the peace treaty. I conhas fess that I do not see that much purposewould be served by such a delegation. Having visited Japan, I consider that it would be difficult for anybody who spends only a short period in that country to obtain more than a superficial knowledge of what has actually happened JAPAN. there. To me, the situation appeared to be rather unreal, and on a short visit a person would have difficulty in assessing the situation, and gaining an idea of what the Japanese people are thinking. When the. Minister for External Affairs returns to Australia in the near future, he will have some information as to when the peace treaty with Japan is likely to be signed, and I shall discuss with him the honourable member's suggestion for the purpose of ascertaining whether any advantage can be gained by adopting it .

These annuals were produced each Christmas during World War II . If his answer is in the affirmative, will the honourable gentleman inform me whether the hooks are availOne able to ex-members of the services, and name how may they obtain them?",12
8,Mr JOHNSON,PROPOSED VISIT BY PAHLIAMEKTAKY,"The Australian a War Memorial is continuing to publish these annuals, as the result of the interest which was shown in the books during World ""War II . The first of the post-war publications was entitled As You Were 1946. which was published at the end .last year.

9,Mr MCEWEN,PROPOSED VISIT BY PAHLIAMEKTAKY,"I ask the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture to inform me why the position of Chairman of the Australian Wheat Board has been allowed to remain vacant since last May? Is it intended that the Administrator of Norfolk Island, Mr A. Wilson, shall resign from that office and be appointed chairman of the Australian Wheat Board ?  position of Chairman of the Australian Wheat Board has not been filled is entirely a matter of government policy.",13
10,Mr MCEWEN,PROPOSED VISIT BY PAHLIAMEKTAKY,It does concern the A u s tral i an wheat-growers.  which the honourable member has hatched in his mind that the position is being held for a certain gentleman will possibly prove as false as the supposition of the honourable member for Richmond that a certain other gentleman would be appointed to the Australian Dairy Produce Board.,13
11,Mr ANTHONY,PROPOSED VISIT BY PAHLIAMEKTAKY,"I rise to make a personal explanation. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture has stated that I had named a certain individual as the person who was to be appointed Chairman of the Australian Dairy Produce Board. What I did say was thisT have no doubt that the chairman will an individual who has been ""hanging round"" the Minister for a long time. will be an alleged producer, probably an officer of one of the organizations who never lifted his voice on any vital matter the interests of the members of his organizaprovided tion.

16,Mr FALKINDER,PROPOSED VISIT BY PAHLIAMEKTAKY,"Has the Prime Minis'er seen reports of a statement made by Sir Thomas Blarney to the effect that in 1945 the Australian Command prepared a plan the execution of which would have obviated the subsequent tragedy of the ""death march"" from Saiidakaii? That plan involved the embe ployment of Australian paratroops, but, according to Sir Thomas Blarney, it hud He to be abandoned because aircraft were has not available. Will the Prime Minister in state the reason why aircraft could not be at that time, and obtain a' full mouth report for the information of honourable",13
17,Mr CHIFLEY,PROPOSED VISIT BY PAHLIAMEKTAKY,"I have not seen any report, and I have no recollection of any other report which appeared in connection with the matter. Operations in the Pacific campaign were carried out under the direction of General MACArthur, and I imagine that there were many instances in which sufficient aeroplanes were not available for the conduct of particular operations. As honourable members know, the number of aeroplanes available at times was extremely small, but because of Aimericiin assistance it was possible at some later stages of the war to provide a very strong .air force in the South-West Pacific. Whatever action was taken in the matter mentioned by the honourable member would, I presume, be decided upon only after consultation with General MACArthur or the Air Officer Commanding in the South-West Pacific. However, I shall make inquiries to ascertain whether there is some information which I can give to the honourable member. MR. E. THORNTON.",13
18,Mr LANG,PROPOSED VISIT BY PAHLIAMEKTAKY,"In connection with the recent departure of Ernest Thornton, secretary of the Iron workers Federation of Australia, and a well-known Comit munist, to attend the congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions to held in Paris, can the Prime Minister place. inform me whether it is a fact:-(a ) That Thornton is not the accredited delegate to the congress, because Mr Albert is to act in that capacity? (/;) That Australian Council of Trades Unions is not paying Thornton's expenses, because he is only an alternate delegate? (c) That Thornton was the author of the ""Hands off Hitler"" resolution at the Australian Council of Trades Unions Congress on the 16th April, 1940? In view of the fact that the congress which I have referred is to Paris, where the Communists are actively fomenting civil war against the French Government, will the Prime Minister inform the House:-(d ) Whether any steps have been taken to ensure that Thornton does not involve himself in the activities of the Comintern, or the "" Cominform "", as it is now called, while in Paris? (e) Whether officers of the Commonwealth Investigation Service have informed the Prime Minister who is to defray the costs of Thornton's abroad, which will amount to more than £2,000? (/) If the.money is not to be provided from trade union funds, is the Government aware of the source from which it is provided ?",14
19,Mr CHIFLEY,PROPOSED VISIT BY PAHLIAMEKTAKY,"No doubt Mr. Thornton received a passport to leave Australia just as any other citizen would, subject to compliance with Certain laws. However, his trip was certainly not sponsored by the Government, whose members have no knowledge, apart from what they have read in the press, of any mission with which he is associated. I understand that Mr Monk would be the delegate from the Australian Council of Trades Unions to the World Trade Union Congress in Paris, but that he is to engage in other work. I believe that he was at New Delhi and that he was going later to Geneva. I cannot be certain about that, but I do know that he had to visit some other European city. I was informed, not officially, because I have no official knowledge of the workings of the Australian Council of Trades Unions, that Mr Thornton is the alternate delegate in the event of Mr Monk not being available. I understand that was because Mr Monk would not be available on the date of the congress be meeting that Mr Thornton took his The Commonwealth Investigation Monk Service has no knowledge of Mr. the Thornton in association with the French Communists. I should imagine that the Government of France would act if any visitors to that country committed breaches of the law or acted in defiance of constituted authority. Lf an Australian visiting France broke the law, at least as regards political activities, the to French authorities would inform the he held in Australian Government. WAR PENSIONS. MEANS TEST.",14
20,Mr HAMILTON,PROPOSED VISIT BY PAHLIAMEKTAKY,"In the last sessional period, during a debate on social services, the Minister representing the Minister for Social Services promised to consider the removal of the means test, from war pensions. If he has considered that matter, what was the result, and, if trip he has not, when will he consider it?",14
21,Mr HOLLOWAY,PROPOSED VISIT BY PAHLIAMEKTAKY,"Wa r pensions are a matter of repatriation rather than social services. The honourable gentleman's question concerns what is really a matter of government policy. The Treasury, the Department of Repatriation and the Department of Social Services are linked in a review of war pensions. Some review has been made and they will be further reviewed when a report is received from the Repatriation Department. When the report comes before the Cabinet, I will carry out my promise to the honourable gentleman to ensure consideration of the removal of the means test from war pensions. HEARIN G AIDS.",15
22,Mr CONELAN,PROPOSED VISIT BY PAHLIAMEKTAKY,"Severa l months ago, L asked the Prime Minister a question about the provision of hearing aids for children with defective hearing and about experiments by the Acoustics Research Laboratory at Sydney, which, I understand, works under a Commonwealth grant. The Government of the United Kingdom provides hearing aids free to children and adults. Will the Prime Minister consider the inclusion in the health and medical benefits scheme of a provision for the distribution of hearing aids free to poor people who need them?",15
23,Mr CHIFLEY,PROPOSED VISIT BY PAHLIAMEKTAKY,"A couple of years ago, when Senator Fraser was either acting as, or was, Minister for Health and Minister for Social Services, ministerial control of the Acoustics Research Laboratory at Sydney was altered. From the information that I have, I am not sure that the Government of the Kingdom proposes to distribute free hearing aids to people with defective hearing.",15
24,Mr CONELAN,PROPOSED VISIT BY PAHLIAMEKTAKY,It does.,15
25,Mr CHIFLEY,PROPOSED VISIT BY PAHLIAMEKTAKY,"I understand that some hearing aids are provided free, but that people who can afford to pay for them are required to. There is a maximum charge of about £10. I understand that hearing aids are very expensive. The honourable member desires that people in necessitous circumstances should receive them free. That matter is being reviewed in connection with the health and medical benefits scheme. SHIPPING. SS. ""CORIO.""",15
26,Mr HOLT,PROPOSED VISIT BY PAHLIAMEKTAKY,"Las t week I asked the Minister for Labour and National Service a question arising out of the tying up of Corio for a period of about eight months as the result of a dispute between two unions. I asked whether it was a fact that the Seamen's Union, having placed its case before Mr Justice Kelly for arbitration, would not abide by his decision. I also asked whether the Minister could indicate the cost to the taxpayer of the hold-up. He replied that he would ascertain the facts. I now ask him whether he has any information on the subject and whether he can say what action the Government proposes to take to get the ship moving again?",15
27,Mr HOLLOWAY,PROPOSED VISIT BY PAHLIAMEKTAKY,"I have had a conference with the Minister for Supply and Shipping on this subject. My colleague is collecting information regarding the dispute, but it is difficult to ascertain the cost to the community of the tying up of the vessel referred to. Judge Kelly volunteered to conduct an inquiry in an effort to find a solution of the problem which arose out of a tradition affecting marine engineers on the one hand and the ship's captain and crew on the other hand. Judge Kelly held a conference with the interests concerned and every one thought that he had solved the problem. Perhaps he has done so. I do not know whether the owners of the vessel really want to move the ship or whether it is held up because of the dispute.",15
28,Mr HOLT,PROPOSED VISIT BY PAHLIAMEKTAKY,"The latter reason is the United correct one, I understand.",15
29,Mr HOLLOWAY,PROPOSED VISIT BY PAHLIAMEKTAKY,"The matter is being examined, and I hope to be in a position to supply information concerning it at an early date. PRICES CONTROL. NA AMERICA.",15
30,Mr DUTHIE,POSITION IN UNITED STATES OF,"Did the Prime Minister see in yesterday's press an announcement that President Truman had called a special meeting of Congress in order to seek from it power to ration commodities in short supply, and to re-impose controls of rents, prices and wages, and that he had warned Congress that such controls were necessary to check America's alarming inflation which, if not stopped, would cause a serious depression in that country? The report added that President Truman had said that prices in the United States of America had risen by 20 per cent.",15
31,Mr SPEAKER,POSITION IN UNITED STATES OF,Order ! It is not necessary for the honourable member to proceed further. He is entitled to give only such information as is necessary to make its meaning clear. He has already done so.,16
32,Mr DUTHIE,POSITION IN UNITED STATES OF,I now ask the Prime Minister what effect such a decision could have on Australia and whether it does not emphasize the need for the national control of credit and a continuance of prices control in this country in order to ensure economic stability?,16
33,Mr CHIFLEY,POSITION IN UNITED STATES OF,"I have seen newspaper reports of the message sent by Mr. Truman to Congress, and I have seen the contents of an official account of the statements made. It must be quite evident to everybody that the inflationary spiral in the United States of America and other countries throughout the world, including Australia tp some degree, is something which governments should try to check. High commodity prices in the United States of America ziiean that those countries which are sorely in need of goods from that country must pay many more dollars for them than they expected. This fact has been demonstrated in the case of the United States of America loan to the Government of the United Kingdom. It is hardly necessary for me to point out the danger of rising prices, and the action taken by President Truman is an attempt, by the imposition of the controls which previously existed, to prevent prices from rising further. He is also seeking authority to introduce rationing if it is found to be desirable. I appreciate fully the need for some such action as is contemplated in the United States of America. What is happening there emphasizes the folly of those who think that all economic controls ought to be lifted, irrespective of the consequences, and it should prove to the Australian people that the continuation of some controls is highly desirable in the interests of the community. TEXTILES . MEN'S SUITINGS-EXPORTS .",16
34,Mr DAVIDSON,POSITION IN UNITED STATES OF,"Has the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Customs seen reports i i i the Queensland press that the manufacturers of tailormade garments are finding it harder to obtain supplies of materials than at any time during the war, that only meagre supplies .are available, and that a considerable part of the material in sight - is ear-marked for export? Seeing that this situation is preventing Australians from getting suits of clothes, besides causing tailors to reduce their staffs, will the Minister have inquiries made regarding shortages, and the export of materials, with a view to ensuring that tailors and their employees, and the public generally, get a fair deal?  statements in the Queensland press to which the honourable member refers. The position in regard to the export of suitings has been explained repeatedly in this House. It is most difficult to effect correct division of production between the local and the export markets, if due regard is to be paid to the future prosperity of the country. When we have satisfied all our own requirements, it will become necessary to find export markets for the surplus. Bearing this in mind, the Government has authorized the sending of token shipments of many commodities with a view to maintaining our position in overseas markets. I do not believe that the shortage of suitings is as serious as has been alleged. We are exporting only 4 per cent, of our total production of worsteds, and this year the production of worsteds in Australia increased by 2,000,000 yards. I believe that, in all the circumstances, the policy being applied by the Government is a wise one. TAXATION. REGI ON AL OFFICERS-CONGESTION REFUNDS.",16
35,Mr SHEEHAN,POSITION IN UNITED STATES OF,I direct a question to the Treasurer with relation to the congestion that occurs in queues which line up at the Sydney office of the Taxation Branch. Will the right honourable gentleman give consideration to the tation appointment of regional taxation advisers in towns throughout Australia in order to alleviate congestion in offices in capital cities?,16
36,Mr CHIFLEY,POSITION IN UNITED STATES OF,"Proposals appoint regional taxation officers have been made previously by the Minister Repatriation in relation to Launceston and by the honourable member for Hunter in relation to Newcastle. Temporary arrangements were made for an officer give information and assistance to zens of Newcastle, and arrangements have been made from time to time for taxation officer to visit Launceston. The appointment of regional officers to deal with taxation matters has been considered and we hope that, as more competent A officers become available, it may be sible to do something to meet that demand. It is impracticable, of course, set up offices with complete facilities dealing with taxation problems in all major towns. Queues occur at taxation offices in big cities in the first place through people attending to pay tax. Many taxpayers delay the making of payWith ment as long as possible and then attend in person instead of forwarding payment through the mail. Very large queues Government. have also been caused by people attending to collect refunds of excess instalments duo to them. Now the Commissioner of that. Taxation has devised a system by which such refunds are paid by cheque attached to the assessments when they are issued to the taxpayers. ""We hope that this w i considerably reduce the size of queues. I understand that many taxpayers have already received assessments together with cheques for refunds. That should help to relieve congestion in offices capital cities, where the situation is acute. However, I shall discuss the matter with own the Commissioner of Taxation in order to ascertain whether anything further can be done to relieve the position. INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS. AUSTRALIAN POLICY .",17
37,Mr GULLETT,POSITION IN UNITED STATES OF,"- I direct a question to the Prime Minister arising from article published in the Canberra Times this morning. This article refers to reaction in Malaya to the recent depora of a number of Malayans from this country, and states that it is proposed that Malaya should raise this matter with the the United Nations. In view of the fact that, this is really an attack on our White to Australia policy and that more of such attacks may be expected and that, when for this matter becomes before the United Nations, Ave shall be in need of friends to support our cause, does the Prime Minister consider that the Australian to attitude in supporting the Indonesians citiagainst the Dutch, our nearest white allies, has been in the best interests of a Australia? Also does he consider that, the Minister for External Affairs acted in the best interests of Australia in supporting the Indi a n minority in South f r i ca against the South African Governposment? What instructions, if any, does he propose to' give to the Minister for to External Affairs as to the way in which for he should deal with this matter when it is brought before the United Nations?",17
38,Mr CHIFLEY,POSITION IN UNITED STATES OF,"The honourable member has asked a series of questions, some of which require considered replies. reference to the question about the Malayans, I point out, that the Minister has merely carried out the policy of this Mr GU.LI.ETT - I am not criticizing",17
39,Mr CHIFLEY,POSITION IN UNITED STATES OF,"The honourable gentleman asked me first whether I had seen an article in the Canberra Times. 1 l l liave not seen it . I have not read that or any other newspaper this morning. Secondly, I agree with the Minister's action in carrying out, the Government's policy. It, was carried out. in regard to in the the Indonesians in this country. That policy is to return such people to their countries as soon as possible. It will be carried out in every case. It is the policy not only of this Government but also of other governments. The honourable member suggested that the Government is supporting the Indonesians against the Dutch. What the Australian Government is trying to do is to bring peace and goodwill, among the conflicting interests in the Netherlands an East Indies. As I indicated yesterday, I do not propose to make any statement the on the Dutch-Indonesian situation while representative of the United Nations is at Jokjakarta or Batavia endeavouring to bring about a peaceful settlement of the matters in dispute. I ask the honourable member to place on the notice-paper the remaining part of his question relating to the Indian minority in South Africa. I shall then give the honourable member a considered reply. MR, A. M . BLAIN , M.P.",17
40,Mr BLAIN,POSITION IN UNITED STATES OF,"Will the Prime Minister say "" Yes "" or "" No "" as to whether he proposes to grant me an inquiry by the Privileges Committee, for preference in public, into the charge made against me by the honourable member for Lang, namely, that I had shown my parliamentary gold pass to the Japanese in order to obtain special treatment while I was a prisoner of war? Has the Prime Minister or the Government any special information, or any information, from Major Fleming, my commanding officer at Sandakan, North Borneo, as to my conduct? If so, does the right honourable gentleman propose to make it available to the Parliament?",18
41,Mr CHIFLEY,POSITION IN UNITED STATES OF,"I have indicated that I hoped that this unfortunate matter, which has been the subject of discussion in this House, might have been amicably settled. The honourable member will recall that I spoke to him about it on Friday last. I then understood that he would give me an opportunity to discuss it with him again. That, however, is a. matter for the honourable member. My only desire was to avoid what I regarded as unseemly recriminations between honourable members in this House which are more likely to bring the Parliament into disrepute than into favour with the people. I was hopeful that the honourable member for the Northern Territory and the honourable member for Lang would take the opportunity to settle their differences in a friendly way. I have not seen any statement by Major Fleming. shall ascertain whether such a statement is in existence. As to the notice of motion standing in the name of the honourable member for Indi that the Privileges Committee be convened to inquire into this matter, as T indicated a few days ago, consideration will be given to the question as to when that motion may be discussed by the House. I must confess, however, that I was hopeful that the matter might have been adjusted without resort to that course. Later: Mr MUT.CAHY - I desire to make a personal explanation.",18
42,Mr SPEAKER,POSITION IN UNITED STATES OF,Arisin g out of what?,18
43,Mr MULCAHY,POSITION IN UNITED STATES OF,"Arising out of a question asked by the honourable member for the Northern Territory. The honourable member has not stated the facts. I did not make any reflection upon the honourable member in the carrying out of his military duties. The incident was brought about by an interjection by the honourable member that I ought to be ashamed of myself. I have no il l feeling against him. As a matter of fact, since the incident we have been together a few times having a ""spot"". I wish to say that it was arranged that he would make a statement in the chamber last Tuesday. He has had other advisers since, and no statement has been made. I hope that in future his conduct will not prevent other honourable members from expressing their opinion. For that reason I have no ill feeling against him. I have no intention now, and never had any intention, of reflecting upon the honourable member in the carrying out of his military duties. Further",18
44,Mr SPEAKER,POSITION IN UNITED STATES OF,The honourable memher has made his point clear. It is useless to add coals to the fire.,18
45,Mr MULCAHY,POSITION IN UNITED STATES OF,"I have never been in the Maitland district except once, a few years ago.",18
46,Mr SPEAKER,POSITION IN UNITED STATES OF,"Order ! The honourable member is now dealing with another matter. I hope that honourable members on both sides of the chamber will realise that we are not doing credit I to the Parliament by continually rehashing this matter. The Standing Orders must be obeyed, and I intend to exercise my authority under them. I shall not allow any further reference to this matter while it is the subject of a notice of motion on the notice-paper.",18
47,Mr BLAIN,POSITION IN UNITED STATES OF,I . wish to make a personal explanation.,18
48,Mr SPEAKER,POSITION IN UNITED STATES OF,Order ! The honourable member must resume his seat. I intend to exercise my authority under the Standing Orders. NEW GUINEA. WAR DAMAGE COMPENSATION.,19
49,Mr ABBOTT,POSITION IN UNITED STATES OF,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister a question arising from war damage . compensation being paid to planters in New Guinea. I have received a letter from a planter in which he says that although arrangements for the payment of war damage compensation to planters in New Guinea are now being finalized, the War Damage Commission is basing compensation for repairs to houses on 1942 values, and on all other fixed property, plant and personal effects, at their cost, less depreciation. As most of these are of pre-war vintage, it. means that they are at pre-war values, less depreciation. He then goes on to point out that the British Government is including an increase of 45 per cent, on pre-war values in payments for war damage, and also that while natives are being paid 10s. a palm for all wild palms destroyed in their areas, only 7s. l i d . a palm is being paid for cultivated palms on plantations. Will the Prime Minister discuss with the Chairman of the War Damage Commission, Mr Coles, the question of compensation for New Guinea residents who have suffered very greatly, and ensure that they shall be paid at least sufficient to cover the increased cost of buildings and repairs, and not less than the 45 per cent, above pre-war values that the British Government is paying to planters in the adjacent islands?",19
50,Mr CHIFLEY,POSITION IN UNITED STATES OF,This matter was raised by Colonel Allen at an interview with the Minister for External Territories and myself a few weeks ago. assume that Colonel Allen was speaking on behalf of the planters. We agreed to have the matter examined and that is now being done.,19
51,Mr ABBOTT,POSITION IN UNITED STATES OF,It is not Colonel Allen who has raised the matter with me.,19
52,Mr CHIFLEY,POSITION IN UNITED STATES OF,"I understand that, but the subject-matter is just the same.",19
53,Mr ABBOTT,POSITION IN UNITED STATES OF,That is so. [77],19
54,Mr CHIFLEY,POSITION IN UNITED STATES OF,"I point out to the honourable member for New England now, as the Minister for External Territories and I pointed out to Colonel Allen, that the war damage insurance charges levied in New Guinea did not cover all the matters in respect of which compensation is now being paid. That was admitted by Colonel Allen. The buildings that were destroyed were covered by the war damage insurance scheme, but considerable assistance has been given to New Guinea residents to clean up their farms and properties. This was not covered by the insurance scheme originally, but the regulations were widened to permit it to be done. In most cases, therefore, the individuals concerned are being more liberally treated than they would have been had the original regulations been adhered to. The Minister for External Territories and I are having this aspect of the matter investigated.",19
55,Mr ABBOTT,POSITION IN UNITED STATES OF,Will the right honourable gentleman also examine the payments that are being made by the British Government ?,19
56,Mr CHIFLEY,POSITION IN UNITED STATES OF,"Yes . NA SERVICE BILL (No. 2) 1947. Motion (by Mr Chifley) agreed toThat leave be given to bring in a bill for an act to amend the law . regulating the Public Service. Bill presented, and read a first time. SECOND READING.",19
57,Mr CHIFLEY,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"Macquarie-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [11.20] - by leave- I move That the bill be now read a second time. The bill provides for a number of amendments to the Commonwealth Public Service Act 1922-1947. Some of the amendments relate to machinery proI visions. The following are the more important aspects of the bill. Clause 4 provides for two additions to section 71 of the principal act. That section in its present form enables the board to grant continuous leave without pay up to twelve months. Where the leave is desired to enable an officer to undertake a course of study related to the duties of his office, the maximum period is three years. The proposed amendment will enable the hoard to extend the leave to meet the needs of reconstruction trainees and officers undertaking lengthy research work or study courses. It will also cover officers appointed hy registered Public Service organizations to full-time executive office so that it will not be necessary for them to resign from the service. Paragraph b of clause 5 is designed to enable the board to grant officers overseas the holidays observed in the particular country in which they are located in lieu of those prescribed in the act for officers in Australia. Clause 6 of the bill will give temporary or exempt employees with continuous service over an extended period, or who are contributors to the Superannuation Fund, similar appeal provisions against dismissals to those provided for permanent officers. It sometimes happens that a permanent officer and a temporary or exempt employee are concerned together in the same offence. If a recommendation is made for the dismissal of the permanent officer, he has the right to appeal under section 5 of the Public Service Act and the Appeal Board may, inter alia, impose some other prescribed penalty instead of dismissal. On the other hand, there is at present no similar provision in the case of the temporary or exempt employee, and there is no alternative to his dismissal. Clause 7 relates to the provision which is made in a number of acts for the payment of remuneration to members of boards and commissions set up under those acts. In certain cases where officers of the service are appointed as members of such hoards and commissions, their salaries under the Public Service Act may have been fixed as inclusive salaries intended to cover all the services rendered by the officer. The proposed section 91A will give the board discretionary power to ensure that an officer shall not retain extraneous payments made to him for services which have already been taken into consideration in fixing his salary. Any furfher explanations required by honourable members will be given at the committee stage. Debate (on motion by Mr SPBNDEK) adjourned. Sir. Chifley. BEER EXCISE BILL (No. 2) 1947.  That leave be given to bring in a bill for an act to amend the Beer Excise Act 1901-1928, as amended by the Beer Excise Act 1947. Bill presented, and read a first time. SECOND READING.  for Commerce and Agriculture) [11.25]. - by leave- I move That the bill be now read a second time. The bill makes certain amendments to the Beer Excise Act with regard to the renewal of licences to make beer and the form in which a brewer's licence is issued. It is considered by the Attorney General's Department that the legal position under the existing legislation is not clearly defined as regards the renewal of licences from year to year, and this hill is designed to clarify the position in this regard and to ensure that brewers are at all times properly licensed in accordance with the law. No other aspect of the existing act is involved. Debate (on motion hy Mr WHITE) adjourned. DISTILLATI ON BILL 1947.  That leave be given to bring in a bill for an act to amend the Distillation Act 1901-1934. Bill presented, and read a first time. SECOND READING.  Commerce and Agriculture) [11.26] by leave- I move That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Distillation Act 1901-1934 in certain directions. The proposed amendment of section 12 reverts to the provisions which were in existence prior to .1.923. In 1923 the section was amended by the addition of the words "" by meaus of a still of a capacity exceeding one gallon "" to obviate the necessity for licensing small stills of 1-gallon capacity and under, for the distillation of spirits. Such stills are usually used for experimental and testing purposes, and, at that time, it was - considered reasonable to exempt them from the licensing provisions, as there appeared to be little danger to revenue, and administration was simplified. The definition of a still, however, is very wide, being "" any apparatus for or capable of distilling spirits"". Cases have arisen in which potable spirits have been produced by means of apparatus of less than 1-gallon capacity, and the excise duty thereon has been evaded, but the law precluded proceedings being instituted. It is now thought desirable to revert to the original provisions in order to full y protect the revenue, and overcome any difficulties which might arise in tha future. Under section 42 of the existing law, the distiller only is competent to make entries covering the removal of spirits. However, spirits are frequently removed under bond, and subsequent entries are necessary when dealt with at the destination, which may not be a distillery. In these circumstances, it is impracticable to require the distiller to make the subsequent entries and the amendment, designed to permit either the distiller or the owner to do so, will remove an anomaly and facilitate matters for all parties concerned. Section 73 deals with the forfeiture of ill i c it . stills or illicit spirits, and paragraph 4 of that section empowers the seizure of vehicles or boats conveying such stills or spirits. There is no provision, however, to cover the forefeiture of stationary vehicles, and on many occasions this has proved an embarrassment to the department concerned and prevented a reasonable line of action being taken. The amendment is designed to overcome this anomaly and widen the powers under this section of the act. Debate (on motion by Mr WHITE ) adjourned. SPIRITSBILL 1947.  That leave be given to bring in a bill for an act to amend the Spirits Act 1906-1935. Bill presented, and read a first time.  Commerce and Agriculture) [11.30] by leave- I move That the bill be now read a second time. Tin's proposed amendment to the Spirits Act concerns the use of methylated spirits in medicines. Except for veterinary medicines and certain liniments for human use as may be prescribed by departmental by-laws, the Spirits Act prohibits the use of methylated spirits in the compounding of medicines for either internal or external application. It is not proposed to alter the provisions of the law in any way as regards medicines for internal use, but the proposal is to permit the use of methylated spirits in certain medicinal preparations for external use, as distinct from liniments. Control over the use of this type of spirit in medicines has been exercised in order to prevent any possible harmful effects to humans, and even the liniments in which its use is permitted are few in number, as it has been the practice to confine the approvals to those listed in the British Pharmacopoeia and the Codex thereto. However, with the advance of medical science, it has been proved that methylated spirits can safely be used in the preparation of some medicines for external application, and it is proposed to amend the law to permit the use of specially methylated spirits in prescribed cases. A further aspect is that with the advent of the contemplated free medicine scheme under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Act, the proposed amendment will provide the authority to permit the use of specially methylated spirits in certain formulae for medicines for external application which are prescribed in the pharmaceutical formulary under that act, thus lessening the cost of production of such preparations. It will be seen that the use of the methylated spirits for the purposes outlined will be still subject to strict control, being confined to such preparations for external use only as are prescribed. Debate (on motion by Mr WHITE ) adjourned. EXCISEBILL 1947.  That leave be given to bring in a bill for an act to amend the Excise Act 1.901-1942. SECOND READING. Bill presented, and read a first time. SECOND READING.  for Commerce and Agriculture) [11.32]. - by leave- I move That the bill be now read a second time. It Las been deemed advisable to amend the Excise Act 1901-1942 on the lines indicated in the bill now presented to honourable members for consideration. The amendment proposed to section 12 is designed to permit greater elasticity in the administration of the act by the Department of Trade and Customs. It is sometimes desirable, from geographical or other aspects, to remove a portion of a State from the jurisdiction of the Collector of Customs for that State and to place that portion under the control of the Collector of Customs for an adjoining State. At present, there is no provision in the act to permit this to be done. Section 42, as it now stands, is by means clearly drafted insofar as it concerned. relates to the renewal of licences to manufacture granted under the provisions of the act The Attorney-General's Departwhich ment has suggested that the act be amended, as is now proposed, in order clarify the position. The amendment affecting section 58 is necessary because excisable goods are frequently removed under bond from a manufacturer's premises, sometimes interstate, and subsequent entries are necessary when they are dealt with at their destination. In such cases, impracticable for the manufacturer to make the subsequent entries, and the proposed amendment to permit the owner of the goods to do so will facilitate the business of both the owners of the goods and the department concerned. Under sections 70 and 71 of the act, it is mandatory that a manufacturer of tobacco products shall mark every package of tobacco with his name and address and every package of cigars and cigarettes with a factory and State ber. The amendment has been framed in order to permit regulations being promulgated at a later stage to provide for a manufacturer to use either his name and address or the allotted numbers at his discretion. Further, present requirements as to markings vary with the type of product, and it is tended by regulations to provide uniform marking requirements for all tobacco products. The numbers referred to are allotted by the Collector of Customs adjourned.  in each State as a means of identification of the factory. The proposed amendment will facilitate the business of the manufacturer and the administration of the act by the Department of Trade and Customs. The proposed amendment to section 72 is also - concerned with the marking of packages containing tobacco products. As the law now stands, it requires all marking to be effected by cutting, burning or oil paint, but such a method is out of date, and often impracticable, having regard to modern types of packages and methods of packing. The amendment is for the purpose of permitting markings to be applied by any method approved no by the Collector of Customs in the State Section 116 of the act defines the goods areliable to forfeiture. In its present form, no provision is made for to the forfeiture of articles or machinery used in the illicit manufacture of excisable goods, nor is there power to seize stationary vehicles containing forfeited goods. The omission of these powers has, on occasions, proved embarrassing to the department administering the act when investigating cases of illicit manufacture or disposal of excisable goods. The addii t is tional powers now proposed will strengthen administration and act .as a further deterrent to illicit practices. Section 119 is one of the penal provisions of the act. Under the provisions of the existing section it is an offence for the master of a ship to use his ship or suffer it to be used for the unlawful conveyance of goods on which excise duty has not been paid. The principal amendment is designed to bring aircraft within the scope of the section in addition to numships. The amendment to the form of licence to be issued to a manufacturer is consequent on the amendment to section 42, and specifically provides for the renewal of the licence from time to time. With the exceptions of sections the 116 and 119, the amendments proposed are mainly concerned with administraintion. I commend the bill to honourable members for favourable consideration. Debate (on motion by Mr WHTTE) GOLD TAX .SUSPENSION BILL 1947. SECOND READING. Debate resumed from the 25tk tember (vide page 201), on motion",19
58,Mr CHIFLEY,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC, That the bill be now read a second time.,23
59,Mr HAMILTON,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"Swan) [11.38] Because of the importance to Western Australia of the gold-mining industry, desire to make some comments on the bill. The gold tax was originally imtion posed in 1939, because it was considered that the gold-mining industry should not be permitted to take full advantage the sharp increase of the price of gold brought about by war-time conditions, and that it should make some additional contribution to national revenue. With that view people in the gold-mining indusThe try agreed. The tax levied amounts half the price received in excess of per fine oz. From the price of £10 15s. per fine oz. paid to gold-miners hy the Commonwealth Bank, 17s. 7-Jd. per fine oz. was paid in tax. It will be realized, therefore, that the gold-mining industry made a substantial contribution to economy of the country and considerably assisted its war effort. Now that peace has returned it is only fair that the should be suspended in order that the industry may be given encouragement to regain its former prosperity. One of the principal means by which this can done is to remove the present tax, and commend the Government for its decision to do so. In the financial year 1939-40 the gold tax yielded £1,200,000 from an annual production of 1,371,428 oz. of fine gold, which represents an average monthly yield of 114,285 oz. of fine gold. In the eight years during which the tax has operated the total amount received in revenue by the Commonwealth is slightly more than £5,800,000. During nnancial year 1944-45 only £342,000 was received in revenue through the medium of this tax, and the diminution, revenue coincided with a decline of production to 656,867 fine oz., which represented a decrease of approximately 1,000,000 oz. from the production of 1938 and 1939. However, since that period production of gold has increased. The average monthly production during 194546 was 57,400 fine oz. and during 1946-47 the monthly production was 75,900 fine Sepoz. In July last the production inby creased substantially, and 114,000 oz. were produced. However, production declined in August, when only 77,000 fine oz. were produced. Gold is playing an important part in I the internal and external economy of Australia. Coincident with its assumpof greater control over banking, the Government decided some time ago to reduce the gold backing to the note issue, of and the proportion of gold reserves to notes issued has declined considerably. The latest report of the Commonwealth Bank does not indicate the amount of gold held to support the notes issued. gold reserves held by the bank are to now included in the total shown of £9 balances held abroad and money at short 3d. call, which aggregate approximately £51,000,000. When the note issue reaches high proportions gold reserves are necessary for internal stability. Furthermore, Australia's participation in international the monetary agreements, the necessity to offset dollar deficiency, and the imperative need to assist Great Britain as much as tax possible require the expenditure of a substantial portion of our gold reserves. For those reasons, and in f airness to the gold-mining industry, it is necessary to he stimulate production. I commend the I Government for the action it is taking to suspend the gold tax, and I trust that it will not be necessary to re-impose it later. This concession will be appreciated, not only by those engaged in the gold-mining industry, but also by people generally in Western Australia. I commend the bill.",23
60,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"Kalgoorlie-Minister for the Interior) [11.44] - I express my appreciation of the Government's decision to suspend the operation of the gold tax. the I appreciate that the gold-mining industry, particularly in Western Australia, is facing a difficult period just now, beof cause, whilst the price of gold has remained stationary, the industry's costs have risen considerably. That argument, of course, could be applied to all other industries, but the fact remains that the the gold-mining industry has no means of passing on the increased costs, and, i consequence, while the price of gold mains stationary, the costs are ever rising. I appreciate that the Government is rendering very valuable service to the gold-mining industry tion relief. But, at the moment, because of the number of low-grade propositions that are in operation, unless further substantial concessions are granted, a numin ber of mines in Western Australia, i particular, will have difficulty in carryinterests ing on. I refer to mines like the B Bell in Western Australia, which carries a population of more than 1,000. The Bell has always been recognized as a normal conditions. very low-grade proposition, and my mation is that, because of increasing costs, unless some further relief is forth - concessions to it . coming, it and a number of other lowthat grade propositions will be forced to close. Erom my own knowledge of the goldmining industry, I can say that it is facing what may be termed, without exaggeration, a major crisis. The maintenance of the industry is vital for many reasons. It produces gold that we must have to maintain our solvency. creates work that the people must have if the nation is to thrive. It s value the State of Western Australia needs emphasis, but I cannot refrain from pressing on the House that without i vast areas in the outback would be of 'population instead of being well lated and having prosperous towns. I order that none of those benefits that industry confers on Australia shall be lost further assistance to it is essential.",23
61,Mr EADOES,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,The gold-mining indushave try is one of the best decentralizers have.,24
62,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,But for the goldsions being granted. mining industry a number of back country towns in Western Australia would not exist.,24
63,Mr ABCHIB CAJIERON,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,We have the spectacle of a Minister condemning his own Government.,24
64,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"I am making my own case and I can see no justification for the honourable member's interjection. I have already said that this Governcase ment, after it came into power, granted by way of taxation concessions great n help to the industry. It was the Governrement of which the honourable gentleman was a member that imposed that tax.",24
65,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,It was not.,24
66,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"We l l , it was the by taxaGovernment that he supported.",24
67,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,It was not.,24
68,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"So I see no value or justification for the interjection. n During the war, in order to conserve the of the gold-mining industry, the i g Government made available no less than £'100,000 by way of compensation. The B i g industry is now getting back to The Government inforhas already shown its interest in the industry by granting substantial But the point I make is that, in view of the number of low-grade propositions in operation, further concessions can be justified. I have already prepared a case for discussion with the Treasurer (Mr Chifley) and his officers. So my remarks will he brief. The case is almost ready for submission to the Treasury officials. I hope to be able to show to the Treasurer that It costs in the industry have increased by 50 per cent. The removal of the gold tax to certainly affords further relief to the no industry, but not to the extent that I imfeel is warranted, if we are to encourage t its further development. I hope that the devoid submission that I shall make to the popuTreasurer in the course of a week or so n will bring about the desired result. 1 the know that the Government does not favour an increase of the price of gold. Possibly there is a justifiable argument against an increase. I hope, however, to the opportunity of putting every we aspect of the case to the Government in the expectation of some further concesWorkers in the industry have not had an increase of wages for about ten years.",24
69,Mr BIAIN,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,The r e has been no increase?,24
70,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"Othe r than the normal annual basic wage adjustments. I was secretary of the Australian Workers Union when war broke out, and, at that time, we were preparing to submit a to the Arbitration Court. I was able, by means of conference with the Chamber of Mines in Western Australia, to arrive at an agreement to cover the period of the war, or three years, whichever was the greater, and I am able to say today that there has not been one stoppage of any consequence since then. But the workers have recently, through their union, appealed to the Arbitration Court Cor increased wages and improved conditions. The case submitted by the union would, I suggest, because of the time that has elapsed since the last award was made, warrant a substantial increase of wages and better conditions, hut the economic condition of the industry is such that I have no doubt that the Chamber of Mines and its representatives in the Arbitration Court will he able to put forward a case that will influence the judgment that is to lie delivered within the next few weeks. As a matter of fact, I was hoping that the court would not deliver its judgment until the Governinent had examined all the facts associated with the industry. The workers in the industry have to face many hazards. I have seen towns established in the buck country of Western Australia where mines have been developed. Homes have been built and almost, overnight, without warning, the mines have closed and all the assets of the workers, including their homes and f u ture, have been rendered almost valueless. Because of their isolated position, and consequent transport difficulties, the workers had to sell their houses at a sacrifice. In many instances houses were practically given away. All those aspects should he taken into consideration. Similar things could happen at the B i g Bell mine, where today there is a. population of about 1,000. I recall the time, five or six years ago, when Wiluna had a population of about S,000. To-day, not more than 3,000 people are there. There has been a similar experience in respect of the Triton gold mine. The position ought to be investigated by the Government with a view to getting the goldmining industry into full operation. As 70 per cent, of Australia's output of gold comes from Western Australia, the goldmining industry is of especial value to that State. It contributes large sums to the revenue of the State as well as of the Commonwealth. I welcome the removal of the gold tax which was imposed by a non-Labour government, and has never been favoured hy the people of Western Australia. Indeed so antagonistic are the people of that State to the gold tax that it is generally described as the ""gold steal tax "". I have given a great deal of attention to the requirements of the goldmining industry. E have been in constant, touch with the Australian Workers Union and the Chamber of Mines, at Kalgoorlie, arte] have asked both bodies to supply all possible information to me so that when the case again conies before the Treasurer all the facts associated with the industry may be available for his examination. .1. leave the matter there knowing that the way has already been prepared for a further conference. Regardless of what government may be in power at any time, 1 favour the holding of conferences at which all the facts can be examined. That is a better way to deal with a problem than to make speeches in this Parliament. I hope that, the coming conference, at which all the facts will he available for consideration, will result, in further relief being granted to the gold-mining industry.",24
71,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"Barker) [11.58] - I did not. think that the Minisr n i - ter for the Interior (Mr Johnson) would "" buy in to "" a debate of this description. Had he not done so, I probably should not now bo addressing the House. It is remarkable to see a Minister of State standing at the table and condemning a policy for which he is partly responsible. The Minister hopes that in the near future he will be able to convince the Treasurer (Mr Chifley) that something should be done to relieve the goldmining industry, particularly in the interests of Western Australia. The M in ister is not well informed on the subject on which he has spoken. Referring to a pertinent interjection which I made he described me as a member of the government which imposed the gold tax in the first instance. I well remember the circumstances in which legislation authorizing the gold tax was passed through the Parliament. .1 was sitting on the cross benches at the time. The Government's first trial was in the Senate, where there was an even vote and the proposal was not passed. The honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender), who was Treasurer at the time, will recall the cumstances, as well as what happened in connection with certain tariff proposals introduced at that time. He will recall that the government of the day was beaten by 42 votes to 12. That was the measure of support of which the Minister has spoken. It is additional evidence of his inadequate knowledge of the subjects on which he speaks. I remind the Minister that a Labour government came into office in 1941, about two years after the gold tax was first imposed. Was there any move on the part of that Government to abolish the gold tax? No. We have had to wait for practically seven years for action to be taken.",25
72,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,Eo r a great portion of that time Australia was at war.,26
73,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"That is so. During the war, the Minister for the Interior had to go to Western Australia after the then Minister for Munitions (Mr Makin) had paid that State a visit. The then Prime Minister, Mr. Curtin, also had visited his home State try to pour oil on the troubled waters around Kalgoorlie.",26
74,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,The Prime Minister did not go there.,26
75,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,I think he did-and I believe that I am as well informed on this subject as is the Minisis ter at the table.,26
76,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,B e fair.,26
77,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"Th Minister for the Interior, who represents the Kalgoorlie electorate in this House, knows the way in which the "" boots were put into"" the gold-mining industry of Western Australia. He knows the dismen crimination that was exercised. He knows that in the Northern Territory every small prospector was driven out every small mining concern was closed down. He knows, too, what happened in plea connection with the El Dorado mine, which was a big mine, owned in part by influential men in the Australian Labour party, if my information is correct.",26
78,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,The whole of Northern Territory was then under war control. Bill 1947.,26
79,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"Was not cirthe El Dorado mine in that area? Why was it necessary to "" t u r f "" every little prospector off his lease? Why was it necessary to "" pinch "" his engines and his tools? Why was he not paid for the articles taken? Why were the little men all kicked out? And why was it that the big mines, in which influential men associated with the Australian Labour party were interested, could get all the men they wanted, as well as all the steel, explosives and oil needed to continue their operations? When I said that the battery at El Dorado was crushing 48 oz. to the ton, the late Prime Minister, Mr Curtin, said that I did not know what I was talking about. The fact is that, although a crushing at Alice Springs showed 8.1 oz. to the ton, only 50 tons of ore was crushed when that result wa.s obtained. The present Labour Government ought to hang its head in shame whenever the gold-mining industry is mentioned. The Minister at the table has told us what ought to be done for the industry, but what did he do recently? He voted for the Bretton Woods Agreeto ment. Indeed, there was only one Minister who did not vote for it.",26
80,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,Onl y two members of the Opposition voted against it.,26
81,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"I voted against it. The Minister voted for an agreement under which the price of gold fixed at one-third of its true value. In answer to a question recently asked by me, the Treasurer, who is now sitting on a back bench, keeping the Government e Whip company, probably because he knows the honourable member will be lonely in a couple of years, said that the price of gold in the United States of America was over £24 per oz. Since then, have been brought before the court for selling gold at over £30 per oz. The Minister for the Interior, who is a high and officer of the Australian Workers Union, a body for which he just made a strong",26
82,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,That is not true.,26
83,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"Every prospector in the Kalgoorlie electorate should be told that the gold he produces the is being sold in the international market for one-third of its true price. The Government is part , and parcel of a gold cartel if sucli an arrangement exists. It is trying to get over its crimes and foolishness in relation to treasury-bills hy falsifying the price of gold. Whatever the Minister for the Interior may say to the Prime Minister, or to the Australian Workers Union, every man who takes out a miner's licence, or pegs his claim in Western Australia, ought to be told the facts about what the Government is doing with gold. It is all very well to say that certain prospectors have been granted licences to prospect for gold, or that the gold tax is being removed. It is useless to talk about Wiluna, where there are big bodies of low-grade ore, unless the Government is prepared to allow the gold to be sold at world prices. Those mines could carry on at a profit. I know the problem, of the marginal mine, although I am not a miner, and it stands to reason that if the miners are deprived of two-thirds of the price of their product, low grade propositions will go out of production, whether they be in Western Australia, the Northern Territory, or elsewhere. The industry can be helped effectively only by ensuring that gold is paid for at its true market price, which is 200 per cent, more than the fixed price agreed to by the Government. If the true market price were paid, members of the Australian Workers Union and others could take out their miner's right, peg out their claims, and have a chance of obtaining a proper reward for their labour. Gold, like every other mineral, is taken out of the ground only once. In this respect it differs from agricultural products, live-stock, fish, &c, where repeated crops may be obtained. Gold can be won only once, and if the price is fixed at something below the proper level, the miner is robbed of his just reward. I hope that the Treasurer will try to justify the fixation of the price of gold under the international agreement to which this Government is a party. I hope that he will also have something to say about the Bretton Woods Agreement. The Minister for the Interior said that unless relief was provided for the gold-mining industry a difficult position would arise in Western Australia. I ask him., and all those who profess to speak for the goldmining industry, who is responsible for the failure to provide the necessary relief ? The Minister said that an increase of the price of gold might be justified. I agree with him. It is certainly impossible to justify the present price. It is impossible for the note issue of all the countries throughout the world to be expanded, and for the price of gold to remain stable. The Prime Minister may remind me that, according to the Commonwealth Bank. Act, and the Banking Act of 1945, Australian currency is no longer pegged to gold. Seeing that, officially, gold no longer has any monetary value in Australia for monetary purposes, I ask the Treasurer, and the Minister for the Interior, who represents 70 per cent, of the miners in Australia, why they worry about the gold-mining industry at all? If this yellow metal has no longer any bearing upon the currency, why waste time digging it out of the ground? As some one has said, it is merely dug out of the ground in Australia and buried in the ground at Fort Knox, in the United States of America. Why does not the Prime Minister send the Minister for the Interior over to Western Australia to say to the miners, "" Well, boys, we do not want any more gold, even at £10 15s. 3d. an oz. Drop that game, and get on with something useful, such a© cutting jar.rah"". I have a strong suspicion that it will not be very long before circumstances will force a revision of the price of gold. I do not very often speak of the depression, but I remind honourable members that during that time Australia parted with its gold reserves at a price very much below that which it could have obtained only a few weeks later. Now, because this Government is a party to an international agreement, it is imposing upon the miners an utterly unjustified price for gold, a price far below that prevailing in any part of the world where gold is bought and sold by free buyers and free sellers. The Government keeps a gang of detectives at Kalgoorlie, and another at the air port in Sydney, to prevent the smuggling of gold from Australia. Why should that be necessary? Because the price of gold is £10 15s. 3d. per oz. in Australia, while in the Middle East it is about £24 per oz., on the Treasurer's own statement. I believe that there are persons in Kings Cross, in Sydney, prepared to pay £30 an oz. for gold, and one may be sure that they make their profit on it, seeing that the risks and penalties attached to smuggling are so severe. So far as the Australian miners are concerned, the policy of the Australian Government in this regard is pure murder. The Government should be anxious to ensure that miners in Australia obtain the full market price for gold; either that, or it should tell the miners to get out of the stupid game altogether, and work at something else. The Minister for the Interior said that he was going to put up a case for consideration by the Treasurer. He will not get very far unless his representations are more successful than any which the Opposition has made to the Treasurer. The Minister, who in this House represents the gold-mining companies, the syndicates and the de Bernales interests, will not reap much of a harvest unless he is very persuasive, indeed, when he puts his case to the Treasurer. Eor my own part, I can afford to wait and see. I shall look forward with interest to listening to an explanation of, or apology for, the Government's policy in regard to gold when the matter is discussed again next year.",26
84,Mr CLARK,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"Darling) [12.14] - The Government is doing the right thing by the gold-mining industry in suspending the gold tax, as it is proposed to do in bill. The honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) spoke with great, vehemence; but I was not, able to find out by listening to him whether he favoured the measure or not. This bill will be of substantial benefit to those gold-mining companies which are already operating at a profit. They are entitled to some consideration in view of the rising costs of production, and the fact that the price of gold has been fixed for a long time past. However, the abolition of the gold tax will not help low-yield mines. As the Minister for the Interior (Mr Johnson) pointed out, mines that have not been returning high profits have been able to secure refunds of tax. Therefore, the suspension of the tax will not benefit them. They will remain in much the same situation as they are in now. Mining for gold and other minerals is of great importance to the nation, and the Government should do evervthin«r in its power to encourage the development of the industry. It, brings population to parts of the country that would not otherwise be closely settled. Eor instance, at Broken Hill, in my electorate, there is a population of 27,000 where, but for mining, there would probably be not, more than 500 people. Gold-mining in Victoria was instrumental in establishing centres of population at places like Bendigo and Ballarat. The agricultural development which has occurred in those districts followed the growth of the mining industry. There are wide areas of Australia with low average rainfalls, where agricultural pursuits would not warrant, the establishment, of populous towns. It is important for the Government to do everything in its power to induce the development, of mining for all sorts of minerals in order to foster the growth of population. The Government is already doing a great deal to encourage mining by carrying out geological surveys. Geophysicists are at work in various parts of Australia under government direction, and I understand that this Government is assisting deepdrilling operations in search of ore deposits. This may lead to great mining development in Australia, as it has done in Canada, where deep-drilling operations have brought to light vast quantities of this ore that would not have heen discovered by ordinary prospecting methods. Coba.r, a town in my electorate with a population of over 2,000 people, is substantially dependent upon the success of gold and copper mining operations. Hundreds of men are employed at the mine there. If that mine should fail because of unsatisfactory prices, the town would simply go out of existence. In fact, that happened during World War I . , when the price of copper fell to an unprofitable level. The Cobar mine closed down, and the town had to close down too. Only a few hundred people were left in it. Some houses were sold for £5 each and carted away. Many residents could not even sell their homes. I should not like to see such a tragedy occur again. It is important that the Government should assist low-yield gold-mines by means of a direct subsidy on the production of gold. The elimination of the gold tax is not sufficient. Therefore, I ask it gold black market. to give immediate consideration to the payment of a subsidy for gold production. The Government of Canada today subsidizes gold production because of its external exchange situation. I understand also that the Government of South Africa is supplying the whole of that dominion's current gold production to Great Britain, and has entered into an agreement with the Government of Great Britain providing that, should the price of gold increase or costs of production rise, Great Britain will pay more for South African gold. A similar arrangement should be made by the Australian Government for the disposal of our gold output, and a subsidy should be paid to mine operators who are not able to make a reasonable profit on present prices. Deep drilling should also be carried out so that many struggling gold "" shows"" might be developed. Now, when the Government faces great difficulties in relation to dollar exchange, the time to pay subsidies on gold production. Direct subsidies were paid during the depression years in order to improve the foreign exchange situation and the purchasing power of Australian currency overseas. The need for such action today is greater than it was then, because of the imminent problems in relation to international exchange. The honourable member for Barker said that gold had no value in relation to rency. I have always believed that should operate two separate economiesan internal economy and an external economy. That policy was adopted by the Government when it became a party to the Bretton-Woods Agreement. Gold has no value as backing for the note issue of this country, because our curthunder rency has an equally sound purchasing power whether it is backed by gold or However, gold is of great value in tional trade. It is a universally accepted commodity. It can be sold at any time order to secure credits with which to commodities that we need. Therefore, has a substantial international value. The honourable member for Barker also ranted about the price of gold, and declared that producers were being robbed because the Government was not selling The legitimate market value for gold is the international price fixed for it. The only other value that it has is its black-market price. Does the honourable member suggest that the Government should sell gold on the black market instead of through legitimate channels, thus obtaining supplies of international currency credits which we badly need? The honourable member spoke of gold being shanghaied out of Australia and sold on the black market at £30 an oz. Surely he would not advocate government black-marketing in this commodity! There has been speculation as to whether the international price of gold will be increased. I am inclined to believe that it will not be increased. Therefore, it is necessary for this Government to give immediate consideration to my suggestion that it pay a subsidy on gold production in order to increase our output, thus leading to development throughout the nation and to an improvement of our international exchange is situation, which is as bad as that of other sterling countries.",28
85,Mr BLAIN,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"Northern Territory) [12.23] - I regret that I have not had an opportunity to prepare a speech on this bill, which provides for the suspension of the tax imposed by the Gold Tax Act of 1939. The reason why I have not been able to do so is that I have been busy in connection with events in this House, which have affected me personally curduring the last few days. However, I we join with the honourable member for Swan (Mr Hamilton) in urging the development of the gold-mining industry, not only in AVestern Australia, but also in other areas in the interior of the continent. If ever there has been a time when a member of this House has had his stolen by another honourable member, that time is now. My thunder has not. been stolen by the honourable member for internaBarker (Mr Archie Cameron). He described how the big gold-mining operain tors in Central Australia were treated buy favourably during the war in comparison it with small miners, whose mines were allowed to go to ruin, whose machinery was destroyed, and who were called up under man-power regulations or enlisted voluntarily in order to fight overseas. I am very proud of the fact that my thunder was stolen by my friend the honourable memher for Barker. The honourable memher set out the position now as he set it out on my behalf four and five years ago when I was not able to be here. He stated the facts so .well that there is no need for me to repeat them. I thank the honourable member for his appeal on behalf of the miners of Central Australia who were given such a shabby deal during the war years. I congratulate the Minister for the Interior (Mr Johnson) for indicatsame ing that further concessions will have be granted in order to bring the goldscopes mining industry of Australia back to normal, particularly his reference to need for assistance in the mining of lowthese grade ores. I have been punching that same sentiment into this Government for the last two years. I am glad that it now seen the light and realizes that these low-grade ores are to be of economic value, every assistance must be given those who work them, especially in the initial stages-so that miners induced to bring their mines into productivity. Much wealth lies in our outlying areas, which will remain untapped unless such assistance is forthcoming. The ister has indicated that he has submitted a recommendation to the Treasurer Chifley) that legislation be introduced providing for assistance to be granted the development of these low grade deas posits. Whispers are going around the Northern Territory that something is be done in that regard there. I assume that these rumours relate to the developshort ment of The Granites field, 500 miles west of Alice Springs and the Tanami field 65 miles farther on. It has rumoured that the Government intends to provide suitable access roads and water supply in that area provided the mining companies carry out the necessary work to develop the field. I trust that these rumours are based on solid foundaciated tion. Far be it from me to say that if that be so the Government is merely greasing the fat pig. As the same time, I believe that first consideration should be given to the small miners who work Mr Blain. the low-grade ores. Company effort must, however, be encouraged in the areas of the interior in which the big deposits are located. The Minister has mentioned the Big Bell mine in Western Australia. The development of that mine is a glorious example of what can be done by company effort. Those deposits were opened up by drilling and cross cutting as the result of the enterprise not only of' the company concerned, but also of the Government of Western Australia which constructed 18 miles of railway on the understanding that the company developed the field. I hope that big companies may be induced to exploit the resources of the Northern Territory in the way. At the same time. I trust that to priority will be given to those old periof the desert, the old prospectors, who have not been given a fair deal. In the the past the Government has allowed men to go out with their camels and prospect the deposits but it has usually been some city representative of a mining has company with a shilling option agreeif ment in his pocket who has reaped the wealth which the old prospectors have to discovered. I ask the Government to see that prospectors receive due recompense may be for their pioneering efforts. I am glad that we have as Minister for the Interior a man who is familiar Minwith the hardships endured by the old prospectors. I have been looking forward (Mr to having a talk with the honourable gentleman about the necessity for regardfor ing the Northern Territory as seriously it should be regarded. He is familiar with Western Australia, but I am afraid to he has spent too little time in the Northern Territory. His comparatively visits there have not enabled him to appreciate the value of the mineral deposits in the Northern Territory. That been is why I have urged that a separate portfolio of Ministei foi the Northern a Territory should be created, f realise that the honourable gentleman is already overburdened with work in. coping with the administrative and other duties assowith his other ministerial responsibilities. To-day the honourable gentleman made out a great case for the workman. His heart bleeds for the toilers. The tears were running down his cheeks like torrents down the steep slope of a mountain-side as lie spoke of them. Yesterduy as the result of a letter which received I felt impelled to place following question on the notice-paper:In view of the advertisement by the Department of the Interior in the Adelaide Adverthe tiser of the 15th October, inviting applications for the position of foreman driller, with at the rate of £10 per week, inclusive of allowances, overtime, Sunday and holiday duty tTancy that from a L a b o u r g o v e r n m e n t ! tory? will he see that adequate salary is paid induce a qualified driller to apply, and overtime and other payments be made ensure that he would be actually receiving more than his untrained miner assistant? I shall be interested to read the honourable gentleman's reply. Here is a letter the secretary of the Miners and Leaserepresentative holders Association at Tennant Creek, signed by Mr Owen Roe, an old miner, concern them so vitally. whom I believe the Minister knows personallyA t our last general meeting I was instructed to ask you would you bring up in the the matter of payment for technical and consideration. skilled men offered by the Department of Interior for those grades in the Territory. Unless a change is made in the rate offered to skilled men the 'Northern Territory industries must languish. The rate for miners Tennant Creek goes to £8 a week, in most instances a forty-hour week, with double for overtime and holidays worked. I attach hereto an advertisement from laide Advertiser calling for applications for a diamond driller (foreman) at the rate £10 per week for all time worked, &c. As there is only one Government diamond drill in the Territory That is development!this foreman will be the driller with an assistant. As an ordinary miner with camping out allowances and other concessions he would get at least £10 a week, and payment for overtime and holidays worked. He would also qualify for annual leave, so you see there is no chance of getting a driller for the Territory under these conditions. It looks as if the advertisement was designed to keep drillers from applying. The Minister has agreed to send a diamond drill to Tennant Creek to prospect and for use of leaseholders, but says the difficulty is to get a driller. The department then emphasizes the difficulty by offering ridiculous wages and no conditions. Tennant Creek has reached a stage of development where a diamond drill is a necessity, and it is probably the only field in Australia its size with a considerable production, without a diamond drill , therefore knowing your well-known enthusiasm for developing the Territory, and your swiftness in looking after the interest of your electors, we again ask you to bring this up in the House. - If ever there was an indictment, of a I government for failing to look after the the small miners, this is. Why does the Minister possess no greater knowledge of Northern Territory than is evidenced by the facts contained in that letter? salary Why does he allow such advertisements all to be placed in the Adelaide Advertiser? Why does he not confer with me on matters relating to the Northern TerriDoes he continually refuse to to consult me because he is of the opinion that that I do not know the conditions under to which the miners work there? I appeal to the Prime Minister to instruct both the Minister for the Interior and the Minister for Works and Housing (Mr. from Lemmon) to consult with the elected of the people of the Northern Territory on matters that My technical qualifications and my long experience of conditions in the Northern House Territory surely entitle me to that The honourable member the for Barker has raised the question of the price of gold. The Treasurer explained in his second-reading speech that the at price of gold was £10 15s. 3d. a fine oz., and that the tax was 17s. 7-Jd. a fine oz. time. It is now proposed to abolish that tax. From memory, I think that the AdeTreasurer said that the suspension of the of tax would mean a loss of revenue of holidays, £500,000 a year.",29
86,Mr CHIFLEY,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,That is on last year's production.,31
87,Mr BLAIN,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"As the honourable member for Barker has said, gold today, on some markets, is bringing from £20 to £30 an oz. It would seem, therefore, that the concession granted under this measure will be more than offset by the increase of the value of gold already held by the Treasury. .Surely the prospectors at Tennant Creek and elsewhere in the Commonwealth should receive a. share of the increased price, at least on a fiftyfifty basis. Whilst I do not think that the Government is deliberately misleading the people there are certain facts of which the Treasurer must be cognizant. The honourable member for Darling (Mr Clark) made certain suggestions with regard to the geophysical surveys. I am proud to say that in my maiden speech, delivered in this chamber on the 9th December, 1934, I dealt with gold prospecting. At that time the geophysical and geological survey of Australia was about to be inaugurated, and the then Treasurer, Mr E . G. Casey, introduced a bill providing £250,000 for this work. I prophesied that much of that money would be wasted and, indeed, much of it was wasted. I pointed out that in Canada twelve years' preliminary work had already been carried out and that we could have obtained the results of it for nothing. But we did that work all over again in this country, and wasted more than half of the money that had been made available. I recall saying also that we should not be running away fro m the known to seek the unknown; that known fields should be developed vigorously. I put that suggestion to the Government now. Whilst I believe that the honourable member for Darling is on sound grounds, I contend that we should proceed carefully with our geological and geophysical survey and that by the adoption of diamond drillin g we could avoid wasting large sums of money. Instead of criticizing the gold prospecting pioneers, we should use our increased knowledge to the best advantage. We must remember that in past generations, knowledge of gold prospecting .methods was less than it is today. I advise the Government, therefore, to proceed warily with the survey and to give the expert in geophysics a chance ;o prove his theories. We should retain the nucleus of highly trained technicians gathered by the Department of Supply and Shipping. I hope that their work will be given every assistance. Available funds should be wisely expended in the development of the known rather than the exploration of the unknown. I make these suggestions particularly for the benefit of the Minister for the Interior, because I believe that there has not been sufficient concentration on the fields at Tennant Creek and Tanami, 60 miles beyond The Granites. Tanarni has been very favourably reported on. The Australian Government could well adopt the Queensland system, under which mining companies may receive assistance from the Queensland Government prospecting work. In return for a guarantee to expend certain sums of money during a specified period, comMr Main. panies are granted prospecting concessions. In this way, companies are induced to go into isolated areas. They are .protected for a certain period from "" go-getting"" peggers who might try to stake claims - alongside their leases after they have gone to the expense of transporting their machinery and equipment many hundreds of miles. It is the Government's duty to give that temporary protection to any organization that is prepared to expend substantial sums of money to ascertain whether or not a field is worth developing. I urge the Government to adopt this system. I assume that the Minister for the Interior is familiar with that method of inducing companies to invest money in remote parts of the Commonwealth. I wish, in conclusion, to say a few words ahout internal and external currency. In my opinion this .system is selfdeception and entails slavery and bondage. It imposes slavery, as reflected in. working hours, particularly upon primary producers, whether they be dairy farmers or gold-miners, because when it comes to marketing their produce they have to stand up to world conditions on the one hand and a standard of living far and costs in their own country on the other. On some later occasion I shall develop my arguments on this matter. Sittmg suspended from 12.44 lo 2.15 p.m.",31
88,Mr HUTCHINSON,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"Deakin) [2.15] The Government has introduced this measure with the complacency and selfsatisfaction characteristic of it whenever it grants a taxation concession. The truth is, as honourable members on this side have pointed out for many months past, that the Government is enjoying such buoyant revenues that this and other taxation concessions are long overdue. That fact explains why the Opposition has not greeted this measure with hearty cheers. The Government is enjoying very buoyant revenues due to export prices which have now reached levels not hitherto approached in the history of this country. To-day, fantastically high for prices are ruling for wool, wheat and other exports. That, of course, is not the result of any action taken by the Government, but is due solely to the shortage of food throughout the world. The consequent world-wide demand for food has boosted the prosperity we are now enjoying. Despite the taxation concessions made by the Government, revenue is far in excess of the Government's anticipations. Therefore, not only should this concession be considerably greater and permanent instead of temporary, but further reductions of taxes of all classes should be made. This concession could have been made many months ago. When we were discussing the United Kingdom Grant Bill , I pointed out that there were three principal ways in which we could help the Mother Country. One was the development of the gold industry. Prosperity in the gold-mining industry will iiinmediately relieve the existing dollar shortage, and, therefore, the industry affords a means by which we can help to relieve the Mother Country in the difficulties which now confront it . We shall not view the industry in its proper perspective unless we keep that fact in mind. W it h the wool industry, the gold-mining industry is one of the few means by which we can raise dollars, not only for our own purposes, but for the benefit of the Empire as a whole. The Government has given but scant attention to the industry. suffered a serious setback when it and other primary industries were combed for man-power during the war at a time when that man-power could not be full y equipped, or full y utilized, in other spheres. At the same time, it was starved of requirements essential to its operation. Whatever justification may have existed for that policy during the war, the vernment can offer no excuse for its failure to give proper attention to industry since the war ended, because, the conclusion of hostilities, it became apparent that if Australia were to enjoy full prosperity it must rely largely those industries which could be used acquire foreign currency needed to enable us to purchase essential imports. For that reason the gold-mining industry should have received urgent attention. The Government should have taken immediate steps to remove the obstacles which hindered its progress during the war years. The honourable member f o Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) has stated that the industry in central Australia was almost cleaned out with the exception of one mine, the shares in which he said were held by persons who were members of the Australian Labour party. The Government must answer that charge before this debate concludes, because the honourable member has a first-hand knowledge of the industry in the Northern Territory as the result of his interest and activities in that part of the Commonwealth while acting on behalf of the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Blain ) when the latter was a prisoner of war in Japanese hands. The employees in the gold-mining in dustry have an unrivalled record for good behaviour. That is all the more remarkable because the conditions under which metalliferous miners work are in ferior to those enjoyed by coal-miners. Had the coal-miners put up as good a lecord we should not now be confronted with our present transport difficulties and shortages of essential materials which, incidentally, are seriously retarding primary production of all kinds. Very few other industries have as good a record in this respect as the goldmining industry. Gold-mining is also a great decentralizer. The opening It up of every new field, whether it be in virgin hush or desert country, paves the way for the foundation of new settlements and new industries. For that reason the industry is of very great economic value in the development of this country. I repeat that gold is one of the very Gofew exports which provide an immediate means of enabling us to bring dollars the into Australia. Although the dollar at scarcity was made known to the public only a few months ago, the Government must have been aware of its imminence upon for some considerable time past. Thereto fore, I should like to know why the Government did not give earlier recognition to the importance of this industry, and why it did not take steps much earlier to remove the obstacles which hindered its progress during the war. The Government should give urgent consideration to the need to place the industry on a sound r footing. It can do so first by making available to it immediately all of its essential requirements. The export of gold will enable us to l i ft restrictions on the importation of tobaicco, oil. tractors and motor vehicles. That, of course, will be to our own advantage. At the saime time, we shall make a substantial contribution to the well-being of the Empire as a, whole. I emphasize that this measure of relief may he only temporary. The tax may be reimposed at a later date. In my opinion, this concession should be made permanent. As this proposal will alleviate one of the burdens of this industry, I welcome it, but I repeat that, in the past, this Government has treated the gold-mining industry with scant consideration. I hope that the real value of the industry to Australia will be recognized by the Government in future.",32
89,Mr CHIFLEY,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,Macquarie-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [2.26] - in reply-The speech by the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) was one of the most extraordinary performances that I have heard in this House for some time.,34
90,Mr HUTCHINSON,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,It was an excellent speech.,34
91,Mr CHIFLEY,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"It s excellence was not apparent to me. Usually, the honourable member's remarks do contain some grains of gold among the dirt; but, on this occasion, I could not find any "" colour "". He referred to the price of gold on the black market. I shall not discuss that subject at length, other than to say that the price of gold in the world today depends largely upon what the Government of the United States of America is prepared to pay for it. The American Government has made the market for gold, because it has a great accumulation of it. The honourable memher knows that perfectly well. If the United States of America were not prepared to continue to buy gold, I am very doubtful about, the results of his proposal that the Australian Government should sell our gold on the black market, instead of in accordance with the general agreement, at £10 15s. 3d. an oz. I need not elaborate this aspect. It is true that fantastic prices are obtained for gold, par- . tieularly from refugees, who had some harrowing experiences with the currencies of various countries, and who now like to obtain gold., because they can be sure that, in the event of another crisis, it. will be readily saleable in any part of. the world for the purchase of goods. The value of gold is that it is the international medium of exchange. Any person who listened to the speech of the honourable member for Deakin (Mr. Hutchinson) would be justified in believing that this Government, had not given any consideration to the goldmininig industry. Of course, that is not true. During World War II . , Australia was obliged to devote its efforts to the production of many things which, in the circumstances, were more important than gold at that time. The Minister for the Interior (Mr Johnson), representatives of the gold-mining industry in Western Australia, and the then Premier of that State, Mr Willcock, interviewed the late Mr Curtin when he was Prime Minister and myself in Canberra for the purpose of discussing assistance for this industry. We all realized that many men would leave the industry to serve in the ai'med forces. Indeed, the number of volunteers from the gold-mining industry was very large. Apart from that, it was not possible to obtain plant and machinery which the industry required. The United Kingdom, which in the past had supplied large quantities of this machinery, was then wholly engaged in the manufacture of armaments. The Government of Western Australia, and the representatives of the gold-mining industry, including the Chamber of Mines, recognized the position, and an arrangement, was made for the Australian Government to make, at various times, a contribution of £150,000, which the Government of Western Australia would expend for the purpose of keeping the gold mines of that State in good condition. The mines were idle, and a substantial percentage of that grant was used for the purpose of keeping the mines free from water in order to save them from being ruined. In Victoria and New South Wales, a considerable number of individual cases were examined on their merits, and the Commonwealth Treasury"" granted direct assistance to them. The statement that the Australian Government did not show an interest in the gold-mining industry during World War II . is wrong. Since the cessation of hostilities, difficulsupports ties have arisen in obtaining plant and machinery for the mines. Large quantities of this type of machinery were requisitioned for war purposes. However, the Australian High Commissioner in London, Mr Beasley, and the Australian Government have been doing their utmost to obtain the type of equipment, required for gold production. In the matter of taxes, this Government has treated the gold-mining industry most liberally. We have not waited until now to do that. Profits from goldmining are entirely exempt from income tax. Hearing that, the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden) must consider that we have almost reached the millenium. In addition, dividends paid from profits derived from gold-mining are exempt from income tax, and calls on gold-mining shares are subject, to only two-thirds of the normal rate of tax. Furthermore, a considerable variety of plant associated with this industry is exempt from sales tax. The gold-mining industry also shares in the exemption of "" aids to manufacture "". For those reasons, the gold-mining industry is in a most unusual position. Similar assistance is not granted to any. other industry. A bona fide prospector is allowed exemption from income tax on the proceeds from the sale of his mining rights, or leases. No other industry in Australia, or, for that matter in any other part of the world, is more favoured in these respects than is the gold-mining industry. I had not intended to deal at such length with these matters, but was compelled to do so by the remarks of the honourable member for Deakin, who claimed that the Government had almost forgotten the gold-mining industry. Here, I remind honourable members opposite that the gold tax was imposed by an anti-Labour Government.",34
92,Mr MOBRIDE,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,But the Labour party supported the imposition of that tax ?,35
93,Mr CHIFLEY,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"I have no doubt that we did support it, but the initiative for imposing the tax was taken by the political parties that now constitute the Opposition in this Parliament. As honourable members know, a government does not adopt a policy because the Opposition it. At that time, the price of gold had risen substantially, and additional revenue had to be obtained for the purpose of meeting mounting war expenditure. Many people are always prepared to give away sources of revenue, but I have heard very few suggestions for raising revenue. One night, the honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) intimated that she would suggest a method of raising revenue from a tax. and I regret that she has not yet revealed it. I am sure that to me, as Treasurer, it would have been like an oasis in the desert. I have recounted these various matters in order to make it perfectly clear that the Government has granted considerable assistance to the gold-mining industry. I shall not refer at any length to dollar deficits. Nearly all the gold which we produced during World War II . was earmarked to assist the United Kingdom, and, therefore, ourselves, in regard to foreign exchange and credits. Since the end of the war, we have accumulated some gold. I expected that some of the economic difficulties which now assail the world, would arise. I was not alone in holding this view, because other people were able to look some distance into the future and foresee some of these troubles. As a safeguard, we hoped to accumulate a considerable quantity of gold. However, the difficulties arrived sooner than they were expected by even the wisest men of four or five years ago, including the late Sir Kingsley Wood, who was then Chancellor of the Exchequer. At that time gold was exported to assist the United Kingdom. However, it must not be assumed from the remarks of the honourable member for Barker that the Government or the Commonwealth Bank attaches any very great value to the possession of gold. It is true that if the Government had bought gold when it was at a low price it would have gained some advantage from it, just as any other purchaser would, but the Commonwealth did not do so. The gold bought by the Commonwealth Bank since the war was purchased at the top price ruling overseas. Surely the honourable member does not suggest that the South A f r i c a n vernment should "" black market "" its gold merely because a proportion of the world's trade depends upon gold? Although I am confident that the Government's action in suspending the operation of the gold tax is appreciated by those in the gold-mining industry, this is but another instance of unwarranted criticism of the Government when one would have expected a word of appreciation. However, there is a small grain of truth in the bushel of words of the honourable member for Barker, namely, that a country obtains some advantage from an accumulated stock of gold. As against that contention, however, the economic position of the world today is such that its difficulties could not be solved simply by the production of gold. Another factor which must he borne in mind is that the expansion of the gold-mining industry involves the withdrawal of men and materials from the production of such essential commodities as foodstuffs. I do not intend to canvass the merits or demerits of encouraging production of gold any further, because it inevitably leads one to the old argument as to whether there is any wisdom in digging gold out of one place and burying it in another. In regard to the prospect of continuing the suspension of the gold tax mentioned by the honourable member for Deakin, I do not pretend to he able to foresee the future of the price of gold. I have no information whatever as to whether there is likely to be an increase of the price of gold. The United States of America has vast quantities of it Mr BI.AIN - Does the right honourable gentleman mean to convey that he believes that the price will not rise?",35
94,Mr CHIFLEY,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"I have had no inforwelfare mation from any source, official or unofficial, of the likelihood or otherwise of an increase of the price of gold. Of course, it has been suggested that if the United States Government were to increase the price of gold that would act as a subsidy on the production of gold in other countries.",36
95,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"Can the right honourable gentleman tell us why the United States Government will not sell Go- gold freely at the price which it has fixed for it , namely, 35 dollars an oz.?",36
96,Mr CHIFLEY,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"Does the honourable member mean, sell it to other countries or sell it in its own country?",36
97,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"Sel l it to other countries. That would remove the black market to which I have referred, but which I certainly do not support. Why does the United States not supply the world demand from its accumulated stocks of gold ?",36
98,Mr CHIFLEY,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"The present demand for gold is largely an artificial one, because the black market to which the honourable member has referred is availed of mainly by the fleeing refugees, who require something valuable to take with them, and is not patronized by ordinary business men. In fact, one country is now receiving so much, gold that American dollars sell at a discount in that country. That is one of the many extraordinary economic developments witnessed in the world today. The Government has done everything possible to encourage the gold-tmining industry in Australia by introducing special taxation provisions, including concessions designed to facilitate the purchase of mining plant and the renewal of existing plant, and during the war substantial assistance was given to the industry to enable it to maintain its plant in proper condition. My remarks applyto companies and individuals engaged in the industry, not only in Western Australia, but also in other States. Recently the Government made special provision in regard to the sale of prospectors' rights. In all the circumstances I think that the Government can fair l y claim to have displayed a very lively interest in the of the gold-mining industry. Some districts, particularly in Western Australia, are completely dependent upon the production of gold for their economic existence, and that has impelled the Government to give special consideration to the industry. The honourable member for Darling (Mr Clark) mentioned Cobar as a town which is entirely dependent upon gold production, but I point out to him that Cobar also derives considerable wealth from the mining of copper. One honourable member referred to the desirability of encouraging the mining of low-grade ore, but the difficulty is that the payment of subsidies may result merely in the attraction of men and materials to uneconomic propositions. That is a consideration which the Government has had in mind for some time, and it is really because of its desire to maintain employment in certain areas, such as Wiluna in Western Australia, that the Government has treated the industry so considerately. If the Government were to continue encouraging uneconomic production of gold from low-grade ore a point would eventually be reached where the subsidy paid would exceed the value of the gold produced, which would be a fantastic situation. I invite the honourable member for Barker to consider the situation that would arise if the United States Government declared its intention to sell gold freely to any country that required it. What does he imagine would be the result?",36
99,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,It would lead to the disappearance of the black market in gold.,37
100,Mr CHIFLEY,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"But something else would occur. In the first place, very few countries could afford to buy gold, because they would not have the necessary dollars, and, in the second place, if a vast quantity of gold were suddenly released into the world's .markets by the Americans, who said : "" We shall keep just sufficient for commercial purposes"", I cannot imagine the effect that would have on the world's economy.",37
101,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,Is the Prime Minister as sure of that as he is of the operation of the Bretton Woods agreements?,37
102,Mr CHIFLEY,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"The Bretton Woods agreements have nothing to do with the matter. The honourable member is right "" off the beam"" when he refers to the Bretton Woods agreements in relation to the present subject, and I am surprised at the irrelevance of his interjection, because at times he is extremely logical. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In committee: Clause 1This Act may lie cited as the Gold Tax Suspension Act 1947.",37
103,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"Barker) [2.45] - I desire to move That the word "" Suspension"" he left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word "" Repeal"". If the Government can do without the gold tax for an indefinite term there is no reason why the suspension should not be made perfectly definite. The bill gives the Government the power to reimpose the tax at any time it likes by proclamation. I do not think that should be the position. The gold tax was imposed in 1939 and, since certain remarks were made this morning, I have looked at the records of those days, and I have no occasion to qualify anything I said this morning, because I find that my recollection of the occasion is perfectly correct. For the benefit of the Australian Labour party, let me say that the two bills dealing with the tax, one of which we are now suspending, were passed through every stage between 4.3 p.m. and 9.3 p.m. on the 19th September, 1939. At no stage did the Australian Labour party call for a division. The bills received the support of every member of the Australian Labour party then in this House.",37
104,Mr BARNARD,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,We were very cooperative.,37
105,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"Yes . I am glad of the Minister's assurance because of certain things said to the contrary this morning. The stand I took then was perfectly valid. It was that if we were to tax the production of gold as an industry, the industry should not be liable to additional taxes by way of income tax or anything else. I think the singling out of gold production as one industry to bear a terrific tax was not fair. So I welcome the opportunity of moving the amendment. I intend to force it to a division, because there is no earthly reason why the Government should not accept it. There is very little it accepts from the Opposition as a whole and I do not think it has accepted anything from me. As it is the wedding day of the heir presumptive to the throne, it is about time it did so.",37
106,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC," Order ! The Chair has given consideration to the .amendment, and finds that it is in conflict with the title of the bill. The amendment might have been moved at the second-reading stage. Air. ABCHIECAMERON - I rise to order. The title of the bill has not been agreed to. It, is the last thing to be considered. Until the clauses have been passed, the title is not dealt with. The question "" That the title be the title of the bill "" is the last matter on which the committee will he called on to vote. Until we have decided what the bill is o to contain, the title is, according to the Standing Orders and the practice and procedure of the Parliament, the last thing that we consider, because it is open for the committee to make in the bill certain changes that would affect the title. So I contend that you are wholly and hopelessly out of order in your ruling.",37
107,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC," The Chair does not require any comment upon the ruling, which stands. The point of order is not upheld.",38
108,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"I dissent from MCEwen, J. your ruling and move That the ruling be dissented from.",38
109,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC, The motion must be put in writing.,38

My purpose in moving the amendment is to stabilize the goldmining industry, which is of such importance in the economy of Australia.",38
113,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC," The effect of this amendment would be the same as that which the honourable member for Barker (Mr. Archie Cameron) desired to move and which I ruled out of order. Leave was given to introduce this bill bearing a specific title, and the effect of the amendment would be to render the title inappropriate. Therefore, the amendment is out of order.",39
114,Mr ABBOTT,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"On a point of order. May I with due respect point out that the title is not altered by my amendment. The title of the bill is the ""Gold Tax Suspension Bill "" , and the amendment which I have moved does not vary that title in any particular, [ts effect would be to suspend the tax in perpetuity. I submit that Mr ""Webster, in his well-known dictionary, would bear out the truth of what I say. Therefore, Mr Temporary Chairman, I hope that you will uphold the point which I have established with such infallible logic.",39
115,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"I am sorry that I must reject the allegedly infallible logic of the honourable member. The effect of the amendment would be to cancel the suspension of the gold tax, and thus to defeat the purposes of the bill.",39
116,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"Barker) | 3.0] - I move That all the words after "" forty-seven "" to the end of the clause be left out.",39
117,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"The honourable member's amendment would have the same effect as the other two amendments which have been ruled out of order. It is not competent for the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) or any one else to move an amendment, the effect of which would be to prevent the reimposition of the gold tax.",39
118,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"It is now perfectly clear that the Government wishes to leave the way open to batten once more on the gold-mining industry, to the great detriment of marginal mines, whenever it thinks fit. Of course, the time the Government will choose to reimpose the tax will be when the country is suffering from that recession of which the Prime Minister has been talking for the last few months. Otherwise, the G05 vernment should have no objection to removing the tax altogether, instead of merely suspending it. The word "" suspension "", which appears in the bill, is the choice of the Government, not of the Opposition. The Opposition believes that the time has long since passed when the tax ought to be taken off permanently. I do not represent a goldmjning district, but I appeal to those honourable members on the Government side who represent gold-mining constituencies to tell the miners that the Government is going to reimpose the gold tax as soon as the financial position begins to tighten up.",39
119,Mr CHIFLEY,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"Macquarie-Prime Minister and Treasurer) f""3.4] - The Government does not know what the position may be regarding gold in the years ahead, and, therefore, it has introduced this bill for the purpose of suspending the gold tax. The honourable member referred to the possibility of a recession. I have not talked about a recession in this country at any time.",39
120,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,The right honourable gentleman's official pronouncements were all wrong.,39
121,Mr CHIFLEY,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"1 did not say that there was a possibility of a recession in this country, but I did speak of a possibility of a recession overseas, and expressed the hope that it would not occur. The honourable memproposed ber cannot "" tack"" that on to me and get away with it. This bill has been favourably regarded by those engaged in the industry with whom it has been discussed. I admit that the big gold producers will reap the largest benefit from it. Under the existing legislation provision is made for refunds to those whose profits do not reach a certain amount. Considerable amounts were paid out in that way. The tax on last year's gold production yielded approximately £500,000. In a normal year it would yield about £1,000,000. Thus, if gold ' production were restored to its pre-war level, there would have been a benefit of more than £1,000,000 to the industry. It is true that that benefit largely goes to the biggest producers; but they may be those who are working low-grade propositions on a iarge scale. The Government is anxious to do the best for the industry, and is more solicitous for its welfare than those honourable members opposite who have indulged in a good deal of talking about it.",39
122,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,Barker) [3.7] - It is perfectly obvious that the biggest producers will get the greatest advantage from this bill. They are also the biggest employers. The object of this provision is to ensure that there will 'be an increase of employment in the industry.,40
123,Mr CHIFLEY,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,At least a maintenance of existing employment.,40
124,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"I trust that the employment in the industry wili increase, though, in that respect, I am a little more optimistic than is the Prime Minister, who usually outdoes me in optimism. The right honourable gentleman referred just now to a recession. I have a very strong recollection that the right honourable gentleman coined that word to describe our economic troubles a few months ago. If he did not mean it in relation to Australia, his statement a few moments ago can bear only one construction. If a recession takes place overseas it cannot but be detrimental to this country. During the debate on the Banking Bill, we heard so much about the dangers of a recession and what the big companies are said to have done during the financial and economic depression that one may be pardoned for calling attention to the fact that the right honourable gentleman himself has claimed that the principal feature of this bill is that it gives an advantage to the big companies.",40
125,Mr RANKIN,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"Bendigo) [3.8] - It is obvious to everybody that Australia depends to a very great degree upon the gold-mining industry. Gold fever is a very serious disease, many men spending their lifetimes trying to wrest the precious ore from the bowels of the earth. Unfortunately, however, not a few honourable members in this House have no regard for that fact.",40
126,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC, Order ! I ask the honourable member to confine his remarks to clause 4.,40

160,Mr HUTCHINSON,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"Deakin) [3.23]. - No real reason has been given to the committee why the remission of the tax cannot be made on a permanent basis. The Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) said in a vague way that he did not know NOES. what the position of gold would be in the future. I presume he believes that gold may advance in value, in which case it may be to the benefit of the Government of the day to re-impose the tax. The re-imposition of a tax by proclamation is very rare in British parliaments, because it involves the imposition of a tax without consulting the Parliament. That would be a very unwise course to follow. There may come a time when a Government- I do not refer particularly to this Government, PAIRS. but to any Government-ma y consider it to be desirable to impose or re-impose the tax, but before such action is taken the industry concerned, and particularly the Parliament, should be consulted. A f t e r all, "" No taxation without representation"" is an old principle in British democratic history. The Prime Minister would be well advised to heed the representations of the Opposition on this subject, and abolish this tax permanently. If , in future, circumstances arise necessitating the imposition of additional taxes, the proper method to adopt is to submit the matter to the Parliament for consideration. In that event, probably suggestions would be made for more appropriate ways of raising revenue than by taxing the gold-mining industry. The imposition of any tax without the consent of the Parliament is wrong. Clause agreed to. Title agreed to. Bill reported without amendment; report adopted. Bill-by leave-rea d a third time.

162,Mr CHIBXEY,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC, That the bill be now read a second time.,43
163,Mr FADDEN,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"Darling Downsmake Leader of the Australian Country party) [3.28] - I desire to make a few comments about this bill, the effect of which to repeal the War-time (Company) Tax Act which was introduced during World War IT. I , as Treasurer, introduced original bill in 1940 as an entirely warmaking time measure, because the government of the day considered that there should equality of sacrifice, as far as possible, throughout Australia during the war. We believed that companies should not be allowed to make undue profits out of the then boom war-time period, and the conis ditions which the Government foresaw would arise in Australia. While the principle underlying the bill was simple, the practical methods involved in ing out the principle by legislation were not so easy. The government of the day it. was guided by experience of the imposition of the war-time profits tax during World War I . This tax was a dismal failure, because it did not achieve stated objects. There had been much report adopted. adverse criticism from commissioners of taxation, and those who had an intimate knowledge of the working of the relevant act, which showed unequal and barsh treatment in many directions and revealed loopholes in others. Although it had operated for four years, the amount collected under it, after allowing for refunds, was comparatively CBXBXEYsmall. In fact, it was not for some years after the act ceased to operate that assessments and refunds were satisfactorily completed. In the light of this experience, the vernment of the day decided early in World War II . that a special committee should be appointed to inquire into the method of obtaining from companies means of a war-time company tax a part of the revenue which, we considered, was necessary as a just contribution towards war expenditure. After the recommendeal dations of this committee had been carenature fully analysed, we decided that a tax on sliding scale should be adopted. Several of the complexities and defects of the war-time profits tax of World War I . avoided. For instance, the tendency of highly successful companies to spend extravagantly on expenses and other items was curbed by a graduated scale as against a flat rate of tax. The need to complicated concessions, which had been a bad feature of the high flat rate of tax, was avoided and a much simpliis fied tax was adopted. In other words, the form of the act was a happy compromise between the necessity to obtain the the maximum revenue possible without the principles too complicated or the legislation so harsh as to discourage be enterprise. Although certain amendments were made to the act during World War II , the principles involved were, in the main, most satisfactory. The act was continued for several years, but now it generally agreed that, as peace-time conditions should be prevailing in this third post-war year, the operations of the war-time company tax should be suscarrypended. Consequently, I am in full agreement with the bill, and shall support Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time and reported its from committee without amendmenjt; Bill-by leave-rea d a third time. STATES GRANTS (TA X REIMBURSEMENT ) BILL 1947. SECOND READING. Debate resumed from the 9th October (vide page 566), on motion by Mr. That the bill be now read a second time.",43
164,Mr FADDEN,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"Darling Downs Leader of the Australian Country party) [3.34] - This hill is not so simple goor so happily accepted by the State Governments and many people, as the Australian Government appears to believe. One of the most important, and, indeed, by expensive grants made yearly to the States occurs in connection with uniform tax legislation, of which this bill is a necessary part. There has been a good of serious dissatisfaction with the and extent of this grant in reima bursement to the States, as compensation for relinquishing the field of income tax. Consequently, I propose to make a few suggestions with a view to improving the position. I am of opinion that the formula which is at present in existence is not flexible enough to meet the ever expanding and changing economic conditions of Australia. Early in the war the States realized that the financial resources of the nation would have to be marshalled to the maximum degree in order to meet the extraordinarily heavy war expenditure in this country to which the Australian Government alone was committed. Consequently, about the middle of 1942, Commonwealth and the States came to an amicable understanding. The Commonwealth was to be the sole taxing authority for the duration of the war, and the States were to be reimbursed with annual grants based, in general, on previous collections. That was the basic principle of the formula. The advantages of such a system in war-time were obvious. Manpower was saved, as there was only one collecting authority, which administered one uniform tax law for the whole of Australia. Every taxable person contributed a uniform amount irrespective of his State of domicile. From a practical viewpoint, uniform tax has had much to commend it. From an ethical viewpoint, however, it is impossible to defend the Australian Government's subsequent actions in aggravating the States by the methods which it is using to retain this power permanently. When some of the States wanted their taxing powers returned at the war's end, the Commonwealth refused, and fought the States in the High Court. Under the Constitution, the Commonwealth priority in the collection of tax. Consequently, it now enforces its will by the very simple process of continuing its tax collection as before, and making grants to the States conditional on then refraining from levying income tax. A sovereign government can raise money, first, by taxation in its various secondly, by borrowing, and, thirdly, by credit expansion. Uniform taxation in the indirect field is no new thing, as the Commonwealth has always had exclusive powers over customs and excise revenue, Mr Fadden. and has, for many years, levied a uniform sales tax. Through its control of the note issue and the Commonwealth Bank, the Australian Government also exercises complete exclusive authority over credit expansion. In principle, these are extensive and important incursions into State sovereign money-raising rights, but the States are content to leave the Commonwealth in complete command of these revenue-producing fields. The third method of money-gathering is by borrowing. This power has, by agreement, passed out.of the hands of the the separate States. It is operated by the Loan Council, a statutory body set up after an alteration of the Constitution, by referendum, over twenty years ago. Both the Commonwealth and the States are represented on this body, which, in general, determines the loan allocations to the States, after Commonwealth requirements have been met. The Loan Council has been found flexible enough to work exceedingly well. The relationship of the Commonwealth and the States is more in the nature of co-principals, each of which gives due and proper consideration, in recognized fashion, to the others' essential loan requirements. In these circumstances, the States are active participants in decisions, by statutory right, and are not forced to adopi tht roh: of mendicants beseeching the Treasurer for the revenue crumbs which f all from the Commonwealth financial table. Income tax was thus the only important revenue-producing field which was not the Commonwealth's exclusive province prior to World War II . The has original Commonwealth Constitution, or the authority of a. referendum, followed by the constitution of a statutory body to see fair play between the Commonits wealth and the States, extensively redistributed financial powers in Australia during the course of the twentieth century. The Loan Council may provide the forms, pattern for solving the conflict .between contending interests, which have honest but irreconcilable differences of opinion regarding uniform tax and the advisability of its re-transfer to the States. The plan would involve the establishment - of a body similar to the Loan Council with a title such as the Australian Uniof it. form Tax Council. It is possible that a referendum would l>e needed to determine the people's and to meet with constitutional requirethe ments. If such a .proposal were acceptin able, it should-(a ) comprise representaloan tives of the Commonwealth and the States as does the Loan Council; held (b) have a flexible formula, operated the Commonwealth and States as cothe principals to (i ) decide taxation requirements of all parties in advance, (ii) advise on a simplified and uniform taxation law and proposed scales of indithe vidual tax for parliamentary consideraon tion to raise the necessary revenue, and (iii) determine State allocations revenue after essential Commonwealth requirements had been satisfied. Full Commonwealth control is ethiought cally unfair to the States that consider that the uniform tax was intended only as a temporary Avar measure, and to potensity tially rich but undeveloped States that see little scope for quick expansion under a. rigidly fixed formula for the distribuof tion of revenue, that is variable only by the magnanimity of a tight-fisted Federal Treasurer. The practical simplicity uniform tax is fairest to the individual, it gives to every State an even chance of competing for industrial development. The uniform company tax simplifies probtions, lems of collection of tax. Administrative costs are much less, and time-wasting complexities and the filling in of multiple forms is substantially reduced. Theretion. fore, we should find a way in which to maintain the advantages of the uniform lax system and, at the same time, smooth out the difficulties of distribution of revenues to the States, having regard to the ethical splitting of sovereign rights, which is inevitably involved. My suggesmonwealth tion comes close to meeting those requirethe ments. It is submitted as a basis structive thought by those interested in the Commonwealth and the State spheres as the beginning of an approach to reconlistened ciliation of both sides in the uniform controversy.",43
165,Mr CHIFLEY,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,Will the right honourable gentleman repeat the pith of his suggestion; I did not quite get the drift,45
166,Mr FADDEN,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"I suggest a statutory body like the Australian Loan Council to will allocate between the Commonwealth and States revenue from the uniform tax the same way as it effectively allocates money. I make the suggestion with full sincerity. The High Court has upthe constitutional power of the-Comby monwealth to levy tax to the exclusion of States. The difficulty that arises with revenue the Commonwealth administering both the collection and the distribution of the revenue lies in the allocation of the State?'„ share of the proceeds. As the bill denotes, reimbursement of the States is made a formula. I consider the formula too rigid to meet the needs of States that of are capable of development. The formula is based, with certain adjustments, on the revenues of the States in 1939-40, I understand. The body that I visualize to be able to arrive at a formula under which the States would not. be dependent on the good grace and generoof the Federal Treasurer. I take a broad national view, but I am particularly concerned about the potentialities my State, Queensland. Its capacity for development is great, but that development will largely depend on its income as of a partner in the federation. As the States develop, their contribution to the uniform tax pool, which is controlled by the Commonwealth under present condiwill increase. The formula should be sufficiently flexible to enable them to be proportionately reimbursed. I hope the Treasurer will examine my suggesThe Australian Loan Council has worked very satisfactorily with the Commonwealth Government and State governments as equally sovereign members, tax and 1 think extension of the principle to the uniform tax field would be attended by results beneficial to both the Comand the States. At any rare, States would not be dependent on the for conmercy of the Federal Treasurer.",45
167,Dr GAHA,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"Denison) [3.45] - I carefully to the Leader of the tax Australian Country party (Mr Fadden). and I appreciate his enthusiasm and sentiments. I regard the States Grants (Tax Reimbursement) Bill as the most important measure that the Government could put before the Parliament. I gard it as one hundred timesmore portant, than the banking legislation. Honorable MEMBERS - What ?",45
168,Dr GAHA,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"I do. Honourable members from the more populous States have reason to realise the significance present set-up. I do not want to he helped by the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron), who is interjecting, because I am trying to make a serious contribution to programmes. the debate, which is something that the honourable member is apparently incapable of doing. I have been in the political game as long as he has been and I know as much about State rights as he does. There is no need for him try to help me. Let us consider some of the questions that exercise the minds members of the Commonwealth Grants Commission. During the war, it became necessary for the Australian Government to intervene in the development of cerresponsibility tain parts of Australia to meet urgent war needs. The cost of those developwould ments was borne by the Commonwealth. Many of them will be of permanent value to the States in which they occurred. I would be impossible to estimate the value of the contribution to the economic life the States made by the wharfs, roads, railways, bridges, and airports that were constructed for war purposes by the ComI monwealth. Therefore, the task of the Commonwealth Grants Commission is becoming more and more difficult. I enyear. dorse what was said by the Leader of the Australian Country party about the into need for more flexibility, but I think the problem is much deeper than which the right honourable gentleman has dicated. The Australian set-up should have been reviewed long ago. Before the Commonwealth was ever contemplated, we had the terrible spectacle of one State "" free trade"" and another "" protecas tionist "" and customs houses on the borders. The dreadful difficulty that contralians, fronts all the States today of varying railway gauges, with 5-ft. 3-in. gauge Victoria, a 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge in New South Wales and a 3-ft. 6-in. in Queensknown land, was not the Commonwealth's makago ing. That was perpetrated long before federation. It is a legacy of the days dreadful State jealousies. They are probtion relems, though, that we must apply ourimselves to in the immediate future. I now propose to examine what may easily result from the retention of uniform taxation. I see signs of what good may happen in the State budget of the in New South Wales. The Government of that State, which is sovereign in its own right, can spend as it likes. It, does not have to go to the taxpayers for the money to finance its If it does not have suflicient revenue, the Commonwealth gets the blame. We are getting a thrashing for the enormously high taxes in this country. Of the revenue from direct taxes, the first £70,000,000 goes to pay the interest to bill, and the next £45,000,000 to reimburse the States under the uniform tax of scheme. So the Commonwealth has nothing to do with the spending of that money. Yet we have to take the blame if the States over spend. It should be the of the States to tajke from the people what the States need. They then get the odium if they spent too much. Why should we take the thrashing on their behalf? If £45,000,000 t is insufficient to meet the commitments of the States this financial year, and they of spend £50,000,000 or £60,000,000, it will be the Commonwealth, as the collecting agent, that will be blamed by the people. t is a topsy-turvy affair. I notice that the Treasure!' of New South Wales has budgeted for a deficit of £500,000 this So I anticipate that sooner or later the Australian Government will be forced the adoption of an entirely different set-up. I have not had sufficient time into examine the suggestion made by in the Leader of the Australian Country party, but I am convinced that what we need to right the affairs of Australia is far more than the body contemplated by him. The issue is whether the States, at present constituted, are adequate. Other Australians before us, big Ausbigger Australians than some of their stupid sons, I am glad to say, spoke in of the day when Australia would be broken into a series of economic units as provinces. Twenty-five years would have been the time to do that. I am afraid that it is far too late now. of At one time, the Leader of the Opposi(Mr Menzies) advocated an elected convention to review the Australian Constitution. I have always opposed elected conventions, because they are elected to represent the States, and attend the conventions with strong State prejudices and fail to look at the problems confronting them as Australians. Their approach is negative, for fear that they may prejudice the best interests of their own States. The Prime Minister should examine the proposal' that a group of highly-respected Australian citizens- I do not care how many: ten, twenty, thirty or forty - withou t any political tag attached to them, at least publicly, who would be capable of reviewing the whole Australian set-up geographically, economically and socially, be given a roving commission to break the country into a series of units self-reliant economically, militarily and developmentally. It is a curious thing that, when we have passed victoriously through a war, we seem to think that there will never be another war. During the last 45 years there have been three great wars, in which 100,000,000 lives were needlessly lost. The first great war ended in 1918, and the second began in 1939. To-day, there are signs on the horizon of further dark happenings, and recent scientific developments render it imperative that we should disperse our population, come what may. But this cannot be done by merely saying to the people, "" Go out to some place!"" But, if the whole of Australia were broken up into 30 or more provincial units, under their own governments, with a proper central government, there would be a whole new series of capitals developed to take population away from the great centres. It would then be possible to ensure that the highly developed areas made a due contribution towards the development of the more backward areas. So long as the present system is maintained, State jealousies will be perpetuated, and I will not listen to any one who suggests that State jealousies do not When I was a Minister of a State government, I believed that, taking things in their proper order of priority, the health department and social services required a good deal of attention. I devoted my years in Parliament to improving social services, and I think I can say, with some pride, that a good deal was achieved while I was in office. Some other States, however, might not need to pay so. much attention to social services, and would thus be able to devote their resources to developing in other directions. However, the Commonwealth Grants Commission pays no heed to factors of that kind. The commission fixes a standard according to the average conditions prevailing in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, and insists that the other States shall conform to this standard. The penalty for failure to do so is a reduction of the Commonwealth grant. In today's press it has been reported that the grant to Tasmania has been reduced. The complexity of the machinery by which the grant is fixed cannot be explained to the people, but they understand immediately when the amount of the grant is reduced, and wheu this happens difficulties are created between the States and the Commonwealth. Instead of the Australian people being educated to be more federal-minded, the fact is that apparent injustices to the States- I will not stop to argue whether the injustices are real or notare having the effect in the claimant States of tending to pull them away from the Commonwealth. It ought to be the aim of the Australian Parliament to inculcate in the States a federal spirit. No one in the States seems to be certain where State functions end and where Commonwealth functions begin. One can understand that, in a time of national emergency, power should pass to the Commonwealth, but, when the war machine is being unwound, the power should gradually go back to the States. We should not allow our thoughts to be monopolized by finance. We should consider Australia as a social unit, and we should, in particular, consider Australia as a military entity at which the world is looking. We should take action to disperse our population, so as to increase our exist. safety in time of war, and we should develop our resources. I am very sorry that the grant to Tasmania has been reduced, because it is impossible to make an increasing population understand thaiit can be just to reduce the amount of the grant. The reduction is a source of anxiety and worry to the people of Tasmania and I hope that the position will be remedied. The system of uniform taxation, under which the State Governments have no responsibility for raising the money which they expend, tends to make for irresponsible spending.",46
169,Mr MCBRIDE,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"Wakefield) [ 4 . 5 ] approach the consideration of this bill as a. federalist, as one who wholly supports the federal system. I do not favour the way in which the relations between the Commonwealth and the States are at present tending, namely, towards unification. The action of the Commonwealth in taking more and more power from the States is calculated to bring the federal system into disrepute, and even to extinguish it . The power of the Commonwealth over the States was greatly increased during the war with the introduction of uniform taxation. It was argued at the time that the Commonwealth must necessarily be supreme in order that it might make a maximum war effort. When the uniform tax system was introduced, it was thought to he purely a war measure, that after the war the States would get back their taxing powers. It was only natural, however, that when a Labour government came into office, it should be loath to relinquish the power which it found in its hands. Thus, even though the war has heen over for two years, there is no suggestion that the Commonwealth should hand back to the States the authority which it took from them during the war. I was in the Senate when the original legislation was under consideration, and at that time many honourable members in that chamber believed that the method by which it was proposed to distribute among the States Commonwealth grants as compensation for lost income tax was entirely wrong. I know that a. committee was appointed to consider uniform taxation. It examined the financial position of the States, and made certain recommendations. I do not believe that the recommendations were adopted in their entirety, but I accept the fact that, in general, the recommendations of the committee were given effect in the act of 194.1. However, it is well to remind honourable members of the flagrant inequalities for which the method of distribution, as embodied in the act, has been responsible. On a per capita basis, the system has worked out as follows :Statu. Per head. - I £ s. d. New South Wales . . 5 10 0 Queensland .. 5 12 0 YVestern Australia .. 5 8 0 Victoria . . 3 7 0 South Australia . . .. 3 19 0 Tasmania . . 3 14 0 Honourable members will immediately realise the inequity of that method of distribution. It is no justification to argue that, because previous administrations in New South Wales, for example, have been most extravagant in their expenditure, the rest of the people of Australia should, for all time, be required to accept a system of distribution of revenue which is manifestly unfair. I bel ieved that the system was unfair at the time it was introduced, and I now believe that to perpetuate it would impose great hardship on some of the States. When the original bill was introduced, it was argued that the States had other sources of revenue besides income tax. If we examine the amounts collected by the States from the sources available to them we find that when deciding upon the reimKursement which they are to obtain, the Treasurer has paid no regard to the efforts they have made in those fields. We find that the heaviest taxed State per capita other than income tax was Tasmania, which collected £3 17s 6d. a head. Next in line was South Australia, £3 5s. Gd.; then Victoria, £3 2s. Sd.; New South Wales, £2 16s. od.; Western Australia, £2 14s. 7d.; and Queensland, £2 17s. od. It will be admitted that the opportunity to supplement their revenues from the sources available to them was not taken advantage of by some States. For instance, New South Wales, which can be described as a rich State, collected in that way only £2 16s. 5d. per capita, whereas Tasmania collected £3 17s. 6d. The war has been over for two years and, excepting for additional amounts added to the original grant of £33,000,000, the same basis of allocation has been continued. I realise that when the original act was amended to provide for the payment of additional amounts to the States a different basis of distribution was agreed upon. The basis then adopted took into account the population of and the average wage existing in the various States, but it did not take into account the difficulties of the States arising from varying fertility, area and general wealth. Had it done so we would have obtained a distribution more in conformity with that adopted in connection with the proceeds of the petrol tax in which the area of the State as well as irs population is taken into account. With, all respect, I suggest that the time has arrived when the basis of reimbursement of the States should be thoroughly overhauled. Many factors that, at present are ignored must be taken into account. For instance, Victoria, which is a compact fertile State, may well get along with less per capita than Western. Australia, which has huge areas of very low value-som e of them comprising desert land-and other areas which can be developed into very fertile areas only at extraordinarily heavy cost. It is perfectly obvious that an amount that would be sufficient for Victoria on any basis of computation as to population or resources, would be absolutely insufficient for Western Australia and, to a less degree, for South Australia. I believe that the time has arrived when this matter must be carefully reexamined. I agree with the sentiments expressed by the honourable member for Denison (Dr Gaha) that under the present system little responsibility rests upon the State governments to budget within their means. In other words, I agree that governments of an extravagant kind can go ahead, as the Government of New South Wales is doing at present, budgeting deliberately for a deficit and finally approaching the Australian Government to bridge the gap. I believe it to be one of the basic principles of government that the government which expends the money should have some responsibility for raising it. That principle must he adhered to if we are to arrive at anything like a satisfactory solution of the difficulties the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States. The present system is bringing about a feeling of irresponsibility among State governments and also a feeling of superiority and domination on the part of the central government. We had an example of that at the last meeting of Commonwealth and State Ministers when the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States were under consideration. At that conference there were present representatives of both Labour and non-Labour viewpoints. It - was attended by the Libera] Premiers of South Australia and Western Australia and the Labour Premiers of New South Wales and the remaining States. It is curious that during the course of the discussion all the Premiers, irrespective of their political colour, supported certain proposals. .1 believe that the vote on one proposal resulted in six State Premiers voting in favour of a motion and the Prime Minister and Treasurer (Mr Chifley) voting against it, but the Prime Minister declaring the motion lost. That, state of affairs may suit those with Labour views; it may suit the miificationists; but it does not suit those who believe in the maintenance of the federal system. I am satisfied that the power of Government must be dispersed. There is great merit in the suggestion made by the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden) that some form of council should be established, somewhat on the lines of the Loan Council, to make decisions on these matters. But here again I direct attention to the fact that even in the Loan Council the Commonwealth is dominant. I do not believe that the federal system can operate satisfactorily whilst the federal authority remains dominant. Whilst I do not object to the increase of £5,000,000 proposed to be made available in this measure, for the reimbursement of the States, I believe that a committee should be established composed of representatives of the Commonwealth and the States to inquire fully into the financial arrangements, responsibilities and commitments of the various States, and that the committee, having assessed all these things, should make a recommendation to the Commonwealth designed to restore to the of States a field of authority in financial matters. Whilst in war-time the Commonwealth must be supreme and control the whole of the resources of the country, in peacetime the very reverse should be the case. In saying that, I believe I am expressing the views of the majority of the people of Australia. Whatever doubts they may have had about the question of federal dominance have been dispelled by the action taken by the Prime Minister and his Government in relation to the banking proposal which has just been passed by this House, and is now being considered by the Senate. The realization of the tremendous upsurge of opposition that came from all sections of the people in all parts of Australia should provide food for thought for the right honourable gentleman. I trust that the people will realise the trend that is taking place, that willy-nilly, without expressing it in explicit terms, the Government is gradually drawing to itself the whole of the powers and controls which rightly belong to the State parliaments. I make these observations because I believe that the need for a review of the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States is urgent. I hope that before we are called upon to pass another bill of this kind this subject will be examined and that proposals will be placed before us designed to give to the States, not only a more equitable share of the nnancial resources of this country, but also some field in which they can exercise their powers and rights as sovereign entities.",48
170,Mr LANG,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"Reid) [4.21] - This bill perpetuates the denial of sovereign rights to the States. The Commonwealth is using the uniform tax legislation to create a tax monopoly. State governments have been left with all the burdens of government and not the prerogative of government to raise revenue from those governed. That position is a repudiation of every known axiom of government. State parliaments can now carry on the work of government only to the extent that this Parliament permits them, through its allocation of revenue. If a State government desired to introduce endowment for the first child in a family, it cannot do so. The State parliaments no longer have the same powers as their own local-governing bodies. Eor instance, the Abercrombie shire council can impose its own taxation; the Metropolitan Water and Sewerage Board can fix its own levels of taxation; but the State Treasurers no longer have that power. This bill, and this principle, appear to me to be a complete violation of section SI of the Commonwealth Constitution, which provides that "" all revenues or moneys raised or received by the Executive Council of the Commonwealth shall form one Consolidated Revenue Fund, to be appropriated for the purposes of the Commonwealth in the manner and subject to the charges and liabilities imposed by this Constitution "". It was clearly the intention of those who framed the Constitution that the Commonwealth should have the right only to tax for the purposes of the Commonwealth. It could not raise money except for expenditure on those tilings that the Commonwealth had power to do. Such matters as education were specifically reserved for the States. Therefore, the States were to have the sole right of raising the necessary money to carry on their education systems, their bursaries, their welfare centres, and all matters incidental to education. The Commonwealth has no right to collect taxes and then say to the States, "" You are granted this sum of money and this sum only, for the purposes of carrying on your education system "". The Constitution is very clear, whatever certain justices for the time being may say. All revenue raised by the Commonwealth must be appropriated for the purposes of the Commonwealth. It cannot be appropriated for the purposes of the States, That view was very clearly expressed in evidence before the Royal Commission on the Constitution by two eminent constitutional lawyers, the late Mr E. M . Mitchell, KC., and Mr. Owen Dixon, now Sir Owen Dixon, a justice of the High Court. While the measure to impose uniform taxes might have been fully justified during the war, on the ground that the Commonwealth must have priority over all revenues for the purposes of conducting the war, that justification no longer exists. The Commonwealth and the States have their respective powers and responsibilities, and they must be in a position to give effect to them without interruption. It is not right for the Commonwealth to say: "" We have priority over taxation, and, therefore, we can increase our proportion to squeeze every penny of taxation out of the people, leaving nothing for the States"". That attitude is wrong. If the Commonwealth continues its present policy there can be only one end, the total abolition of the State parliaments. We cannot saddle, the State parliaments with the responsibility of providingthe essential services required by their peoples and leave them without the means of raising the revenue necessary to provide such services. We should uot use these taxing powers to create a super State, with the State parliaments as vassals of the Commonwealth without sovereign rights. This Government has a fetish for centralizing power in Canberra. Already some of the States are in serious financial trouble and are dependent upon "" hand-outs "" from the Commonwealth. That is the spirit of this bill. A rich, powerful centralized government is to hand, out charity to poor mendicants. The Australian Government is using its taxing power to maintain a Commonwealth dictatorship over all the Australian States. When the State Premiers come to Canberra to sit in conference they have to touch the forelock and bend the knee. If they are subservient they may wring some petty concessions from the Commonwealth Treasury, such as the lifting of the gold tax, which the Government agreed to at the recent conference at the request of the Western Australian Premier, Mr. MCLarty, to assist wealthy Western Australian gold-mining companies. If the States resist the Commonwealth dictatorship, they are liable to be beaten to their knees and to suffer nnancial strangulation. The financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States have undergone this revolutionary change during the last twenty years. The time is rapidly approaching when there must be a complete review of the powers and functions of the States. If they are to survive, some measure of sovereignty must be restored to them. If they are to die, then let it be a quick death, and not a process of slow torture and strangulation. We are now at the cross-roads. We must decide whether we will retain the federal system or not. The federation was based on the idea that in some matters Commonwealth action was desirable whilst in others a decentralized system of government should be retained. At that stage Australia adopted the Jefferson line of [781 thought in regard to the working of a federal system. The federation was to be based on the maximum of freedom for the individual member's comprising it, but now we have a new conception of government. This system is not unification as visualized by the Labour movement, but it contemplates the centralization of all power. The new conception is one of centralized dictatorship where every phase of our life is to be determined by the centralized bureaucracy. That dictatorship cannot function under a direct federal system. It needs a totalitarian of'ganization. Therefore the States are to be stripped of all their sovereign rights. Otherwise they might be in a position to resist and ward off the dictatorship. Uniform taxation is just as much an instrument of this new form of dictatorship as wage-pegging, prices control, rationing, licences for this, that and the other thing, production control and land sales control. The purpose of uniform taxation is not to simplify taxation and to make it easier for taxpayers to understand the basis of their payments and to make it easier for them to pay. Taxation procedure in Australia has never been more involved than it is today. The taxpayers have never known less about their legal obligations than they know today. The present system of taxation is vicious in both principle and operation. The purpose of uniform taxation is to create a taxing monopoly for the Commonwealth at the expense of the States in order to maintain the Canberra dictatorship. Under this system the amount of money received by each individual State has no relation to either the amount of money raised in the State or to the State's legitimate needs. The residents of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, where there are no parliaments, now pay an indirect State tax the proceeds of which may go to meet the needs of Western Australia, or even New South Wales. All this has been achieved under war-time emergency. It is typical of a monopoly-minded government. No government has ever had a more fervent faith in monopoly than this Government has. It has fostered monopoly at the expense of small business. It believes that the Commonwealth should have a monopoly of power and that this power should be exercised over the private lives of every citizen. Hitler believed in a similar system and called it national socialism. That system was founded on the doctrine of a centralized German government operating a series of State monopolies. The people of Australia have never expressed their approval of monopolistic government in the Commonwealth. When they had been consulted, as they have been on many occasions, they have almost invariably declared in favour of the retention of powers by the States. They have more faith that democracy will endure under federal system than under a centralized monopolistic government. Eor my part I question the validity of this bill. Whatever power the Commonwealth might have to raise revenue by the imposition of taxes, a clear obligation is laid upon it under the Constitution to pay the money so raised into the Consolidated Revenue Fund, and when the money has been paid into that fund it may be appropriated only for Commonwealth purposes. The purposes of the Commonwealth are clearly stated in the Constitution, particularly in section '51. The money proposed to be appropriated under this measure will be spent for many purposes outside the powers of the Commonwealth. Therefore, it is my contention that it is not lawful for this Parliament to appropriate money in this manner. That contention has been reinforced by the opinions of very eminent constitutional lawyers. Quite apart from the constitutional aspect, though, there is a vital aspect at stake. Our State parliaments must remain responsible governing bodies. Without the power to impose taxes they can no longer be regarded as responsible legislatures. If it is right for the Abercrombie shire council to exercise its own taxing power it is right for the Parliament of New South Wales, the Mother Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, also to have the right to impose its own taxes. I object to the title of the bill. It is wrong that money which is being expended for the legitimate purposes of the States, should be referred to as a Mr hang. grant. That is altogether a wrong attitude for this Parliament to take towards constituent States of the Commonwealth. It is not the lawful function of this Parliament to wreck the State parliaments by manipulating finance. Some of the State Premiers have already issued a grave warning that their treasuries will soon face a financial crisis. They have asked that their taxing powers be restored. The Commonwealth has refused this request, only because it is determined to put its own economic and financial policy into operation. But the time is rapidly approaching when this problem will have to be faced by this Parliament. a The direct taxing functions of the States will have to be defined, and their sovereign powers restored. The alternative is a complete Commonwealth dictatorship, and that is one thing which the Australian people cannot afford to tolerate.",50
171,Mr TURNBULL,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"Wimmera) [4.42] One honourable member described this as a most important bill, and I agree with that view, not because I oppose the greater allocation which is being made to the States as a reimbursement, but because I consider that the allocation, in view of the amounts which the Commonwealth collects from the States, is entirely inadequate. The honourable member for Denison (Dr Gaha) stated that he believes that this is the'most important bill which has come before this Parliament for a long time. He even considered that it was of greater importance than the Banking Bill. With that view, I do not agree, although I admit that there is some similarity between the Banking Bill and uniform income tax legislation. The banking legislation of 1945 gave to the Australian Government certain powers to control finance. The uniform income tax also gives to the Australian Government other powers to control financial policy. It only requires another move, like the Banking Bill, in connection with uniform income tax to give to the Australian Government sole control over every form of finance represented by taxation. Therefore, the similarity between those two measures is apparent, and, in that respect, I agree with the honourable member for Denison. But the honourable member for Denison went even further, and said that in wartime, it was only natural that the Commonwealth should acquire greater powers, because it had infinitely greater responsibilities. He added that when peace-time conditions return, this power would gradually revert to the States. However, that is not happening with uniform income tax. The States agreed to accept this system like many individuals agreed to accept restrictions, however distasteful, as a war-time measure, expecting those restrictions to be removed after the cessation of hostilities. ""When I returned to Australia, I found that many people believed that the States would recover their authority to impose income tax. Whether the uniform income tax legislation is valid, I cannot say, but the Commonwealth continues to enact it, to the detriment of the expansion of certain States.",52
172,Mr BARNARD,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"A former Premier of Victoria, Mr Dunstan, tested the validity of the uniform income tax legislation, and the High Court declared that the legislation was valid.",53
173,Mr TURNBULL,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"The former Labour Premier of Victoria, Mr Cain, asked the Treasurer (Mr Chifley) for a larger allocation, and he was granted an additional £2,000,000. With that amount, he had to be satisfied. I forecast that before long, the new Premier of Victoria, Mr Hollway, will make an urgent and persistent demand on the Treasurer for an increase of the allocation. A brief examination of the relevant figures will reveal the injustice which Victoria is suffering under uniform income tax. I am well aware that included in ihese figures are receipts from certain taxes which the Commonwealth was levying before the introduction of uniform income tax, hut they do not materially alter the situation. The Commonwealth collects from Victoria slightly more than £51,000,000 per annum, and returns by way of reimbursement to the State less"" than £9,000,000. According to reports in the press, the Treasurer has not seen fit to grant the amounts which the Government of Victoria requires for certain important irrigation projects. What we have to decide is whether it is better to expend money in the interests of Australia as a whole in a State like Victoria, which has progressed beyond the initial stages of development, than to put the money down the sink, as it were, in northern Queensland or northern Western Australia.",53
174,Mr EDMONDS,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"Any money invested in northern Queensland is not, put down the sink.",53
175,Mr TURNBULL,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"Once a State has reached a certain stage of development, we can achieve greater productivity more quickly with less expenditure than we can with more expenditure in States with less development. That is why the Government of Victoria has asked for a large grant for rehabilitation purposes, and for the development of the great Murray Valley. The honourable member for Herbert (Mr Edmonds) objected a few moments ago when I described the investment of money in northern Queensland as putting money down the sink. Some honourable members have stated that millions of pounds have been sunk in Queensland without an adequate return. I am not opposed to a fair distribution of this money, but I do object to a disproportionate allocation represented by collections totalling £51,000,000 and a reimbursement, of less than £9,000,000. That is wrong. Therefore, I enter an emphatic protest against the continuance of uniform income tax. One feature of this debate has been the unanimity among honourable members on both sides of the House that the present formula is unfair. Another point which has been made is that Australians gener ally are not satisfied with the way in which the Australian Government is expending its revenue from taxation. People are dissatisfied with the expansion of government departments, and the increasing number of public servants. Taxpayers believe that the Government should devote more attention to fostering primary production, which would serve the interests of Australia better than an expanded Public Service. Ever since I have been a member of this House, I have heard honourable members speaking of what occurred hundreds of years ago, and, of course, many honourable members opposite often speak of the financial and economic depression.",53
176,Mr EDMONDS,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,That was not hundreds of years ago.,54
177,Mr TURNBULL,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"No . It occurred in the early 'thirties. To-day, the honourable member for Denison propounded a scheme, for introduction in the distant future, embodying economic units throughout the country which would function somehow or other for the good of the people. The general trend of his remarks was that, under such a scheme, everybody would be happy and prosperous. What I have been endeavouring to find out since I became a member of this chamber is the Government's plans for the present. Many people delve into the past, or look into the future, and leave the present to look after itself. This is the time when the Prime Minister (Mr. Chifley) should act. Knowing that the formula is unfair, as honourable .members on both sides of the chamber have shown, the right honourable gentleman should realise that the time is ripe for a change. As a representative of Victoria, I look to the Prime Minister to make a definite Statement, or take some action along the lines which I have recommended. I do not .agree with the view of the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr. MCBride) that Victoria does not require so much money as, say, Western Australia. I did not become a member of the Parliament in order to agree with any honourable member, irrespective of his political beliefs, who made a statement which I did not consider was right.  the honourable member for Wakefield.",54
178,Mr TURNBULL,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"I often disagree with the Minister for Commerce and  he is right, and, on those occasions, I give him credit for it.",54
179,Mr BARNARD,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,Then the honourable member must agree with the Minister on this matter.,54
180,Mr TURNBULL,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"Yes . The Minister may assert that, in this matter, I am the judge and I give my opinion as I view the matter. If I did not act in accordance with the dictates of my conscience regarding what I 'believe to be right, I should be a. poor representative of the people.",54
181,Mr CHIFLEY,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,A man must have a conscience to begin with.,54
182,Mr TURNBULL,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"I fear that on some issues the right honourable gentleman has been without a conscience. My role in this debate does not call for a long speech. I definitely oppose the present formula, and urge the Prime Minister to increase the allocation to Victoria, and, indeed, to other States which contribute a major percentage of the collections from the uniform income tax. Before long, the new Government of Victoria will ask for a reconsideration of the formula, and, in this House, I shall strongly support its representations. I urge the Prime Minister to heed the remarks on this subject which honourable members on both sides of the House have made this afternoon. They have stated clearly that the present formula is unfair and inadequate for an expanding Australia.",54
183,Mr THOMPSON,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"Hindmarsh) [4.52]. - If I understood correctly the remarks of the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Turnbull), he expressed the hope that the time would come when the State which contributed the greatest percentage of revenue under uniform income tax would receive the greatest reimbursement. The blessing of uniform income tax is that it has caused us to abandon the "" little State"" idea, and act as Australians. When honourable members compare the allocations which the various States receive, they lose sight of the fact that, when the original apportionment was made approximately six years ago, the calculations were based on the amount which each State considered to be sufficient for it to collect from its people by way of income tax. I agree that, under the original allocation, Victoria suffered in comparison with other States, and that taxpayers in Victoria were obliged to pay more than they had paid under the dual Commonwealth State system of taxation. The honourable member for Wimmera condemned the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr MCBride), who said that Victoria did not require such a large allocation on a per capita basis, as did ""Western Australia or South Australia. I issue a warning that if we revert to the former system, we shall condemn some States permanently to an inferior position. Some honourable members, including the honourable member for Reid (Mr Lang), contend that under the uniform taxation legislation the States have lost their sovereignty and are practically dependent on the Australian Parliament for money with which to carry out their functions. It has been claimed that the States have been sacrificed to Commonwealth. What is the Commonwealth but the States? We represent the different States in the Australian Parliament. I regard the uniform tax as beneficial to South Australia and to thy South Australian people.",54
184,Mr MCBRIDE,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,Onl y since the honorthere able member's election to this House.,55
185,Mr THOMPSON,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"No . I always more favoured it. Long before I was elected to the House of Representatives, when the uniform tax was being introduced, I addressed meetings at which I explained how its operation would benefit the State and the individual State taxpayers. agree that the uniform tax does restrict the spending rights of the States in interest-earning directions, but land settlement schemes and irrigation schemes are financed, not from revenue, but from loan funds. So, I do not thirds the uniwas form tax will affect the Australian loan works programme.",55
186,Mr TURNBULL,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,It is already having that effect in Victoria.,55
187,Mr THOMPSON,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"The States are uniform tax. not unanimous on this subject. It is said that the apportionment of the proceeds of the uniform tax, as between Commonwealth and the individual is unfair, but what has been said today indicates clearly how difficult it is for the Commonwealth and State Treasurers .Playford Government. to evolve a system of tax reimbursement satisfactory to the States.",55
188,Mr MCBRIDE,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,To satisfy the Federal Treasurer is the greatest difficulty.,55
189,Mr THOMPSON,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"The Federal Treasurer is in a difficult position. Honourable members opposite press, on the one hand, for reduced taxes and, on sentatives. the other, for increased payments to the States from the proceeds of tax. How they can do both surpasses understanding. I wish honourable members opposite would be consistent. As the Treasurer pointed out, by way of interjection, the gap between revenue and expenditure last financial year had to be financed from loan funds. I agree that the formula on which the State3 are reimbursed cannot be regarded as perfect, and that something more in line with the desires of the Premiers could perhaps be evolved. I do not agree, however, that we the should revert to the old system, under which the Commonwealth raised money to meet its needs and the States money to meet their needs. In any event, the High Court has decided that the Commonwealth has first call on the people's money in the matter of taxes. After it had satisfied its needs in a State like South Australia, would not be much left for the State Government, and it would once be placed in an inferior position as compared with the more populous States of Australia, and, indeed, a position inferior to that which it occupies today. I do not wish to hark back unduly to the past, but twenty years ago, I when. South Australia was predominantly a primary-producing State, it was nonimpossible for the State government to levy high taxes, and it had difficulty in attracting secondary industries. As the result, the standard of living of its people lower than that of the people in the industrial States. The uniform tax has changed that. I hope that it will continue to operate. I know that the Premier of South Australia objects to the",55

192,Mr THOMPSON,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"Because of the way the seats in the Parliament of South Australia, have been distributed, it is almost impossible to depose the present Premier. About 42 per cent, of the people have 26 representatives and the remaining 58 per cent.' thirteen repre",55
193,Mr ACTING DEPUTYSPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC, Order !,55
194,Mr THOMPSON,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"I do not propose to continue that line of argument, but, when the honourable member claims that the return of the Playford Ministry to power indicates the South Australian people's opposition to the uniform tax, I must impress upon him that it was returned, not on that issue, but because of the manner in which the distribution of seats was made. We must bear in mind that we represent, not merely the people of our own States, but also the people of the whole of Australia, and that it is Australia that counts in the long run. Any system of taxation that places one State at an advantage and another at a disadvantage, keeping the second poor, as it were, must be avoided at all costs. I hope that I am a big enough Australian to be interested in the welfare of all people, not merely those whom I directly represent. The honourable member for Eeid referred to the need of the States revenue from taxation for educational purposes, but, under the system he favours, prosperous States would be able to spend on education much more per capita, than would other States not so prosperous, and that would condemn the children in the less prosperous States to education inferior to that conferred upon children in the more prosperous. My view is that every child in Australia, whether born or brought here, is entitled to be guaranteed a. high standard of education regardless of the part of Australia in which it may live. The history of taxation is one of evolution. Varying methods of taxation have been applied to meet, varying circumstances. We have evolved the uniform tax to meet present needs. I realise, however, that the apporthe tionment of the proceeds of the tax must be considered from time to time and brought into line with the needs of the individual States and Australia as a whole.",56
195,Mr HOLT,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"Fawkner) [5.7] - There are a few points that I desire to bring briefly to the notice of the House while it is considering this legislation. I find myself in agreement with honourable members on the Government side of the House, at least in respect of .some observations that they have made. That is a rare experience and one which is worthy of emphasis. The honourable member for Denison (Dr Gaha), for example, explained that this was a most important measure, and that the uniform tax represented one of the vital and formative elements in the constitutional history of Australia. While the conclusions that we may both have drawn from that point of view would differ, I believe most honourable members would share his view that the uniform tax, which was brought in as a matter of administrative convenience, has involved a constitutional revolution in Australia.. The urgency of the war factors that made it a desirable administrative sr.ep in the war years in order to gain the maximum finances for the purposes of war have passed so quickly by that we have not yet fully explored the the constitutional implications of what was then done. But at least it should have become clear to the thoughtful people of for Australia that the operation of the uniform tax has weakened tremendously the constitutional strength of the State parliaments and governments. That is a result that may be acceptable to many people. It may be acceptable to a majority of honourable members supporting the Government. But, to many other people, who have become alarmed by the centralizing tendency of the war years and concerned by the impact of a central bureaucratic control of the lives of the people, this development will not, appeal. They will desire to restore to the State parliaments much of the authority which has been whittled away from them by the operation of the uniform taxation legislation. I unhesitatingly place myself amongst those who desire to put gears in reverse so far as this matter is concerned. I say that, not as one giving expression to a reactionary political philosophy. I say it as one who came into this Parliament virtually a unificationist, desiring to see the powers of this Parliament increased, and desiring to see them exercised for the nation as a whole by a central authority; but the views which I brought here some years ago have been shaken by the experience of myself and others during the last few years. What I have seen happen in this country, and in this Parliament, has convinced me that the views which I then held were mistaken. An opinion which was held strongly by me when I came Stales Grants (Tax [20 into this Parliament has heen very much modified by what has happened in the last ten years.",56
196,Mr BAKAAKD,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"In other words, the honourable member is becoming more reactions. l ternary.",57
197,Mr HOLT,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"The Minister for ReConsequently, patriation (Mr Barnard) says that am becoming more reactionary. That is a popular expression with some honortively able members opposite. Por them, any one who is not a. socialist is a reactionary. .1 do not know how closely they have studied the political history of various countries, but if they made such a study they would find that the reactionaries were those who tried to increase the authere thority of ihe State-wh o tried to concertgard trate all power in the State-whereas the man who was fighting against reaction was the man who stood for the rights the individual.

Howthe ever. I do not propose to elaborate point further. What has happened as a result of the operation of the system of uniform taxaperly tion, and of the doctrinaire approach the Government to the matter, has given authority and strength to a centralized bureaucracy in Canberra, something which has not meant good government for the people as a whole. It is custoequally mary to talk of uniform taxation, that is a fallacious expression. What have in Australia today is not uniform taxation, but only uniform income taxavices. tion, and income tax is only a part, though an important part, of taxation u whole. I ask honourable members to the ponder the implications of that distincthe tion, because they have an important the tearing in Victoria, at any rate. Before the introduction of the present system, each State had developed a taxation system along lines which, in the opinion of successive governments, met the needs NOVEMBER, 1947.] Reimbursement) Bill 1947. 2411 of that State. In New South Wales, the people had become accustomed to a comparatively high rate of income tax, but to low rates of taxation in other direcI n Victoria, our income tax rate was lower, but we had a much higher per capita rate of other forms of taxation. when uniform taxation, so 1 called, was introduced, the people of Victoria had to carry, not only a comparaheavy burden of taxation other than income tax, but they had also t.o assume the uniform income tax rate levied throughout Australia as a whole, a rate which was higher than they hod been accustomed to. Therefore, a serious injustice has operated in Victoria, and is a. particular disadvantage in reto State social services. In those States where the income tax rate was low. it was open to the Parliament to impose of higher taxation in other directions in order to meet the cost of expanding l be social services, but that remedy was not available, to anything like the same extent, in those States where such taxation However, the matter goes deeper than that. Under the Constitution, the States have responsibilities which affect the people more directly in many respects of than do the responsibilities which, under Constitution, are exercised by this that Parliament. I refer in particular to health, education, police, and other domestic services, which are obviously and prothe direct responsibility of the State of parliaments. In recent years there has been a tremendous expansion of Commonwealth income, but no corresponding expansion of the income available to State Governments for expenditure on purposes as important as those upon which but Commonwealth revenue is expended. we Honourable members speak of the great expansion of Commonwealth social serThis Parliament has voted substantially increased amounts for invalid as and age pensions, widows' pensions and like, but those are social services of hand-out variety. I do not begrudge payment of those pensions, but, in im portance, they do not compare with such constructive social services as health and education. Commonwealth payments for social services are made, in the main, 'o the older groups of the population-r o those who have become' invalid, or who have reached the mature years of their lives. However admirable that, may be, they are not more important than expenditure on health and education for the benefit of the younger groups in the community. In their hands is the future of Australia, and if we have large amounts of money for expenditure on social services it should he expended proportionately upon those in the younger age groups. It is one of the evils of the expansion of Commonwealth revenues at the expense of the States in recent years that insufficient attention is being paid to health and education services and that, if anything, an extravagant provision is being made for social services at the other end of the scale.",57
198,Mr CHIFLEY,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,I understood that the honourable member was seeking to introduce an amendment to improve such services.,58
199,Mr HOLT,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"I do not wish the Prime Minister to misunderstand me, or to misinterpret me to others. I said that I did not begrudge the payment which the Commonwealth made for social services, but, if there is to be an expansion of social services, they should expand proportionately in those fields where the most good is likely to be achieved. However, this is not the place to engage in a detailed discussion on that matter. I merely make the point that one of the unsatisfactory effects of uniform taxation is that it deprives the States of the ability to expand their services as compared with Commonwealth services. I think it is fair comment to say that £1 spent by a State government is usually spent more profitably, because it has fewer pounds to spend, than if the money was spent by the Commonwealth Government. The honourable member for Reid (Mr. Lang) made a point of the centralization of bureaucracy in Canberra. My criticism is that the Government is clearly trying to perpetuate war-time emergency measures. I do not believe the people of Australia want to perpetuate the wartime bureaucracy. They have given every public indication that they are opposed to it, but the Government, on every possible pretext, seeks to perpetuate the sent bureaucratic administration. Wc have at present before the Parliament legislation designed to extend for. a further' period certain war-time emergency powers. We have been told thatsuch powers will be necessary for perhaps three or four years after the end of the war. Whatever doubts we may have had of the bona fides of the Government in seeking to retain those powers are strengthened when we remember that this Government is pledged to a socialist philosophy. We remember that it has only just recently forced through this House financial measures designed to enable it to implement its socialist philosophy. Therefore, we say that the Government is, obviously, determined to perpetuate the bureaucracy centralized in Canberra. I believe that a centralized bureaucracy, working from Canberra, involves red tape, obstruction, restrictions and repression of the rights of Australian citizens. The present tendency should be reversed. We should decentralize not only our industries,, but also our administration. Instead of strengthening the administrative authority of Canberra, we should strengthen the administrative authority of the States and municipalities, which affect community life so intimately. I make those points because, although we have not the opportunity to examine them more closely now, they must be examined at some time in the future, because involved in them are some of the most important constitutional issues which this country will have to face.",58
200,Mr BOWDEN,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"Gippsland) [5.25] As a Victorian, it is natural that I should look at this problem through different coloured glasses from those through which the honourable member f.jr Hindmarsh (Mr Thompson) and those other honourable members who represent States which benefit from the uniform income tax, including the less populous States, viewed it. It was most noticeable that the bill to provide for uniform taxation passed through this House with the greatest possible ease because honourable members representing the less populous States believed that it would benefit their electors. Yet we have the spectacle today of practically every State Premier opposing the scheme. That brings into focus pre- the statement of the honourable member for Hindmarsh that the federal sphere is really the sphere of the States. It is nothing of the kind; the federal sphere is merely part of the federal system which depends upon co-operation between States and the Commonwealth. On the second last occasion on which a conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers was held every Premier was fighting with the Prime Minister in an effort to induce him to modify his hold on the taxes collected from the people and to allocate a little more to the State. He told them what they had to take; he gave them that and not what they wanted. It is obvious that if this evolutionary process of taxing the people, about which the right honourable gentleman spoke so glibly, is to benefit humanity, it can only do so provided the States are given an opportunity to develop production within their own borders. As a. Victorian I admit that the claims of the less populous States to develop their own resources and to provide their own facilities are reasonable; but at the same time. I say that if this country is ever to become great those places where the natural resources exist, must naturally be first developed. We have in Victoria, as the Prime Minister knows, an area known as the Latrobe Valley, with natural resources which ultimately must make it as valuable as the Ruhr Valley in Europe, not in our time, possibly, but at some future date. Those resources may be developed, not because of the inclination of the people to provide the money for their development, but according to the whim of those who exercise control in the federal sphere as the result of what is misnamed uniform taxation. There may be some uniformity in the collection of the tax, but there is far from uniformity in its distribution. En passant, may I cite a few figures to show what has happened since this tax was introduced. In Victoria in 1946-47 collections of uniform income tax amounted to £42,746,000, and in New South Wales to £67,190,000. Overall tax collections in Victoria amounted to £51,090,000 and in New South Wales to £72,545,000. But note the distribution! Out of the £51,090,000 Victoria received £8,S60,000, and out of the £72,545,000 New South Wales received £16,477,000. These figures show how disproportionate are the distributions to the collections. There is no uniformity in that. I do not believe that the Prime Minister will claim that New South Wales is more capable of beneficial national development than is Victoria. Victoria enjoys the advantage of being a small compact State, very rich in resources, and with a large population, and consequently it would have greater opportunity for development by the expenditure of itsown money than would be thecase of the less populous States. I point out that when the party led by Mr Cain was in opposition in the Victorian Parliament it was wholeheartedly in favour of uniform taxation. It regarded that method of collecting taxes as the grandest innovation that had ever been devised. Yet when Mr Cain's Government assumed office in Victoria and accepted all the responsibilities that go with office, it immediately became a hot gospeller "" for a better distribution of the proceeds of uniform tax than is accorded to Victoria today. Every government, whether a Labour or a non-Labour government, has an obligation to develop, to the maximum of its capacity, the resources of the State which it controls, and it cannot do so if it is hamstrung because of the lack of money, not of insufficiency of money paid by way of taxes, but because the central government does not dole out sufficient of the revenue collected from the people of the State to enable its development to proceed. The Cain Government was obliged to increase railway fares, which it should not have had to do, because it could not obtain sufficient money out of the taxes collected Ivy it to meet the railway deficit. The governments of the other States are placed in the same position. Apart altogether from the claims made by the less populous States for a better distribution of the proceeds of the uniform income tax, moneys are disbursed to the States under the Federal Aid Roads Agreement. The more populous States have made heavy contributions towards the building of roads in the less populous States. We do not complain about that; but Western Australia has no Latrobe Valley and, naturally, if that area is to be developed in the national interest as well as in the interests of Victoria, surely it is a matter for the Commonwealth to say, "" Here is where we can improve Australia vastly by developing one of its great natural resources"". The unanimity among the States which the honourable member for Hindmarsh talks about is non-existent. There is unanimity only in the demand that the uniform income tax scheme either be abolished or considerably modified. I am a reasonable man. I admit that the Prime Minister has to meet national obligations transcending in importance any small local State affairs. He has to provide for those obligations and to collect money from all the States for that purpose and to decide what allocations of money to the States can then be made; but in fixing the State allocations he should endeavour to ensure that the greatest possible national development is achieved. That is the only way in which this evolution in taxation principle can be of benefit, to mankind."" To illustrate what I mean I want to refer for the moment to what was achieved in the United States of America during the war period. Because the 4S American States were given an opportunity to develop their own States and were not compelled to depend on the central government, they were able, in a year, to supply the greater part of the civilized world with all the materials necessary to fight the war. If they had not been in that position things would have gone badly for the allied nations. If Victoria were able to develop its natural resources that State would be able to deliver the goods; but, it will never be able to do so as long as it has to depend on the whims of a government sitting in Canberra, remote from the centres of necessary development. The Prime Minister will have to face another battle in the near future. The hungry Premiers will again shortly demand money. I want him to approach the consideration of this subject in a more humane manner, not to tell the Premiers that they are talking a lot of "" ruddy "" nonsense, as he did on a former occasion, but to consider the problems of the States from the viewpoint, of the States. All the State Premiers have the interests of their State at heart, and the interest the States as a whole is the interest of the Commonwealth. The States comprise an integral entity, and what is beneficial to one must, be of benefit to the other. I ask the right honourable gentleman to reexamine the distribution of the proceeds of uniform income tax collections, with Ur. Bowden. a view to ascertaining whether it is not possible for him to give to the States a better opportunity to develop their natural resources.",58
201,Mr HAMILTON,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"Swan) [5.35] - At the last conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers, the Premier of Western Australia made a valiant effort to induce the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) to increase the allocations of uniform income tax to the States from £40,000,000 to £'«0,000,000. He submitted a case which was supported in its entirety by the Premiers of the other States, hut all his persuasiveness did not move the right, honourable gentleman. At first he offered them an additional £4,000,000, and, after further pressure had been exerted upon him, lie saw fit to give them an additional £.1,000.000, making the increase £5,000,000. I admit that in Western Au=tralia we have no Latrobe Valley. T imagine that, the Latrobe Valley is situated in the electorate of the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Bowden).",60
202,Mr BOWITEN,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,A pretty good guess.,60
203,Mr HAMILTON,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"Western Australia, however, comprises an area representing approximately one-third of the area of Australia, much of it very rich in natural resources. Western Australia suffers greatly from its isolation, and the vast, distances which, have to be traversed within its borders. Its isolation makes it dependent, to a great degree, upon the eastern States, particularly in its present state of development. Western Australians are developing their State at a time of high costs, whereas the eastern States were able to achieve the major portion of their development at a time when costs were reasonably low. To expect the Commonwealth Grants Commission to assess the whole of the requirements of the less populous States is placing too much responsibility on that body, and the recommendations of the commission are not always accepted by of the Treasurer. In the bill which will be placed before us shortly provision will be made for a grant to Western Australia which is £500,000 less than that recommended by the commission.",60
204,Mr CHIFLEY,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,Oh no.,60
205,Mr HAMILTON,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"At the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers, in replying to either Mr MCLarty, the developed side by side. Premier of Western Australia, or Mr. MCGirr, the Premier of New South Wales, the Prime Minister saidJ have never heen able to ascertain three smaller States bother arguing about regaining the right to impose taxation. they were given all the taxing powers they want they would still not be able to meet needs about which Mr MCLarty, Mr Cosgrove  ceived an increase of tax reimbursement, Commonwealth Grants Commission would reduce correspondingly the amount which i recommended they should receive. In its fourteenth report, the Commonreally wealth Grants Commission recommended that Western Australia should receive £2,400,000. The Government proposes make available an amount of only £1,900,000, a difference of £500,000. Yet, the Prime Minister told State miers that, if they had full taxation rights, the Commonwealth Grants Commission would make corresponding reducthat tions in its recommendations.",60
206,Mr CHIFUEY,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,That is not right.,61
207,Mr HAMILTON,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"Ha d it been able to collect its own taxes at pre-war rates, Western Australia would have received £1,000,000 more than it has received 194.6-47. That amount of money would work in the State. go a long way in the development of the south-west corner of Western tralia, which is claimed by Western tralians, and by visitors from all over world, to have a future equal to that two Chicagos or even two Californias. Whether or not that claim is reasonable is another matter. It would be the equal in wealth-producing capacity, but unformission tunately money is not available within the State for the necessary developmental work in the area. Money for the purpose would need to be made available by the Commonwealth, particularly as it has full taxing power. This Parliament should also take consideration the defence aspect. Western Australia comprises one-third of the whole area of the Commonwealth, and year parts of the State are very vulnerable to attack. If it is intended to expend money there on defence projects, such as the. provision of a naval base, aeroreason dromes or army establishments, it will also be necessary to locate some heavy industries in the State, for defence jects and heavy industries must be This would involve substantial expenditure. If the Commonwealth intends to retain complete control of taxation it must be prewhy the pared to spend more money in Western Australia or to reimburse the State more If generously. The Commonwealth Grants the Commission should be requested to inquire into the matter, having in mind redefence needs. Expenditure at Albany, the in order to make that harbour fully t satisfactory for naval purposes, would be amply justified. Albany is the only deep-sea port between Melbourne and Wyndham that could be converted into a naval base without huge expendito ture, but to carry out such a project the expenditure of some money would be necessary. I reiterate that defence proPrejects and the establishment of heavy industries must go hand in hand. I impress upon the Prime Minister the reimbursement being made to Western Australia is very much below the requirements of the State. The sooner the Commonwealth increases the amount the better it will be for all concerned, and the better will be the prospect of for undertaking adequate developmental",61
208,Mr CHIFLEY,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"Macquarie-Prime AusMinister and Treasurer) [5-44],- m Ausreply-Some honourable members who the have spoken in this debate do not seem of to realise the true position. The honourable member for Swan (Mr Hamilton), for instance, referred to recommendations of the Commonwealth Grants Comwhich, he said, the Government had not accepted. When I tabled the report of the commission a few days ago I intimated that the Government intended to give full effect, to its recomthe mendations. The commission stated in its report that its recommendations had into been made on the assumption that the tax reimbursements to the claimant States would be on the same basis this as last year, and that if these were varied the special grants to be recommended to the States concerned would need to be adjusted accordingly. It was for that that I said I wondered why the three States involved considered it necessary to argue the matter, because so prolong as the uniform taxation arrangement continued in force they knew where they stood. I question whether these States would be any better off if they had complete freedom to impose taxes. I have said, at conferences of Commonwealth and State Ministers, and also on other occasions, that I considered it to be the duty of the Commonwealth .and of the more financially fortunate States to assist the less fortunate States. I have never departed from that attitude. I do not take credit to this Government alone for having observed the recommendations of the Commonwealth Grants Commission. The fact is that every Australian Government has done so. The point I make, however, is that when the claimant States had complete freedom to impose whatever taxes they desired,, they still were unable to meet their financial needs, and they even then applied to the Commonwealth for financial assistance. I have put that point of  Premiers. The only disadvantage that E can see that these States suffer from by reason of the operation of the Commonwealth Grants Commission is that, whereas the amount of tax reimbursement that they receive is fixed, the amount of grant that may come to them as the result of recommendations of the commission may vary from year to year. The Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden) is, I believe, sincere in his approach to the subject of the financial relations of the Commonwealth and States; but I could not help feeling that he spoke with his tongue in his cheek when he referred to the practicability of ensuring harmony in this matter by the 'adoption of certain methods. The right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes), who has been a member of the Commonwealth Parliament since its inception, knows better than most of us that the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States have always, been unsettled. The right honourable gentleman can. go back, in personal knowledge, to what has - been described as the "" Braddon blot"". must confess that I have been somewhat disillusioned by the remarks of the Leader of the Australian Country party. I believe that at times, while he was Commonwealth Treasurer, he en- Council. ifr. Chifley. deavoured to secure some kind, of an agreement between - the Commonwealth and States on financial matters.",61
209,Mr FADDEN,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,I did try;,62
210,Mr CHIFLEY,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,But without success ?,62
211,Mr FADDEN,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,I did not succeed. There were too many Labour Premiers to deal with.,62
212,Mr CHIFLEY,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"The right honourable gentleman, of course, is well aware of the difficulties of the problem. I fear that these difficulties will have to be faced for a long while to come. There will always be a feeling among different people that some States receive too much and some too little help from the Commonwealth. Somethinghas been said about a formula. Payments to the States are not based, as has been said, on the income tax which the States collected in pre-war years. That principle ivas abandoned in July, 1946. The Premiers have never been able to agree on many points associated with uniform taxation. The former Prime Minister, Mr Curtin, and I attended a conference in Melbourne on one occasion in an endeavour to reach an agreement with the States on this subject, but the proposals submitted to the conference were unanimously rejected. The Government was therefore obliged to proceed along other lines. The action which it took was tested in the High Court, and in the resultant judgment the court held that, oven apart from the defence power, the Commonwealth had priority in the collection of taxes.",62
213,Mr FADDEN,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,The High Court decided that it was a permanent power.,62
214,Mr CHIFLEY,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"The decision of the High Court, did not deprive the States of the right to impose income tax. - Mr FADDEN - That is so, but the Commonwealth has priority.",62
215,Mr CHIFLEY,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"Exactly , the Commonwealth has priority under its tax power and not under its defence power. However, these matters are not new. I I did not introduce the lengthy discussions which have taken place for many years between Commonwealth and State Treasurers, not only about the uniform income tax, but also about the Loan",62
216,Mr THOMPSON,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"The position, has altered very much.",63
217,Mr CHIFLEY,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"If anything, the business of the Loan Council has been transacted more expeditiously in recent years than it was before. I emphasize that the States did not agree to the introduction of the uniform income ax. In addition, they did not agree to the amount which we finally decided to allocate to them. But they did agree to the method of distribution. I refer now, particularly, to the latest arrangement under which the amount for distribution was increased from £34,000,000 to £40,000,000. Here again, I make it clear that the States did not agree to the amount of £40,000,000, but they did agree upon the method of distribution. one of the conferences, we devised a formula. The State Premiers did not agree to the base amount. I shall not attempt to explain to honourable members the formula which will come into operation next year, because it is complex and I doubt whether honourable members have given sufficient study to the subject to be able to appreciate a full explanation of it. As the subject is so complicated, I might not be able to explain it lucidly enough for honourable members to understand its effect. However, the formula will come into operation nexl? year, and the State Premiers have agreed to it. Mr FADDEN,-The Premiers agreed to the formula, but not to the quantum.",63
218,Mr CHIFLEY,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"That , is correct. The Premiers did not agree to the quantum.",63
219,Mr FADDEN,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,They agreed to the cut up. but not to the goose.,63
220,Mr CHIFLEY,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"The formula provides for the aggregate amount to be increased as from the next financial yea.r relation to population and the national income. There are also certain other qualifications in regard to the size and area of the States. The States also agreed on the method of distributing the last allocation. This year we increased it by £5,000,000. Some honourable members opposite appeared to consider that an additional £5,000,000 is rather niggardly. Personally. I regarded it as rather generous, and some of my colleagues, who attended these discussions not with the 'States, considered, when I increased the amount by £1,000,000, that I was over-generous. I realise that the Commonwealth Grants Commission did recommend certain payments to various States, but there was a provision that if those States received an additional amount from the Commonwealth by way of reimbursements, the original grant would be reduced hy a corresponding sum. That is being done. However, the total available for reimbursement to the States was increased this year by £5,000,000. In the next financial year, the formula will begin to operate. As the States have agreed to the formula no difficulty will arise in that respect. If next year, under this forAt mula, the States would receive less than £45,000,000, the amount will be built up to £45,000,000. If the formula entitles them to more than £45,000,000, they will teceive the additional amount.",63
221,Mr BURKE,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,The formula is based upon the growing expenditure of the States.,63
222,Mr CHIFLEY,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"The formula is based upon population and national income. It is most complex. I remind the House that the development of the States has nor been dependent upon their revenue derived from income tax. Many taxpayers, under the uniform income tax, are paying less tax than they did in 1938 under the dual system of Commonwealth and State income tax. The development of the States has been dependent upon loan money, and the principle which governs the allocation of loan money to the States has not been altered. What has happened is that, in the past, the banks informed the Loan Council how much money the States could expend upon developmental works. That in has not happened since I , as Treasurer, have represented the Commonwealth at meetings of the Loan Council. During World War II . the States were not able to expend their allocationsfrom the Loan Council. While they decreased their indebtedness, the Commonwealth's indebtedness went sky-high. Another point is that, the States' interest payments have fallen. As I stated, the banks formerly told the Loan. Council how much loan money the States might expend on developmental works.",63
223,Mr FADDEN,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,That did not happen when I was Treasurer.,64
224,Mr SPENDER,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,It did not happen as late as 1940.,64
225,Mr CHIFLEY,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"The honourable member for ""Warringah (Mr Spender), a former Commonwealth Treasurer, has some knowledge of this matter. As the Leader of the Australian Country party remarked, all the States had to do was to out up the goose. The right honourable gentleman will recall that the Commonwealth pays one-half of the sinking fund in respect of loan moneyf o r developmental works. Since the end of the war, the States have not been able to expend ail the loan money for what they themselves regard as necessary works. Honourable members should bear that fact mind.",64
226,Mr FADDEN,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"As a matter of fact, the States were unable to spend their allocations because of the lack of and materials.",64
227,Mr CHIFLEY,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,Yes . The amount which they could obtain for developmental purposes was measured only by their physical capacity in men and materials. 997)That position has never arisen previously in the history of the Loan Council.,64
228,Mr FADDEN,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,It has only happened now because the States are unable to obtain man-power and materials for their d e v e 1 o p m en t al w o rks.,64
229,Mr CHIFLEY,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"I shall not weary House with any more details. The sion Leader of the Australian Country party advocated the formation of a new authority. In my opinion, that body would deprive the Parliament of the Commonwealth of its sovereignty. The expenditure of Loan money for defence purposes is not subject to the consent of the Loan Council. If the organization reported. which the right honourable gentleman recommended were established, Commonwealth Budget would be subject to its review.",64
230,Mr FADDEN,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,That was not suggested. It was to be just a pattern of the Loan Council.,64
231,Mr CHIFLEY,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"D e f e n c e expenditure from loan funds is not subject to review by the Loan Council, and Commonwealth expenditure on works has been small. 1 adopted. make these few points because some people become rather confused about the in formula for reimbursements to the States under the uniform income tax legislation. The only difference, although it is very important, is the total amount allotted for distribution between t,he States. The States agreed among themselves to the method of distribution, although I emphasize again that they did not agree to the base figure. However, they reached an agreement on the method of distribution and submitted their proposal to me for approval. I did approve, and that is the basis upon which the distribution will be made.

I do not need to add that the Leader of the Australian Country party in this House has a strenuous task. I know, myself, as Leader of the Opposition, the work involved. Every honourable member will be delighted to know that some small provision is to be made for him. I therefore, support the bill.",65
237,Mr SPENDER,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"Warringah) [8.8] I echo the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies), hut I do not think we can consider increased allowances to members of the Parliament without having regard to the needs of other sections of the community. We only recently increased the allowances of honourable members of this House and we have increased the salaries of permanent public servants. To-night we are asked to assent to-and I freely give my assent-a n allowance for the leader of the third party. It seems to me that all tliese payments rest on the need to adjust allowances in accordance with the in creased cost of living. One section of the community that seems to have no regard paid to its needs by the Government is the small investors, the small landlords. Landlords are regarded as capitalists by members of the Australian Labour party; but I direct the attention of the Government to the plight of the widow with a small amount of money invested in a. few houses from which she receives an income, the purchasing power of which diminishes as years go by. Her rental is fixed on the basis of rents in 1939. She cannot be granted an increase of rents by the Fair Rents Court except Mr SPEAKER,-Order !

244,Mr ANTHONY,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"Richmond) [8.12] - it. While I approve of the proposal that leaders of parties of ten or more in this House should be paid an allowance of £400 a year, I believe that a long-distance view should be taken cf the matter, and that we should take into consideration the state of affairs which may obtain in future years. Eor example, the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) is at present the leader of a party with 49 members. If , after the next general election, he. should lose 40 of his supporters, and be the leader of only nine-whic h in all probability will be the case-wil l the Prime Minister, as the leader of the new opposition of nine members, be entitled to no allowance at all? I realise that the Prime Minister is doing his utmost to reduce the strength of his party from 49 to fewer than ten. As I look across the chamber at the Government supporters, I could name one member after another who, if we may judge by the result of the Victorian elections",66
245,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"Order ! The honourable member has said that he is taking a long-distance view. As a matter of fact, he is alreadv too far away from the bill. Mr CHIFI.EV - When this matter was last discussed in the House, I promised to give serious consideration to the point now covered by the bill.",66
246,Mr ANTHONY,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"I have mentioned that the present number of the Government party is 49, and I have referred to the possibility that it might be only nine in future.",66
247,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,Order ! That has nothing to do with the bill.,66
248,Mr ANTHONY,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,I am speaking straight to the point.,66
249,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,The Chair thinks otherwise.,66
250,Mr ANTHONY,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"The Chair should look at the bill. Mr SPEAKER,-Order ! If the honourable member continues to defy the Chair, he must resume his seat. I have looked at the bill. If the honourable member wishes to make a burlesque of the debate, the Chair is not disposed to allow him to do so. The bill consists of only two clauses, and most honourable' members ought to be able to understand",66
251,Mr ANTHONY,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"The bill provides that the leader of a political party of not fewer than ten members, of which no member is a Minister of State, shall receive an allowance. I am visualizing, as I am entitled to do, the possibility of there being a party in this House consisting of fewer than ten members. The Australian Country party may be returned after an election with fewer than ten members, or the Liberal party may have fewer than ten members. However, I was referring to the greater possibility that the Labour party might come back after the next election with fewer than ten members. I should like to know why this number ten has been arbitrarily chosen. Is it the opinion of the Prime Minister and the Government that the Australian Country party, which is the party obviously affected by the bill, will never have fewer than ten members in this House? I hope that the Prime Minister is correct in his estimate, and 1 agree with him that the Australian Country party will (probably be stronger in the years ahead. However, I am concerned over the position of parties in this House which may have fewer than ten members. The honourable member for Reid (Mr Lang) entered this House as a lone member. As one looks around the chamber, one realizes the possibility that honourable members who are somewhat doubtful of their position today, particularly in view of the recent banking legislation, may be prepared to entrust their political fortunes to the honourable member for Reid. He may be able to recruit seven supporters, so that his party, including himself, would number eight. I believe that the honourable member for Reid is of such calibre that, if he led a party of eight members in this House, he would be entitled to an allowance of £400 .a year. I remind you, Mr. Speaker, that there was at one time in this House a notable and virile party known as the Lang party, which did not' number ten.",66
252,Mr SPEAJXER,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"The honourable member cannot "" get away with it "" by flattering the Chair.",67
253,Mr ANTHONY,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"I did not .really intend to flatter the Chair; but if the Ohair bakes that view of it I must accept the situation. I was pointing out, that - in 1937, when I came into this Parliament, there were here seven or eight members of what was known as the Lang party, led by Mr Beasley. You yourself, Mr Speaker, were a distinguished member of that party. 1 see others in the chamber. The Chairman of Committees, the honourable member for Darling (Mr Clark), was also a member.",67
254,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,'Order ! We are not dealing with the past; we are dealing with the present or the future.,67
255,Mr ANTHONY,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"But the past is a good indicator of the future, and it is possible that we may have another Lang party in this House. It is also possible that we may have another minority partysitting in sole opposition to the Government. What I want to know from the Prime Minister is, by what process of mathematics he a-rrived at the figure of ten members of a party as the number which would qualify the leader of that party to draw an honorarium. If six members of a party each represented 60,000 electors, they would represent a total of 360,000 people and thus be not a negligible group in this House. The loader of such a party would have to prepare his speeches in opposition to or in favour of the legislation presented to the Parliament. Why should any discrimination be made as to the number of members lie must lead before he becomes entitled to the allowance? The number stated in the bill is.but an arbitrary figure. The Leader of the Australian Country party is entitled to very much more than he is now to receive, especially in view of the allowances drawn by some Ministers. I do not propose to labour the matter. 1 merely say that if a number must be ar-bitrarily chosen, let it be less than ten. It is not inconceivable that before very long a party will be in sole Opposition, the numbers - of which will not exceed ten.",67
256,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"Barker) [S.2S] - May I .say that the conditions visualized .by the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) are not likely to occur; but if they do occur, we have a suitable precedent to guide us in these matters. When the Australian Labour party met its last great Waterloo in December, 1931, it came back from the elections the weakest party in the House. If it should come back from the next elections as the honourable member for Richmond, hopes, as the weakest party in the House, its position will be safeguarded then, as it was in .1.931, by the fact that the leader of that party would be the Leader of the Opposition. In 1-932, when the Lyons Ministry was formed, the United Australia party had an absolute majority of all the members of the House of Representatives, and it exercised its right to form a completely United Australia party ministry. No members of the Country party were included in that ministry. The Australian Labour party was then the weakest of the three parties in the House, and it was rendered still weaker by the fact that its members were .split between the official Australian Labour party and what was then known colloquially as the Lang Labour party. The number of both branches of the party was then fewer than ten. That position obtained until I came here in 1934. On that occasion the Australian Country party exercised its right to sit on the cross benches and did not demand that it be regarded as the official opposition. If these circumstances should be repeated after the next elections, which is not impossible, and the Labour party comes hack as the weakest of the three parties in the House, my friends in the Australian Country party would he prepared and most anxious to adopt the same attitude as they did in 1932, and allow the Leader of the Australian Labour party to assume the title and functions of the Leader of Opposition.",67

260,Mr HARRISON,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"Wentworth) [8.30]. part - The Minister for Repatriation (Mr. Barnard) said, in his second-reading This bill brings provisions for control of funds under - the Australian Soldiers' Act. The existing provisions are the National Security (Patriotic Funds) Regulations under the Defence (Transitional ProI wondered then whether the real purpose of the measure was to retain control was of patriotic funds within the federal Power exists in all the States under which State authorities, in the exercise of their sovereign rights, may concertain classes of patriotic funds. It apparent, therefore, that this bill represents another effort by the Commonwealth unto exercise powers which should be left to the States. Like other honourable members, I have examined this measure carefully, and I have formed the opinion that the Government is making an effort to grab-and I use that term advisedly - al l patriotic funds, particularly those of ex-servicemen's organizations. Every ex-service member of this House should be a be interested in this matter. It must be realized that many patriotic funds have been raised, by voluntary subscriptions, for specific purposes, and large amounts have been placed in the hands of ex-servicemen's organizations in order to assist ex-service men and women. Yet, such as has the bill providesGovernor-General may make regulations to{a) the establishment of patriotic funds: I (6) the raising of moneys and acquiring of assets for patriotic funds; (c) the control and distribution of moneys and assets raised or acquired by patriotic funds: . (d) the winding-up of patriotic funds ami disposal of the assets and moneys of the funds: and (c) the provision of penalties, not exceeding a fine of Fifty pounds or imprisonment for six months, for any breach of the regulations. Despite anything that the Minister has said, or that he may say, on this subject, J. can find no provision in the bill which exempts any patriotic fun d whatsoever from coming under the control of the Repatriation. Commission, which is, in effect, government control.",68
261,Mr CONELAN,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"It is a good thing that nobody takes any notice of what the honourable member for ""Wentworth says.",69
262,Mr HARRISON,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"The honourable member for Griffith (Mr Conelan) has had no experience of any kind in the services, and, for that, reason, he must be regarded as incapable of expressing the views of ex-servicemen. The bill provides that the control shall extend to all patriotic funds, buildings, properties, trust moneys, moneys bequeathed under wills, and .moneys raised by voluntary subscription for the express purpose of helping ex-servicemen through their own organizations. The administration of such funds is to be removed from the bodies concerned, and transferred to the Repatriation Commission. Ex-servicemen's organizations and other patriotic bodies have invested money in bonds and loans for specific purposes, and there is no assurance whatsoever in this measure that the Repatriation Commission will give effect to the specific purposes to which the money should be applied. I have been in touch with many ex-servicemen's organizations' on this subject, and have spoken with representatives of ex-servicemen who have taken part in recent conferences which have been called to discuss this measure. These all consider that the bill is quite inadequate and does not contain safeguards even, indeed, if it could be agreed, which is not the case, that such a measure is necessary. These organizations consider that some provisionmust be included in the measure specifically to exempt, their funds from controls which could be exercised if the bill is passed in its present form . I hope that the Minister will deal with this point in his speech in reply to this debate. It is essential that the interests of ex-servicemen should be protected in this regard. The organizations concerned should have power vested in them to use funds which have been raised voluntarily to fulfil the purposes for which they were raised. It is not, a sufficient answer to say that the Repatriation Commission will have authority, for we all are well aware that whereas when the commission was first established it consisted of men who had had experience in the various services and were thus well informed of the disabilities of ex-servicemen and of the problems associated with their rehabilitation, it has now been converted into a branch of the Public Service and its officers are under the authority of the Public Service Board. For this reason it may happen fhat, in the future, public servants may be appointed to the commission's staff who will not be ex-servicemen and will not be informed of the peculiar problems and disabilities of ex-servicemen. .In his second-reading speech the M in ister stated that funds such as those of the Australian Red Cross Society, the Royal Australian Naval Relief Fund and the Royal Australian A i r Force Welfare Fund would continue to function in definitely. Presumably, therefore, these are the only patriotic funds of ex-servicemen that will not be subject to the controls contained in the bill. The tendency of the Australian Government is to socialize everything within its reach, and the extent of its grasp on all kinds of activities cannot be ignored. A representative at one conference of ex-servicemen expressed the view that the Commonwealth was taking power to nationalize patriotic funds. Certainly the provisions of this measure give power to the Government, through the Repatriation Commission, to assume control of all patriotic funds. One of the greatest sources of revenue which the Government could seize through the commission would be the funds of ex-servicemen's organizations of various kinds, some of which are the result of contributions made throughout the period covered by two world wars. For many years these patriotic bodies have controlled their funds capably and efficiently and have disbursed the money entrusted to them in a most effective manner. The Eeturned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, for example, is a. patriotic organdonations, ization which has accumulated funds assets totalling approximately £2,500,000. That is no inconsiderable amount. This organization is well able to control own funds. A part of its funds consists of a distress fund from which disbursein ments are made every day. This fund of the very sinews of the organization, and no organization could distribute the funds more effectively than they are being distributed at present. This fund contains approximately £10,000 in cash, and £6,000 in bonds. The assets of league include ANZAC House, which is worth about £400,000, and the land, which is worth about £100,000. These assets were donated by the Government of New South Wales. Only recently, Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, at its annual conference, expressed concern this legislation under which the control of patriotic funds will be vested in Repatriation Department. The delegates, who represented all the sub-branches of the league, and who reflected a wide tion of ex-servicemen's opinions, conturning tended,that the funds of this organization were provided by voluntary subscription for ex-servicemen, and that ex-serviceThis men's organizations were the most approThe priately fitted bodies to administer to needs of those requiring assistance from its funds. I come now to a section which was created for the relief of ex-servicemen, and for purposes associated, with exservicemeji's affairs. There are the New funds which were raised for the men of the Sth Division and which accumulated during the long imprisonment of the men for whose assistance they were outlinematters, designed.",69
263,Mr BLAIN,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,Why did the Australian Red. Cross Society retain that money stead of devoting it to the purposes which it was collected ?,70
264,Mr HABBISON,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"May I correct honourable member for the Northern surer, Territory (Mr Blain), and point out that many of these funds have retained money for the purpose of assisting bers of the Sth Division in the event of them becoming distressed. M.r. BLAIN - Who held the funds?",70
265,Mr HABBISON,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"They made some with which I shall deal, and I and shall show the honourable member how much money is being held. I shall cite a particular case. There is the 2/15th its Eield Eegiment Australian Imperial Force Association Patriotic Fund, now the hands of the 2/15th Eield Eegiis ment Eelatives Association, which is prepared to hand it over to the Unit Association whenever necessary. The controllers of this fund have stated that when the Eeturned Sailors, .Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia is prepared the to accept the money, they will hand it over to the organization, for the alleviation of former members of the Sth Division who are now in distressed circumstances. The league is prepared to the accept the fund, and to open a special trust account so that the monev may be used for the purpose for which it was at raised. The organizers of this fund collected a considerable sum during the war, the and the proceeds were handed to the Lord Mayor's Eund. Towards the end of the war, when it appeared that survivsecing members of the unit would be reto Australia., it was decided to retain some of the money for the assistance of these men and their relatives. fund is now approximately £900. organizers are prepared now, if the necessary, to hand it over to the Eeturned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia for the alleviation of distressed members of the 8th Division. The Unit Association is registered, as it should be, as a charity under the South Wales Charitable Collections Act. I do not propose to deal at length with these but I shall give a broad of the position so that honourable members may understand exactly what the Government proposes to do. Another infund about which some concern has been for expressed is the Merchant, Navy War Memorial Fund Limited. Under the the approval of the Commonwealth Treathis organization collected money from the public for the erection of a seamen's home as a memorial to the efforts memof the members of the merchant navy during World War IT. It is allied with the Rawson Institute and other bodies dealing with the welfare of men of the merchant navy. I have selected tliese funds as examples of what the Minister proposes to transfer to the control of the Repatriation Department. The people who administer these funds have a specific object in view, or a specific understanding of the circumstances of distressed ex-servicemen who have been associated with them. They claim that they have closer contact with, and a better understanding of, the difficulties and disabilities of ex-service^ men. They avoid entirely the red tape of governmental administration which must be associated with the control of any funds of this nature. They contend that they, having collected the money by voluntary effort, are better fitted than is the Government to distribute it. It is true that they are subject to all kinds of overriding controls, but the administration of these funds still remains within their power. We fear that when the Government takes control of these funds, it will assume control of the administration. The bill does not contain a safeguard against that. We contend that, the administration of these funds should not be placed in the hands of the Repatriation Department, which is responsible for the repatriation of ex-servicemen, the payment of pensions for the disabilities that they have suffered, and the like. These funds are entirely divorced from and must not he confused with governmental assistance. The Government has its own obligations to ex-servicemen, and must assume them. It has no right to take over the control and administration of these funds, because that is outside its prerogative. The people subscribed the money to these funds, as distinct from the taxes which they paid to Commonwealth revenue, for the alleviation of the distress of ex-servicemen. I shall cite an illustration. We have the ordinary educational system, and responsibility for the provision of schools and facilities associated with them rests with the State governments. Outside of that, there are the Parents and Citizens Associations which raise funds in order to give pupils additional facilities which the Government is not prepared to supply, and extra comforts which may be necessary. A State government might step in and take control of the funds of Parents and Citizens Associations saying, "" Although you collected the money and supply facilities and comforts which are outside our obligation, we consider that you have uo right to administer the funds or use them for thepurposes for which you raised the money"". That is a comparable case. Ex-servicemen's funds were subscribed as something in addition to what the Government has an obligation to do. The money has been donated by the generosity of the public for a specific purpose. In the circumstances, I assert that the Government should not remove these funds from the control of ex-servicemen's organizations. Of course, the Government might exercise some control for the purpose of ensuring that the funds shall be used in a manner which, will confer the maximum benefit upon ex-servicemen. That, in itself, might be quite fitting and proper, but the bill does not contain any provision to state that the Government shall not assume control of the distribution of these funds. If the Minister for Repatriation can give me an assurance to allay my fears, the case which I have made has been well put indeed. But if he cannot give such an assurance, I believe that every honourable member who is an ex-serviceman, should oppose the bill in the interests of ex-servicemen.",70
266,Mr TURNBULL,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"Wimmera) [S.48]. - I oppose the bill for reasons similar to those stated by the honourable, member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison). I have spoken to many ex-servicemen and they have no complaint with the manner in which these funds are being administered. Therefore, I cannot understand, and I should like the Minister for Repatriation (Mr Barnard) to explain, why the Government considers that it is necessary to introduce this hill. Proposed new section 118A. provides that the Governor General may make regulations in relation to the control and distribution of moneys and as'ets raised or acquired by patriotic funds. This power is most comprehensive. It covers almost everything. In addition, the Governor General may make regulations in relation to the winding up of patriotic funds and the disposal of the assets and moneys in them. Suppose an association does not desire its patriotic fund to be wound up or its assets to be sold. What will happen ? By regulation, the Governor General may force the organization to take this action. Only last Monday I received from the 8th Division and Prisoners-of-war Relatives Association, which operates in Melbourne, and of which Lieutenant-Colonel Dunlop is the chairman, a book of raffle tickets at a cost of 10s. I sent the organization a postal note for the amount. This raffle was approved by the Government. If people are still collecting funds for the benefit of servicemen and ex-servicemen they are doing valuable work. The Minister for Repatriation and his departmental officers already have enough to do without having to imdertake the work envisaged for them in the bill. I may be pardoned for thinking that perhaps the amount of money accumulated in the funds is the magnet that drew forth this bill from the Government's mind. I see no reason for it. If I could be convinced that ex-servicemen would be better served as the result of the passage of the bill, I would not oppose it, but the people who raise and administer patriotic funds have a deep knowledge of the needs of servicemen and ex-servicemen. Some of them are perhaps the mothers of men who made the supreme sacrifice. That sort of person is more sympathetic with ex-servicemen than any government or department could be, and in saying that, I do not specify Labour governments. It applies to. all governments. Governmental administration implies red tape, and ex-servicemen cannot hope for the same sympathy from men hampered by red tape as they can from people who out of practical sympathy have so interested themselves in their welfare as to raise and administer funds on their behalf. From the knowledge I have of the bill I must oppose it. Yesterday, I was spoken to over the telephone by Councillor S. J. King of Warracknabeal, who has given wonderful service to ex-servicemen as a member of the local Repatriation Committee. He said to me, "" Y o u will hear more from us about the bill "" . Time has passed too quickly for him to have conveyed his further protests to me, but he expressed concern about what will Mr Turnout!. happen to the money, buildings and other assets of patriotic funds when the Governor General, which means the Government, has complete control over them. As the Minister for Repatriation and his department have enough work on their hands already, and as I see no reason for the bill, I cannot support it at present.",71
267,Mr HAYLEN,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"Parkes) [8.53] - The honourable member, for Wimmera (Mr. Turnbull) has debated the issue on unsound premises.",72
268,Mr TUKUBTJLL,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"If that is so, I am prepared to change my opinion.",72
269,Mr HAYLEN,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"The view I take is that the remnants of patriotic funds left as a legacy from the war should be dealt with in a business like way. After the war of 1914-18, there were patriotic funds consisting of amounts ranging from a few thousand pounds to £30,000 or £40,000, and the trustees were perplexed as to what to do with them. They had various objectives. In the depression, when ex-servicemen had a real need of aid from the funds, it was impossible to disburse money to them because of the iron-clad conditions governing them. The funds were frozen and of no use to men who ought to have benefited from them. The honourable memher for Wimmera, who is jealous of the rights of ex-servicemen, may rest assured that the Minister for Repatriation (Mr Barnard) has no intention of making an assault on the funds. I know that from my experience of and conversations with him. The proposal is merely to gather the funds together. It is a sort of cleaning up process. The funds will be held in suspension pending the ultimate decision as to what shall be done with them. I regard that as the tidiest way in which to deal with this aftermath of the war. It is better to do that than to leave reservoirs of money throughout the country. I agree with the honourable member that the Minister for Repatriation and his department have their hands full, but the Minister has a duty to the people who subscribed to the funds, and to the ex-servicemen who may later share in the distribution of the proceeds. The Minister is the appropriate representative of the Government to do the job. I should be sorry if ex-servicemen's associations regarded this measure as a ""grab"". It is not. It is good accountancy that the funds should be co-ordinated. I suggest that local Bepatriation Committees in cities and country towns would provide ideal means of feeding the funds back the citizens through ex-servicemen. There is nothing sinister in the measure, and commend it to honourable members on both sides of the House.",72
270,Mr RYAN,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"Flinders) [S.56] - The purpose of this bill is to continue the control that the Government has over patriotic funds by virtue of National Security Regulations after their expirathis tion at the end of the year. It is underlarge standable that such legislation must brought down if the Government is to restricted continue that control; but I should like know why control of the funds should not be allowed to revert to the States in which they were collected. The patriotic funds are on exactly the same footing are all charitable funds collected in States, and I see no particular reason the Government should wish to continue a strict control over them. However, the Government intends to continue its trol, and, no doubt, the Minister for Bepatriation (Mr Barnard) will explain why when be closes the debate on the second reading. The bill is drafted such a way as to give the Government complete power over the establishment patriotic funds, the raising of moneys acquiring of assets for patriotic funds, control and distribution of moneys and assets raised or acquired by patriotic vote against it. funds, the winding-up of patriotic funds and disposal of the assets and moneys of the funds, and the provision of penalties for any breach of the regulations. It is understandable that the bill has caused great concern to the organizations that, during the war, were responsible the raising of the funds. The Minister for Repatriation (Mr Barnard) or controlled the Government, as the case may be, may rake a generous view and decide - that funds raised in a locality shall be tributed in that locality. I entirely agree with that principle, but the bill does not provide that that will be done, and it is possible, therefore, for the money to be.paid into Consolidated Revenue and expended i i i one hundred and one ferent ways.",73
271,Mr BARNARD,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,That is not intended.,73
272,Mr RYAN,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"Doubtles s it is not, but it would be possible for that to happen. That is why the bill has caused anxiety. The Minister says it is not intended to to pay the money into Consolidated Revenue. So there should be no objection to the inI sertion in the bill of a provision that it shall not be. At least, in order that the anxieties of people may be allayed, a firm assurance should be given, on behalf of the Government, that it shall not be. I assure the Minister that many people are very worried. They believe that as money has been collected from a number of generous people during be the war, often in small villages and in areas, for definite and restricted to purposes, they should be allowed to dispose of what remains of the fund-whicl i in some instances represents a considerable a.monnt. In some instances the as amount remaining is several thousands of the pounds. Those persons in whose charge why the money now is have definite opinions as to how it should be disposed of. Such purposes as assistance for returned serconvicemen, provision of amenities and educational facilities, honour rolls, & c suggest themselves to the mind. However, it is proposed to give the Governin ment complete control over this money, and there is no assurance that it will be of devoted to the purpose for which it was and collected. If a firm assurance on this the point were forthcoming, I should have no objection to the bill; otherwise I will",73
273,Mr BLAIN,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"Northern Territory) [9.2] - I support the remarks of the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr. Harrison), who criticized this bill for the sins of commission for which it would be for responsible. The Government is actually commandeering most of the funds now by ex-servicemen's associations, funds that are ably administered by men who have gone through the mill themdisselves, and have a deep sympathy for others who may be in need of assistance. I suggest to the Government that the authority of these organizations should be recognized, and in particular that they difshould not be swamped in a government department administered, possibly, by officials with no war experience. The honourable member for Wentworth dealt with this phase of the matter, with the sins of commission, if I may so describe them, but I wish to deal with the sins of omission inherent in the proposal. In the second-reading speech of this bill, the Minister for Bepatriation (Mr Barnard) 3a i d Many of the funds have already been wound up and others are in process of being wound up, but funds such as the Australian Bed Cross Society, the Royal Australian Naval Relief Fund and the Royal Australian Air Force Welfare Fund, will .continue to function indefinitely. No doubt there were good reasons for not interfering with the funds held by those three organizations, but I wish to deal with the Australian Red Cross Society, and here I plunge immediately into the question of prisoners of war, particularly the Sth Division. course, every time ex-servicemen are mentioned, 90 per cent, of Government supporters assert that we are trying to ride on the soldiers' backs. ",73
274,Mr BLAIN,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"The honourable member for Griffith (Mr Conelan) interjected to that effect only ten minutes ago. The men of the Sth Division obtained information through underground channels that money was being collected for them, but on their return to Australia, the money had more or less disappeared into the mist. During the last twelve months I have been making inquiries in Sydney in crder to find out why the money had not been devoted to the purposes for which it was raised, instead of being lumped together with the other funds of the Australian Eed Cross Society. honourable member for Parkes. (Mr . Haylen) said that the Government had difficulty in deciding what to do with funds of this kind-thoug h he was not referring particularly to money raised for prisoners of war. I have been informed that when Singapore fell such a wave of sympathy, or should I say horror, swept Australia, that the people opened their pockets and contributed very freely. My informant, Mr Dash, told me that block collections were made, one person making himself responsible for collecting from every one in one street, and another person in another street, and so on. He told me that the f u n d grew so rapidly that finally it was necessary to tell the people not to contribute any more. Later, I have been informed, legislation was passed in Victoria to enable the money collected in New South Wales to be paid into the central office of the Australian EedCross Society and Mr Dash told me of the remarkable work which they had done in fanning the enthusiasm of people in Australia to contribute towards a fund for prisoners of war. I now ask the Minister to consider favourably my suggestion that the funds collected for that purpose, and paid into the head office of the Australian Red Cross Society in Melbourne, should be set apart to be administered by ex-servicemen's associations for the purpose for which the money was collected. I believe Of that it is within the authority of this Parliament to ensure that that is done. I speak for the prisoners of war, who have asked me during the last two years to do what I could to ensure that the money collected for them should be handled by the prisoners of war section of ex-servicemen's associations. The Minister should accept an amendment exempting such funds held by the Australian Red Cross Society fro m the bill . It may be taken for granted that those prisoners of war of the Sth Division who die in the next fifteen years will die as the result of - their sufferings and tribulations in Malaya. That is the opinion of most doctors with whom I have discussed the matter. At present, prisoners of war who are in distress have to go to the Australian Red Cross Society where they are interviewed by young The women-ver y capable and welleducated young women they are. who give their services voluntarily, and I am not criticizing them. A young woman is certainly not a suitable person to interview prisoners of war, discuss their medical history and ascertain their troubles. The men want to be interviewed by representatives of their own organization. They have no complaints to make against these members of the Australian Red Cross Society on personal grounds. They agree that, the young women are highly educated and very t a c t f u l; but they complain that they are under a disability in discussing frankly their personal affairs with them. They contend that the fund should he released and placed under their own control. I do not suggest that the proceeds of the fund have been wrongfully used, but I do suggest that the money has been placed under the control of the wrong organization. Much as I admire the excellent work done by the Australian Red Cross Society as the spearhead for the collection of these moneys, I believe that the fund should now be administered by the association formed by the prisoners of war. I appeal to the Government, and particularly to the Minister for Repatriation (Mr Barnard), to insert a provision in the bill to vest the control of the fund in - the organization formed by the ex-prisoners of war. If that be done the men will feel that they will receive just and sympathetic treatment. Debate (on motion by Mr WHITE) adjourned.

POSTAL DEPARTMENT : REHABILITATION PROGRAMME: TAMPERING WITH MAILS..",75
279,Mr CALWELL,AUSTRALIAN ARMY MEDICAL,"On the 13th November, the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Adermann) asked the following question:Has the Minister representing the Postmaster-General seen the report that delegates to the Federal Conference, of the Commonwealth Postmasters Association criticized the slow progress of the Postmaster-General's Department's three-year plan for rehabilitating postal services. Is it a fact, as stated at tin: conference, that the Postmaster-General's Department has been able to spend only about £1)00,000 from an allocution of £5,000.000 for rrlnnbilitatioii work in the last twelve mouths, rf so, will the Minister, in view of the urgency of improving postal services in country districts particularly, have the position investigated, take appropriate action and advise the House of the result? The Postmaster-General has supplied the following information:The report referred to by the honourable member does not indicate the true position. In a comprehensive statement which I forwarded recently to a ll members of the federal Parliament the exceptional measures which have been instituted to overtake the enormous arrears of works that accumulated during the war were outlined, and reference to this""particular statement will show the honourable member that special attention is being given to country districts. The Government has approved of a post-war programme for the Postal Department which will extend over an initial period of three veins and will include works to the total value nf about £42,000,000. The programme involves an estimated expenditure during the current and two succeeding financial vears of approximately £30,000,000: it has been endorsed by the Government and has been commenced. Despite the acute shortage of some essential materials and .skilled man-power, gratifying progress is being made with the implemcntatinn of the three-vein programme and, as the result of vigorous measures which have been taken by the department, greater progress can lie expected to take place in the future. Procedures have been streamlined and plans have been co-ordinated to meet the phenomenal situation, which is not peculiar to Australia, and the programme is being supervised by a sub-committee of Cabinet comprising the Treasurer, the Ministers for Post-war Reconstruction. Works and Housing and'Interior and the Postmaster-General. Members of the Cabinet sub-committee and responsible officers of the Postal Department are f u l ly conscious of the need for implementing the programme as soon as possible. During the financial year 1940-47, 92,000 telephones were installed throughout the Commonwealth, this representing an all-time record. Based on the progress since the beginning of 1947-48, this record will be exceeded greatly during the current year and, in addition, telephone trunk lines and other essential facilities will be installed to a far greater extent than in the past. Of the total amount of £39,4-13,000 allocated for Post Office services during the current financial year, the sum of £9.139,000 has been allotted for new capita! works, including buildings and sites, and I have every confidence that tin: whole of this provision will he absorbed and that the 1947-48 portion of the rehabilitation programme will be completed. The honourable member may be assured that the Postal Department recognizes the inconvenience which is being caused to the community in the absence of adequate and efficient facilities, and is doing everything within its power to restore services to a satisfactory standard. On the 1.1th November, the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison) asked the following question:Last week I posted a letter from Canberra addressed to Mr K . E. Winchcombe. of 48 ; Bridge-Street. Sydney. The stamp on the letter bore the cancellation stamp of the post officeat Parliament House, Canberra. This week I found it in my box at the Federal Members'' Rooms, Sydney, where I understand it had been placed by one of the staff of the Minister for .Transport, Mr Ward. It had been re-addressed to Mr Ward, and was marked ""Opened inmistake"". The letter was open. I ask the Minister representing tin; Postmaster-General whether, in view of a. previousincident concerning the opening of a letter by the Minister for Transport, which had been addressed to the Private Secretary of the Right Honourable R. G. Casey, inquiries will be madeto ascertain how my letter which was not addressed by me to Mr Ward came to be diverted to him and opened by him. In view nf the suspicious circumstances surrounding this incident and the many protests which have readied me regarding tampering with mails, will the Minister inform me under whosedirection this letter was diverted and whether - such diversion of mail to a Minister representsa continuance of censorship or an attempt to build up a dossier against citizens by members nf the Security Service. Although it was evident that, the misdirection of the letter referred to by the honourable member was obviously an accident, I asked the Postmaster-General to investigate the circumstances and he has now supplied the following information :Investigations have disclosed that the letter mentioned by the honourable member was despatched in the normal way from the Canberra Post Office to the General Post Office. Sydney. It was addressed to 48 Bridge-street, Sydney, and was sorted for delivery to that address. The postman concerned was aware. Jhowever, that the addressee is a private boxliolder at the General Post Office and, in accordance with the usual practice, he endorsed - the appropriate private box number on the envelope and transferred the article to the private box section. Unfortunately, one of the figures in the - endorsement was formed imperfectly and resembled another figure for which it was mistaken by the officer who sorted the article into the private box bearing the number which he thought to be represented by the endorsement. The box in which the article was placed is held hy the State Ministry of Transport and a correspondence clerk employed in that department, when unable to identify the addressee as a memher of the staff of the organization, Assumed that he was attached to the Federal Ministry of Transport and, after marking the letter "" Mr Ward, M.H.E., Federal Members' Rooms, Sydney "", handed it back, unopened, to jin officer at the General Post Office. The inquiries also indicate that the letter was then delivered with Mr Ward's correspondence to the Federal Members' Rooms in Sydney, where a member of Mr Ward's staff opened the article in good faith and without noticing that it bore two addresses. When the officer concerned found that the letter was not intended for Mr Ward and had been written by Mr Harrison, he wrote on the envelope the words, "" Opened in mistake "" and placed the article with Mr Harrison's correal {Kindcnce. The Postal Department sincerely regrets the occurrence which arose from an unfortunate elm in of events.",76
