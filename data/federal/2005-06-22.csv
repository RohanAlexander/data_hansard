1,The SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. David Hawker) took the chair at 9.00 am and read prayers. NA (DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS) Second Reading Debate resumed from 21 June, on motion by Mr MCGauran: That this bill be now read a second time. upon which Mr Beazley moved by way of amendment: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House is of the view that: (1) medical personnel and media representatives should be given independent access to people in detention centres; (2) decisions on temporary protection visas must be given within 2 years, with (a) the onus of proof being on the Government to establish that a visa should not be granted; and (b) the system recognising that even if a person may not succeed in an application on the grounds of refugee status, the person may be accepted on the grounds of adding to Australia's social or cultural life; (3) an Inspector General of Detention should be appointed to hear and resolve complaints from detainees about detention conditions; (4) children under 18 their siblings and parents should not be held in high security detention unless a judicial assessor determines otherwise; and (5) the Ombudsman should report monthly on the continued detention of all detainees held for 90 days”.",17
2,Mr BARRESI,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Migration Amendment (Detention Arrangements) Bill 2005. It is an issue that has caused me a great deal of concern in recent times. The importance of reform to the migration litigation process in Australia has become more and more apparent in recent years. This bill deals directly with two areas within the overall mandatory detention polBILL 2005 icy. The first issue is that of children in immigration detention. The second is the unacceptable time that several long-term detainees have spent in detention centres throughout Australia. Many of my constituents have expressed their concerns to me about long-term detention, and for some time. I have shared some of these concerns. But I have not been alone in this process, and I have spoken on this issue in the past in the House. Other coalition members have also called for a degree of change to our immigration policy, and I welcome the recent debate that was stimulated by the member for Kooyong to bring about the recent changes. With this in mind, and with a growing sense of concern, earlier this year I organised a visit to the Baxter immigration detention facility in South Australia. I was joined on that visit by the member for Kooyong and the member for Cook. Following that visit, I was convinced even more that the government could strike a balance between the two often competing demands of a compassionate response combined with control and retention of the fundamental principles of mandatory detention and border control. What also struck me during that visit was the psychological and emotional degradation that takes place with long-term detention. While I am not an expert in immigration visa applications and I cannot attest to the veracity of the various cases and the individuals whom we met, certainly I did walk away with a concern about the mental state of many of those whom we met. While the government has made genuine progress in recent years, the system has proved unable to process all visa applications in a timely manner. There have been many causes for these delays. In particular, there has been a long and often protracted legal process that has often dogged the systemand this is an issue that has been discussed length by many in this House. Australia's policy of mandatory detention has been a success. I know that there will be those who will dispute that fact. Even the more moderately inclined members of the Australian Labor Party have accepted this point. The system has been a key plank in deterring the immoral and callous trade in people smuggling. But the time has come, with the reduction in the number of boats and the stemming of the people-smuggling trade, for us to look at the detention policy with renewed interest. I am very pleased with the changes that are before us today. I draw a strong sense of pride from the fact that this government is committed to helping some of the world's hardest-hit humanitarian refugees. Indeed, just a few months ago, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs announced that the government will maintain the intake of genuine refugees at 13,000 new places in 2005-06. While the government's commitment to genuine refugees remains strong, the stance on illegal immigration has been beneficial. As I say, this has reduced number of boat arrivals. It would be remiss of the parliament to overlook the recent positive progress that has been made. In recent years, the government has introduced changes to ease the visa processing period. The implementation of the residential housing projects and, more recently, the returnpending visa has helped to bring about a greater level of homelike living conditions. This is especially the case for women and children who have taken up those opportunities. The issue of children in immigration detention is a difficult and multifaceted one. The government has worked in recent times to remove children into residential housing with their mothers. However, this has preat sented the dilemma of separating young families from their fathers. Through this bill, we now have a further enhancement of the compassionate response to handling children in detention by affirming as a principle that a minor shall only be detained as a measure of last resort. I am pleased to see that this bill will ensure that, when possible, the detention of a child will take place within the community. I welcome this move and the provision for additional power for the minister to specify the arrangements for families that are waiting for visas to be processed. I know that there are some in this House who will be concerned about the minister having a noncompellable discretionary power, but this is a step in the right direction. More than anything, these changes are about fairness. On the one hand, it is fair for an orderly immigration system to process people wanting to come to Australia, including genuine refugees. On the other hand, it is only fair that people's visas are processed in a timely and appropriate manner. An alteration to the act will bring a three-month time line for the processing of primary protection the visas. I am encouraged by this move and by the further three-month time line that will be imposed on cases before the Refugee Review Tribunal. While no-one disputes the need for an immigration appeals system, it is surely counterproductive and totally unreasonable for the system to allow immigration detention for up to 6½ years. While I am proud of the strong stance against people smuggling, the growing issue of long-term immigration detention in Australia has caused me a great deal of concern. I have always sought to provide an informed and insightful contribution to the debate on immigration detention. I have personally visited refugee camps overseas as well as the detention centres here in Australia. These experiences have always resonated in my mind. We need a robust and fair immigration process in Australia. One detainee whom I was keen to meet  from the disputed territory of Kashmir. Like many other Australians, I have been touched by Mr Qasim's story. I was fortunate enough to meet with him during my visit to Baxter. Ironically, he was in relatively good spirits and I was buoyed by his positive attitude on the day. Mr Qasim's case is unique. After more than 6½ years he simply wants to be out of detention, be that here in Australia or-in more recent times-back in India. Many in this House would be aware of Mr Qasim's story. He is a native of the disputed region of Kashmir. Mr Qasim's journey took him through Pakistan, Singapore and Papua New Guinea before arriving in Australia. Since then he has spent time in the Port land, Woomera, and Curtin detention centres before arriving at the Baxter facility. His time in detention has also included a brief stay in prison after escaping the Port Hedland facility. This protracted process has lasted in excess of four years, which appears to have been to the detriment of Mr Qasim's health and mental well-being. I was particularly concerned to hear reports the other day that Mr Qasim has been moved to treatment at the Glenside Hospital in Adelaide because of his deteriorating mental condition. The possibility that Mr Qasim may be released on a return-pending visa is an outcome that I come wholeheartedly. I look forward to Mr Qasim taking up the offer. The campaign that was waged against me on the issue of mandatory detention by so called local ‘action groups' within my electorate of Deakin prior to last year's election was ferocious. Many within this group called for ‘change within the federal seat of Deakin'. Fortunately, it did not happen. I was horrified by some of the antics that were proposed. Most abhorrently, a prominent Melbourne newspaper columnist and Greens supporter proposed placing caged children outside my electorate office as a way of generating publicity for the cause. That proposal horrified me and certainly I know that reasonably minded individuals in my electorate would have been appalled by it. It is ironic that some refugee advocates are now calling for a change within the Australian Labor Party following the ill-advised comments of the member for Reid in reference to Peter Qasim being offered a return-pending bridging visa. I do not want to go on at great length on the ALP's position. There have been positions all over the place on this. I am particularly heartened by the fact that the changes Hedthat have taken place have been because of the voice that has been expressed on this side of the House. The voice that has been expressed by coalition members has created change. Throughout the whole process the Australian Labor Party has basically been made to look irrelevant in this whole debate. This can no better be demonstrated than by a comment that was made to me following my visit to Baxter. There was some publicity in the Age and in the Australian and one prominent ALP backbencher said to me, ‘Keep it going, guys. You're making us look totally irrelevant and are embarrassing us with your stance.' I am pleased to see that other voices welon this side came through and supported the need for a more compassionate response. The changes within this bill are sensible and have been largely brought about following the discussions in the party room. I would like to acknowledge those coalition MPs who have expressed their views. More importantly, I would like to acknowledge the Prime Minister for his availability to listen and for providing every member of the coalition who wanted to express a view with a chance to do so. In return, the Prime responded in the manner we have seen in the last three or four days and in the bill before us today. I commend the bill to the House.",17
3,Ms KING,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"In rising to speak in this debate on the Migration Amendment (Detention Arrangements) Bill 2005 I want to start by congratulating the government on finally recognising that all is not well with its immigration policies. The changes currently before the House are long overdue. I welcome anything, no matter how small, which can potentially provide relief the many individuals who are suffering the horrors of unnecessary detention. But, to be honest, it simply is not enough. In my first ever speech in this place in 2001 I made no secret of my determination to find ways of changing immigration policy. I predicted then that the other side of this House would find the mess they have made of our immigration program sticking in their throats. I am saddened but not surprised to see that that prediction has come horribly true, if only for a scant handful. These proposed changes are the most impressive example I have ever seen of the expression ‘too little, too late'. Ask Peter Qasim if this amendment will do anything to repair the severe mental illness which his seven years of detention have left him with. In fact, ask Peter Qasim if this amendment will guarantee that nobody else faces the same circumstances. It will not. In a press conference a few days ago the Prime Minister said, ‘The more I have delved into this issue, the greatest areas of complaint really arise around the issue of time.' I remind the House that since 1997 there have been over 40 amendments to migration legislation and not one prevented Naomi Leong from spending her entire life behind razor wire. This government has had ample opportunity to show compassion to asylum seekers and to make the changes it is now proposing, but it Minister has consistently chosen not to. Of course, these changes are not genuinely driven by compassion on the part of the Prime Minister but by political expediency and a desperate bid for damage control. Four Liberal MPs finally spoke up after months of increasingly shameful stories had pricked their consciences. Condemned by one of their own as political terrorists, they nevertheless stuck to their guns, only to be bullied into accepting a massively watered down version of what they had really wanted. And to now the government is preening in the press, patting itself on the back and claiming some moral high ground when it has presided over one of the most shameful periods in our history. Well, Prime Minister I am not fooled. Compassion is not a convenient cloak that you wrap yourself in, only to discard when the weather turns fair. It is something you either have in your heart or not, and frankly I can only see the image of the Prime Minister puffing out his chest, trying to build himself in stature, roaring out to his adoring audience, ‘We will decide who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come.' The government has had ample opportunity to put balance back into the immigration system. In 2002 Labor presented a policy of a more humane, open and accountable mandatory detention system. In 2003 the then shadow minister for immigration introduced a private member's bill which would have seen children removed from detention. That was in 2003. Here we are in 2005 finally trying to do something about it. Members of the House would know that every single attempt by Labor to have children removed from detention was defeated by this government. The amendments to this bill moved by the Leader of the Opposition are sensible and reflect a more balanced and accountable approach than the watered-down compromise that is being offered by this Prime Minister. They are not amendments that we have just dreamed up overnight, which is what the government has done in cobbling together this bill. They came out of an extensive period of policy development. It is a policy based on hours of consultation with asylum seekers and refugee advocates, and extensive consultation and work within the party itself. I myself deliberately visited a detainee in Maribyrnong detention centre prior to our national conference so that I would be informed about the decisions that I was making and that would affect him. Unfortunately, two years later that man is still behind bars in Maribyrnong detention centre. First and foremost, Labor wants to make the process transparent and independent. Under this bill it is an assumption that the best way to protect those in the department's care is to give the minister more discretion to make decisions on detention. Frankly, it is a bit like giving the school bully the right to decide who gets the cane. The recent track record speaks for itself. Since Minister Vanstone effectively handed over the power of ministerial discretion to Minister MCGauran, he has exercised his ministerial discretion in only four per cent of cases. Certainly the former minister, who many considered to be quite a harsh minister, had a better strike rate than the current minister, Mr MCGauran, has in relation to ministerial discretion. Min- not. isterial discretion puts the power of decision making into the hands of a single individual, and this bill means that decisions cannot be reviewed or challenged. This reads like a recipe for, at best, mistakes and, at worse, absolute abuse. It has become clear recently that the department is in crisis, with even the secretary of the department admitting it needs a massive cultural change. When we have seen 200 cases of wrongful detention being referred to the Palmer inquiry, and accusations of brutality and assault on a regular basis, you would be naive and disingenuous to pretend that these problems have nothing to do with the minister and nothing to do with DIMIA. Nobody could feel totally confident that a system giving complete power to one person provides a fair and transparent process for every individual seeking refuge in Australia. The culture operating in DIMIA gives me absolutely no confidence that we have not sent genuine refugees back into areas where they will face persecution. Labor wants to provide certainty about the removal of children and their families from detention. I support the proposal that was originally put by the member for Kooyong that children under 18, regardless of the detention period, should be released into the community with their parents and siblings once an independent assessment shows that they are not a security risk. The government, on the other hand, in this bill proposes that children be released if the minister says soonly if the minister says so. To date we have seen clearly how ministerial discretion has been applied, in an ad hoc fashion, without transparency or any apparent system. This bill also retains the ability to detain children as a last resort. What does that mean? What does ‘a last resort' mean? Under what circumstance does the detention of a five-yearold ever become justified? It simply does The amendments moved by the Leader of the Opposition contain a better model for processing of visas for persons in detention. Our model removes the delays and potential unfairness involved in the use of a nonreviewable ministerial discretion by substituting an independent assessment of any compelling special humanitarian claim. The government's proposed amendments simply provide non-compellable power to the minister to grant a visa to a person in detention. There is no proposal for independent or reviewable assessment, and there is no provision for dealing with exceptional circumstances. Further, the amendments provided by the Leader of the Opposition introduce other elements of Labor policy. Labor will create a new independent tribunal, called the refugee status determination tribunal, for managing processing. The government changes, on the other hand, keep the process in-house and continue to avoid transparency and accountability. Then there is the government's proposed review process. The department is to report to the Ombudsman, who will then report to the minister, who can then choose to ignore the report anyway. It difficult to see how this process will do more than provide bureaucrats with more paper to shuffle. But of more concern than the deficiencies in the government's bill is the significant number of issues that remain unresolved. There is no provision for handling stateless persons. Aside from catching the minister in a good mood, there is no solution for those detainees who have been rejected by their country of origin. This is the true test of compassion and-let us face it-of common sense. The case of Eidress Abdulrahman has provided us with a model example of how not to manage the plight of a stateless person. The government paid thousands of dollars to try and deport him, only to have him turned away because he had no country that would accept him as a citizen. He remains in detention today. There is no logic to keeping a person in detention until we effectively drive them mad-and that is what we have been doing as a country. Stateless detainees whose identity and country of origin are clear should be granted permanent residency. To do anything less persecutes them for just the sake of it. It is inhumane and capricious. The government's bill says nothing about returning management of detention centres to the public sector. Despite the clampdown of information coming out of detention centres, it is becoming increasingly clear from recent comments by both detainees and former staff that all is not well behind the walls. In the Weekend Australian on 18 June, Elisabeth Wynhausen reported on some serious problems with Global Solutions Ltd's running of the detention centres. I was interested to read that GSL will be fined $5,000 if officials are found to have ignored the advice of a body referred to as the ‘health advisory panel'. I was bewildered to further read that, although GSL has been running the detention centres is since the beginning of last year, the panel is yet to even be set up. The contract to run our detention centres is one of the largest documents of its type in the world, but at the moment neither the House nor the taxpayers whose money pays for it can actually inspect it. This has always been, and will continue to be, a fundamental problem where so-called commercial-in-confidence secrecy creates doubt and undermines confidence. Labor will return the control of detention centres to the public sector and regain that confidence. The government's bill does not provide certainty for temporary protection visa holders. It proposes a time frame for primary assessment, but the reality is that TPV holders will still be in limbo-unable to form long term relationships or plan for their future or that of their children. The government's bill does not make provision for health services in detention centres provided by independent medical professionals, nor does it provide the ability for those professionals to speak out on issues. We have seen the disastrous effects that the lack of access to proper health care has had on the mental health of many detainees. The family of Cornelia Rau have stated clearly that her custody in Baxter was punitive, prejudicial to her physical and mental health, and brutal. Let us not forget that the treatment meted out to Ms Rau may be a shared experience for other detainees. But without independent and reportable access to health professionals, how can we know for sure? Labor would make provision for independent medical professionals in detention centres, and we would not gag them. The government's bill does not provide media access to detention centres. Clearly the habit of secrecy is not in the interests Labor would provide media access via agreed protocols to protect the interests of both detainees and national security. In conclusion, we are not convinced. The introduction of this bill by the government sends a clear signal that they know they have got this policy wrong. But it does not go far enough, not by a long shot. Labor, on the other hand, have worked hard to create a humane, accountable, fair and balanced system for migration. If you want a serious change that introduces a balanced immigration system then you will not have that delivered by the Howard government-no matter what four Liberal MPs with some elements of compassion might be able to achieve on their side of the chamber. I commend to the House the amendments moved by the Leader of the Opposition.",20
4,Mr TURNBULL,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"Australia's immigration policy has a heavy responsibility-it has to balance the need to secure our borders and ensure the protection of the integrity of our immigration policy with the need to deal with those seeking asylum in a compassionate and humane fashion. The Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs administers one of the largest immigration programs in the world relatively speaking-part of which is the second-largest refugee intake program relative to population in the world. Most of the refugees Australia accepts have been chosen from amongst the poorest and most oppressed people on earth. More than 70 per cent of them come from African countries such as the Sudan and Ethiopia, where finding the funds to travel to Australia by any means is utterly inconceivable. Last year nearly 14,000 visas were granted under DIMIA's humanitarian program. Of these nearly 12,000 were granted to people overseas, with the balance granted to persons of detainees. applying within Australia. Our offshore refugee program therefore is one of great generosity and compassion, but it has been overshadowed in the public eye by the management of refugee cases within Australia. Hundreds of my constituents, since I announced my candidacy for parliament, have contacted me on the streets, by letter, by email and by telephone about this matter. Their overwhelming concerns have been focused on two issues. The first is the detention of families and children in detention centres. I have shared that concern and have expressed it to the minister and other members of the government. The second focus of their concerns has been the inordinate time it takes to process applications. That delay comes about through departmental reviews, reviews of the Refugee Review Tribunal and of course the extraordinarily tortuous process that these applications take through the courts-which is being addressed, I should note, by the the Migration Litigation Reform Bill 2005 that was debated in this chamber only a little while ago. Those delays wreak great injustice and great hardship. The hardship they wreak is obvious for people who are in detention. Plainly, if someone is in detention pending the outcome of an application, the longer that application is pending the more hardship they suffer. These long delays-some of them of almost Dickensian proportions-also wreak great injustice and hardship on people who are living in the community who are not under any form of detention, because the longer they live in Australia the more connections they make with the community. They have children and their children go to school. They make friends and connections. If, at the end of the process, it is concluded that their application should be rejected then the hardship of them being removed from Australia is even greater. So there is an enormous interest, both in terms of efficiency and humanity, to have applications dealt with expeditiously. That is why a feature of this package-which is not actually part of the bill before the House today-that was announced by the Prime Minister last week is to have the first review, the consideration of the application by the department, concluded within 90 days and then the review by the tribunal, if a review is sought, completed within a further 90 days. Those timetables are important. It would be desirable if they could be even shorter. In an ideal world-and I repeat what I said in this chamber on the Migration Litigation Reform Bill-there would be a departmental review followed by one hearing, or one review. The complexity of the process that we currently have is not required by any concept of natural justice. It is certainly required under international obligations and, as I said, it wreaks great hardship. I see that the honourable member for Kooyong is in the House. I compliment him and his colleagues on their efforts in advocating reform. We have had a very productive debate within our party, a very open debate. That was a debate to which many members of the coalition contributed and to which many thousands of Australians contributed. This has been a great exercise in democracy and a great refutation of the suggestion by the Clerk of the Senate that parliamentary democracy is dead in Australia. I think we have seen in the last few weeks that it is very much alive and productive. The most important change for most Australians will be the statement that a minor shall only be detained as a measure of last resort and a provision that enables the minister to arrange for families to make a residence determination and so to arrange that families be allowed-or any person in fact but it is intended to be applied particularly to families-to reside in a place in the community which could be anywhere in the community as opposed to being in a detention centre or a residential housing project. This added flexibility is designed to enable families with children to live within the community with some reporting requirements and, as the explanatory memorandum says, with ‘minimal direct supervision'. The legislation before the House grants the minister additional flexibility and discretion, and that has been criticised by the opposition. Flexibility and discretion are highly desirable. In fact one of the defects of the legislation to date has been a lack of flexibility for the minister to administer the department in a more responsive and humane fashion. Discretion can obviously create concerns if it is misused, but discretion which is accountable is a very valuable combination. not There are provisions for reporting by the Ombudsman both to the minister and to parliament. The Ombudsman of course has considerable powers to investigate, to compel witnesses and to compel the production of documents, and his oversight of this program will ensure that the discretions are exercised in a way which is accountable and transparent. If honourable members consider that these discretions have been exercised in a way that is unsatisfactory they will have all of the information before them to challenge the minister and call for those discretions to be exercised in a different way. I am delighted that this legislation has been presented to the House. It is a great step forward, as is the rest of the package announced by the Prime Minister. It will make our immigration system more efficient, more compassionate and more accountable. I know that the overwhelming majority of my constituents in Wentworth are as delighted as I am by these reforms.",23
5,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"I wish to speak briefly on the Migration Amendment (Detention Arrangements) Bill 2005 today to associate myself with the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition and with the second reading amendment which he has moved and to concentrate in some respects on a brief history of how we have got to where we are today. I think it is true say that the measures contained in this bill can only be described as incremental. They make incremental improvements to the system but they do not do the fundamental thing which is required: they do not set the system up for the future to ensure that the terrible things which have occurred in this area will not occur again in the future. From March 1996, 221 boats carrying nearly 12,000 people, generally from Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan, arrived on our shores. From the end of 2001 only four boats arrived carrying less than a couple of hundred. The reason for the boats coming and the boats stopping were all to do with what we describe as ‘push' factors, not ‘pull' factors. The fact that there were no longer great civil wars in Afghanistan and that the circumstances in Iraq had seen Saddam Hussein removed saw those push factors recede, if not eliminated. That saw the consequent ebbing of the flow of people coming to our shores. These factors are described correctly by the academics as push factors. It is not the pull factors which see people coming to a nation seeking asylum or refugee status; it is the push factors. In the coffee shops of Afghanistan and Iraq and Iran they did not stop coming because they were concerned about mandatory detention or the excision of islands or offshore processing in Australia; they stopped coming because of changes in circumstances in their own countries. As a consequence of those arrivals from March 1996 to the end of 2001, in the last parliament, 2001-04, we had to focus very much on the circumstances of the detention of those people, the processing of those people's claims for refugee status and how we treated and dealt with temporary protection visa holders in the community. Labor addressed our policy approach seriously in that parliament because it was clear that our previous approach had been deficient. Together to with my predecessor, the shadow minister for immigration, the member for Lalor, I was heavily involved in the last parliament as shadow minister for immigration in Labor's changed policy approach. At our January 2004 conference I gave an address that said in part: Labor believes in an orderly immigration system, a system based on the rule of law, a system of integrity which the Australian people will have confidence and trust in. For the Australian people to have confidence in the administration of our immigration system, it must be built upon rigorous procedures and processes, which protect our national interest and our national borders. We must also treat individuals fairly and with dignity. To treat individuals fairly requires that they are dealt with in a speedy and efficient manner, where decisions are based on fair procedures and subject to appropriate review. … … It is also in our national interest to conduct selves as a good international citizen, to do our fair share for those who are subject to persecution and who need protection. As a result of that general approach that conference adopted some detailed policy proposals which are relevant to the debate today. As far as mandatory detention was concerned, we said that we believed mandatory detention should be maintained but that we wanted to remove children from detention centres. We said that we wanted to make sure that detention centres were managed by Commonwealth officers on Commonwealth territory as a strict line of accountability and that that would see the end of the so-called ‘Pacific solution'. We wanted 90 per cent of claims to be determined within 90 days. We wanted to provide an independent review of the claims not determined in 90 days with the goal of processing all claims within 12 months and we wanted claims processed quickly through a new refugee determination tribunal, with appeals to federal magistrates. We wanted to make substantial changes to the temporary protection visa system to ensure that there was some certainty given to those people who had been placed on temporary protection visas. I will elaborate on that matter in the course of the committee stage debate. All that saw a Labor policy which was aimed at doing two things. It was to deal with the backlog of people who had come during the period from March 1996 to the end of 2001, whether that backlog was in detention centres, whether that backlog was in the administrative or judicial processing of these people or whether that backlog was in respect of temporary protection visas in the community and future requirements as to temporary protection visa holders. It was a two-pronged approach to deal with the back… log and to then set the system up for the fuourture so that the terribly adverse things which we have seen over this recent very regrettable period will not occur again in the future. Those aspects of the policy approach which are relevant today are reflected in the second reading amendment: Labor's now long standing policy approach of access to detention centres for independent medical personnel, an inspector-general of detention, processing of claims within 90 days and, where that is not met, monthly reports thereafter, and children out of detention. In 2004, in debate on the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002, I caused amendments to be moved to that bill in the Senate. That amended bill was returned to the House on 1 April 2004. Those amendments contained provisions to remove children from detention and to change the processing of temporary protection visa holders. Regrettably, the House rejected the Senate message on division. Regrettably, on that occasion the member for Kooyong and the member for Pearce voted with the government. I make this point in passing, and it is just a gentle criticism because it is always hard for an individual to make a stand against a long-standing policy of their own party. The member for Kooyong, the member for Pearce and others in this place who now claim credit for these changes were given plenty of opportunities in the previous parliament to make the stand that they have now taken. On every occasion they declined to take those opportunities. So if you are seriously interested in setting the system up for the future, you need to note that members of this House have had more than one occasion since 2001 to make changes along the lines that are currently being referred to. I also make this point in passing. It is a matter of historic record that the government won the 2001 election on a combination of border protection and national security. In the 2004 election this issue was not of quite the same order, but that did not stop the Howard government going to the electorate with its so-called stronger border protection and immigration policy, which was precisely the same policy approach that it took into the 2001 election. Interestingly, this border tection and immigration policy was not launched by the current Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; it was launched by the Attorney General and the former minister for immigration, Mr Ruddock, who had made himself so infamous in the course of the 2001 election and thereafter. So those members opposite had plenty of opportunities between 2001 and 2004 to support the changes Labor outlined which would see two things occur: proper addressing of the backlog of people who had come to our shores seeking asylum and setting the system up for the future so that the terrible things which had occurred could not occur again. They declined every opportunity, and the formal policy approach which those opposite took to the last election was for no change in this area. I welcome the fact that, as a result of nally and reluctantly responding to political pressure, the government are making some incremental changes in this area. But they should also stand back and make some fundamental changes which will set the system up so that, if there were ever to be an influx of asylum seekers to our shores in this way again, we would not make the same mistakes that were made on the government's watch during this period of time. We would treat people fairly and with civility and we would process them efficiently and effectively. When you look at the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report which was delivered to this House in the last parliament, you see that all the ills that we in this area come from one single factor, lengthy detention, so everything we do in a policy sense should be aimed at ensuring that people are not held in detention for unnecessarily lengthy periods. That is why if the government had adopted Labor's policy approach of an independent inspector-general of detention, 90 per cent processing in 90 pro- days with a monthly review thereafter and independent access to medical professionals, the Rau scandal that we see now would not have occurred. That is the truth of the matter. Over the previous parliament this government ignored the suggestions that we made to them, and all members opposite, on more than one occasion in the last parliament, voted against amendments moved by Labor to remove children from detention and to establish a TPV system which would have set the system up for the future in a much fairer way.",25
6,Mr CADMAN,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"I believe that the immigration policies of this country have been forced to follow the policies of the Australian Labor Party simply because of the dog in the manger attitude of the Australian Labor Party to consistently refer back to their old policies, thinking that fi- they were the best since sliced bread was invented. Members opposite know that. The shadow minister, the member for Perth, has just admitted that ALP policies were deficient. It was not until six years after this government came to office that the Labor Party admitted that and went to the ALP National Conference to change them. The coalition won elections time after time, seeking to change the immigration program, to set up a program which is quick, efficient, fair and compassionate, but the Australian Labor Party insisted on living in the past, living with policies that proved to be a failure, and insisted that this country should keep outdated, worn-out, immigration policies. find Through an obstructive Senate, they were seeking to impose on the nation irrelevant and out-of-date attitudes. Time and again, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs at the time, Philip Ruddock, brought amendments to this House which were, in turn, rejected by the Senate. On 40 occasions, as far as I know, he attempted, in a patient way, to achieve changes that would result in quick processing of people who arrived as asylum seekers. Time and time again, those approaches were rejected by the Labor Party in the Senate, which was living in the past. That has led to lengthy detentions and to many of the problems we see today. The Migration Amendment (Detention Arrangements) Bill 2005 has come about because of Labor Party policies and the inability of the government to have its way in the Senate. Those things are changing and I believe that, despite the activity of four of my colleagues, many of these changes would have come about following 1 July when the processes of the parliament will be in balance and the government's policies will be truly implemented. The most notable process, in my view, will be the additional noncompellable power of the minister, acting personally, ‘to specify alternative arrangements for a person's detention and to impose conditions to apply to the detention of that person'. If we look in the explanatory memorandum at the concept of non-compellable power to grant a detainee a visa, we see that the minister will be provided with: ... a non-compellable power to grant a visa to a person who is being held in immigration detention where the Minister is satisfied that it public interest to do so. In the exercise of this power the Minister will not be bound by the provisions of the Migration Act or regulations governing application and grant requirements. The Minister will have the flexibility to grant any visa that is appropriate to that individual's circumstances, including a Removal Pending Bridging Visa where the detainee has no right to remain in Australia but removal is not practicable in the foreseeable future. That is a sensible provision. When the Australian Labor Party first came to change the Migration Act, it insisted on the codification of every aspect of that act. Under these provisions, the discretion of the minister is a justifiable discretion, where the minister has the right and is given the legal power to exercise judgment. I do not know why the Australian Labor Party feels that every aspect of the Migration Act needs to be codified. That is not the case. During the leadership of Bob Hawke and Paul Keating, ministers, for a good part, exercised judgment. They made decisions on individual cases based on information provided by their department and by other professionals. Ministers are appointed to make decisions. It was Senator Robert Ray who decided that this was all too hard and too much and refused to continue this process. It was he alone who said, ‘We must codify the lot.' Look at the mess we have. I will trust Labor ministers and Liberal ministers to make decisions to the best of their ability. If they fall down in making decisions, that is seen publicly. If they make a bad decision, that is seen publicly and they are criticised for it. If they make good decisions, there is no criticism. The exercise of discretion in difficult immigration cases is something which I believe ministers need to do. Ministers are appointed to do that. I am thankful that the capacity to make a discretionary judgment is now back in the legislation, albeit in a limited way. There are a is in the number of reasons whereby and circumstances in which the minister can exercise this discretion, but they relate to whether or not there are children in a family. The one aspect of all this change which I think is regrettable is that it focuses on children as being the prime reason for a change in circumstance. Children are not the prime applicants for immigration to Australia; parents are. That is the problem. With this legislation, we have shifted the real cause for immigration and for possible change in visas to the fact that there are children involved. I believe this process will encourage people, wherever possible, to have children, be they in detention or not. Children will become the focus for seeking a change of status. Smart lawyers will be encouraging people to have children in Australia and to be put into detention. That will be the way through in future. I do not think anybody has contemplated the way in which these factors will be abused by those seeking, for whatever reason, to gain permanent residency. Australia is a most desirable country. If I were in poor circumstances and locked out of this nation, I would do everything possible to gain access to it and to gain permanent residency. If I had a family, why would I not do that? If we have a program which is responsible and economically based in part, which in part allows for reunion of immediate family, and which has a significant part for the special humanitarian and refugee element, then we need to be genuine in the way in which we approach that compassionate element. We need to be sure that those who have a claim to come here as refugees or under special humanitarian circumstances are genuine and that there is a proper process of assessment. One only has to talk to the refugees from Sudan to understand that their circumstances are not quite like those of many from the Middle East who are seeking to get to Australia. One only has to look at the carnage and at the millions who have been slaughtered in Sudan and in nearby regions to understand that it is traumatic, life-changing and damaging. They are the people most in need on the face of the earth at the moment. I believe Australia will continue that policy, but we need to remain focused on giving aid and sustenance to those most in need, not to those who make the loudest claims.",27
7,Ms BURKE,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak in this debate on the Migration Amendment (Detention Arrangements) Bill 2005. This bill contributes to fostering hopelessness in the law. As Sydney PEN says, ‘The fostering of hopelessness is law.' That is the tragedy of the bill before the House. While I want to praise it and say good things about the courageous band on the other side who have led this debate, I feel a slight despair because it is all about maybes. It is not about sound legislation. It is not about enshrining in law how things will be dealt with. It gives greater discretion to a minister who has already failed to act and has led a department that has accorded terrible atrocities to these people. A collection of poems by asylum seekers was recently published by PEN. It gives an insight into another world, another countryone of greater uncertainty, without hope, without dreams or trees and where children are placed behind barbed wire. I desperately want to praise the efforts of the rebel moderates on the government back bench, but I cannot fathom all the excitement about a bill which legislates uncertainty. I express my thanks to their ringleader, the member for Kooyong, for his persistent courage in trying to create a more humane world for those who come to our shores seeking asylum from terrible oppression and tyranny. But, tragically, what keeps ringing in my head is the Monty Python phrase, ‘He is not the Messiah, just a very naughty boy.' And that has been exhibited by some of the outrageous comments from the Liberal members opposite. At the beginning of the year I was on Lateline with the member for Indi, Sophie Panopoulos. Prior to her outrageous comments, she referred to Petro as ‘the one that all families have to have'. She said of his stance on this issue, ‘One swallow does not a summer make.' I shudder in despair to think that, in the supposedly broad church of the Liberal Party, where all views are meant to be heard, the views of moderates are apparently condemned in this way. Where were the member for Kooyong and his merry band of four when the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission handed down their report A last resort? in which they described the effects of detention on the physical and mental health of children. The Convention on the Rights of the Child states that all children living in Austraing lia have a right to the ‘highest attainable standard of health' and that children escaping conflict, torture or trauma have a right to special hope to recover ‘in an environment which fosters the health, self-respect and dignity of the child'. In its report A last resort? National inquiry on children in immigration detention the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission found that child detainees had experienced, among other things, clinical depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and various anxiety disorders. Children in detention exhibited symptoms including bedwetting, sleepwalking and night terrors. At the severe end of the spectrum, some children became mute, refused to eat and drink, made suicide attempts and began to self harm, such as by cutting themselves. Some children also were not meeting their developmental milestones. The report found that, although more than 92 per cent of child detainees were refugees, the trauma experienced in their countries of origin ‘did not account for the extent of the mental health problems they demonstrated in detention'. A study by mental health professionals, the 2003 Steel report, found that all but one of the 20 children who had been detained in a remote detention centre for an average of 28 months were diagnosed with a major depressive disorder and half were diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. The symptoms of PTSD experienced by the children were almost exclusively related to experience of trauma in detention. The children described nightmares and many would scream in their sleep or wake up shouting. In April 2002 the South Australian child welfare authority reported on the condition of a 13-year-old boy who had been detained for more than a year: [He] is very withdrawn and lethargic. Since enterWoomera he has been suicidal and very sad. He reports nightmares nightly, seeing himself dead, or unable to move with people carrying his body. He reports waking screaming and finds trouble falling to sleep. He reports a diminished appetite. He has little memory of past events and no hope for the future. He refuses to make new friends because he believes they will be released but not him. He engages in constructive day time activities but spends hours sitting staring vacantly. Despite all the effort that went into the report, which was released in May last year, the government did nothing. And it will do nothing now. This legislation states that the minister may grant a visa to a detainee to allow them to live in the community if the minister thinks it is in the public interest to do so. But the minister does not have a duty to consider whether to exercise the power and is to exercise power personally. It is up to the minister personally to decide whether or not these children are released. She has that power already and has failed to use it. Many media reports have stated that all families with minor children will be released into the community. I would tell them not to count their chickens before they hatch out of Villawood, because the minister is under no obligation to do any such thing. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs has remained silent on this legislation-no media release, no doorstop, no interview. The last we heard was that she thought making any concession would completely undermine Australia's immigration policy. If that is what she thinks, will she really exercise these new discretionary powers? Will the minister release the bar-code kids from detention centres around Australia? Will she release child VW4977? Will she release child VW8238? Will she release child VW8740? Will she release child VW8741? I could go on. The Prime Minister has stated that children will now only be held in detention as a last resort. As Australia is a signatory to UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, this should always have been the case. The Prime Minister needs to clarify his definition of ‘last resort'. Labor believes that children should only be detained for health and security checks when they arrive in this country as asylum seekers, and even then it should be for only the shortest time. So I ask: where were the courageous four when HREOC handed down its report asking for the immediate release of children a year ago? Where were these courageous Liberals when Labor moved an amendment in 2002 to the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002, which sought to modify the legal power to detain asylum seekers so that children could not be held in high-security detention for long periods? This amendment was to compel the government to put unaccompanied children into foster or community care arrangements and to allow children to live in accommodation such as the Woomera alternate detention trial. Where were these members when the member for Gellibrand introduced a private member's bill to remove all children from detention in December 2002? They were voting with the government to oppose these measures. This is institutionalised hopelessness and more discretion to an incompetent minister and her department. Hope is what these people are seeking. I want to commend the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, who is currently at the table, for giving hope to a Lebanese migrant in my electorate. He did come through at the end of the day, but it took weeks and weeks. I understand that these things are difficult but there was much uncertainty and trauma for that family, with my having to send this individual each week to get another bridging visa from the department and to go and purchase a ticket to the go back to Lebanon just in case the intervention did not come through. Each week we were told that it would be all right, and it was. As I say, I want to thank the minister for his sound intervention in that matter. But there was hopelessness and trauma for this individual who had mistakenly taken wrong advice from a migration agent and put in an inappropriate claim. He should have applied for a spousal visa because he is here and married to a lovely 25-year-old and has two children-one is two years of age and has severe cerebral palsy and the other is 10 months old. Sending that father back to Lebanon would have seen that family collapse. Again, it is the hopelessness and the institutionalised uncertainty that is sending these people mad. I was recently approached by a senior academic at one of the universities in my electorate. They are sponsoring a student on a TPV visa who was recently called into the immigration department for an interview. He was told that he cannot discuss with anybody what the interview was about, so he has not. But the trauma of that interview has sent him into absolute apoplexy. He is an individual who has already suffered persecution and torture in his own land, and his father was executed. Again, it is the uncertainty surrounding this. Why was he interviewed? What does it mean? What is going to happen to him? He cannot get on with his studies and he cannot get on with his life because he is living with a sense of uncertainty. In my doom and gloom I want to add that this bill will improve the lot of those behind barbed wire, but only if the minister acts-I wait to see that. The bill is all about what minister might or could do, and well she could have up until now but she has not. I want to commend all those involved in the various asylum seeker groups who have kept the faith and the pressure on us so that we saw a shift in public opinion. I want to thank those who have written, emailed and rung me to tell me to do more to see this debate through. We the legislators have followed public opinion in this debate and I want to commend those people to you. Legislation should be sound and need ministerial discretion only as a last resort. This bill enshrines the ‘may' of the minister.",29
8,Mrs GASH,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"Most people will recall that I was born in Holland during the tail end of the war. I still have nightmares about the stories of horrific war crimes and the underground activities that took place. The vision of barbed wire detention centre fences appalls me still to this So anything that can change the culture, whilst still keeping our mandatory detention policy, has always been something to work for with likeminded colleagues. In Australia there remains a vestige of an era when there was distrust of someone who appeared a little different. One thing that is different is that, as Australia prospers, it becomes more attractive to those who seek a new life but who must compete in a market where more people want to come than is possible to sustain. Little wonder that there has been a growth in illegal immigrants. Many want to jump the queue and are not prepared to follow the rules, hoping perhaps that the weight of public opinion will sway the lawmakers. I am not certain whether there were too many boat people when the European migrants came over; I think we were first introduced to this phenomenon after the Vietnam War. I recall that, initially, we put our hand the out because those people were seen as genuine refugees. After all, we shared a common enemy. After a time the flow became a flood and our attitudes hardened. Long after the Vietnam War finished, it was becoming apparent that these people were not refugees from oppression but were looking for economic opportunities. Nevertheless, with the passage of time, we became generally accepting of these ‘new' Australians. If nothing else, we Australians are a forgiving people, generally fairly tolerant of others, and we pride ourselves in a selfperception of equality. Perhaps in our laconic and tolerant way we allow others to take advantage of our good nature. If so, surely that is grist to the mill. Looking at the problems that other countries are having with illegal immigrants, Holland being one such country, and seeing what we have achieved here, it is little wonder day. they are envious of our policies. However, that does not mean we cannot move forward and make changes as they become apparent. Thanks to the consistency of our approach, the flood has slowed to a trickle and it is time to make those changes for long-term detainees, and in particular for the women and children in detention. I know it is probably politically incorrect to call people ‘illegal immigrants', but we must remember that they did break the law in the way they chose to arrive. It strikes me as peculiar that many of these so-called refugees bypassed many safe havens and came on to Australia. I have no hesitation in saying that mandatory detention must remain as the cornerstone of our national policy. It is really the only effective deterrent that demonstrates to the world, and in particular to those who are making money from this illegal trade of human cargo, our resolve to choose who we let in, a policy widely supported in Gilmore. However, the time is overdue to make substantial changes, and with the thread of this bill we can afford to be more humane. I also believe we need to streamline the law so that the legislative rights available to everyone under our system of justice and law are not used as leverage to squeeze public sympathy and guilt. The time has come also when the Migration Act 1958 can be further amended to reflect contemporary expectations. I applaud the fact that it is this government that has made these changes. Whilst we in the House may understand the processes that take place, some in our electorates do not. Could I state up front that I have visited all the detention centres, except for Nauru, and am on the record as saying that detainees are often treated better than our own elderly citizens, which is not something I am proud of. They get access to timely medical and dental care, education, specialised meals, recreation and so forth. That is not to say that suspicion. being a detainee is a bed of roses emotionally. It is not, but it has to be remembered that not all of these detainees are genuine refugees-a fact that has been well illustrated. They have to be checked out and their claims validated. This takes time as each appeal further prolongs the process and, unfortunately, is in turn used as a basis to legitimise a future claim for permanent residency. I am also very conscious about sending out the wrong message, particularly to those who profit from illegal activities. The concern I had was the issue of women and children in detention. The model that I saw being used at Woomera of the community living in group homes was a good example of how to do it better and more humanely. Detainees were able to shop locally, volunteer with community groups and go on outings, and children attended local schools. There are many in Gilmore who are very anxious about allowing these detainees into the community, with them taking jobs and welfare support ahead of others, before they have been declared genuine. This process has taken far too long and will certainly be changed by this bill. Then there are those who are prepared to encourage resettlement, and this is where the rural Australian Refugee Association come in very handy. They are very active, especially in the Southern Highlands. I applaud their work and, as always, I will assist where I can. I know I have been criticised by some groups claiming that I should have revealed my voting intention earlier, but my response, both public and private, has always been that both sides of the debate need to be heard first. Those who know me and kept in contact will know I always said that changes were on the way, but, unfortunately, in being a politician people tend to regard you with To me, that is the most distressing downside of being in parliament, and we really have to lift our game to earn the respect of the people we represent. As guilty as we are sometimes made to feel about our attitude to illegal immigrants, I am proud that with these changes we have balanced the previous hard line to protect our borders with a more acceptable arrangement by reducing waiting times and time spent in detention, especially for women and children. Things do change, and in an increasingly volatile world I know there are many in Gilmore who supported our policies but now want to see a change in direction. This bill is a compromise between the resolute defence of our interests, which has held us in good stead, and the national psyche of the Australian people, which says, ‘Fair crack of the whip.' Yes, there will be criticism on both sides of the debate, but I wonder whether that criticism is driven by practical considerations or pure emotion. The fact is that we have demonstrated that we are prepared to bend and make changes-that we are flexible but not a pushover. If results show that we have misjudged the situation, let us be prepared to be equally flexible in responding to that situation. This bill lutionary, not revolutionary. The amendments reflect the will of the Australian people, and that is that mandatory detention is acceptable and successful deterrent and must stay in place. But we must temper this with compassion, and this bill contributes to that end. I would like to acknowledge some people who have been of great support in this difficult time and have always maintained their determination to see changes made yet have done so with great dignity, extraordinary support and understanding. Those people are the members of Amnesty International, and the Kiama branch in particular, especially Brian and Gerda Keast, Libby Turnock of Kangaroo Valley, who has taught me so much about human nature, and Isabelle MCCallum, as well as the many in our community who were open to a balanced view of the debate. But I give a special thankyou to the students of Ulladulla High School, who allowed me to visit them a few Fridays ago as they staged a detention ‘sit-in'. I found them to be well informed and they asked some excellent questions. No doubt there will still be many questions to answer and, as always, I will be happy to address these either individually or in a forum, as I have done many times. To the Prime Minister and all of my colleagues, the debate we had was conducted with dignity and respect for other points of view. It makes me feel proud to belong to a party that not only allows such a debate but also listens and has the guts to make changes when they are needed.",32
9,Mr TANNER,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"Melbourne) (10.11 am)The Migration Amendment (Detention Arrangements) Bill 2005 provides a number of small but significant changes to the Howard government's harsh and inhumane mandatory detention system. The changes are a long way short of the proposals in the origiis evonal bills put forward by the member for Kooyong and, indeed, a long way short of Labor's policy on these matters. Nonethean less, these changes are welcome. They signal a turning of the tide on an extremely important issue-something that is of great concern to many Australians. The bill empowers the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs to order the release of children and their families and, in some cases, long-term detainees from detention. It provides for three-month deadlines for DIMIA decisions with respect to asylum applications, for the Refugee Review Tribunal to review some of those original decisions and for the Ombudsman to inquire into the detention of people who have been in detention for longer than two years. It also contains some other provisions regarding the processing of TPVs. These changes are relatively modest, but they are significant. It is a good sign for this country that we are finally starting to soften this harsh, inhumane system. I remind the House of Labor's policy in these areas. Labor want to see people out of detention after 90 days. For those for whom security, health and identity checks are continuing beyond that time, Labor propose an independent monthly review by an expert committee around whether or not they should remain in detention. Labor want all children out of detention, not on the basis of ministerial whim but on the basis of right. We want to end the outrageous Pacific solution and ensure that temporary protection visas operate for two years only and are one-off and that, beyond that time, the individual concerned will have their case for permanent protection assessed-with the assumption being that, unless it is demonstrated otherwise, they have a legitimate claim. I look forward to the time when Labor policy will be in advance of this and when Labor will commit itself, as the bills originally put forward by the honourable member for Kooyong did, to abolish temporary protection visas altogether, because the ultimate rationale behind temporary protection visas is that people are discriminated against on the basis of the mode of transport that they use to get to Australia-hardly an intelligent basis for determining the right to asylum. The real significance of this bill is that it reflects a major change in community opinion in Australia. Finally, we are seeing the middle ground of genuine, caring, decent, honest Australia starting to assert itself. years of appalling group vilification of asylum seekers by the government with thinly veiled appeals to racial prejudice, after years of hearing sick and deranged people ringing talkback radio programs saying things like, ‘Sink the boats,' and, ‘Just shoot them,' and after years of abuse, denigration and namecalling of people who have taken up the cause of asylum seekers-being called ‘bleeding hearts', ‘the caffelatte set' and the like by people in and associated with the Howard government-finally good, ordinary, decent middle Australia is stirring. This major revolt that we have seen in the parliamentary Liberal Party is an illustration of how strong that sentiment is becoming and how much the attitudes in our community are changing. The cynically manufactured hysteria of 2001 has receded, thankfully. The boats have largely stopped coming because of the fall of the Taliban, the fall of Saddam Hussein and the much stronger cooperation on the part of the Indonesian government, not because of the fabled deterrent effect of the harsh detention system. People have begun to realise that having children born and raised in prison is simply grotesque inhumanity, that indefinite detention for years for people who have committed no crime is simply torture-it cannot be described in any other terms-and that asylum seekers, however weak or strong their individual cases, are almost invariably fleeing a dangerous, deprived and miserable existence and are aspiring to only one thing-to become an Australian, like millions of other migrants and refugees have done before them. It is time we stopped imprisoning people for the crime of wanting to be Australian. It is time we stopped jailing small children. It is time we rebuilt Australia's claim to be the land of the fair go. We are seeing a significant shift in community opinion on these After issues, and I congratulate the member for Kooyong and those who have supported him on playing a role in this. They could have perhaps done it earlier; they could have perhaps done it stronger; they should have stuck out for more; but ultimately they are reflecting a major change in community opinionsomething that is long overdue but most welcome. Decent caring Australia is finally awakening, finally asserting itself and finally saying that this inhumane, harsh system of detention goes way too far and that, although we all accept that we have a need to manage our immigration system, we accept that not all people claiming asylum have genuine cases. We all accept that any nation must and will control and regulate its borders and must and will determine who is to live within those borders. The way that this has been done in Australia in recent years is simply outrageous. It is simply inhumane and no policy justification or policy objective of any government justifies imprisoning small children. No objective can justify that. No objective can justify having people such as Peter Qasim in indefinite detention for years when they have committed no crime. These issues are finally awakening community sentiment in this country. It is pleasing to see that, in spite of John Howard's rhetoric and in spite of the government's formal position, they are starting to soften their approach. The Right is clearly in the ascendant in Australian politics, as it was in the mid1960s. It was subsequently crippled for a generation by the Vietnam War. For all the vile, arrogant, nasty, rabid ranters of the Right that we have to tolerate, such as the member for Indi, I offer this warning: your appalling treatment of asylum seekers, your cynical manipulation of racism and your deliberate fostering of division within the Australian community will hang around your necks in Australian politics long after John Howard has exited the stage.",34
10,Mrs HULL,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"In the very short time-five minutes-that I have to speak on the Migration Amendment (Detention Arrangements) Bill 2005, it is very difficult to make a meaningful contribution to the debate. So I would like to put on record today my thoughts on one area that needs to be covered and that has been covered by many in this debate-that is, the courage and conviction of the members of parliament who have remained committed to the cause. Whether you agree or do not agree with this amendment bill or its intentions, you must admire the courage of these parliamentarians under fire. You must also admire their ability for conciliation, discussion and their meaningful and purposeful intent to be able to resolve a very difficult issue. You must admire the thought and ability of the Prime Minister and these members of parliament to be able to sit down and rationally discuss this issue and to come to a very sensible resolution-sensible not only for future policy making decisions but also for those people who have unfortunately been in this position for far too long. When you come into the House to speak on an issue, you always try to introduce something new into the debate, but it is very difficult with this issue because it involves particularly personal and emotional points of view. But one thing that this kind of demonstrated democracy has done is reinforce the commitment of members like me and other members in the House to acknowledge what is just and what is unjust. The people who will benefit from the very brave and courageous amendments that the government have put forward in the bill will see this for the rest of their lives as the beginning of their lives. The day that they can get the benefit of the amendments that these members of parliament have negotiated will be the day that they can begin their lives. Wherever they begin their lives, it will be a meaningful day for them. One can only imagine what it must feel like to be a victim of people traffickers. Make no mistake, the people who have come here are mostly genuine refugees-and have been recognised as such. They have been victims time and time again. They were victims in their own countries. They were victims of abuse and violence and death threats to their families. They became victims of people traffickers and people smugglers and then they became victims of a set of rules that treated them as though they had committed significant or horrendous crimes when in fact the only crime that they had committed was to try to remove their family from these circumstances. I would believe that, given the same conditions, I would make the decisions that many of these people have made. There is no doubt that if somebody threatened the life of my family-my sons, my grandchildren-I would be willing to make any sacrifice or take any risk to ensure their safety and their well-being. I kept coming back to this issue when this was being discussed. I have a very dear Ethiopian family in my life. I fought for five years to reunite in Australia a genuine refugee with his children. He came into Australia in 1991 and had the most horrific story to tell. It would reduce the hardest of people to absolute tears. When he was fleeing his village and trying to get to a safer place to which he could then bring his family, what he experienced was just grotesque. Yet he survived, went to Egypt and finally made it into Australia as a genuine refugee. To then try and get him reunited with his family was the most difficult task I have ever undertaken. But after five years of hard work he was reunited with his family, and they are a very important part of my family now. If people had not believed him in his plight along the way in his country, if people had not provided him at times with shelter from those that were pursuing him and if it had not been for the person who picked it up at the end and decided that he was well worth saving, then I know that this wonderful family would never have had an opportunity. So it is with these people, this family that is so close to me, in mind that this very close to my heart. I commend the Migration Amendment (Detention Arrangements) Bill 2005 to the House. I think it is the beginning of life for many people and I again congratulate those members who have had the courage of their convictions to lead us, show us the way and show us what it is like to be a true and committed member of the House of the Parliament of Australia.",36
11,Mr WINDSOR,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"I will speak briefly to the Migration Amendment (Detention Arrangements) Bill 2005. I am aware of some of the arrangements that the House has made to expedite the passage of this bill. I would like to congratulate the member for Kooyong, in particular, and his three comrades on the stance that they have taken. It has received a lot of support from people within the electorate of New England. It is one of those issues that have touched the hearts of many, and many people have wrestled with the broader problems in trying to come to grips with solutions and in taking a more compassionate approach. Success has many fathers. A lot of people are trying to grab hold of the coat-tails of this change in policy, but I have absolutely no doubt that the four people who led the charge in the Liberal Party are the ones who need the acclamation of all of us because they have been prepared to stand up for this under what have been, at times, fairly strenuous circumstances. I have no doubt that some of the private meetings that took place and some of the comments that were made, privately and publicly, would have subjected those individuals to quite a lot of pressure. So I have great admiration for those people who have been prepared to stand up for something that they believe in. I would encourage others in this parliament, if they believe in something quite strongly, to stand up and say so. I think it is a good thing for debill is mocracy when the broader community can see people standing up on matters of principle, irrespective of whether it causes some damage to their personal political careers. I think many of us were offended-as I am sure the member for Kooyong and his colleagues were offended-by the terms that were used by another member of parliament, who referred to them as political terrorists. That is an abuse of the language and an abuse of the principles and the particular view that those four hold on this matter, and I believe it is to the detriment of the individual who made those comments. They were comments that were very good to be in the paper for a day or two, but I think it is regrettable that they were made. I would be the last to say that I have led this debate, because, like many Australians, I recognised that there was a problem but, like many of us, I really did not know what the solution was. I am pleased to see that some people within the government while possibly not curing all of the problems, have made the system much more compassionate. I refer to my maiden speech on 14 February 2002 when I entered this place. It was after the Tampa incident. I made this comment-and it was an unwritten speech, so it was a bit all over the place: The process that we are going through at the moment with the Tampa is a disgrace. Locking people up for two or three years indicates to the process is not working. That does not mean we open the borders up to everybody but we have to develop a different process that does have a more compassionate approach to it. What we are seeing today, under the leadership of the member for Kooyong and the three others, is a move towards a more compassionate approach to an issue that I think has touched the hearts of many, and I congratulate the government and the House on accepting the very well-meaning thoughts of the member for Kooyong and the others.",37
12,Mr MCGAURAN,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"Gippsland-Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs) (10.29 am)-I wish to thank all members who have contributed to this debate on the Migration Amendment (Detention Arrangements) Bill 2005, although I would score their contributions quite differently. Some members of the opposition have used the opportunity to again run tired, old and even discredited criticisms of the government and its immigration policy, but I am not going to get bogged down in what is old news and political opportunism of the worse kind. Instead, I want to address the substantive issues, because this is, at the risk of stating the obvious, enormously important legislation before the House of Representatives. In doing so, I am going to commence with a brief summation of Australia's refugee and humanitarian program. I am the minister responsible, together with Senator Vanstone, for the settlement of our refugees and I am therefore extremely familiar with the program. Sadly, very few members of even this House, let alone the general public, are aware of what Australia does for the most deprived and vulnerable refugees in the world. We have a program of taking each year 13,000 refugees and humanitarian arrivals, mostly from the Horn of Africa countries: Eritrea, Ethiopia, the Congo, Sudan, me that Burundi, Liberia and Rwanda-the most war-torn and impoverished countries in the world. We take refugees from the camps in Tanzania, Kenya and Egypt, and they have often been in those camps for several years. We are one of only three countries in the world who do it. There are but three countries in the world with an organised refugee and humanitarian program-the United States, Canada and Australia. So do not give me this ‘I am ashamed to be Australian' stuff that you here repeated every now and then. As soon as someone says that, forget it. That is just moral proselytising; that is just selfrighteous reinforcement. Australia has one of the proudest records with regard to refugees anywhere in the world bar none. Actually, after the United States, we take the most number-not per capita but in actual terms. The United States has a program for about 28,000 refugees, ours is 13,000 and Canada's is slightly lower than ours. And we increased it. It was 12,000 a year ago; it is now 13,000. Our settlement programs, where we meet migrants at the airport and give them intensive assistance with accommodation, employment, education and integration in the community, are studied throughout the world. People come here and look at how we do it. Canada and the United States will, in all humility, study our programs to see how to do their settlement better. So the Howard government's refugee humanitarian policy is amongst the best in the world. We rely on the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to nominate those refugees. As I say, it is dominated by Horn of Africa countries-people escaping the worse imaginable human circumstances. If they have not themselves suffered physical abuse, then they have certainly witnessed it. So there is a lot of traumaand torture-counselling issues in the settlement also needed for them. We should be proud of that. We should be talking about it. Instead it gets swamped by media reports about unlawful arrivals-the asylum seekers of the past few years. Let us understand this: our international responsibilities are to political refugees, not economic refugees. The United Nations tells us that there are 17 million refugees identifiable throughout the world. Eight and a half million are the most vulnerable and the most depressed. Australia does not accept economic refugees. We have an orderly program. By the way, can you believe that only five countries in the world have an immigration program: the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Israel and Australia. Australia's program is in the national interest. It program of 140,000 people, 95,000 of whom are business or skilled migrants. On top of that we take 13,000 refugees. We do not take economic refugees. To the best of my knowledge, no country in the world does. We take political refugees. When people arrive here unlawfully by boat then of course we have to assess their claims. And that is why you have mandatory detention-a Labor Party policy that we have continued in government. There is nothing unreasonable or wrong about the policy at that point, at the starting point, where we determine their identities and examine their claims for political asylum. The simple fact is that a lot of unlawful arrivals are not going to assist in the establishment of their identity because that might place them as economic refugees rather than as political refugees. It takes time to work through the absence of material or the misleading material available to us. Let us put this in context. Australia has every right, as the general public well know and understand, to determine the identity of people who arrive here unannounced and unlawfully, particularly when we are bringing in so many refugees and are so dedicated to assisting them-with their most troubled of experiences, background and past-to settle in Australia as quickly as possible. We want these people to realise their ambitions and their hopes for themselves and their families as quickly as humanly possible. That is the starting point. We have to compassionately, sympathetically and speedily process people who are in detention. We agree with that and we have endeavoured to do that at all times. Now we have legislation before the House that softens some aspects of mandatory detention. I do not want the House or the public believing that this is an overnight revelation. For some time now, the government has been softening its detention policy. We have established alternative acis a commodation for families, for children especially, outside of detention centres. Mr Albanese-So you had it wrong.",38
13,Mr MCGAURAN,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"Over a period of time, as numbers have decreased, we have been able to soften it. There are interjections from the opposition. Let us turn to the opposition because I want to place on the record the framework within which the government operates and the very compassionate, humanitarian and generous program we have for refugees. Did you know that in 1994 the Labor Party had 342 children in detention? Did you know that the year we came to government, 1996, they had 191 children in detention? There was no residential project then. There was no community housing for them. The Labor Party, in the six years since they introduced mandatory detention, never softened it and never provided choice to apply for alternative arrangements for families and the like. The Labor Party have this chant and the Leader of the Opposition led it: children behind razor wires. They have practised it, they have worked it, maybe they have even focusgroup tested it-children behind razor wires. If you read the Hansard from yesterday, you will see the Labor members have all been told to get that up to morally blackmail the government. There are 53 children in detention as of today compared to the Labor Party's hundreds of children in detention. It is remarkable, isn't it? The Labor Party have no credibility on this issue. I will not go through each member's contribution; time will not allow it. The contribution I will concentrate on was that given by the Leader of the Opposition yesterday. This is the man who holds himself out to be the alternative prime minister. A more superficial and contrived presentation you would never find. Leaving aside the deficiencies of the Leader of the Opposition's presentation, the aspect I would like to concentrate on is his slanderous and totally unfair attack on Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. A basic rule in politics is that you never repeat a negative because that is just kicking an own goal, but I am actually going to quote the Leader of the Opposition, even though it is an attack on the department because the air needs to be cleared in regard to his allegations. He said: ... the bungling, disaster prone Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs presumably continues on its merry way, detaining Australian residents, deporting Australian citizens and keeping women and children behind razor wire ... A department out of control, rocked by scandal after scandal, without any scrutiny or check from a judicial review process, emerges unscathed. That is a cowardly attack on overwhelmingly dedicated officials of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. Firstly, there are eight million transactions or contacts by the department over the course of a year. Almost all of them are done professionally with care and attention and as quickly as circumstances will allow. Given eight million dealings with the public, you would think there would be tens of thousands of complaints. But, in actual fact, there are very few, particularly as they relate to detention. There were 88,000 persons detained last year for overstaying or for working without the correct visa or the like. Some of those detentions might have been for a few minutes; some of them might have been in the foyer of the office of the departmentit is not that they went into detention centres. Of those, we have referred 201 cases to the Palmer inquiry for consideration. I actually believe a number of those 201 will show that the department acted reasonably. If you raid a brothel or an orchard, which is the standard practice of compliance, people for good reasons are not going to immediately offer their identity or do not have the papers with them. the They do not carry their passports or their visas with them. Of the 201, I believe in a number of them it will be found that the department acted reasonably. But that represents 0.2 per cent of detentions. Forget your eight million-let us just look at the 88,000 detentions each year. We have raised a query about 0.2 per cent of detentions and we want the Palmer inquiry to advise on them. That is a remarkably small number. Instead the Leader of the Opposition is using hyperbole, exaggerating and misrepresenting, because he talked in the plural‘detaining Australian residents, deporting Australian citizens'. We have the Rau and Alvarez cases. They are singular; they are not in the plural. The Rau and Alvarez cases are a tragedy without doubt, and reform has already taken place in identity processes, but the issue also involves a number of state government agencies and also the difficult and complex issue of mental health. I believe the Alvarez and Rau cases are more revealing about mental health treatment and identification than they are about detention. But I will wait for the Palmer inquiry. The Leader of the Opposition then talked about the department being without any scrutiny or check from a judicial review process. My heavens! Without check or judicial review! DIMIA is the most scrutinised, accountable department in the entire Commonwealth Public Service, I would think. There is the Ombudsman and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commissioner, all of the courts and parliamentary oversight committees. There is a steady stream of people going through detention centres, and always has been, checking the levels of service, accommodation and the like. But the point is: this is a difficult, lenging area for any government. When I talk about 0.2 per cent of detentions being referred to Palmer for consideration, as I stress, I believe that not all or even a majority-I do not know; I am speculating-will be found to be of concern. I am told that was the same as when Labor was in power. This is a difficult area. As Mr Cadman, the member for Mitchell, said earlier on, Australian citizenship is the most prized in the world. Of course people are going to come here and do their level best. The member for Mitchell said that he has no hostility towards somebody trying to use the system or whatever legal rights or avenues are available to acquire Australian residency. Why wouldn't people do that if it is the best social security, education and health system in the world-even as we strive to improve them? There is no inbuilt hostility towards people seeking to become an Australian citizen. On the other hand, we are trying to run an immigration policy, and rules are rules. Listening to some members of the opposition, you would think they are saying, ‘Let's tear up the rule book.' For instance, the member for Chisholm, talking about a case I am very familiar with, complained about a Lebanese man who applied for a spouse visa because he is married to an Australian citizen. Fair enough, but the rules are that you have to apply offshore unless there are special circumstances. In this case, because the child was seriously ill, I intervened using my powers under the act. I am very familiar with this case. That man deliberately and knowingly avoided the rules. The member for Chisholm complained that it took time to decide this issue. You bet it takes time. He knowingly avoided the rules. If you look at his immigration history, it will verify this. Do we have a rule book or not? Do not chalconfuse the visa overstayers with the unlawful arrivals or the asylum seekers. That is part of the ignorance of members of the opposition. Many of their contributions are riddled with it. There is a big difference between visa overstayers seeking a migration outcome via political asylum and people who are genuine political refugees from Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran and the like. The member for Reid knows this. I see that the shadow minister for immigration is subject to some criticism. I have a lot of sympathy for him. All he has tried to do recently is discuss some of the realities of immigration policy. When you have millions of inquiries from people wanting to come to Australia and hundreds of thousandsapproximately 450,000-applications a year, you have to have some rules. You have to have some criteria and you have to do the right thing. That means applying offshore. We do have unlawful arrivals and we must deal with them. We do so as compassionately as possible, as does DIMIA. The contribution of the Leader of the Opposition was not a contribution by an alternative Prime Minister. This was a contribution by somebody who was seizing the political moment. The Leader of the Opposition does himself no credit. His generalised slurs and slander against DIMIA are most unfair. Above all else, they are utterly incorrect. What we need from people of seniority like the Leader of the Opposition is thoughtful contributions. He will set the tone for his backbenchers and his shadow ministers. A person as politically beleaguered as he is will seize on any opportunity to turn it to his political advantage. In regard to the Leader of the Opposition's second reading amendment, the first paragraph of significance is: ... an Inspector-General of Detention should be appointed ... That is just a duplication of the role of the Ombudsman. It is another bureaucracy. The Labor Party will always revert to bureaucracy and complicated internal processes when devoid of real, meaningful ideas. It is an absurd suggestion when you have the Ombudsman already in this field. The second aspect of major interest is: ... the Ombudsman should report monthly on the continued detention of all detainees held for 90 days. Ninety days! That is an administrative nightmare, as the member for Reid, with a good understanding of immigration operations, will tell you in a moment of honestyin private. He will not say it publicly. You cannot have the Ombudsman reporting on detention after 90 days. It would be an administrative nightmare that would be utterly unworkable. All in all, I have to say that I am disappointed in most of the contributions by members opposite, particularly in the contribution by Mr Beazley, who in his attempt to discredit DIMIA only discredits himself. Like my colleagues, I am proud of the legislation we bring to the House. We believe it is line with public expectations. It will win wide public support. It is the result of considered and, for the most part, harmonious party room deliberations. I thank all members of the government for their constructive contributions that have allowed us to reach this point, which is to soften and introduce a more flexible and orderly detention policy.

14,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"I understand that it is the wish of the House for the opposition amendments circulated to be debated in groups and for the question on each group of amendments to be deferred. After the House has completed its consideration of the amendments, individual questions will be put on each group.",43
15,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,NOES,"I move opposition amendment (6) as circulated: (6) Schedule 1, after item 18, page 11 (after line 23) insert: “18A Before Part 9 insert: Part 8 AC Inspector-General of Detention 486 AL Inspector-General of Detention As soon as practicable after this section commences, the Minister must appoint a person as the Inspector-General of Detention (the Inspector-General) 486BL Functions of Inspector-General of Detention (1) The functions of the Inspector-General are to (a) receive and make determinations concerning complaints from persons in immigration detention (b) pay particular attention to the needs of children in immigration detention, in community care or in residence at a place specified under tion 197AB (c) consider general or systemic matters the Inspector-General decides of his or her own motion to consider; and (2) The Inspector-General may make a determination about any matter considered by the Inspector-General. (3) The Secretary must take action to give effect to any determination made by the Inspector-General. In what was unfortunately a singularly ill informed contribution, the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs denigrated this amendment by saying that it was just a matter of creating another bureaucracy. He tried to minimise the crisis affecting this department by saying repeatedly that there had been a single case of illegal detention of Australians. Once again I say it is singularly ill-informed. He seems to think that the Iranian man detained for two weeks in WA who had obvious psychiatric problems and was not an Australian should not be counted. He said that there were only 200 cases referred to the Palmer inquiry. I hope he understands-I hope he was not trying to mislead-that there are another 928 cases being looked at by the department to see whether they should be referred. We have here a singular need for oversight and for transparency in this area. We are a long way from the comments of the Prime Minister in 2002 when he could credibly say in his mind that until he had evidence of bad administration or systemic failure he was not going to do anything other than support the department. That comment, of course, is very much under the hammer at the moment. We have seen over many months of exposes the urgent need for oversight. We have a situation where male guards are observing women in Baxter and the contractor can give no assurance that that will be avoided. We have a situation where the nature of Red 1, secthe specific detention monitoring system inside, has had to be taken out of operation because of public criticism. We have the reality that, many months before it became a national issue, people at Baxter gained the impression that Cornelia Rau might be an Australian. It did not go up the food chain. No-one was advised. She languished there. Justice Finn has commented that ‘it is imperative that the Commonwealth conduct regular and systematic performance audits' of the contractors. That has not been the case. There is no effective review of these operations. The government has been dragged to provide better psychiatric assistance, conceding that it has been inadequate. We have the reality that Cornelia Rau's condition was essentially only driven forward by the pleas of the detainees in the centre. They could see a psychiatric state; they could see the need for assistance. To say that all is well, that we do not need any oversight and that it is bureaucracy is an insult to that which has been exposed over recent months. It is neglect of the interests of the people in detention. We know that Justice Finn in that very important decision of the two Iranian detainees who had not been given psychiatric assistance for 12 and 17 months respectively said that there had been culpable neglect by the government, the department and the contractors. To say that we do not need any oversight, that we do not need any transparency, that we do not need more accountability and that we do not need the reduced possibility of wrongful detention is preposterous. But that is the kind of argument that was put forward by the minister for multicultural affairs-that all is well, that we do not need any oversight, that these things will sort themselves out, that there are no problems. Quite clearly there are. Kjell Liljegren, a former detention guard who had been there for seven years, commented: It was more obvious that they wanted to run the centres more like prisons than actual detention centres which are meant for administrative purposes only. Most of the time it was based on trol and restraint. We have a federal immigration officer commenting in the Herald of 13 March 2002: The detention centres are now a cross between a jail and a lunatic asylum. So to say that there is no need for oversight is spurious. Over many months inadequacies have been found. The less the service and the cheaper you can provide it determines how it operates. There is obviously great criticism of the subcontractors in the medical and psychiatric areas. People, it seems, who do not have proper professional credentials have been working there. The actual service up until very recently-long after the Prime Minister made these comments about how great the system was-took six to eight to nine weeks. The government has relented. It has surrendered because of public criticism by the opposition to provide a more adequate, swifter and more available service. We have a contractor, GSL, that seemingly has a culture of prison.

16,Mr MCGAURAN,NOES,Gippsland-Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs) (11.06 am)-I and my colleagues in the government are somewhat constrained almost to the point of being in a straitjacket about responding to the opposition's amendments because they were circulated four minutes ago.,45

Maybe the opposition are paying me a compliment I do not deserve but I cannot absorb them so quickly in such a short time frame as the opposition have given us, so that is disappointing.  uty Speaker: while I was listening to the minister I was wondering whether he could advise the House when the opposition actually got a briefing",45

Just because the opposition are tardy or disinterested does not mean we do not have a right to complain when detailed amendments come four minutes before discussion commences on them. But, in any event, the amendment that we seem to be dealing with at present goes to independent medical access, so may I inform the House of what the present case is.

They have come to this House and put very important and far-reaching reforms to immigration and detention policy dealing with all of the medical access aspects because-and this is important to get acrossMr Laurie Ferguson-On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: I spoke earlier of ill-informed contribution",46

31,Ms HOARE,NOES,"The minister in this place is an absolute disgrace if he cannot come into this parliament and try to debate amendments which have been put forward by the Australian Labor Party in relation to migration legislation. He should be absolutely embarrassed and the government should be embarrassed that they have got a minister here who has got absolutely no an idea of what we are debating in this place right now. It is an absolute disgrace. The minister spoke about the time frame of the amendments, but the Labor Party was given a briefing on the government's legislation at four o'clock yesterday afternoon. ",46
32,Ms HOARE,NOES,"At four o'clock yesterday afternoon the opposition was provided with a briefing on the government's migration amendment legislation, so the Labor Party members who are sitting here have had to formulate our amendments based on that briefing yesterday at a very late period of time in the day. In speaking to our amendment proposing an inspector-general of immigration detention centres, I want to make a number of comments on the negotiated settlement between the Prime Minister and the member for Kooyong in relation to mandatory detention. Whilst the compromise is welcome and certainly an improvement on the inhumane conditions so many refugees have been subjected to, we on this side of the House do not believe that the changes go far enough to address the fundamental wrong of incarcerating people in the desert without charge. Labor's position goes so much further than what the Prime Minister was prepared to give into. I have been promoting Labor's policy on asylum seekers since its endorsement at the 2003 ALP National Conference in Sydney. It has an appropriate system that still retains administrative detention but removes its punitive nature. Under the Prime Minister's amendments to the act, the minister will be able to specify alternative detention arrangements but will not be compelled to do so. Hopefully, the inspector-general amendment will be accepted to ensure that, in all cases where there is a threat to a detainee's mental or physical well-being, the detainee will be released into appropriate alternative accommodation. The inspector-general will ensure that 90 per cent of all claims for asylum will be processed within 90 days. The government's amendments are intended to have all primary visa decisions made by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs within three months and the reviews made by the Refugee Review Tribunal in a further three months. The Howard plan does not take into account many crucial measures which have been addressed by Labor's position. They have been out there, Minister, for the past two years. The inspector-general would allow health services in detention centres to be provided by independent medical professionals and would ensure that these aspects would be carried out. These professionals would be free to speak out on issues, the need for which has been emphasised by the recent tragic cases of Cornelia Rau and Vivian Solon. The Prime Minister's measures do not create an independent inspector-general of detention centres nor, as we will hear, do they allow media access to detention centres or resolve the problems associated with lengthy waiting times for court appeals. The inspector-general would oversee the availability of appropriate community housing facilities onshore and offshore. The government proposals do not indicate where community housing will be coming from. Crucially, the Prime Minister's compromise position on immigration detention does not resolve flaws which lead to people remaining in the system for unacceptable periods. Labor believes in an orderly immigration system based on the rule of law, a system of integrity in which the Australian people will have confidence and trust. We must treat individuals fairly and with dignity and civility. To treat individuals fairly requires that they are dealt with in a speedy and efficient manner, where decisions and procedures are subject to appropriate review. It is in our national interest to conduct ourselves as a good international citizen, to do our fair share for those who are subject to persecution and need protection. Labor in government will ensure that our borders are secure and that the processing and detention of asylum seekers is fair. I am sure that all members in this place have been inundated with letters, emails and phone calls from constituents calling for changes to the inhumane system of mandatory detention. This grassroots campaign has at least brought about some softening of the arrangements. I commend all Australians who have taken the time to get in touch with their politicians urging change. If we had more grassroots activism, Australia would improve for the better. I specifically wish to record my appreciation of local Lake Macquarie and Hunter based organisations such as Amnesty International Newcastle branch and the Newcastle Action for Refugee Rights group and the campaign they have waged over many years to bring about decent changes.

33,Mr CADMAN,NOES,"Mitchell) (11.16 am)This proposal, opposition amendment (6), inserts another review process. The opposition claim that their proposed amendments streamline and make the legislation fair and compassionate. So what do they do? The first amendment they move puts another review process in train, creating a new office of spector-general, who will be sent around the traps to look at the circumstances of detainees. The lawyers will not stay at homethere will be legal process involved. This amendment merely creates another review for the inspector-general who will take legal advice from representatives of the department and of the detainee. It sets out to do exactly the opposite of what the Australian Labor Party claim they are supposed to do. The secretary appoints the inspectorgeneral whose functions are to receive and make determinations concerning submissions and complaints-there is a whole list of things the inspector-general can do-and to ‘pay particular attention to the needs of chilto dren'. What does that mean? It will mean that psychologists, educators and medical people get in on the event and the whole process becomes another grand overview, a second hearing of all the elements already previously gone through. This is a ridiculous proposal. Instead of streamlining the process, the Australian Labor Party are proposing another complication. The secretary is also to ‘ensure that the Inspector-General is given unrestricted access' to all centres and to all people. He will cart the media along as well. So the person with the best publicist will get the most attention. What a crazy way of making decisions. The first of the proposed opposition amendments says that the media has to have access to everything. It will be trial by media. You can see it now: the inspector-general will go into a detention centre, there will be cameras everywhere, he will listen to the claims of the detainee, the lawyer, the child psychologist-all and sundry. The media then can publicise exactly what is being presented to the inspector-general. This is a strange and very unusual process. We ought to go back to the ideas of the in- member for Reid, Laurie Ferguson, rather than these strange ideas. In 2002 or in 2004, his ideas were dumped and the Labor Party moved into a new era of enlightenment and fairness! This is crazy stuff-that an inspector-general can wander around detention centres, is given open access to everything, can take complaints and submissions from all and sundry, including lawyers, and have the media there to help him along. It is no wonder the government has no intention of voting for this issue. There is no intention on our side for this proposal to get up. If you want to check on conditions within detention centres, an elite group of people, including Gerry Hand, have been travelling detention centres and reporting to the minister on conditions in those centres. I take it the inspector-general is not going to do that. His or her role will be to take specific submissions from people in the centres. I do not know where the Australian Labor Party's brains are on some of these issues. Its former policies were bad enough, but this is moving into the arena of the strange and the terrible. It will be trial by media, by publicmatters, ity. The person with the best publicist will get the most attention. Because the minister will grant access to the media, he will be influenced by public opinion rather than by the facts of the case. I cannot believe that you would want to bypass the proposition of the government that the Ombudsman should reassess things and report to parliament. What could be better than having the Ombudsman-I do not purport that we should start the case all over again-look at the facts and report to parliament. That way, everything is open and transparent and everybody knows the circumstances. (Time expired)",48
34,Mr SNOWDON,NOES,Lingiari) (11.21 am)What a pathetic performance! I wonder if the member for Mitchell recognises that there is an inspector-general of prisons in his own state of New South Wales. Does he think that is appropriate or inappropriate? Mr MCGauran-We have an Ombudsman.,49
35,Mr SNOWDON,NOES,"I guarantee there is an Ombudsman in New South Wales as well. These people are not prepared to provide external oversight of what is going on in these institutions. They want to have an interdepartmental committee, with no power and no responsibility, to give advice to the government. That committee will be asked to report to the government backbenchers on a fortnightly basis. That is how much confidence they have in this process. We need an inspector-general who will be able to receive and resolve individual complaints from detainees, be empowered to enter detention centres and immigration processing facilities-including on Christmas Island, which is part of my constituency-meet with detainees as necessary, question detention centre staff, view relevant records, receive complaints and inquire into and resolve such pay particular attention to ensuring the needs of these children in community care are being met and be able to inquire into more systemic problems on his or her own motion. I ask members opposite to go to the questions without notice from Senator Kirk to Senator Vanstone on the issue of Cornelia Rau. If you want an example of why we need an inspector-general, read Hansardbecause it makes it very clear that the role of the staff in the detention centre was the only reason that Cornelia Rau's case was brought to the attention of the government. If there had been external oversight by an inspectorgeneral, I am sure that this would have come to light a lot earlier. I have spoken to Dr Frukacz, the psychiatrist involved in that particular case, and it is very clear that the bell was rung but nobody took any notice. Had there been an inspector-general, I am sure that would not have been the case. If we are to have an immigration detention policy, we have to make sure our procedures for detaining people are entirely above board. This is particularly important when government policy appears to be-and is-to hire private contractors to manage and staff the detention centres. I believe it is very important that the inspector-general be empowered to assess the recruitment, training and professional development standards for staff as well as the conditions for detainees. We need to be sure of the staffing arrangements in these detention centres. These problems arising from privatisation will be further exacerbated if the border protection legislation goes through, because it will add more contractors-this time to AMFA-to the list of persons authorised to detain. These may not be strictly detention trained staff, but the inspector-general should insist on training and skill levels consistent with those required for the larger detention centres. Detention centres have been described by an individual as a cross between an asylum and jail. What does that say about the standards that are being applied by those who are running these detention facilities? To supplement Coonawarra in the Northern Territory, further temporary detention points at Gove, Broome and Horn Island to look after foreign fishermen were announced in the budget. In my view, this will add to the need for the inspector-general to operate under a very broad canvas to ensure that standards of treatment are consistent across the different centres. There has to be someone who can answer the question: quis custodiet custodes-who guards the guardians? That is the point. I do not believe that anyone on the government benches honestly and sincerely believes they should not be supporting this amendment-no-one-because it is logical, fair, reasonable and says we have to have standards. In his earlier intervention the minister said, ‘We were only given these amendments yesterday.' Mr MCGauran-Four minutes ago!",49
36,Mr SNOWDON,NOES,"Four minutes ago. Minister, you say that you are diligent, but I am not sure that you are. I believe you could be if you applied yourself, but I do not think you have. Had you known what the Labor Party policy was, you would have known that we would put this amendment, because it is part of our policy which was framed almost 2½ years ago. It has been consistently advocated by the Labor Party. So do not come in here crying crocodile tears and saying you are surprised by the fact that we are moving an amendment which relates to the inspector-general. You should have known and you should have the arguments before you. (Time expired)",50
37,Mr TURNBULL,NOES, Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER Mr Laurie Ferguson-Costello wants to know what you were doing at the Sharks game.,50
38,Mr TURNBULL,NOES,"The member for Reid's interjection would be more interesting if I could hear it-whether it is because of the distance or because of my own capacities, I do not know. Amendment (6) seeks to impose an inspector-general of detention-I will come back to that-and to change the reporting times in the new part 8(c) of the bill such that reporting to the Ombudsman would be done after 90 days instead of two years and ongoing reports would be given every month instead of every six months. I think I have correctly captured the essence of the amendment. I believe that everyone of goodwill agrees that the critical need is for the immigration department to administer its refugee policy with efficiency, humanity and compassion. The fundamental requirement is that the administration of the policy-the execution, if you like-be done in a way that meets our expectations of compassion and efficiency. Imposing more and more third party oversight can often be very counterproductive. We already have in this bill a provision for an established office bearer with a role in oversight and review of administrative actions-the Commonwealth Ombudsman-to be reported to regularly about persons in detention. As I said earlier today, this office bearer has very extensive powers to subpoena witnesses, procure documents and interview anybody in the course of investigating the matters under review. This obviously is a considerable increase in accountability to the public and to the parliament. The question has to be asked: what is really added by appointing an inspectorgeneral? What is the inspector-general going to do that is not currently open to the parliament through the joint parliamentary standing committee, through the UNHCRMr MCGauran-HREOC.",50
39,Mr TURNBULL,NOES,"through the various NGOs and agencies, such as HREOC, as the minister interjects. There is already a considerable amount of attention paid to conditions in detention centres and, arguably, we might not be having this debate today if there were not. The answer of the Labor Party, which is simply to appoint yet another agency, is creating yet another bureaucracy to do the same piece of work being done by so many others. The change to the role of the Ombudsman is to bring the reporting periods down to very short time frames. It is difficult to say whether, in the light of experience, reporting after two years, with an update after six months, as is comprehended in this bill, will be timely enough. Experience will tell. The government has demonstrated that it combines both a big heart and a hard head in dealing with immigration, and that was demonstrated by the Prime Minister's presentation of these reforms last week. If the time frames prove to be inadequate, no doubt they will be reviewed. But to arbitrarily, and just for the sake of putting up an amendment, foreshorten them in the way they do now is really just proposing an amendment for the sake of having something to say. The minister's bill is an outstanding reform, and it is one that we should all wholeheartedly and without any reservations or amendments support.",51
40,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"In accordance with the wish of the House, the question that opposition amendment (6) be agreed to is deferred until after the House has completed its consideration of all the proposed amendments.",51
41,Ms KATE ELLIS,NOES,"by leave-I move opposition amendments (3) to (5), as circulated, together: (3) Schedule 1, item 11, page 7 (line 13), omit “If” substitute “Subject to section 197 ABA, if” (4) Schedule 1, item 11, page 7 (after line 25) insert: “197ABA Children to reside at specified place rather than being held in detention centre etc (1) Unless the Minster receives a determination under section 197 ABC from the Judicial Assessor, the Minister must make a residence determination in respect to children under 18 within 30 days of the day on which this section commences. (2) Unless the Minister receives a determination under section 197 ABC from the Judicial Assessor, if the Minister has made a residence determination under subsection (1) in respect to a child, the Minister must also make a residence determination in respect to any parent, brother or sister of the child if that parent, brother or sister is held in detention with the child. 197 ABB Appointment of Judicial Assessor (1) As soon as practicable after this section commences the Minister must appoint a person as the Judicial Assessor for the purpose of this section. (2) A person appointed as the Judicial Assessor must either (a) be a judge of the Federal Court of Australia; or (b) have been (i) a judge of the Federal Court of Australia, or (ii) a judge of the Supreme Court of a State or Territory. (3) The role of the Judicial Assessor is to consider applications by the Secretary for a determination by the Judicial Assessor that a residence determination should not be made under subsection 197ABA(1) in respect of a child or under subsection 197ABA(2) in respect of a parent or a brother or a sister of a child. 197 ABC Determinations by Judicial Assessor (1) If the Secretary makes an application to the Judicial Assessor for a determination under this section in respect of a child or the parent or brother or sister of a child, the Secretary must ensure that all information held by the Department in respect of that person is made available to the Judicial Assessor. (2) The Judicial Assessor must not make a determination that a residence determination should not be made in respect of a child or the parent or brother of a child unless the Judicial Assessor concludes that, if the person were allowed to leave immigration detention, there would be a significant risk that (a) the person would represent a danger to the safety and welfare of the Australian community or to a segment of that community, or (b) the person would not be available if required for any further action under this act. (3) A determination by the Judicial Assessor under this section must (a) be made by notice in writing, and (b) be provided to the Minister within 7 days after it has been made.” (5) Schedule 1, item 11, page 9 (line 28), before “The Minister”, insert “Subject to section 197ABA”, I stated last night that, whilst I think this immigration debate is long overdue, it is pleasing that the House has the opportunity to debate the national disgrace which is our immigration system. We have heard many contributions over the course of the debate. People have addressed serious concerns regarding a number of issues in our system, such as the plight of those on temporary protection visas, independent medical access to our detention centres and, of course, the unacceptably long time that we are detaining people who are awaiting processing. But I would like us to now focus on one single issue which I believe stands above all others-that is, children do not belong in detention centres. It is time that we address that in this parliament and ensure that it no longer continues. As I said in the chamber last night, Labor wants children out of detention. These amendments moved by Labor will do just that. There was much expectation when the member for Kooyong proposed his two initial bills as they had provisions for removing children from detention and placor sister ing them in community homes. The Prime Minister's watered down compromise does not go this far. It does not enshrine in legislation what I and many Australians believe, which is that all children should be removed from behind the razor wire. The Prime Minister's bill leaves it at the discretion of the minister. This is not good enough. I think the Australian people have an expectation that we are finally going to act on this important issue and ensure that, from this day forward, no child will grow up in a detention centre in this land. That is what these amendments seek to do. Children in detention is probably the most emotive issue associated with the detention of asylum seekers. Many people find it unconscionable to keep children behind the razor wire. At this point I will talk about one of the things the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs brought up. He said that members on this side of the House keep using emotive language such as ‘children behind the razor wire', and he suggested that we had perhaps been told that we had to use this language. Through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I point out to the minister that the reason we use emotive language on this issue is that on this side of the House we have emotions, which means that when we are talking about children growing up behind bars we get worked up about it and we use emotive language. My question is: why is that not the case on the other side of the House? Last night I quoted a GP from my electorate who summed up the social, physical and psychological impact of detention on children. The doctor wrote and explained simply that ‘the effects of long-term detention are disastrous in every way, especially upon children'. We need to debate here this morning whether we really want to be responsible for these effects on children growing up on Australian soil. The government's bill leaves to the discretion of the minister whether children are removed from detention. It provides for a non-compellable power for the minister to specify alternative detention arrangements. This is not good enough. It is not acceptable to me, to the GP who wrote to me or to the many other people who have contacted me, and indeed have contacted us around the country, about this issue. The specifics of Labor's plan would see children removed from behind the wire and placed in the care of foster families after a health check. Unlike the Prime Minister's bill, under Labor additional ministerial powers are not required for this to take effect. I have mentioned that I recently visited Baxter. I point out that it was May when I made the trip to Port Augusta, yet it was still 35 degrees there. I found my trip to that detention facility a truly awful experience. While I have no doubt that the staff there are working hard and trying to do their jobs, it an awful place and is certainly absolutely no place for children to be growing up. It would perhaps be helpful at this stage to point out that these amendments do not amount to policy on the run. The Labor Party since its national conference has consistently argued in support of removing children from detention. This was announced on Australia Day 2002. To this end, Labor moved amendments to the Migration Act in 2002 and 2003 to remove children from detention. It is strange, then, that some members opposite continue to run the line that Labor has been silent on the issue. Labor has not been silent on this issue and Labor will not be silent until we get children out of detention. We have had good policy, we have been very vocal about it and we will continue to be. Whilst I am glad to be finally having a chance to debate this issue in parliament, I am saddened that the potential to remove children from detention, as envisioned by the member for Kooyong in his initial bills, has not been realised by the government. It has fallen, once again, to the Labor Party to right the wrongs of the detention system in Australia. I urge all members of this House to support these amendments, to do something that we can all be really proud of and get children out of detention centres. (Time expired)",51
42,Mr MCGAURAN,NOES,"Gippsland-Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs) (11.37 am)-The first amendment the opposition moved at the consideration in detail stage of the bill proposed another bureaucracy. It dealt with the introduction of an inspector-general of detention, who would oversee the conditions of detention. And now we have a judicial assessor. As my friends and colleagues have already made perfectly clear with regard to the role of the inspectorgeneral of detention in overseeing detention, how many more overseeing individuals, bodies and organisations do you need? Have a is look at the long list. We have the Ombudsman, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, parliamentary committees, advocates who visit on a regular basis, nongovernment organisations, as the member for Wentworth mentioned, and legal advice. For every detainee who requests it, DIMIA is obliged under the Migration Act to provide legal advice. Mr Laurie Ferguson- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. We had to do this earlier, but I refer the minister to the amendments that we are considering. The member for Adelaide clearly identified them as amendments (3) to (5).",53
43,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,I call the minister.,54
44,Mr MCGAURAN,NOES,"I am laying the groundwork by reaffirming for the information of the chamber the unworkable and unnecessary bureaucracy that the opposition sought to establish with their earlier amendment. Now they are doing the same with their later amendments by creating a judicial assessor, which leaves more questions unanswered than",54
45,Unknown,NOES,Opposition members interjecting,54
46,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,Order! I am sure the public will judge the minister's reply.,54
47,Mr MCGAURAN,NOES,"The judicial assessor will have authority to decide which children remain in detention-yet another bureaucracy. What are the questions that immediately leap out of the recently drafted amendments? Is the assessor's role conducted in a personal, administrative or judicial capacity? Which is it? After all, it was the member for Lingiari who boldly made an assertion earlier in impressive Latin. I was very taken aback by the scholarly skills of the member for Lingiari; I could not hope to repeat it. It is a little unusual for a Northern Territory boy to be quoting Latin in the parliament.",54
48,Unknown,NOES,Opposition members interjecting,54
49,Mr MCGAURAN,NOES,"All right, I did learn Latin in school; I just do not recall it-I did not take it all that seriously, lated, what the member for Lingiari said was: ‘Who guards the guardians?' We have an answer to that: we guard the guardians as a parliament and as an executive, and there are numerous bodies involved in decisions about the release of people from detention, especially children. The member for Lingiari said the government should have answers to all of the issues raised in the amendments because they have been Labor Party policy for a long time. All right, if they have been slaving away on their policy they can answer these questions regarding the judicial assessor. What capacity is the judicial assessor acting in, because there are significant incentives to encourage further litigation? We are going to go back to the old days of lawyers making a meal out of the asylum seekers and establishing an industry which will delay final decisions as to their standing and status, invariably not to their advantage. Another question: under the Labor Party's amendment, what does ‘significant risk' mean and what factors are relevant for assessing this? What is the answer to that? It has been Labor Party policy for years; can we have some answers? Why aren't these answers available? Because they are making policy on the run. The Labor Party are trying to find differences with the government's exemplary legislation. How is the judicial assessor to assess whether a person ‘represents a danger to the safety and welfare of the Australian community'? What is the answer? What is the answer to the question of whether or not the person would be available if required? We have the Ombudsman's powers and we are increasing the resources. It is transparent; it is accountable. We have the interdepartmental committee headed by the Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. We are serious about a more flexible and softer detention policy. The Labor Party are only serious about poI can say. Translitical advantage.",54
50,Mr ALBANESE,NOES,"I second the amendments moved by the member for Adelaide and I am very proud to do so. The Labor Party have previously put forward two bills in this House, in 2002 and 2003, which would have seen all kids out of detention. Today we have been flexible. In this amendment we have actually used the words of the member for Kooyong's proposal because we believe that this is a critical issue. I give credit to the member Kooyong, the member for Pearce and others, who have put a human face on these issues and who acknowledge that we are dealing with real human beings. Today I remind the House of a very stark reality of the impact of the government's attitude towards detention and its immigration regime. Last week I spoke about an incident where two young children were forcibly removed from their classroom at Stanmore Public School. Ji Hee Han Hwang, known as Janey, was born in Australia in 1998 and was enrolled in kindergarten in 2004. In Yong Han Hwang, known as Ian, was born in 1993, was enrolled in kindergarten in 1998 and was in year 6 at Stanmore Public School. On 8 March 2005, DIMIA officials went to their classroom, banged on the window and dragged them out of that classroom to lock them up in Villawood detention centre. The impact on those kids and on every kid in that classroom is a disgrace and should not be allowed to happen in Australia. That is the reality of the way that DIMIA is run in this country in 2005. It occurred without the presence of a legal guardian and without prior notice to the department of education. These Gestapo tactics might be defended by some opposite, but they are not the Australian way. It is completely unacceptable that two young children, one of whom was born in Australia, could be forcibly removed from their classroom. It is wrong that these children were removed in this manner and it is wrong that these children remain behind barbed wire. The immigration department is clearly out of control. It has lost all sense of decency. It is fundamental that we treat children with kindness. All kids should be out of detention, out from behind barbed wire. Australia is the only country in the world where asylum seekers-adults and children-are detained for the duration of their processing. Curfor rently 53 children are in detention centres, and on average they have been detained for over 12 months. Only half of these children have access to external schooling. In late May 2005, three-year-old Naomi Leong was released after spending her entire life in Villawood detention centre. Her only exposure to playing with, and learning from, other children was when she was allowed to attend a child learning centre for three hours. While inside Villawood, Naomi would bang her head against the wall. Naomi was so isolated and alone and so confined that her only method of coping was to copy her mother's emotional state. The psychiatrist who assessed Naomi and her mother has acknowledged that the family have been traumatised by their time in detention and that they are likely to be haunted by their experiences for the rest of their lives. It is blatantly clear that the detention of children is detrimental to their mental health, let alone that of their parents. A study by the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists in May 2003 of children in remote detention centres found a 10-fold increase in the number of psychological disorders in children over a two-year period. We ask those opposite to vote for this amendment because it is about family values. This is a test of how fair dinkum they are about family values. Labor has picked up the member for Kooyong's wording in order to maximise the possibility of that occurring. These kinds of interactions are very real. That two children at Stanmore Public School were taken from their classroom and locked up is an indication of how out of control it is. This is unacceptable in Australia in 2005. I commend the amendments to the House. (Time expired)",54
51,Mr BARRESI,NOES,"If you listened to the ALP on the Migration Amendment (Detention Arrangements) Bill 2005, you would think that they had a mortgage on compassion. Let me tell members of the ALP that compassion does not start and end on that side of the House. There are people on this side of the House who have been equally concerned about children being held in detention for a long time. In fact, one of the motivating factors for the introduction of these amendments by the Prime Minister was even his concern about children in detention. So do not put yourselves on some moral pedestal about your concerns. If you had those concerns, why didn't you act on them in government? The member for Lingiari stands up and says, ‘When in government the ALP will do such and such.' When in government you had that chance. You had that chance to take children out of detention. What did you do? In 1994, 318 children were in detention centres. How many were born in detention? Member for Reid, 24 were born in detention after the arrival of their parents to Australia, bringing the total to 342. How many children do we have in detention today? We have 53. We have seen over a period of time-not just since this debate has started-the government introducing measures to move children and their families into residential housing situations. And full credit to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs for doing that. We have now gone one step further by saying that the minister now has a non-compellable authority to move these kids into housing facilities even faster. Labor's amendment puts restrictions on the process by saying, ‘It's got to go to a judicial assessor; it's got to be done within 30 days.' What about just allowing the immigration minister to make the decision? After all, she has the greatest accountability. She has more accountability than any other minister on these issues. She is the most scrutinised minister in this government. She is scrutinised by HREOC. She is scrutinised by the United Nations Human Rights Commission. She is scrutinised by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration. She is scrutinised by every member of parliament in this place. She is also scrutinised by the media. She will make the decision based on the needs of that family at the time. No-one has greater power than the minister in this area and, knowing her and other ministers, I believe that power will be executed with absolute consideration for the needs of the families and the children who need to be moved out of detention centres. The minister needs greater flexibility. She needs to consider all the issues in regard to a family. Not every family that she will consider will have the same situations. They will have their own unique considerations. Of course, often with these applications, there are one or two members of a family who perhaps need greater scrutiny. So an entire family, including the children, will need to be considered more so than, perhaps, another family. We need to take into consideration the type of housing we are going to move a family into and the location. Will an NGO take them on, or will they go into a state or a federal funded facility? We need to take into consideration the age of the children, their medical conditions and the kinds of facilities and services they require. The Labor amendment simply hobbles the minister; it does not give her the flexibility that she needs. The member for Grayndler went on with his usual rhetoric and fear campaigns, describing Gestapo-like tactics of officials takinterests ing kids out of school. What the member for Grayndler has deceitfully done is confuse visa compliance issues with those of illegal immigrants. Let us not confuse that! They are two separate issues. Yet, he has deliberately done that to give the impression to every person who has kids in school that these Gestapo immigration officials are knocking on windows and dragging kids out their classrooms. The parents are of non-compliance cases. If they have already been in this country for a number of years and they have gone through a number of bridging visas and extensions along the way, then perhaps the time has come when they need to be held accountable to the department and to the Australian people. Mr Tanner interjecting",56
52,Mr BARRESI,NOES,"Of course we do not condone those kinds of tactics, but do not confuse the role of the immigration department and what they do with illegal immigrants versus non-compliance-(Time expired)",57
53,Ms GRIERSON,NOES,"I proudly rise to support Labor's amendment that will see children being taken out of detention centres. I just heard the previous speaker, the member for Deakin, describe what is in any school a critical incident: the removal of children by strangers. It is something that we are trained in schools to handle, yet this government practises it every day. In May 2004 a Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report was tabled in this parliament dealing with repeated breaches of human rights suffered by children in Australian detention centres. That two-year inquiry found that the mandatory detention system breached the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Our detention system, it said, had ‘failed to make the best of the child a primary consideration in detaining them and it failed to treat them with humanity and respect'-the right of all innocents made vulnerable by their youth. It condemned the government's failure to implement repeated recommendations by mental health professionals to remove children with their parents from detention, describing it as ‘cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment'-unfortunately, something Australians have been encouraged to look away from with callous disregard. This damning HREOC report has been callously disregarded by the Howard government until now. Fortunately, a handful of Liberals with compassion and courage have stood up to the determined bullying of the Prime Minister and have forced this shameful abuse of human rights back into this parliament and into the public eye. The bill that results is a compromise, but it is the best that could be achieved within government ranks. It will fall short, unfortunately, in dealing with the crisis that exists in our migration and detention systems. Regrettably, an incompetent minister in a complacent and arrogant government, supported by complicit senior bureaucrats in DIMIA, will remain. These amendments will not, however, remove the responsibility or the culpability of this government, but they will remove children from behind razor wire. Labor has been pressing for these amendments and for this action since 2002. But today my Labor colleagues and I are pleased to finally have the opportunity to rid our immigration system of some of the most despicable aspects of government policy that have blemished the human landscape in this great nation. I give full support to the effect of the bill and the particular Liberals involved in bringing this about. More than 2,000 children have suffered in immigration detention over the past few years. We hear today that there are 53 children-I thought it was 68-who are still at risk of abuse and are having their rights demeaned right now. Hopefully, though, this legislation will mean DIMIA's calculated mistakes will never happen again. It has been a long battle and I acknowledge the contribution made by many of my Labor colleagues, by refugee advocates, civil libertarians and decent Australian citizens. I make particular mention of the New South Wales Teachers Federation, who have quietly assisted children's education and their removal from detention centres for that education. But too many have been absent from this debate. It has taken extraordinary pressure, in one case from the Malaysian media, before the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs agreed to grant Naomi Leong a bridging visa. Naomi, as we have heard, was born in detention and she is therefore considered stateless-a pretty damning and sad label for a young child. Until recently, Naomi had never left the confines of a detention centre. Her plight became public last month after a psychiatrist, Dr Michael Dudley, revealed that Naomi had been banging her head against a wall and was mute and unresponsive. Having spent most of my lifetime contributing to the development of children, I find this horrifying. Mr MCGauran-It's unsubstantiated.",57
54,Ms GRIERSON,NOES,"If this is true, it is horrifying. The first three years of a child's life are formative and will shape forever their attitudes and relationships. Sadly, Naomi's experiences, if substantiated, will have a profound and negative effect on her development. Michael Andrew Tran was born prematurely on 23 May 2005 under guard at Perth's King Edward Memorial Hospital. Michael's parents were among 53 asylum seekers who came within sight of Australian shores in July 2003 and have lived in detention on Christmas Island since. Michael's parents endured seven days of heartache while they waited to see if a compassionate DIMIA would allow them to keep their oneweek-old baby, Michael. Thanks to intervention and media attention, this family was not forced to return to Christmas Island, but they continue to live under guard in a Perth suburb with the father's 74-year-old mother, who was at the centre of controversy earlier this year when she was kept in the Perth airport detention centre while seriously ill. What must they think of Australians? When mothers are forced to abandon their children, when kids are locked up in detention from birth, when mentally ill Australians are incarcerated or deported because they are unable to explain or defend themselves, it is clear that Minister Vanstone and her department of immigration are in unacceptable crisis. Naturally, the department resists a judicial assessor. It resists any scrutiny of its performance and any onus of proof being placed on it. We know that some 200 cases of potential wrongful detention have been referred to the Palmer inquiry. Decent Australians demand a more compassionate approach and this amendment will deliver that. When people of the world arrive at our doorstep seeking respite from trauma and injustice, seeking shelter and safe haven, we have choices and we certainly-(Time expired)",58
55,Mr TURNBULL,NOES,"There are several ways in which the parliament can deal with this problem of children in detention. Let me say that I and, I believe, all of my colleagues share the community's concern about children being in detention centres. It is highly undesirable. Extended detention is clearly calculated to inflict psychological damage on children. It is a most unsatisfactory state of affairs. The recognition of that unsatisfactory state of affairs can be found in the legislation proposed by the government. What does it say? Children should not be detained in detention centres other than as a last resort-I emphasise: a last resort. So there are two approaches that we can take. The approach the government are taking is for parliament to state a very clear principle-children should not be in detention. That is what we believe; that is what we want to achieve. Having stated that principle, we then give the minister the ability to implement that principle by arranging for children and their families to live in the community under regimes of supervision or reporting that in some cases may be very light indeed. Then the third part of that approach is to make the exercise of that discretion accountable so that parliament knows and the community knows whether the minister is exercising her discretion in a manner that is consistent with the principle laid out by the parliament, a principle which we all share. The opposition's approach is a different one. It seeks, just as it did in the previous of amendments that we discussed, to impose another legalistic layer-in this case, a judicial assessor-to impose yet another level of legal review in a system that is crippled and rendered inefficient, unjust and lacking in humanity by excessive legalisms, excessive legal processes. In some respects, as I said earlier today, the tortuous path of litigation associated with immigration matters is of Dickensian proportions. The government is endeavouring to cut that back with the migration reform bill, but more will need to be done. I would have hoped that the opposition would have recognised the problems associated with excessive litigation, excessive legalism, and would have recognised that an abundance of lawyers is no answer to a shortage of compassion. The answer to a shortage of compassion is more compassion, and that is what the government's bill seeks to enable the minister to effect. In short, the opposition is simply providing here just another excuse for something to say. The judicial assessor will make no substantive improvement to the situation. The law, as proposed, gives states a very clear principle. It gives the minister great discretion-that discretion of the minister's is made accountable-and if she fails to exercise that discretion in a manner consistent with the principle then she certainly will be brought to account. A judicial assessor is simply yet another legal framework, another opportunity for the legal profession, of which I have to confess I am a member or a former member, but it is not a move that is calculated to make our system more efficient, it will make it less efficient, and it will certainly not make it more compassionate. There is no substitute for efficient and compassionate administration. (Time expired)",58
56,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"In accordance with the wish of set the House, the question that amendments (3) to (5) be agreed to is deferred until after the House has completed its consideration of all the proposed amendments.",59
57,Mr DANBY,NOES,"I move opposition amendment (1): (1) Schedule 1, after item 9, page 5 (after line 19) insert: “9A After section 194 Insert ‘194A Independent medical access etc The Secretary must ensure that independent medical professionals and media representatives have access to a person detained under section 189.'”. It is a scandal that we should have to move such an amendment in this House. We have to do so because the honourable member for Kooyong and his colleagues did not succeed in getting the Prime Minister to agree to such an obvious safeguard for those held in detention. We have to do so because of the decisions made by this deeply ideological government to contract the administration of detention centres to private contractors, whose motivation as a business is naturally profit rather than to ensure that the physical and mental health of detainees is safeguarded. It is striking that the hapless Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Vanstone, is being made to carry the can for this government's embarrassment over the treatment of people in detention. It is striking that the honourable member for Berowra, who as Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs from 1996 to 2001 set up the regime which Senator Vanstone now administers, seems to have escaped any criticism. But it was the honourable member for Berowra who decided to privatise the department's detention centres. It was the honourable member for Berowra who gave the department its riding orders, who set the tone for the ruthless and callous way in which-as we have heard today, children have been dragged out of schools, as the Palmer report now tells us-the department has treated detainees. It was the honourable member for Berowra and, behind him, the Prime Minister who are ultimately responsible, despite all of their wriggling and evasion, for the Cornelia Rau and Vivien Solon scandals, even though it will be Senator Vanstone who will have to accept the blame. We now have a situation where the parliament must mandate the secretary of the department of immigration to allow detainees access to independent medical professionals. It is clear that the physical and tal health of detainees has been neglected. It is also clear that this is the only way in which the government can be forced to accept its responsibilities. Detainees must have the right of access to independent medical professionals. This is not a question of merit or otherwise of a policy of mandatory detention. When a government detains a person, for whatever reasons, whether that detention is just or unjust, the government becomes responsible for that person's health and well-being. Even murderers and rapists in our prisons have a right to adequate health care and, by and large, they get it. Isn't it ironic that even Saddam Hussein in his prison cell is currently getting superior medical care than is made available to detainees under the care of the Australian minister for immigration? It is apparently only asylum seekers in detention, who in many cases are eventually found to be genuine refugees, who are denied this right. This amendment also mentions media access. The current policy of treating detention centres as though they are some kind of prison camp to which people are sentenced without right of communication, as in Stalin's day, never to be heard from again, must end. People in detention centres are not criminals. They have the right of free speech and free association. As events have shown, independent media scrutiny, and access to media by detainees, is an independent safeguard against the various abuses we are now discovering. The government cannot say they were not warned about the consequences of handing over the administration of these centres to outside contractors. As the honourable member for Reid said in his speech on this migration bill last night, Labor has been advocating an end to this practice since 2002. It was our policy adopted at our last national conference. It was our policy long before the men- honourable member for Kooyong and his colleagues took their stand. I commend the honourable member for Kooyong and his colleagues for bringing this issue to a head inside the government and for wringing at least some concessions from the Prime Minister, but fairness and accuracy require an acknowledgment that Labor was advocating these positions well in advance of the honourable member for Kooyong. We were retro before Petro, as I was trying to say when the honourable member for Adelaide and I were gagged when we tried to bring this into the House a couple of weeks ago. Our friends in the media have given Labor, and the honourable member for Reid in particular, a hard time on this issue over the past few days. I suppose it is too much to expect fairness in the treatment of this issue, but the fact is we have taken a consistent position, and the honourable member for Reid has consistently stated that position. We support an organised border protection policy. We are opposed to illegal immigration. We agree to detention only in temporary, specified, limited circumstances. But we also favour justice and due process for all asylum seekers and humane treatment of all detainees, regardless of their status. That does not seem to ask a lot-I would not have thought the Australian people would have thought it was asking a lot-but it was evidently more than the Prime Minister was willing to concede to the honourable member for Kooyong. It is now up to this House to do the right thing.",59
58,Mr MCGAURAN,NOES,"Gippsland-Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs) (12.08 pm)-The Labor Party is going right over the top. We expected, naturally, a spirited debate on the legislation and now the amendments, but when the honourable member for Melbourne Ports talks about Stalin and alleges that Saddam Hussein is treated better than detainees he has gone too far. The member for Grayndler spoke of the Gestapo tactics of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. This is outrageous and these members should be held accountable. But I predicted this. Earlier today I spoke of the Leader of the Opposition's tone when I was summing up in the second reading debate. I spoke of his hyperbole, his exaggeration, his abuse of the department and his generalised slander and, sure enough, members of the opposition have picked up on the tone that he has set, to their eternal disgrace. What upsets me more than anything else is that they come in for five minutes and then they are gone. Even the member for Adelaide, who moved the previous amendment and set off 30 minutes of debate, departed almost immediately after her contribution. She had her hand on her heart, gave a speech of moral righteousness that was wholly inaccurate and left the chamber. I have had the member for Mitchell, the member for Deakin, the member for Wentworth, the member for Macquarie here, except for brief periods, for the entire time of this debate, whereas you get the member for Northern Territory who comes in, makes an aggressive speech and is gone within five minutes, immediately he has made his contribution. This is true of even the mover of the amendment. It is the same with all of them: they come in and grandstand, they repeat the inaccurate and defamatory assertions of the extremist advocates, they do not give any evidence, they do not substantiate their case and then they are gone. It is all about them. It is how they feel about their own self-importance and their own moral proselytising. The member for Grayndler, the great union man, accuses the whole department of Gestapo tactics. I think those members of the union in the department should be taking this up with the self-appointed champion. The member for Melbourne Ports is absurd. He talks about children being dragged out of schools. You name them and I will go through each and every one of those alleged examples. You are just repeating the rhetoric of the critics; you are jumping on the bandwagon. The Labor Party themselves have no approach to this. The member for Grayndler spoke about Naomi Leong. These are unsubstantiated allegations or accusations of the child's self-harm. Mr Danby interjecting",61

60,Mr MCGAURAN,NOES,"But they do not care on the other side; they just want to throw mud and hope some of it sticks. Their major target is not just the government but also the honest, dedicated and hard working officials of DIMIA, who do an extremely difficult job. To work in immigration anywhere in the world is one of the most difficult and challenging issues. Mr Danby interjecting",62

62,Mr MCGAURAN,NOES,"You are dealing with people's lives and you have to do it with respect, dignity and sensitivity. Overwhelmingly the department does this. Plucking out errors of judgment, mistakes which occurnobody denies that; that is why we have the Palmer inquiry-is doing an injustice to the whole department and the policy that guides them. For heaven's sake, of course there is medical access at the request of the detainee, just as there is legal access at the request of the detainee, just as there is media access at the request of the detainee. These are trumped up charges. Mr Danby interjecting",62
63,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,The member for Melbourne Ports is warned.,62
64,Mr MCGAURAN,NOES,"Give us specific examples. Tell us about a journalist who has requested to see a detainee or vice versa who has not been given access. Go on-you are moving an amendment in the parliamentand give examples of deprivation of access to media. Give examples of deprivation of access to medical or allied health assistance. The errors have occurred in mental health. Agreed, the Cornelia Rau and Vivian Alvarez tragedies relate to mental health, but I can tell you that, across the community and across all the state departments of community services and the like, there are shocking errors of judgment about mental health as the whole community grapples with this issue. We are looking to improve our services in that regard and we will be guided by the Palmer inquiry. But the Labor Party are grandstanding. This is a very shallow debate, unconvincingly presented by the Labor Party, and their allegations of DIMIA behaviour do them no credit. (Time expired)",62
65,Mr TANNER,NOES,"Melbourne) (12.13 pm)Now that the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs has finished frothing at the mouth, I am happy to reinsert some basic rationality into the debate. I want to address my comments primarily to the question of mental health and to the opposition's amendment that will guarantee proper access to independent medical advice and assistance to detainees. The Cornelia Rau case has exposed the enormous deficiencies in the provision of health services in detention centres in Australia in ways that shame our entire society. It reflects a mentality that is widespread in our community, sadly, that is complacent, neglectful and, ultimately in many cases, uncaring about the question of mental illness generally. It illustrates some of the rather retrograde attitudes that can be found in many parts of the Australian community with respect to problems of mental health. These issues are even more serious when they apply to somebody who is being detained by the state, and they are particularly serious when they concern somebody who is being detained when they have not committed a crime, when they have not been sentenced to any specific period of detention and when the mere detention itself is a significant contributing factor to-indeed, an adjacent cause of-the mental illness from which they are suffering. No matter how cynical any of us may be, we have to accept that there are very serious mental illness problems in Australian detention centres and we have to accept that indefinite detention, the uncertainty about an individual's future that goes with that and the harsh administration of this system by both the department and its contractors are major contributing factors. We can argue about individual cases, we can go into detail about specific individuals, but we have to accept that there is a climate, a set of circumstances and a set of pressures that are all highly adverse to the mental health of individuals and therefore impose an enormous onus on the Commonwealth to ensure, if it insists on continuing with this regime, that appropriate independent assistance is available to people. In the case of Cornelia Rau, we have seen a spectacular example of how that did not occur. It was recently leaked to one of the newspapers that Mick Palmer, who is investigating the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and its administration of these requirements, was concerned about mindless zealotry on the part of officials of the department. All of the stories that have emerged suggest that there is a ture that is highly punitive, highly cynical and almost sinister in the way that Australia's asylum seeker policy is administered. The often extreme insensitivity and arbitrary behaviour to which many detainees are subject is calculated to have a significant effect on the mental health of anybody, but particularly somebody who has committed no crime, who is completely uncertain about their future and who faces the possibility of years in what is effectively a prison situation. Labor's amendment is designed to guarantee access to independent medical professionals for detainees with respect to both physical and mental illnesses. This access will ensure a much better monitoring and intervention process for health and psychiatric problems. It will ensure that appropriate treatment is able to be provided when required and that we do not see a repetition of what occurred with Cornelia Rau. Detention centres are indeed very similar to prisons. Cynicism and indifference to the plight of the individuals who are incarcerated are rarely below the surface. Of course, this is absolutely critical with issues of mental health. We need a revolution in attitudes to mental health generally in our community. It is a huge problem, it is a massively important issue and it should not be considered just in isolated situations such as this. I recommend to honourable members a recent book by Professor Richard Layard entitled Happiness, which is an extremely good book. I had the privilege of meeting Professor Layard in London recently. One of the conclusions he draws is that, when you actually look at the totality of human happiness as a key goal, if not the key goal, of any policy or government approach to governing society, in that framework the issue of mental health is almost paramount. The totality of human misery and suffering that comes from mental illness throughout our society is cul- absolutely enormous. We should see this amendment not only as part of fixing a particular problem in detention centres but as a signal of a need in the community generally. (Time expired)",62
66,Mr BARRESI,NOES,"I share the concern of many members in this House-not only those on the other side but also on this side-as to the medical, psychological and emotional conditions of those who undergo long-term detention. That is one of the reasons why the Migration Amendment (Detention Arrangements) Bill 2005 has been introduced as a way of curbing the great length of time for which a person can be detained and also providing greater flexibility for the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs to respond. Mr Deputy Speaker, if you listened to the other side you would be hard-pressed to believe that doctors were allowed into detention centres at all. The fact is that detainees currently have access, and are increasingly having access, to preferred medical service providers. They may request a medical opinion from external health care providers at any time. They have that ability; they have that right to do so right at this moment. I am not sure why the ALP feel that they need to put all these restrictions in the act rather than providing the flexibility that is required to manage individuals on a case-bycase basis. The medical relationship between the detainee and the independent medical practitioner needs to be upheld. It is a right out in the general community and is also a right in detention centres. If someone seeks a private, independent medical opinion, they have the ability to do that right now. The member for Melbourne Ports referred to psychiatric and mental health services and the need to address those issues. I could not agree more. It is a blight on our society. There is a growing need generally, not just in detention centres, for governments of all persuasions-state, territory and federal governments-to spend money in this area. We have referred the whole issue of medical treatment to the Palmer inquiry. I know that in the next few weeks or so, when Mick Palmer brings down his report, he will be making recommendations specifically at the request of the minister and the Prime Minister that deal with examining and making findings on measures taken to deal with medical conditions and other care needs during the period. From the unfortunate episode I have mentioned, we will learn things about the role of the federal department and also about the role of the state and territory departments in that particular case. There are moves afoot in that area. I look forward to the Palmer inquiry's recommendations in that area. The other part of this amendment deals with access by the media. One of the things that I noted when I went to Baxter earlier this year was the concern expressed by some of the detainees about their identity and their particular circumstances being broadcast back home. I recall specifically one gentleman saying to me that one of the reasons why he cannot go back-I think it was to Iran-was that his face was on a web site that indicated that he had converted to Christianity and that he was playing a role in conversions within the detention centre. It is that kind of breach of privacy which is at the heart of making sure that the media's access to detention centres does have strict guidelines. The media are not prevented. As the minister rightly pointed out, we have not come across any media outlet or organisation that has made a request to have access to a detainee and has had it rejected. Far from that, we have seen many articles in newspapers by noted journalists who have had detailed interviews with detainees about their conditions. Privacy is an important issue. It does need to be maintained. We do not want to jeopardise the safety of that individual or their family overseas, a fear some of them have expressed to me on a personal basis. That is one of the reasons this amendment needs to be rejected.",63
67,Ms HALL,NOES,"Shortland) (12.23 pm)Firstly, I refer to a statement made by the previous speaker, the member for Deakin. I know he is a very caring and compassionate man. He noted that if a person wanted or needed an independent medical assessment they could request it. I understand that he may not be as familiar with mental illness as a lot of people are, but one of the issues surare rounding mental illness is the lack of insight into the fact that you may even need that independent medical assessment. You only need to look at some of the statements made by Cornelia Rau to understand the impact that mental illness has on a person's ability to request that type of assessment when they need it. There is no element of Australian society that causes me to feel more ashamed than the treatment of our detainees, or should I say people, human beings who have the same needs as every other person in our community-treatment that led to Australian citizen Cornelia Rau being held in detention for an inordinate period of time. She was mentally ill. This mental illness was not identified. She was subject to degradation and humiliation when all she needed was appropriate medical treatment. I mentioned that inability to have that insight into the fact that you need that treatment. If there were a regular independent medical assessment by health professionals of people who were being held in detention this would not have occurred. This amendment to the Migration Amendment (Detention Arrangements) Bill 2005 allows that to happen. I cannot help question why the government will not accept this amendment. I probably would argue that the government is frightened to give independent medical professionals access to detention centres because it is frightened of what those professionals will find. There is no argument about the psychological impact of indefinite detention. That is irrefutable. Amnesty International continues to receive allegations of physical and mental mistreatment of detainees held in Australian immigration detention centres. That is irrefutable. There are the hunger strikes, the suicide attempts, the riots and the protests. They are all symptoms of the fact that people being held in detention centres are disempowered. They all evidence of the effect this is having on human beings who are being denied effective remedy to the conditions. Dr Louise Newman, director of the New South Wales Institute of Psychiatry, said on the ABC recently that detention was a very abnormal environment for child rearing and for people to be held in and that the institute had clinical and developmental evidence that shows detention is causing enormous emotional and psychological trauma and stress for the children. This would be picked up if we had independent medical assessments. There is the example of a female held in detention-and this example illustrates the powerlessness of detainees-and the guard would say to her: ‘Australians do not want you. Australians hate you; they want you to go home.' This engenders a feeling of selfworthlessness and it creates an environment where people will develop significant mental illness. I believe the Howard government stands condemned for not allowing independent medical professionals to gain access to detention centresMr MCGauran-They do.",65
68,Ms HALL,NOES,not on request but on a regular basis. Denying this covers up the plight of detainees like the young girl I mentioned and the plight of people like Cornelia Rau. If we had regular access by independent medical professionals this would prevent problems from developing. (Time expired),65
69,Mr TURNBULL,NOES,"Yet again we have an example of the opposition having formed the view that the officials and professionals responsible for administering the immigration system are not doing their job well. Certainly there have been some unsatisfactory events, incidents and practices. There is no question of that. Everyone shares the concerns about the case of Cornelia Rau, about which several members have spoken eloquently and powerfully today. But just because you feel that bureaucracy A is not doing a good job does not mean that the answer is to create bureaucracy B to then look over the shoulder of bureaucracy A. If you feel that the department or officials, professional medical staff or whatpsychiatrist ever are not performing their task adequately then the objective is to ensure that they do. Legislation is not a ready solution for good administration. The amendment that is proposed by the opposition is quite interestingly worded. It says that the House is of the view that medical personnel and media representatives should be given independent access to people in detention centres. I would have thought that if the objective of the honourable members opposite were to be achieved, if their concern were to be dealt with, it would say that people in detention centres should be given independent access to, for example, medical personnel. Are they suggesting that anyone with a medical qualification should be able to enter any detention centre and perform physical or mental examinations of any person they see fit? If the opposition's concern is that people in detention centres should have access to independent medical opinion, that objective is not achieved by the language of the amendment that is proposed. The fact remains that detainees may nominate a preferred medical services provider and may request a medical opinion from an external health care provider. If they request a specialist opinion, a referral should be provided by the detainee's treating doctor. So the ability to get an outside medical opinion, a second opinion, is there. The case of Cornelia Rau, which of course will be the subject of the Palmer inquiry, has been touched upon. I simply observe that in the case of Cornelia Rau there was an independent assessment. The problem was that the diagnosis was incorrect. Again, you cannot legislate to make every medical diagnosis correct, just as you cannot fix a perceived problem in administration by creating a second phalanx of administrators and overseers. its You cannot legislate to ensure that every who interviews a person is going to get to the right answer, any more than you can legislate to make lawyers give the right answer. The most charitable view one can take of this clause is that it is utterly superfluous. The access to independent medical advice is there. The medical staff involved in the detention centres are professionals. They do not always get it right. Even honourable members have been known to make errors from time to time. So none of us is perfect. But the principle of access to independent medical opinion is certainly agreed to and is certainly part of the current process. But the language of this amendment is so revealing. It seeks to give medical personnel and media representatives independent access to people in detention centres, so the people in detention centres are not people, they are objectsobjects that the opposition wants to become the object of inspection and interest by third parties. We believe on our side that the motivation or the instigation of that independent advice should be with the detainee. (Time expired)",65
70,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"In accordance with the wish of the House, the question that amendment (1) be agreed to is deferred until after the House has completed its consideration of all the proposed amendments.",66
71,Ms VAMVAKINOU,NOES,"I move opposition amendment (2) as circulated: (2) Schedule 1, item 10, page 6 (after line 7) insert “Considerations to be taken into account in issue of visas (4A) In exercising the power conferred by subsection (2), the Minister must have regard to whether a person has a need for temporary protection or for permanent protection. (4B) If the Minister considers that a person has a need for temporary protection, the Minister may grant the person a visa for a period not exceeding two years. At the end of the Secretary has presented evidence to the Minister that satisfies the Minister that the decision to grant a visa be reversed, the Minister must grant a further visa permitting the person to remain in Australia indefinitely. (4C) If the Minister considers that a person has a need for permanent protection needs the Minister must grant the person a visa permitting the person to main in Australia indefinitely. (4D) If the Minister considers that a person does not have a need for permanent protection, but considers son has made, and can continue to make, a long term contribution to economic, social or community life, the Minister may grant a visa permitting the person to remain in Australia indefinitely.” As of February this year there were 6,550 temporary protection visa and temporary humanitarian visa holders in Australia. The majority, some 3,980, are from Iraq, followed by 1,853 from Afghanistan. And there are about 800 TPV cases still waiting for a primary decision to be made. The proposed changes in the Migration Amendment (Detention Arrangements) Bill 2005 do nothing more than speed up the process by which at least these primary decisions are to be made. To date this process has been disgraceful and the proposals in government's bill do absolutely nothing to guarantee any certainty for TPV holders. In particular, the government changes fail to address the numerous people on rolled-over TPVs for two to three years. Those people who have been determined to be refugees should be granted permanent protection rather than having to go through the traumatic and pointless process of reestablishing their status. The government's bill does not guarantee permanent protection and therefore does not go in any way to end the uncertainty that TPV holders are curthat period, unless rently suffering. The original proposal by the member for should Kooyong called for the abolition of the TPV system and for permanent residence to be given to all TPV holders. The member for Kooyong understands the plight of TPV holders who are forced to live in limbo, not knowing what their future holds. It is a shame that the Prime Minister and his minisre- ter have not also understood the folly of this inhumane policy and that the government is only prepared to tinker at the edges rather than address the core of the problems surthat the per- rounding TPVs. We in the Labor Party, however, understand that the handling of TPVs needs significant attention and that is why we are proposing measures that will restore some certainty and dignity to TPV holders. Labor's position is born from our commitment to ensuring that we deal with this matter in a humane and decent way. It comes from a commitment to humanity and to social justice that is at the very core of Labor beliefs. Labor therefore proposes that decisions on protection visas be given within two years, with the onus on the government to establish why a visa should not be granted. Labor's amendments further recognise that even if a person is unsuccessful in an application for refugee status they will have an opportunity to put their case to be accepted as a person who would otherwise be accepted for a migration program. My electorate of Calwell is a welcoming community; we have built on waves of immigration and we have provided a home to many new refugee communities. We are well aware in our community that amongst us there are a great number of refugees living in circumstances of tremendous uncertainty because they are TPV holders. I have seen the frustration and despair that ongoing TPV status has on the lives of these people, people like Mr Jassim Albtat and his boys, Muhammad, who is 13 years old, and Haidir, who is 14 years old, who live in Broadmeadows. After being released from Woomera in 2001 they are still waiting for a detervisa. mination of their application for permanent residency. Mr Albtat has said that he simply wants to stay in Australia. Because of the persecution he endured under Saddam Hussein's regime he believes that now they cannot go back because the situation is still so unsafe and tenuous in Iraq. Only Labor's amendments will bring certainty to the lives of TPV holders like Mr Albtat and his family. Many onerous restrictions are placed on TPV holders, such as being prevented from family reunion migration programs, having no access to DIMIA case management services, no access to accommodation support or household formation support services and no access to government funded English language tuition. But above all there is no certainty for these people as to when their circumstances will change, and it is this that creates hardship and impacts adversely on their emotional and mental well-being. It is estimated that there are 113 TPV holders in my electorate, with Victoria's third largest TPV population living mainly in Broadmeadows, Dallas, Jacana, Coolaroo and Meadow Heights. Local welfare agencies, including the Al-amel TPV Holders Association, have been helping TPV holders. The association's name, Al-amel, means ‘hope'. Labor's amendments provide the only hope for these TPV holders, and that is why this government should adopt them as a matter of urgency.",67
72,Mr MCGAURAN,NOES,"Gippsland-Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs) (12.38 pm)-I can confidently predict that amendment (2) will not survive if logic comes into play by the time this is debated in the Senate. It is defective-and this is what happens when you bowl up backbenchers to move amendments that they know nothing about. Amendment (2) refers to temporary protection visa holders in detention-but you are not held in detention if you have got a I stand to be corrected: maybe there are one or two TPV holders in detention at the moment through some circuitous route. But this amendment that the Labor Party has put forward-which the member for Calwell does not understand, nor do the draftersseeks to amend section 195A of the Migration Act, which deals with detention. So the member for Calwell, who is going out of the chamber-she will leave the parliament like everybody else on the opposition side; they stay for their five minutes and then they are gone, which is a measure of their seriousness and commitment to this debate-needs to explain to the House why amendment (2) deals with TPV holders in detention when her speech-and presumably those of everybody in the opposition that follows herdeals with TPV holders more generally out in the community. So that is the first ground on which it is defective. The second ground on which it is defective is its policy basis. The Labor Party would have it that all TPVs are converted automatically after two years. That is a recipe for disaster because it does not take into account the character issues that you need to check, which will take at times longer than two years, nor does it take into account the changed circumstances in the country of origin. So is the Labor Party saying that if democracy takes even stronger hold in Iraq, people cannot be returned to Iraq when there are no longer grounds for political asylum? In other words, the Labor Party wants TPVs converted automatically after two years. The situation at present is that the large number of people who come into the TPV stream quite regularly do need the existing issues of character and country of origin circumstances properly assessed. So I will be very interested to know whether or not the Labor Party truly believes TPV holders should automatically get permanent residency after two years. Instead, I would submit to the House that the Labor Party's amendment is unnecessary as the minister's power to grant a visa under the new section 195A is where the minister believes it is in the public interest to do defining the public interest, protection needs and contribution to the Australian community are factors that are taken into account. The large number of current TPV holders have been processed and assessed over the last couple of years to the point where, I understand, the overwhelming majority of TPV holders have been assessed and that a very significant number of them have received permanent residency. The Prime Minister has set October as a deadline for all TPV holders to be interviewed and assessed. I hasten to add that process is well under way, so the Labor Party is coming to this issue-like with all others-especially late. It would have been interesting to hear the member for Calwell raise these issues in the House previously as to her assessment, because thousands of TPV holders have been assessed and I would have thought that a majority of them had been given permanent residencyand we have now set October as the target for the remainder. So amendment (2) is defective, not just in a policy sense but in an operative sense as well.",68
73,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,NOES,"In my contribution to the second reading debate, I said that the Migration Amendment (Detention Arrangements) Bill 2005 made incremental changes and we supported them on that basis, but that if you are really serious about addressing the inequities that have occurred in this area you need to do two things: clean up the backlog and set the system up for the future so that the sorts of terrible things we have seen occur can never occur again. As for cleaning up the backlog, when we look at the cases of the 12,000 people who came to our shores between March 1996 and the end of 2001 we see that we have to make changes to detention arrangements, changes to processing and changes to the administrative and judicial review procedures for asylum seekers' cases. We have so. In also got to make changes to the temporary protection visa system. So if you want to set the system up for the future, then you need to seriously address-as Labor has been arguing since the course of the last parliamenthaving an inspector-general of detention, 90 per cent of processing done in 90 days and for those cases not done in 90 days a 30-day automatic review, access to independent medical advice, children out of detention and better processing and review mechanisms. So far as temporary protection visas are concerned-the subject of this particular amendment-there are two things we have to address. There is nothing in the government's proposals which will effectively address the backlog after all these years of having 8,000 or 9,000 TPV holders who came to this shore and were recognised as refugees by John Howard, on his watch, who have languished with uncertainty, delay and unfairness, other than the government saying, ‘We are going to try to get these things done by October, by processing on the papers,' when that could have been done years before. The second fundamental thing is to set the system up for the future. If you have a TPV system, you need one which operates consistently and fairly, which does not leave people in limbo forever and which reflects, recognises and understands our international obligations. So far as temporary protection visas are concerned, since January 2003 Labor has had a policy which is reflected in these amendments. The rationale for that approach is essentially what I said to the ALP National Conference in January 2003, and it rings true today: So far as Temporary Protection Visas are concerned, John Howard believes that Temporary Protection Visas somehow operate as some form of deterrent to unauthorised arrivals. Well if it is such an effective deterrent, why have we had 8,000 to 9,000 people come here on his watch who are now out there in the Australian community. We say there is a role for Temporary Protection Visas, but only if that role is consistent with the Refugee Convention. The Refugee Convention always envisaged that there would be circumstances where the ongoing protection of the Convention was not required. Under our model, an unauthorised person who comes here, who is determined by the Commonwealth to be a refugee, will go on a Temporary Protection Visa for a one-off period of two years. After which if the ongoing protection of that person is required, and the onus of that will be on the Commonwealth, then that person has a pathway to permanency. The worse of Howard's Temporary Protection Visas is having people out there in limbo for several years. You have to deal with the backlog but you also have to set the system up for the future. I continued: We say two years is an appropriate time to make a judgment. Two years is an appropriate period to give protection, but after that period a different public policy consideration comes into play. ... if the ongoing protection under the Refugee Convention is not required, in the case of those people who have been here on a Temporary Protection Visas for two years or more, you can make a judgment which is, are these people, who have been out and about in the Australian community making their family, community, social and economic contacts, are these the sorts of people who in any event Australia would want as part of our migration intake? If you come to a positive conclusion on that, then there is a pathway to permanency. So it is not, as the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs incorrectly describes, an automatic jump from TPV to permanency. These measures were put to this House in April 2004-a sensible, coherent TPV system, with trigger points consistent with our international obligations, making independent judgments under our migration procedures and rules, together with the right of reentry. Everyone on the other side of the House voted it down, including the members for Kooyong, Pearce and Cook. You have to address the backlog of the 8,000 to 9,000 people who came here during John Howard's watch. John Howard said they were refugees. John Howard gave them temporary protection visa status and now they just roll around in limbo. You have to set the system up for the future so that uncertainty can never happen again. If you adopt Labor's amendment, that will set up the system to treat TPV holders in a fair way, consistent with our international obligations. (Time expired)",69
74,Mr CADMAN,NOES,"Mitchell) (12.48 pm)There is no way we can wear this proposal to take away proper discretion from the minister and to confine the minister in decision making to basically a single outcome-that is, a permanent result rather than giving the minister the option of assessing an individual's case carefully, taking into account every aspect of that case, including family circumstances, likely problems on return to country of origin and other options that a minister must consider. The Labor Party seek to codify everything. They want rules for everything; they do not want ministers to exercise judgment or to be criticised. They want a minister to say, ‘That's the law; I had to do it.' That is the problem with the way in which the act has been codified. This is a sensible provision which will allow the minister to exercise judgment. The amendment qualifies the power to grant visas and provides for the grant of a two-year visa and then the person must move towards permanency. That is not the government's intention. The government's intention is to provide proper assessment by a minister taking advice from everybody, including members of parliament and other agencies. The Labor Party have presented these amendments in a very interesting way. Instead of going through the bill in a seriatim process, which is the normal way to run a series of related amendments, the Labor Party have gone through Petro Georgiou's speech, picking out the purple patches and graduating them in a process where they think they can get people to cross the floora political stunt. They start with the inspector-general, but they know we are going to knock that out, that we will not wear it. The next one they want to run is the judicial assessor. They do not run them in a seriatim process, the normal process for amendments. The Labor Party have them in a graduated order of concern so that they can make a political point. The grant of protection visas detainees and the 90-day provision are next. This has been purely a political exerciseone after the other. Part of the political exercise is the wish to codify the actions of a minister and to encourage the process of granting permanency-no other options; just change the visa and grant permanency. If we go through the four parts of this proposal put forward by the Australian Labor Party we find that one after the other they remove discretion. Nobody is going to deny that there should be removal of the discretion which the government wants to grant in these circumstances. I believe you cannot argue effectively that that discretion should not be given. The judgment of the minister is exposed to everybody and open to public criticism. The minister is going to make these decisions and it is going to be open for everybody. But, in the view of the Australian Labor Party, the minister needs to be confined. The government do not believe that that should be the process. We believe the minister needs to exercise full discretion and that is why these amendments are hopeless.",70
75,Ms PLIBERSEK,NOES,"Sydney) (12.51 pm)One of the enduring features of the temporary protection visa regime in Australia is the government's effort to keep secret the stories of the people who are affected by it. One after another, these stories come to light and we hear not only Labor members but also government members saying: ‘The temporary visa protection system is terrific except for the people in my electorate who are making such a fantastic contribution'-picking fruit in the Riverina or working in the abattoir at Young-‘These people should not be affected by this regime, because they are a special case. They are terrific people and should be able to become Australian residents and eventually Australian citizens.' There is an irrational belief that the refugees for we know are okay-it is all the other refugees who are a terrible threat to the Australian fabric and way of life. Discussing temporary protection visas, I am reminded of the film Molly and Mubarak, which was shown in Parliament House in November 2003. It is a beautiful film by Tom Zubricki about a young Afghan boy, his friendship with a girl of a similar age at Young, their developing friendship and his virtual adoption by her family. It was a moving film and was very light-hearted in parts. It was certainly no great threat to Australian democracy. You might remember that the government tried to ban the screening of that film in Parliament House. The reason I was given for this was that the film is critical the government's policy, selectively quotes the Prime Minister and promotes the theme of widespread resistance to government policy. That was the reason given to shut down debate in this country on temporary protection visas. The film's director, Tom Zubricki, said of Molly and Mubarak: ‘It is a film which I think makes you rethink your position on people who have been accused of being illegals and queue jumpers. It presents them in a different light and that is why it probably politically contentious. It can be seen as subversive, because it humanises these people who have been demonised and vilified.' We should remember that temporary protection visa holders have been found to be genuine refugees. There is no debate about whether they deserve Australia's protection as genuine refugees. That is not the question. The question is: what sort of protection will we give them? Up until now, we have given them extremely substandard protection. We have said that they can never be reunited with their families. They cannot leave the country to visit their family in a third country. In 20 or 30 years time, will they be permitted to meet their family in Singapore and see what has happened to children who have grown up or parents who are almost at the end of their lives? No. This is the regime to which we have subjected refugees who have come to Australia. The member for Mitchell is talking about taking away ministerial discretion in this area. The point of his government's legislation is to give ministerial discretion where it has not previously existed. I do not know how you can possibly interpret our efforts as being aimed at taking away ministerial discretion. Our efforts are aimed at offering certainty to people who deserve it. These people have invoked their right to protection of under international laws. They have come here during the government's watch, as one of the earlier speakers said, and have been granted asylum by the government. We want to say to these people: ‘We will give you some certainty. You need not look forward to a lifetime of having the threat hanging over your head that, any day, you may be returned to your country of origin.' Most of the temporary protection visa holders are from Iraq and Afghanistan. Of the almost 9,000 tempois rary protection visa holders, over 3,500 are from Afghanistan and over 4,500 are from Iraq. I do not see the situation in those countries being safe any time soon. The constant threat that they will be sent home makes it impossible for them to settle into Australian society.

76,Mr BARRESI,NOES,"As the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs pointed out in his contribution, this is an amendment we will not accept. Ms Vamvakinou-Come on, Phil, have a heart!",72
77,Mr BARRESI,NOES,"I have full regard for the member for Calwell, having worked with her on committees. But if she really understood the amendment and what it is trying to achieve-if she went back and looked through the legislation it is amending-she would know that it does not achieve what she intends. This amendment qualifies the power to grant visas to detainees and amends section 195A to require that TPV holders be granted permanent visas. I say to the member for Calwell and the member for Reid-who has responsibility for carrying these amendments through the House-that section 195A is purely for those who are in detention. These changes are not possible under this amendment. The issue is uncertainty. This amendment will create even more uncertainty if it is passed. We all know that the United Nations prefers that those who seek and are granted asylum in another country should at a future time be settled back in their original country. Granting permanent protection visas before we have had a chance to see how the situation unfolds back home prevents that United Nations objective from being achieved. It is much better that people be resettled back home if possible. The TPV allows a person's individual case-such as the country they come from, and their political, economic and social situation-to be reassessed to see whether or not it is safe for them to return home. The TPV gives that extra flexibility, including to the minister. The member for Sydney says that these people are going to be prevented from going back to Singapore or Bangkok or wherever else to catch up with relatives in 10 or 20 years time. We know from current practices that the majority of TPV holders assessed as being in need of further protection have in fact already been granted permanent protection. In August 2004 the government introduced amendments to allow former TPV holders to access mainstream visa classes. We have allowed that flexibility for the TPV holders to access other visas. A lot of the cases have been assessed as warranting permanent protection. However, automatically granting TPV holders permanent protection removes the flexibility that any government and any minister would require. This is one of the reasons why this amendment should also be voted down.",72
78,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,NOES,"by leave-I move opposition amendments (7) to (12): (7) Schedule 1, item 19, page 12 (line 2) omit “2 years” substitute “90 days” (8) Schedule 1, item 19, page 12 (line 10) omit “2 years” substitute “90 days” (9) Schedule 1, item 19, page 12 (line 11) omit “2 years” substitute “90 days” (10) Schedule 1, item 19, page 12 (line 15) omit “2 years” (twice occurring) substitute “90 days” (11) Schedule 1, item 19, page 12 (line 22) omit “6 months” substitute “1 month” (12) Schedule 1, item 19, page 12 (line 31) omit “6 months” substitute “one month” We have a stark contrast here. We have the assurances of the member for Wentworth that it is difficult to say whether reporting on people two years after detention and a further six months later is good enough. He says that experience will tell. That is very nice for him, but one has to ask whether it is all that nice for the people in detention. We also have the contribution to this debate from the member for Mitchell. He has lamented the possibility that Labor is codifying, bringing in controls and bringing in bureaucracy. He says that we can trust the minister; the exercise of ministerial discretion is good enough. But I am inclined to look to the other side for this stark contrast: the views of the member for Kooyong with regard to this constant stream from those opposite that the department is, to quote the member for Deakin, ‘scrutinised too much'. The member for Kooyong stated: … no government department has greater unscrutinised power over people's lives thanDIMIAand I do not believe that it is acceptable to decisions about detentions in the hands of DIMIA officials without additional independent scrutiny and intervention. For all the rhetoric and talk opposite that this department is over controlled and over scrutinised, many of us would say that the member for Kooyong is more on the money. We have a situation where, two years after detention, they will start looking at giving a report to the ombudsman's office and then every six months after that. This is at the same time that the coalition comes to this parliament saying that DIMIA will process stages of these people in three months and then in another three months. One would have to question whether, given that alacrity and that move towards swiftness with the devotion of more resources, they cannot be a little bit more proactive with regard to having an early report on these people. I say that a first report after 90 days and further reports after one month is a far more sensible suggestion. I do not need to dwell at length on the allegations and the evidence of psychiatric problems of people who have been in long term detention. The minister has said that she was not prepared to come to the conclusion that the detention system puts patients at serious risk of mental illness. A few days after saying that, in the aftermath of the revelations, she said: Can I give an absolute guarantee that the detention of Cornelia Rauwho was detained for 10 months and not two yearsdid not in any way further damage her condition? Of course I cannot give that guarantee. Those opposite talk about trust and scrutiny et cetera. The member for Kooyong and his allies do not trust ministerial discretion. I made the point earlier that the secret deal, which was not revealed to the public, involves this interdepartmental committee, led leave by Mr Shergold, reporting to the member for Kooyong and the other members involved in this on a fortnightly basis. That is the level of trust their own side of politics has in this process; they have to report fortnightly to see how it is going. This is the same interdepartmental committee which is supposed to be trustworthy with regard to monitoring the department of immigration, which, as anyone would know, is dysfunctional and out of control, as we have seen over the last few months. The complaints about bureaucracy, about paperwork and about difficulties and over scrutiny should be seen in the context of the experiences of the people and the revelations of recent months. Labor puts forward that the background to this is a faster and fairer processing system; transparency and accountability are long overdue. There will be no hiding behind the non-compellable power of ministerial discretion. There must be a justification to parliament if the minister refuses the recommendations of these reports. We should avoid unnecessary and prolonged detention and we should have a system that is humane; the system is necessary but it should not be punitive. There is a solid case in what we have seen for strong intervention, strong oversight and strong checking up on this department and, more particularly, on detention. The situation came to a head when Justice Finn said that the government, the department and the contractor had all lamentably failed in their duty of care to these people in detention. Australian citizens with psychiatric problems have been detained-and not on one occasion, as the minister said earlier; this has been demonstrated publicly on at least two occasions. We have to have protection in a system where it has been revealed that there have been 200 unlawful detentions and where there is the possibility that some 928 further cases will be referred.

79,Mr MCGAURAN,NOES,"Gippsland-Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs) (1.00 pm)-The opposition's amendments to the Migration Amendment (Detention Arrangements) Bill 2005, before us now, would change the government's proposal for ombudsman assessments of a detainee every two years and then every six months to, instead, assessments by the Ombudsman every 90 days and then every month. This is a matter of judgment more than a matter of opinion. We believe that our system of assessments every two years and then every six months-and, in the interim, the interdepartmental committee chaired by the Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet reporting fortnightly to interested government members-is the more practical and reasonable system. To have the Ombudsman reporting on detainees every 90 days and every month thereafter, quite frankly, is an administrative nightmare that will quickly become unworkable. Consequently, we do not accept the opposition's amendments. We will properly resource the Ombudsman. I find an inherent contradiction in the opposition's presentation of its amendments. It puts forward a proposal for a new inspector-general who has the responsibility of overseeing the detention arrangements. Therefore, what does the ombudsman do? The inspector-general and the ombudsman will be crossing each other's paths in and out of detention centres basically doing the same thing. Then on top of that you have the judicial assessor. The layer upon layer of bureaucracy is frightening and not in the interests of detainees, let alone in the interests sound immigration and detention policy. It smacks of the opposition trying to find points of difference and separation from the government. It is a game of one-upmanship to the opposition. That is why we are getting these new bodies, these new people, and these new powers. Let me state categorically-and I know I speak on behalf of every member of the government-that we do not want people in detention, let alone for prolonged periods. But the simple fact of life is that when you are running an immigration policy there are people in detention. That is unavoidable. The House will be interested to know that at present 75 per cent of all people in immigration detention are compliance cases, such as overstayers, most of whom are in for short periods. Fifteen per cent of detainees are unauthorised boat arrival people and the remaining 10 per cent are mostly people awaiting deportation, a number of them for criminal offences. Only a minority of children, nine per cent, or women, 20 per cent, found to be unlawfully in Australia are detained. In the vast majority of cases DIMIA works on removal arrangements while the women and children remain in the community. We have heard Labor members talk about Stalin and say that Saddam Hussein has more rights than detainees. We have heard the word ‘gestapo' from the opposition-all exaggeration. But when you look at it clinically and objectively, we have a fair and necessary detention system which we are improving very substantially as time goes on. Senator Vanstone has announced reforms and improvements in past months. Administratively she has done a great deal and now, legislatively, the government is doing even more to make the system flexible and softer. Let us face it-in a minority of those cases where detention is the only option it is because parents or other individuals are not cooperating of fully in removal arrangements. So in summary, there has been a detailed consideration of the opposition's amendments. They bring nothing to the table except political posturing. Their amendments are either impractical or unworkable. They cannot walk both sides of the street on this. They cannot be strong on border protection and then weaken mandatory detention to a point where it becomes unworkable. Instead, the government has fair and sensible reforms brought about by the considered deliberation of all government members, reforms which will be endorsed widely throughout the community.",75
80,Mr CREAN,NOES,"I rise to again acknowledge that progress has been made on the Migration Amendment (Detention Arrangements) Bill 2005, but it does not go far enough. That is why I am supporting this amendment, moved by the member for Reid, along with the other amendments. This issue could have been dealt with by the parliament more than two years ago. Labor gave this House the opportunity to vote on the more expeditious processing of people in detention facilities. We came to that position because we had an extensive process of consultation around the community. For over 12 months the member for Lalor, and then the member for Reid, conducted seminars and discussion groups around the country to try to work out the best way in which we could advance this policy area so that we got the balance right between secure borders and a more compassionate system. One of the conclusions that came out of those consultations, not only with community groups but also with experts in the field and with the department, was that it was possible to process nearly every asylum seeker within 90 days. We accepted the need for detention to establish the question of health checks, security checks and citizenship, but we said it should not go on endlessly. We took advice and we were told that this could be done within 90 days. In fact, we were given an assurance that 90 per cent of cases could be dealt with in 90 days. This, I note, is a fact not disputed, not demurred from, by the government members. So what we are dealing with here is what happens after the 90 days. It is not just a question of judgment, as the minister at the table, the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Mr MCGauran, talks about. This goes fundamentally to whether we want a fair system for dealing with people after the 90 days has passed. Let us understand the contrast between what Labor's amendment proposes and what the government proposes. We say that after the 90 days the onus of proof should shift. It should essentially come back to the government or the independent assessor to say why the person needs to be kept in detention facilities after 90 days. That is an exercise that needs to be made public. We say that there should be a requirement on the part of the independent body to report on a monthly basis and for that to be made public. What does the government say? The government's bill effectively says that the Ombudsman, the independent body, does not even start to look at these people for two years. And then it has a review only every six months. In other words, instead of our system, which would put the onus back on the government to say why after 90 days the person could not be released, we are stuck with this system which says the person can still be in detention for another two years and then only get a six-monthly review. That is not judgment-that is deception. You cannot masquerade in this place talking about 90 days and fairness if the truth is two years plus six months. That is the contrast. That is the difference between the amendments we are putting forward and what the government bill proposes. The government's process could take 10 times longer than the process we have been advocating. This is not the first time Labor has put type of amendment before the House. I might say again of the four members that have been claiming credit for pursuing these changes: where were they when we put these proposals to the chamber before? They did not vote for us. I think that, importantly, has to get on the record. I have congratulated them on what they have achieved. But, if they really believe in their heart of hearts what they have been talking about, they should be supporting our amendments. As for leaving the discretion ultimately in the hands of the minister: what a joke. This is a person who has shown no indication of compassion, no ability to really judge the circumstances. Yet after the Ombudsman reports to her it is up to her as to whether anything is done. That is not good enough. If we want a system that is going to improve, we need to accept Labor's amendment on this case as well as on the other initiatives that are before the chamber.",76
81,Mr CADMAN,NOES,"We need to analyse what the Labor Party is proposing here with these amendments. The amendments propose that the period of two years before a re-examination is made be substituted with 90 days and then every month thereafter. This is not confined to asylum seekers; it applies to everybody in detention, of which at 27 May there were 973. These amendments are proposing that for each month after the 90-day period 973 cases be re-examined. In every instance-right through the government's bill-‘two years' would be substituted with ‘90 days', with a follow-on of one month thereafter. On a rough calculation that would require the Ombudsman to look at 263 cases a week, approximately eight minutes per case. Is that a review? Do you think that will get bogged down, Madam Deputy Speaker Bishop, in bureaucracy? I am sure it would and you would agree with me. So how is it going to this work? It is impractical. The proposed amendments to the act mean that in 973 cases there would be this monthly review. I am sorry: it will not work. The intention may have been good, but it is impractical if you add together the cumulative impact of all of these amendments. This is why the proposals of the Australian Labor Party are so flawed. The first amendment they moved was to get a grand inspector to go into the whole array of detention centres to inspect them and to take submissions from anybody the inspector-general would want to take submissions from. That is one review. The next review would be by the assessor-the judicial assessor would do another review of children and families in residential detention. So that is a second review and a second person doing their stuff. Then of course independent medical and media representatives would be able to go and see whomever they liked at any time. On top of that, the amendments confine the minister's discretion so the minister cannot really have much say except to grant permanent residency. Finally, to cap it all, there would be another survey of every individual in detention, giving them 8½ minutes per month every month, 12 months of the year. The impracticalities of three reexaminations plus access by media and medical advisers, along with confining where the minister can exercise judicial discretion to make worthwhile decisions, is topped off by this 8½-minute examination by the Ombudsman. It just shows how out of touch the Australian Labor Party are with policy in general but immigration policy in particular. They have been running a line that was hopeless for them in government. It took them six years to decide they were going to ditch that policy. Then when the policy was continued for a little longer by the shadow minister he had a private talking to and was told to pull his head in. Finally we have these silly amendments today. It just shows you how out of touch they are.",77
82,Mr BEVIS,NOES,"Brisbane) (1.20 pm)Clearly consistency and statistics are not strong suit of the member for Mitchell. Elsewhere in the government's contribution to this debate they have claimed that they will process most cases in 30 days. I am not quite sure how that factors into his quick piece of arithmetic, nor his analysis of the work of the Ombudsman's office, who I take it he assumes has a total staff allocation of one individual. The simple fact is that involved in dealing with these amendments there is a fundamental principle that all members of this chamber cannot escape. It is whether we think people should be detained, effectively without review, for up to two years in what amounts to mandatory sentencing or whether there should be an obligation built into the system to process most people within 90 days. As the member for Hotham pointed out earlier, Labor in 2002 made it clear that our policy would be to have 90 per cent of these people processed within 90 days. As bona fides, to ensure that the system operated properly-because we understood in 2002, as has become tragically clearer since then, that this department has failed to conduct affairs in a way which most Australians would regard as proper-we would build in the transparency and accountability mechanism of having, after 90 days, an external review for each of those cases. That external review would be conducted on a monthly basis and the minister of the day would be required to provide a response to that independent review. That provides a transparency and a process of accountability that the Australian people demand as fair and reasonable. Contrast that with the government's bill and the position which government members have sought to defend in this debate, which is that people should be put away and locked up for two years before there is an external accountability and review process. After the those two years, there is then a review only every six months. In practical terms, the contrast is this: Labor's amendment would ensure that if someone was detained compulsorily in a detention centre for two years, they would have had something in the order of 18 to 20 reviews by the time they got the first review under this government. Someone on the government benches might like to explain why that is fair. I have listened to the debate today as a number of government members have complained that Labor members have tried to take some moral high ground on this. A number of people on the government benches have indicated their personal commitment to similar principles. I accept that a number of government members do share similar principles on this. The test of those principles and their bona fides is in dealing with these amendments. There is an opportunity for government members who claim to be concerned about these things to demonstrate that, not in press releases, doorstops or stunts, but in real activity by a vote in this parliament which makes a difference. There its is an opportunity for them to put their feet where their mouths have been for the last few weeks and actually support what is by any measure a fair and proper system. We think that to detain people for 90 days is a fair period in which the system can determine identity, health and security risks for the great bulk of people. That was a decision we took in 2002. I am glad that the member for Hotham spoke prior to me on this because when he was the Leader of the Opposition, he gave the commitment on Australia Day 2002, on behalf of the Labor Party, that changed our policy to say that we would remove children from detention centres. At the time, that was a pretty courageous stand to take. The member for Hotham did that with dignity. It is something that those of us on this side of the House are proud of. Since that time, we have argued for a policy that embodies these principles of fairness. We have moved amendments in this place to that effect in the past and government members have done their best to prevent the parliament debating them. Here they have an opportunity to vote on the substance of the issue-no tactical games, but a vote on the substance of the issue. Do the government members who claim to be concerned about these things want to see people detained as a matter of practice for two years or do they think that 90 days is a fair time to process them? Here is the test to those opposite. We will wait to see whether they can measure up to that test. (Time expired)",78
83,Mr BARRESI,NOES,"I thank the member for Brisbane for coming out and finally telling us what the motivation for these amendments is all about. The motivation for these amendments is to see whether or not there are members of the government who will cross the floor. That is what this is all about. It is pure and simple: this is politics. I understand that; it is the fession that we are in. But do not disguise it behind some concern about the existence of immigration detention at all. This is about politics. The bells will ring and let us see whether or not people are going to cross the floor. These amendments, more so than any of the other amendments, basically outline a new ALP policy-that is, the dismantling of mandatory detention. Mandatory detention would cease to exist if we have in the legislation the ability for reviews to take place within 90 days and then every month afterwards. People out there will know that they are going to get a decision within 90 days and after that every month. Mandatory detention is dead. This is a new ALP policy and let them come out and say it. Is it dead or is it politics? It is one of the two. It is either a new ALP policy of making mandatory detention dead or it is all about politics. I will get back to the amendments because our changes do address the issue of people who will be in detention for exorbitant periods of time. I spoke in the main debate about my concern for Peter Qasim and how much I was touched by his story when I met him. We do not want situations like Peter Qasim's to slip through the system. That is why we are making changes so that after two years, and then every six months afterwards, the Commonwealth Ombudsman will review each case. That is a fair system. Within that two-year period, we will also allow the applicant the ability to go through the primary application, including the tribunal, the Federal Court, the Magistrates Court and the High Court. So the legal avenues will still be available to the detainees. On the other hand, what the ALP is doing is mixing two systems-an administrative system and a legal system. If you do not understand that, it is because this has nothing to do with addressproing the issue; it is all about the politics that you are playing at the moment. There is another thing that we need to understand. I think it was the member for Hotham who spoke about the onus of proof shifting onto the government to prove the case. At the moment we have a situation where someone applies to be an asylum seeker. Surely it is reasonable to expect that, if you are going to make an application for something, your application should demonstrate the veracity of your case. It is up to that individual, not the government, to demonstrate the veracity of the case. Even beyond that, the United Nations guidelinesand you would know this, Member for Reid, as after all you carry the portfolio on behalf of the opposition-allow within that system, where there may be a benefit of the doubt, that that also be taken into consideration and go in favour of the applicant. The application of the United Nations guidelines currently allows the benefit of the doubt to be applied. But we know what this is about. This is about politics; this is not about your concern for mandatory detention. If it is, then you have outlined a new ALP policy of dismantling the entire thing. What is it? State which one it is, and let us get on with it.",79

91,Mr HUNT,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Flinders-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage) (1.51 pm)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill 2005 is to make amendments to the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act 1989 and to the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust Act 2001. Australia's Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act 1989 has made a significant contribution to the global effort to phase out ozone depleting substances, and is now also contributing to minimising Australia's avoidable emissions of synthetic greenhouse gases. Through cooperation between government and industry, the legislation has reduced Australia's consumption of ozone depleting substances by 80 per cent since 1989, resulting in estimated savings to the Australian economy of some $6.4 billion by the year 2060. This bill proposes to amend the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act 1989 to rectify a small number of operational anomalies and unintended consequences of drafting. The proposed amendments will ensure the consistent and effective operation of Australia's legislaWales. tion for the management of ozone depleting substances and their synthetic greenhouse gas alternatives. These substances have very significant impacts on the global climate tem and the ozone layer, and appropriate restrictions are essential to ensure that substances are managed consistently and used sustainably within Australia. Specifically, this bill will make two changes to the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act 1989. Firstly, it will confirm that importers or exporters of recycled or used methyl bromide or hydrochlorofluorocarbons are only required to hold a used substances licence. This approach is consistent with that taken for other ozone depleting substances-such as chlorofluorocarbons and halonscurrently controlled under the act. Secondly, the bill will ensure that reporting obligations for synthetic greenhouse gases manufactured in Australia are the same as those for synthetic greenhouse gases imported into, or exported, from Australia. The proposed amendments to the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act 1989 contained in this bill demonstrate the government's determination to further advance its practical and effective approach to managing ozone depletion and climate change. In relation to the amendments to the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust Act 2001, the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust is responsible for preparing and implementing a plan for the future uses of former defence and other Commonwealth lands on or near the foreshores of Sydney Harbour. These are historic lands. They tell the story of European settlement in Sydney and trace the patterns of defence, industry and population growth in the fledgling colony of New South The lands are Macquarie Lightstation on South Head; the former Artillery School at North Head; Woolwich Dock and Parklands; sys- Cockatoo Island; Snapper Island; Defence lands at Middle Head-Georges Heightsthese Chowder Bay; and the former marine biological station at Watsons Bay. The Sydney Harbour Federation Trust's comprehensive plan for these sites was approved by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage's predecessor, the Hon. Dr David Kemp, in September 2003. The plan was some years in preparation and involved wide community consultation. It is fair to say that consultation by the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust in the preparation of the plan was a hallmark of the planning process. A community advisory committee, established under the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust's legislation, was instrumental in reflecting community interest in the sites and providing advice and recommendations on site outcomes. I particularly commend the work of the member for Warringah and the member for North Sydney in assisting with the community consultation. The Sydney Harbour Federation Trust has begun the challenging task of implementing the comprehensive plan. Former Defence lands at Middle HeadGeorges Heights-Chowder Bay are being transformed into a headland park. The park will link all the elements of these disparate defence bases and bring them into accord with the great natural and cultural assets of the Middle Head plateau. A network of walking tracks, lookouts, revegetation and interpretive signage will underpin compatible uses of buildings and facilities and highlight the Indigenous and military history of this beautiful headland. The Sydney Harbour Federation Trust Act 2001 provides for the sale, subject to environmental and heritage considerations, of 19 residential lots listed in schedule 2 to The residential lots are at Markham Close, Mosman. Other trust lands are listed in schedule 1 to the act and are to remain in public ownership. To date 12 residential lots at Markham Close have been sold by auction. The effect of the proposed amendments contained within this bill will be to enable the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust to more effectively bring to the fore the natural ridgeline of Middle Head peninsula and add to the character of the headland park. This entails transferring three residential lots in Markham Close from schedule 2 to schedule 1, thus allowing them to be incorporated into the park and in exchange transferring the land on which a disused scout hall is located, currently included in schedule 1, to schedule 2 permitting its eventual sale. This land swap, which has strong community endorsement, is consistent with the trust's comprehensive plan and the fundamental objective of making its lands accessible to the public. The scout hall land does not have any significant environmental and heritage value and the scouting association has relinquished its lease on the land. The scout hall land, comprising around two-tenths of a hectare of trust lands, will be sold to private funds to enhance trust sites. The trust's preparation of the management plan for Markham Close included the proposal to swap land in the interests of highlighting the ridgeline of Middle Head peninsula and contributing to the creation of a spectacular headland park. The proposed land swap was overwhelmingly supported by the community during the exhibition of the draft management plan. The proposed amendments contained in this bill will enable the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust to fulfil the objectives of the the act. comprehensive plan and to open Middle Head peninsula for the benefit of the community. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.",84

94,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that the petrol bill of a typical ily increases by $8 a week with every 20c a litre petrol price rise? Will the Prime Minister strengthen the Trade Practices Act and the powers of the ACCC to prevent and punish profiteering? Will the Prime Minister establish a full and independent inquiry into petrol pricing and profiteering? Or does the Prime Minister agree with the Treasurer that there is nothing the government can or will do?,87
95,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I would have thought that the Leader of the Opposition was aware that the reason petrol prices are so painfully high at the moment-and they are painfully high; the government understands that-is that the world price of crude oil has risen. It is as simple as that. Mr Costello-A record high.,87
96,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is a record high, as the Treasurer reminds me. Let me say that since 1979, when I think the former leader of the Labor Party and former Labor Prime Minister and my immediate predecessor embraced the policy of import parity pricing for crude oil, I have not heard the Labor Party repudiate that policy. All I can say is that the call by the Leader of the Opposition for another inquiry is the sort of empty populism about which Senator Robert Ray has complained. To Senator Robert Ray, the member for Lalor and all the other people who are running around telling the Leader of the Opposition to lift his game can I say that a decent policy alternative and not cheap populism is what is needed from the Leader of the Opposition.

97,Mr LINDSAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister inform the House of the outcomes of yesterday's meeting of the International Whaling Commission.,87
98,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. The International famWhaling Commission held its second day of meetings in Ulsan, Korea, yesterday. At that meeting Japan proposed an amendment to the convention that would have allowed the resumption of commercial whaling. I am pleased to inform the House, and of course it has been in the media in any case, that working closely with quite a number of likeminded countries we were successful in voting down this measure by 29 votes to 23. The fact that a majority-a good majority in the circumstances-were opposed to the resumption of commercial whaling is something that we particularly welcome. This was a vote that built on our earlier success in blocking Japan's attempts to alter the procedures and the agenda of the International Whaling Commission to suit pro-whaling nations. I make the point that this excellent result was the product of patient diplomacy, and I congratulate Senator Ian Campbell, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, on the excellent job he has done. I think we are all very grateful to him for his hard and effective work and to the officials of his department and my department. This is an example of patient diplomacy that has spanned many years. This is not an issue that has cropped up in the last three months; this issue is ages old. We have had very effective but quiet cooperation with our partners. There will be further votes in coming days, including on an Australian motion that the International Whaling Commission not consider Japan's expanded scientific whaling program until a review of the original program has been completed. The outcome is hard to predict and, again, it will be very difficult to get a majority. It is possible we could, but it is possible that we will not. But in the end we will do our best to try to achieve that outcome. In conclusion, some members and commentators have argued that we should abandon this process, that it does not amount to much, and, instead, we should just go to the International Court of Justice. The government have always said that we do not rule in or rule out any options. We obviously keep our options open, but we would need to consider any measure like that very carefully. That is the sort of measure that needs to be thought through. Bringing legal action in the International Court of Justice is a process that could take a decade or more, so we would not get very quick results there. Also, the doctrine of abuse of rights, which is the basis on which we would take action in the International Court of Justice, has not succeeded so far and so that is a case that would have to be argued. A third consideration is that, even if we were successful after a decade or so in the International Court of Justice, it would be open to Japan to circumvent the impact of the court's decision by simply withdrawing from the International Whaling Commission. It is better that Japan remain in the International Whaling Commission, where its whaling activities can be supervised and regulated. We would not want to overreact by dealing with this issue in such a way that it might be to the benefit of a decent headline one day but in fact be entirely counterproductive the next. That is the sort of issue that not just the government but the parliament needs to think through very carefully. Whaling",87
99,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware of the comments by the Parliamentary Secretary for Industry, that Tourism and Resources, who, according to yesterday's Cairns Post, said that the slaughter of whales for food is ‘okay'? Is the Prime Minister aware that the member for Leichhardt stated that he has an ‘issue with the government taking a position of total prohibition against countries killing whales'? Given that whale watching contributes some $300 million annually to Australian tourism, will the Prime Minister send a clear and unequivocal message by harpooning the member for Leichhardt from his position as parliamentary secretary for tourism?",88
100,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That question is bordering on being ruled out of order, but, if the Prime Minister chooses to answer it, I invite him to do so.",88
101,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would be happy to answer it. I am glad they have the heavyweights in action now! I simply say that our policy on this is very well known. What is more, it has been powerfully articulated by Senator Ian Campbell, who has done a wonderful job. I endorse without reservation everything that he has said on the subject. Economy",88
102,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Would the Treasurer outline to the House recent partial data on the state of the economy? What does this data indicate about Australia's economic outlook?,88
103,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Paterson for his question. The Australian Bureau of Statistics today released information on sales of new motor vehicles for May. That showed that sales were down by 1.2 per cent on the previous month. One would not want to overstate this, because 2003 was a record year, 2004 was a record year and 2005 is in excess of 2004, but the fact that sales are increasing at a slower rate compared to 2004 does show that consumer demand may well be slowing a little, as I have indicated through other data. Also, the skilled vacancies index was released today, which showed that skilled vacancies fell by 0.5 per cent in the June quarter and are 3.2 per cent lower over the year. That is consistent with the budget forecast showing a moderating domestic demand and employment growth slowing to 1¾ per cent in 2005-06. That is slower than in previous years but it would be sufficient to maintain the unemployment rate at around 5 per cent, which is at a 29-year low. The partial data released today, I believe, is consistent with other data such as we have had from the housing sector, which indicates a slowing in consumption in the domestic economy. We have had very large price rises in relation to exports, and a rebalancing of growth from domestic to external sources would certainly be welcome. This moderation of consumption may well be consistent with households rebuilding their balance sheets. Again, that would be a welcome development for the economy. Credit Card Security",88
104,Mr FITZGIBBON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is also directed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer advise the House on what date the government first became aware of the credit card security breach which has exposed 130,000 Australian cardholders to fraud?",89
105,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I cannot advise what date the government became aware of that. I understand that Senator Ellison has been answering questions in relation to this in the Senate. Mr Crean interjecting",89
106,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,89
107,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am interrupted by the sound effects man down there! I can inform the House that data was stolen in America from CardSystems Solutions through computer hacking in the United States. I am informed that any person involved in using credit data stolen from CardSystems within Australia to access funds, credit or other financial benefits will be subject to offences under the Criminal Code. I am also informed that the code of practice between the Australian banks provides that, where somebody has suffered a loss because of fraud by a third party, the banks will make good and individuals will not be responsible for any loss. I am also told that the banking industry is forming an information security customer response task force, led by the Australian Bankers Association, which will be in place by 1 July. As far as I am aware, those banks that became aware of this credit card fraud in the United States took immediate steps to replace the cards. I am not aware that there has been any loss by any Australian user of those cards, because the banks have made that good. I believe that Australian law enforcement authorities are cooperating with their American counterparts. Mr Fitzgibbon- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I invite the Treasurer to get back to the House at a later hour with advice on exactly when the government became aware of the fraud.",89
108,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It is the prerogative of the Treasurer if he wishes to add to his answer. Budget 2005-06,89
109,Mr FAWCETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is also addressed to the Treasurer. Would the Treasurer inform the House of new tax schedules that are due to take effect in July 2005? Are there any impediments to these schedules taking effect?,89
110,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Wakefield for his question. I can inform the House that the good news is that all Australian income tax payers will receive a tax cut in nine days time on 1 July. The legislation to enact those tax cuts, unfortunately, has been blocked in the Senate by the Australian Labor Party, but schedules, which take effect and can be relied upon, have not been disallowed by motion in either house. They have now been in this House for 11 days and in the Senate for six days. There is only one more day of sitting for anyone to move a disallowance motion. Provided that no-one moves a disallowance motion tomorrow, those schedules will go ahead and every Australian will receive a tax cut on 1 July 2005. Labor's campaign to stop taxes being cut on 1 July 2005 has failed. The good news is that the public recognises that Labor's campaign against income tax cuts was a misguided campaign. A large proportion of the Australian Labor Party also now recognise that the decision by their so-called brains trust to oppose the income tax cuts in the budget was misguided-and the poor Leader of the Opposition is living with that. But, as I constantly say to the House, do not hold him solely responsible; he was advised by the member for Lilley, the member for Swan and Senator Conroy-the three wise roosters. This morning the member for Lilley was asked about the tax schedules. I will read the question and the answer, because I think the question is a bit of a corker. The journalist that approached the member for Lilley asked this question-and I ask the House to listen to it: ‘Wayne, are the roosters worried that Kim Beazley isn't coming through?' Answer: ‘No, we're not worried at all.' The good news is that the roosters are not worried. The line from rooster central is that there is no need to panic. Everything is going according to plan. There is a cunning strategy and all will shortly be revealed. Let the backbench of the Labor Party know that this particular strategy is under control-under rooster control. Situation normal at rooster command. We on this side of the House believe that taxes should be cut because, if you can fund your services, if you can balance your budget and if you can reduce your debt, income taxes should be as low as possible for the Australian public. We have a plan to cut income tax rates at the lowest marginal rate and to increase thresholds at the top rate. After these schedules go through and after the legislation goes through in August, only three per cent of Australians will be bothered by the top marginal tax rate. That will put incentive back in the Australian taxation system and encourage growth and the continuation of a strong economy in this country. Comcar: Employees",90
111,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Minister, is it a fact that, in negotiating a new agreement with Commonwealth car drivers, the government, discharging its employment responsibilities through Comcar, has proposed to cut 10 current conditions of employment with no pay increase? Minister, if the government is happy to treat its own driverspeople it works with every day-in this unfair way, what confidence can any Australian employee have that they will not be worse off under the government's industrial relations changes?",90
112,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am not aware of the negotiations with the drivers and Comcar. Now that the member for Perth has alerted me to them, I will make some inquiries. But I remind the member for Perth and the House that through the use of agreements Australians have more jobs and higher wages because of the changes brought about by this government. The reality is that Australians have enjoyed a 14 per cent increase in real wages because of the industrial relations changes that this government put in placethings which the member for Perth, amongst other colleagues on the other side, said would bring about the end of industrial relations as we know it. What he said in 1996 was wrong; what he is saying now will also be wrong. Aviation",90
113,Mr SECKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Would the Deputy Prime Minister update the House on how government policies have contributed to the development and growth of the Australian aviation industry? What further challenges does this industry face?,91
114,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I am delighted to be able to report to the House that there is very clear evidence that the government's aviation policies are working. There is strong growth in both the domestic aviation sector and the international aviation market. The combined domestic and regional aviation industry is operating now at record high levels, with almost 38 million passengers carried during the year ended December 2004. That was an increase of 14 per cent on the previous year. At the same time, passenger traffic on Australian international flights has also grown very strongly. Over the 12 months to December 2004, we saw a record high of 1.93 million passengers internationally-an increase of nearly 10 per cent on December 2003. International activity reached a record high of 10,000 flights in December 2004, which was 16 per cent higher than December 2003 and 48.4 per cent higher than the low recorded in June 2003 when activity was negatively impacted by SARS. The figures are very buoyant and very encouraging. They come off the back of the sharp downturn of two or three years ago, which no-one could have foreseen; but, nonetheless, they are remarkable figures. It is worth bearing in mind-and we must never forget it-that the aviation industry operates in a very volatile climate. It is particularly susceptible to sudden shocks. Unfortunately, the international aviation industry is highly corrupted with many airlines enjoying not only natural geographic advantages over us-that is all strength to their right armbut also the protection of government ownership and support, which we no longer supply and should no longer supply in Australia. I make the point that, while the airlines themselves have to do everything they can to be internationally competitive-and we encourage them in that-there is also a vital need for international reform. There are too many airlines internationally because there are too many governments that prevent sensible rationalisation-a point well made by Rod Eddington recently. He is a well-known and respected Australian who headed up BA for a long time. Unfortunately, our carriers still face unreasonable restrictions on access to other countries. For example, in my view there are still unrealistic and unfair limitations on our access to the important UK market. On the domestic front, it is worth making the point that there are those opposite who would still want to saddle the aviation industry in Australia with the cost of a white elephant-namely, a second airport in Sydney. Mr Murphy-Nonsense!",91
115,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Nonsense. He wants a second airport but cannot justify it. I think it would, by demonstrable indicators, be a white elephant that would cost the aviation industry a lot of money. The fact is that total passenger numbers at Sydney airport have more than recovered, but the number of actual aircraft movements is significantly lower than it was back in 2000.",91
116,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,92
117,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"A lot of policy thought has gone into this by those opposite. You can tell that. They are all over the place. There is a certain sense of aircraft drift here, aviation drift. What has happened is that there has been a rapid move to having fewer aircraft carrying more people-more rapid than anyone might reasonably have foreseen. Indeed, it is worth making the point that the Sydney airport master plan, approved last year, indicated that the airport would be able to cope with Sydney's air traffic needs for at least 20 years. I think that is a very good outcome indeed. Accordingly, I say to the House that the government has formed the view that a second Sydney airport will not be needed in the foreseeable future and, consequently, the government has no plans to impose a white elephant on the aviation industry in Australia. Voluntary Student Unionism",92
118,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Does the Deputy Prime Minister share the belief of many National Party members that the education minister's voluntary student unionism bill will destroy student services at regional university campuses? Will the Deputy Prime Minister support the National Party members and senators by allowing them a free vote on this issue, or will the Deputy Prime Minister bow to the Liberal Party's plan to destroy student services at regional universities?",92
119,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Prime Minister will ignore the last part of that question.,92
120,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for what could be described as a fairly predictable question. The Nationals are completely opposed to compulsory unionism, particularly where those funds are used to support political campaigns and activities. I was at the University of Sydney in 1975 and I remember very well those front lawn activities. You do not forget them, Mr Speaker, so we are pursuing a policy that has long been supported by the party that I have the privilege of leading. If people want to voluntarily join a union, that is entirely their choice. But the changes contained in this legislation will finally offer university students across the country the choice that I think they want and they need. But I would make this point: there has been no greater friend to regional universities than the Howard-Anderson government.",92
121,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The best friend they ever had.,92
122,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The best friend regional education ever had, that's right. Indeed, my colleague the Minister for Education, Science and Training has prevailed over the provision of an extra $140 million in regional loadings for our regional universities. Ms Macklin interjecting",92
123,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member has asked her question.,92
124,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In relation to services, if there are issues there that need to be discussed, the minister will take those forward in a very constructive and cooperative way. Workplace Relations Reform",92
125,Mr SLIPPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Would the minister inform the House how the government is protecting and upholding the rights of employees? Are there any alternative views?,92
126,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Fisher for his question. I can indicate to him and the House that the government's workplace reforms will protect minimum wages, they will protect collective bargaining and, indeed, they will protect the right of individuals to join unions. It is against this backthe ground that we see this continuing misleading campaign from the unions and the ACTU. Just recently they have been joined by some ALP MPs-namely, the member for Canberra; Senator Lundy, the Labor senator for the ACT; and the member for Fraserwho have sent out a letter to residents in the ACT, including a copy of an ACTU brochure which contains a number of misleading and deceptive statements. It appears now that the ACTU's campaign has been extended to using the postal allowance of ALP members to send out this misleading union campaign material. Like other misleading statements that have been made by the unions, this brochure contains further deceptive material. For example, this brochure asserts that minimum wages will be reduced. That is just wrong. It asserts that unions will not be able to access the workplace. Again, this is just wrong. It says the changes that the government proposes will reduce the capacity for collective bargaining. Again, that is simply wrong. So what we now have is ALP members being the mail-out boys and girls for the ACTU scare campaign. It would seem that, in return for the $47 million which the unions have donated to the Australian Labor Party, what they have bought for themselves is a junk mail delivery service, as this letter from the member for Canberra and the member for Fraser indicates. We have had an increasingly desperate campaign from the ACTU as the days have gone on. Yesterday, the Secretary of the ACTU, Greg Combet, said that this government proposed to abolish federal awards. That is what he said-we would get rid of federal awards. That is absolutely wrong. It was made clear in the statement which the Prime Minister made to this parliament, it has been made clear in numerous other statements and it has been made clear in all material which has been sent out that this government proposes to retain federal awards, yet we have this increasingly desperate campaign from the ACTU and Greg Combet, just saying things which are simply misleading and deceptive-a desperate campaign from a desperate union movement. Drugs",92
127,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Can the minister inform the House what, to use his words, the ‘clinically suitable alternative' drug for Alimta, an end-of-the-line treatment for lung cancer, would be? Isn't it true, Minister, that there is no drug on the PBS which has-and once again I use the minister's words-a ‘chemically identical active ingredient' to Alimta, which can only be prescribed when all other treatments have failed? Can the minister explain why people suffering from lung cancer should pay around $500 per treatment for the only drug that can help them?",93
128,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I say to the member for Lalor that, if it is the only drug that can help them, their treating doctor can apply to the HIC for an authorisation and they will get that drug at the standard copayment. Medical Services",93
129,Mr NEVILLE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is also addressed to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Would the minister inform the House how the government is providing country people with better access to medical services?,93
130,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Hinkler for his question. As he knows, as members of this House know, and as the Prime Minister and the state Labor premiers all recently agreed, Australia has a good health system. One of the reasons we have a good health system is that the Howard government does not just talk about Medicare; we invest the real money needed to make a good system better. I can say to the member for Hinkler that we have heeded his message about medical services in the bush. We have listened to people like the member for Hinkler and we are delivering. Under the policies of the Howard government, some 2,000 longserving country doctors are receiving bonus payments of up to $25,000 a year to keep practising in country areas. We have put nurses into 1,100 rural practices and we have got 600 allied health professionals working with country GPs. There are now 11 rural clinical schools, including an excellent rural clinical school run by the University of Queensland in the town of Bundaberg in the electorate of Hinkler. There are 10 university departments of rural health. Twenty five per cent of medical students are required to do at least 50 per cent of their clinical training in country areas, because the more you train them in the bush the more likely they are to stay and practise in the country. Since 2001 there have been 346 additional medical student places at our universities, every single one of them bonded to country practice or practice in areas of work force shortage. Since 2000 there have been three new medical schools in the great state of Queensland, with 150-plus publicly funded places. Can I make it very clear to the member for Hinkler and everyone else in this House: Medicare matters. Medicare matters to the Howard government, and since the election I have answered 37 questions about Medicare from coalition members. I just had my fifth from the member for Lalor. I ask this question: what has the member for Lalor done to upset the Leader of the Opposition so much? What has she done? Let us face it: she is not the only one who leaks out of shadow cabinet. That is what you get from a bunch of dills: leaks out of shadow cabinet. Or it may be that the Leader of the Opposition has got the message that the member for Lalor has not got-that the Howard government is the best friend that Medicare has ever had. Drugs",93
131,Ms CORCORAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Would the Minister explain to the House and to people with epilepsy what-once again to use his words-the ‘chemically identical' generic substitute is for Keppra, a medicine used to treat epilepsy? Minister, isn't it true that there is no clinically suitable alternative to Keppra? Isn't it also true that experts advise that epilepsy patients should not switch medications and that no doctor would substitute Keppra with a chemically different drug?",94
132,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I welcome that question from the member for Isaacs. I respect her interest in the welfare of patients, and I say to her what I said to the member for Lalor: if it is the only drug that is clinically appropriate and if the doctor approaches the Health Insurance Commission for an authorisation then that patient will get the relevant drug at the standard copayment. Indian Ocean Tsunami",94
133,Mrs DRAPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. As we approach the six-month anniversary of the tsunami tragedy, would the minister update the House on how the government has helped populations in affected countries through its emergency assistance?",94
134,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Makin for her question. I appreciate all the work she does and her interest in the way that our support for Indonesia and other countries in response to the tsunami is unfolding. This Sunday marks exactly six months since the tsunami tragedy, and it does provide an opportunity to outline both the timeliness and the effectiveness of the government's response. The government has now spent over $75 million on relief and rehabilitation assistance to help people rebuild their lives as a result of the tsunami. Indonesia, over $40 million has been spent on projects in Aceh and North Sumatra. Over 1,000 tonnes of humanitarian aid to Aceh has been delivered, medical services are being assisted in their re-establishment, essential pharmaceutical supplies have been given, schools have been re-equipped and essential infrastructure, including water and sanitation, has been repaired. And we provided over 100 Australian medical staff to assist. As the emergency assistance phase draws to an end, as it obviously is-and we provided initially $60 million for that, all of which has been spent-and people return to their homes, we are beginning the task of assisting them to meet their longer term needs. In addition to what I have already described, the House well knows that the government has committed a billion dollars to the five-year Australia-Indonesia Partnership for Reconstruction and Development program, and progress on this is already pretty strong. Over $175 million worth of activities has already been agreed, including the $50 million Aceh rehabilitation program. We are helping, for example, with the rehabilitation of the Banda Aceh hospital; we are training doctors and nurses to take the places of some who were killed as a result of the tsunami. In conclusion, there has been some suggestion in one of the newspapers today, the Australian Financial Review, that this program was not unfolding. It is and it is unfolding at a good and effective pace. It would be folly indeed if we tried to spend all of the money at once. That does not just apply to the government but also to the nongovernment organisations which have raised over $300 million. They have spent about 20 per cent of that, but it needs to be spent over a period of time, not spent all at once. This program by both the government and the non-government organisations is progressing In very successfully. I think all Australians will be pleased to hear that, because all Australians have supported the response by both the government and the non-government organisations to the tsunami. Drugs",94
135,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing. I refer the minister to his last two answers and I ask: given the medical evidence about the lack of chemically identical substitute drugs for Alimta for lung cancer and Keppra for epilepsy, is the minister guaranteeing no patient will ever pay more than the standard PBS copayment for these medications?",95
136,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I am not. I am guaranteeing that my previous answer is correct. Literacy and Numeracy",95
137,Mr TICEHURST,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Education, Science and Training. Would the minister inform the House of further progress on the government's efforts to introduce national literacy and numeracy tests and plain English report cards?",95
138,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Dobell for his question. He is working hard to get those toilets fixed at the Tuggerawong Public School in his electorate. As I informed the House last week, the government, before handing over $33 billion of taxpayers' hard earned money for schooling over the next four years, has for the very first time put conditions on the funding. The states, before they receive that money, will be required to agree to a number of things, which include that by 2010 there will finally be a common starting age for schooling in Australia. We will from next year have not only testing of our children in years 3, 5, 7 and 9 in literacy and numeracy but reporting to parents. Principals will have a say over who actually teaches in the school. The performance of the school must be published at the school level. In other words, parents have a right to know how many students are passing literacy and numeracy in years 3, 5 and 7. They have a right to know the qualifications of the ers, the participation of teachers in their going professional learning and how much money governments spend on the support of teachers at the school level. One of the other requirements is career leaver destinations: how many kids got apprenticeships, how many went to TAFE, how many got a job and how many went to uni. That information needs to be published. Another requirement, which is long past due, is that of plain language reports to parents. As parents, we are sick and tired of getting politically correct language neutered reports at home about our kids. If you are told that your child is almost achieving, what does that mean? If you are told that your child is consolidating or performing sometimes or not yet performing, what does that mean? We have only one state government left to sign this agreement, and that is the Victorian ernment. The Victorian government has eight days to sign up before it will lose more than $1 billion in funding for schools. The plain English report cards will describe student performance as A, B, C, D or E. As parents, we know what A, B, C, D and E mean. They will also be required to tell parents which quartile, which 25 per cent, of the class their child falls in. So, taking the typical Australian primary school report which has gone to the states, for example looking at mathematics, the student will be graded A to E. So, for example, with a D in mathematics, Mr Speaker, you would know exactly what that meant if your child came home with that or was in the bottom 25 per cent. Then the teacher is required to explain in plain language what it means. So the grades are from A to E and then the parents must be told in which quartile of the class their child falls. If your child is in the bottom 25 per cent-somebody has to be there-you would want to know about it. For example, the report might say: ‘Wayne is trying hard teach- in maths and attempting his homework. onHowever, he is not doing as well as last year and I would like to discuss further work he could do at home. Please contact me.' This is what parents are going to get over the next 12 months. Plain language reporting is a condition of funding, and I table an example of a plain language report. Drugs",95
139,Mr BYRNE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Isn't it a fact that, when interviewed on radio on 25 January this year, in answer to a question about whether the prices of branded medicines would go up for patients as a result of the Howard government's 12.5 per cent price cut policy, the minister said: The idea that the price of drugs is going to go up because of a 12.5 per cent price cut for generics is just wrong. gov- Minister, isn't this statement untrue?",96
140,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I make two points. First of all, I say to the member for Holt that any patient whose doctor believes that a particular drug is clinically necessary can, by way of an approach to the HIC and an authorisation from the HIC, ensure that that patient gets the drug at the standard copayment. That is the first point I make. The second point I make is that we the government stand by our policy of a 12½ per cent mandatory price cut for new generic drugs coming onto the PBS. This is a good policy. Ms Gillard interjecting",96

143,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Lalor!,97
144,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is a good policy because we need to make more use of generic drugs and we need to deliver a better deal for the taxpayers of Australia. This is a government which is quite prepared to consider two objectives at once and which is quite capable of it. We are quite capable of both delivering the necessary drugs to the patients of Australia and protecting the interests of taxpayers-unlike members opposite, who are capable of nothing but irresponsible scaremongering.

146,Mr SCHULTZ,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will just take a moment to focus, Mr Speaker, so that I do not mess up like yesterday. My question is addressed to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Would the minister update the House on recent developments with the government's increased assistance to Australia's drought ravaged farmers.",97
147,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Hume for his question. He represents some of the worse drought affected farmers in New South Wales and he has been a strong advocate, providing timely and effective assistance to the farmers in his region. The member for Hume will welcome the good news that yesterday the Farm Household Support Amendment (Exceptional Circumstances Relief Payment) Bill 2005 passed through the Senate. That means that all of the elements of the government's enhanced drought assistance package can now be implemented on time and in full. The legislation means that there will now be a $10,000 concession on off-farm income in assessing the eligibility of farmers in drought stricken areas for the exceptional circumstances relief payment. That will mean that a lot more farmers will be eligible to receive this essential help for them and their families. Other parts of the package include the more generous EC interest rate subsidiesup to 80 per cent in second and subsequent years of a drought-and the easier off-farm assets test associated with those benefits. Additional counselling and support services are being put in place. The new drought Envirofund round will be called very soon. And yesterday the Prime Minister and I were happy to ceremonially hand over a cheque for $3 million to the CWA so that they are able to commence their role in providing additional assistance to farmers and their families who are especially in need. Last week I provided to the state rural adjustment authorities revised guidelines for the implementation of the interest rate subsidies, which again will mean that more assistance will be available and that it will be provided under more generous terms than has been the case in the past. These benefits will certainly be encouraging to farmers facing the difficulties of drought. There is no doubt at all that the Howard-Anderson government has been the best friend that drought affected farmers have ever had. I guess there is only one thing better that we could deliver, and that is rain right across the nation. We have made a reasonable start on that, although I know we had a bit of assistance from above. There is one thing better than drought assistance that farmers can get, and that of course is rain across the country. I am encouraged by recent falls but, as the honourable member for Hume knows, there is going to have to be a continuation of this improved weather for some time before the drought is broken. In the interim, this government will stand beside farmers so that they are able to take advantage of better circumstances when they come.",97
148,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Minister, isn't it a fact that the expensive new drugs used to treat osteoporosis-drugs which cost the PBS $130 million a year-are effective only if taken together with calcium tablets, which have now been removed from the PBS to save about $9 million a year? Isn't it also a fact that some patients with kidney problems may need to take as many as 10 calcium tablets a day, at a cost of over $30 a month? Given these facts, why did the government take calcium tablets off the PBS, particularly without getting any advice from the experts, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee?",98
149,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me make two points in response to the member for Lalor. The first point I make is that once upon a time there were responsible members of the Labor Party. Let me quote: ... the community as a whole can ill-afford the situation where large quantities of these medicines are dispensed on medical prescriptions when they are readily available over the counter ... That is a very true statement-not from me, not from the Treasurer or the Prime Minister; it was from Dr Neal Blewett, the Labor minister for health, when the former Labor government took a large number of over-thecounter medicines off the PBS. That is the first point I make. The second point I make is that the government has recently received advice from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee on this matter, and we are taking it seriously. Superannuation",98
150,Mr CAMERON THOMPSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer. Would the minister advise the House on progress in giving choice in superannuation to Australian Drugs workers. Are there any barriers to greater choice?,98
151,Mr BROUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Blair for his question and his interest in superannuation and the workers of Australia. On 1 July this year, in just nine days time, some five million Australian workers, for the very first time, will get the choice of determining where their investment, their superannuation, is to be invested. This is something that the coalition has been fighting for since 25 May 1995, when it was first announced as coalition policy. In November that year, the then shadow Treasurer, now the Treasurer, told the ASFA conference exactly what the coalition intended to do with choice and how we were going to empower Australian workers. We took it to the Australian public in 1996 and won an overwhelming mandate. Here we are, nine years later, with nine days to go before finally Australian workers will be able to choose where their money is invested. It certainly has been a marathon. To people listening, to the Australian workers out there, it must seem incredible to believe that the Labor Party is still seeking to obstruct the introduction of super choice. There is just one sitting day left in the Senate and the Labor Party is yet to support the government in passing the final superannuation choice legislation. That is creating confusion for small business and unnecessary uncertainty just because the Labor Party refuses to make a decision. People need to understand what it is that we are trying to achieve. For nine years the coalition have been fighting to give workers the right to be able to choose where their money is invested-not so some union through a union backed award agreement decides where your money goes, not so an employer decides where you should put your money, but so you as the worker who has earned that money decides where it goes. If an employee moves jobs they are required to set up another fund in many cases and have another set of fees. The Labor Party seems to think that is all right in 2005. That is the status quo that the Labor Party wants to maintain. Ms Macklin interjecting",98
152,Mr BROUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I hear the member for Jagajaga interject. In the same way, the member for Watson yesterday tried to tell the House that employers would face jail terms. I would like to tell the member for Brand, who is a Western Australian member-it may come as some surprise to him-that Western Australian employees have had the right to choose where they put their superannuation investments since 1998. I did not see at the last state election the Labor Party in Western Australia trying to remove that right. In fact, the very charge that was levelled in this place yesterday was that employers would go to jail. How many people have gone to jail? How many people have ASIC thrown the book at in Western Australia, where they have had the right of choice since 1998? One hundred? Ten? Zero. It is another lousy scare campaign and last-ditch attempt by the Labor Party to try to roll back choice. It is not going to happen. I read in the Financial Review today that the Labor Party will release its own super plan closer to the next federal election in 2007. I implore the Labor Party to make a decision today-not in 2007, not 12 years after we put choice into this place, but today-and once and for all support super choice in the Senate. Let Australian workers have the choice to determine where their biggest investment for their retirementtheir superannuation-should be.",99
153,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: NA Credit Card Security",99
154,Mr COSTELLO,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS," Mr Speaker, I seek the indulgence of the chair to add to an answer.",99
155,The SPEAKER,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,The minister may proceed.,99
156,Mr COSTELLO,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,"It has been reported that there was a security breach in an Arizona based credit card transaction processing company. The vast majority of cards vulnerable to the breach are held by US customers. Of the MasterCards affected it is thought that less than two per cent were issued by banks in the Australia-Pacific region. The following information comes from Visa. Visa has informed the Treasury that it was the National Australia Bank that uncovered this fraud out of all the domestic and international banks of the world and reported it to MasterCard and Visa in September 2004. The FBI was notified and commenced an extensive investigation and on 1 June 2005 declared it a crime scene. During this investigation organisations were told by the FBI not to say anything publicly and the FBI only allowed public comment on Thursday or Friday of last week. I am told by Senator Ellison that he was aware of the matter when it was reported in newspapers in Australia, as was I, which was some time this week. Mr Fitzgibbon-What about the department?",99
157,Mr COSTELLO,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,You want answers; I am giving them. You ask when the government was aware. I am telling you that I was aware when it was in newspapers and I am told-I would not know myself-that Senator Ellison became aware of it when it was published in newspapers this week. The electronic funds transfer code of conduct administered by ASIC protects account holders from liability in respect of unauthorised transactions where they have not contributed to the loss. Visa and MasterCard have similar internal rules. The government encourages all credit card users to review their statements on a regular basis and report any suspicious transaction to their financial institution. Australian banksand they have done this publicly-are urging credit card customers who have travelled to the United States or used their cards to buy goods from a US based online merchant to check their statements and report any unauthorised transactions to their financial institution. I again state that this was believed to be a breach of security in Arizona in the United States. NA Parliamentary Committee Reports: Government Responses,99
158,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, with regard to recent press reports concerning the very large number of House of Representatives committee reports and joint committee reports that government ministers have failed to respond to, will you agree to write on behalf of this House to the responsible minister in each case to seek advice as to when a response will be forthcoming and the reasons for any further delay? I understand a report to the House on the status of all outstanding government responses to committee reports is due to be presented tomorrow by you. I think it is important that steps are taken by you to: ... reassert and re-establish a degree of respect regard for the institution. They are words used by this Prime Minister on the election of the Speaker on 30 April 1996 and, sadly, not acted upon by his ministers.",100
159,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I thank the member for Banks. As he has rightly pointed out, tomorrow I will be providing a status report to the House on responses to committee reports. I intend to make a few further comments at that point. QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: NA Comcar: Employees",100
160,Mr ANDREWS,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,"Menzies-Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (2.59 pm)- Mr Speaker, I seek the indulgence of the chair to add to an answer.",100
161,The SPEAKER,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,The minister may proceed.,100
162,Mr ANDREWS,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,"I was asked a question by the member for Perth about some negotiations between the department of finance, as it is, and Comcar over their collective arrangements. I am advised that the department of finance met with the two relevant unions, the TWU and the CPSU, on 2 June to discuss negotiations of a section LJ collective agreement-that is, one with the unions-and that in the course of those discussions the department of finance gave the unions a list of 10 possible productivity measures that could offset any pay increases that the unions may seek in the negotiations. It is therefore wrong to assert that we were stripping entitlements. The 10 proposals, I am advised, are purely options for the unions to consider and are completely dependent on the size of any wage increase sought by the employees. It is open to the unions, as is usual, to accept or and reject some or none or all of the optionsthey are not final. Indeed, the department of finance has sought for three weeks to arrange a meeting with the unions to get a response to the proposals made at the earlier meeting, on 2 June, and the unions only agreed yesterday to meet on 28 June. This is a beat-up by the Labor Party to portray negotiations as though they were outcomes and to scaremonger about productivity improvements in the absence of referring to any offsetting pay increases.

175,The SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received letters from the honourable member for Lalor and the honourable member for Wentworth proposing that definite matters of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion today. As required by standing order 46(d), I have selected the matter which, in my opinion, is the most urgent and important; that is, that proposed by the honourable member for Lalor, namely: The Government's failure to be accountable for its ongoing mismanagement of Australia's health system I therefore call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",101
176,Ms GILLARD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That was a very wise selection indeed, Mr Speaker; thank you very much. There is a brand of politics that causes more disgust towards politicians and governments than any other. Many people in this parliament were fans of the American television show The West Wing in which the press secretaries would gather on a Friday afternoon and talk about ‘putting out the trash'. What they meant by ‘putting out the trash' was that they would put out the bad stories on Friday night-put them out deliberately too late for Saturday's newspapers but by Sunday's newspapers they were too old. That was how they would clear out the stories they did not want anybody to know about. It is clever, it is tricky and it is that brand of politics that causes the community to reel back in horror. Unfortunately, it is a brand of politics in which the Minister for Health and Ageing fundamentally believes, because it is that kind of trickiness that has actually characterised his interaction with the public across the sweep of his public life. This is the minister who in 1998 denied any involvement in the Australians for Honest Politics slush fund, only to be caught out spectacularly on TV on 27 August 2003 on the 7.30 Report. This is the minister who got caught out so amazingly on Lateline denying and then confessing in the one interview that he had met with Cardinal George Pell. This is the minister who went out and gave the community a rock solid, ironclad guarantee before the election, with every ounce of his credibility and every fibre of his being in that guarantee-with his word, his honour and his integrity on the line in that rock solid, ironclad guarantee-only to smash it immediately after the election. This is the minister who practises that sort of mean, tricky politics by doing things like putting out the private health insurance premium increase notifications on the same day that interest rates go up, hoping against hope that one storythe big interest rates story-would come over the top and exclude from the public glare the story about the mismanagement by the Howard government of private health insurance premium increases. Last Wednesday we saw the minister back at it again when at 6.30 that night-when, as Leader of the House, he would have known that Douglas Wood had been released and that all of the nation was going to be rejoicing that Douglas Wood had been released and was going to be returned home safethere was the minister sneaking out under the radar, hoping no-one would notice the fact that he is turning our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme into a two-tiered system. There is a reason I started with an allusion to The West Wing. I did so because this is the Americanisation of our health system-the creation of a two-tiered system for pharmaceuticals. Perhaps the Australian community would forgive Minister Abbott his meanness, his trickiness, his bit of manipulation here and slipping out of a press release there and his not-quite-frank statement on TV-maybe they would forgive him those things-if they thought he was competently running our health system. In fact, Minister Abbott is either nowhere near our health system or near those bits that are a complete shambles. Let us look across the sweep of the Howard government. Who is looking after the biggest issue when it comes to the health sector's medical work force? The Treasurer is-that is who is looking after that. Who is looking after reviewing the PBS? The Treasurer is, and, when the minister for health was asked, he did not even know about the review. Take a huge issue like mental health. Who is looking after that? The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing, who is leaving the chamber now. Take something as important to the future of medical science as the stem cell review. Who is looking after that? The Minister for Ageing is. Then of course there is the question of the sale of Australia's biggest private health insurer, Medibank Private-government owned at the moment-that most Australians rely on for their private health insurance products. Who is looking after the sale of that? Senator Nick Minchin, as Minister for Finance and Administration, is. And when asked about the scoping study for the sale of Medibank Private, the minister for health did not even know anything about it. So all of these enormous health issues are being dealt with elsewhere in the Howard government. One might imagine that his closest colleagues know something about his competence that they do not let the rest of the Australian community into. When you look at the things that the minister for health is ally managing, you see they are a shambles all round. I am going to go out and buy a Tattslotto ticket on the strength of the fact that I put in this MPI before the most recent shambles in health even emerged in the public domain. But it has emerged today with the Pharmacy Guild basically putting up their hands and saying: ‘We want to deliver medicines at a reasonable price to Australian consumers. We would like the Prime Minister to honour his word, the word he gave us when he wrote to us on his letterhead'-a prime ministerial letter on prime ministerial letterhead, and John Howard's signature down the bottom, which is something you would think would actually count a little bit. ‘We would like the Prime Minister to honour his word to pharmacists. We are trying to negotiate a new five-year agreement with the minister for health and we just can't do it because the minister for health cannot competently conclude these negotiations.' That is the most recent shambles in health, which emerged today in between me putting in this topic for the matters of public importance debate and the debate actually coming on before the parliament. The pharmacy agreement-a five-year agreement about the delivery of pharmaceutical products and medicines across Australia at reasonable pricesis expiring on 30 June. And this minister, who knew that it was expiring on 30 Junebecause everybody knew that was the end date-and who has had every day since he first became minister for health on 29 September 2003 to competently conclude a new agreement with the pharmacists, has been unable to do so, jeopardising Australians' access to pharmaceutical products after 30 June this year. Everything he has ever touched in health has become a shambles. But the very particular matters I questioned the minister about today show that the very thing he slipped out last Wednesday, actuhoping no-one would notice-this new twotiered structure for the PBS-is, as of today, in a shambles too. Let us talk about this in some level of detail. What has happened here is that in the federal election campaign, after the Prime Minister had gone out on the Sunday, done his campaign launch speech and spent billions and billions of dollars with not one dollar specifically directed at older Australians, by the Monday and Tuesday in the second to last week of the campaign the headlines and the newscasts were all saying that there was an adverse community reaction to Prime Minister Howard's freespending policy announcement speech. On the Wednesday we had the Labor launch and it contained a very big policy for older Australians-Medicare Gold. By the Friday the Howard government, which had obviously wanted to coast through the election campaign not saying a word about older Australians because they were taking their votes for granted, thought they had better respond. But they knew they had spent too much money. What were they going to do faced with this conundrum: they needed a policy for older Australians but had spent too much money? ‘Oh,' they go, ‘we need a savings measure. Where are we going to get a savings measure from across the whole sweep of government? Where are we going to make a cut when we are desperate? I know-the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.' They had a small problem: they had spent two years corresponding with Labor denying savings could be made on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme-denying such savings were possible. But let me tell you: while they bleat about the Charter of Budget Honesty process as it applies to the opposition, they never apply anything that sounds like the same discipline to themselves-never once, not ever. So, with complete disregard of anything like transparency in fiscal policy, quick 48-hour cycle, they cobbled together a cut on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. It is very important to remember that the money generated from this cut was not going to go to PBS sustainability; it was not even going to go to the Health portfolio. It was going out of Health to other portfolios to fund an older Australians policy that they cobbled together at the last minute. The Department of Health and Ageing has admitted at Senate estimates that it had nothing to do with the costing of this savings measure. Why should that surprise us? Mr Abbott-It was in the caretaker period.",102
177,Ms GILLARD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"If it was a responsible measure, you would have been working on it before the caretaker period, my friend. Putting that to one side, why should it surprise us that the Minister for Health and Ageing did not know anything about this savings measure? It would not surprise us at all because, on his own admission, at a press conference he said he is ‘not very good with figures'. For a minister with a multibillion dollar spending portfolio, his depth of knowledge about expenditure in health is limited to the statement, ‘Peter will provide; he always does'-a reference to the Treasurer. The minister's intellectual hold on the financing of the single biggest expenditure area of the Commonwealth government-his complete encapsulation of this challenge for modern Western democracies where inflation and balancing the health account keep public policy specialists and academics fully engaged-is ‘Peter will provide; he always does.' The problem is that Peter has a tendency to provide six months before an election and a very startling tendency to cut back six months afterwards. When Peter could have salvaged",104
178,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member Lalor will use the member's correct name. Mr Crean-She is quoting him.,104
179,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Member for Hotham, the chair does not need any help. Mr Crean interjecting",104
180,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The chair can also remember the standing ordersespecially 94(a). Mr Crean interjecting,104
181,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I will be speaking to you.,104
182,Ms GILLARD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is a direct quote as to how the Minister for Health and Ageing refers to the Treasurer. The Treasurer is known to refer to me by unusual titles, but I will respect your ruling, Mr Deputy Speaker. The problem for the Minister for Health and Ageing is that the Treasurer provides in the runup to elections, but he does not provide afterwards. The Treasurer could have salvaged this minister's future and credibility and allowed him to keep his rock solid, ironclad guarantee to the Australian public for an expenditure of $200 million-the difference between the Charter of Budget Honesty figure of $1.3 billion and the $1.5 billion the Treasurer said he had to cut back. He decided not to do that. Peter does not always provide, does he? Let us come to the details of the savings measure this government cobbled together during the election campaign and the consequence it has had. The government want to cut the price of generics by 12½ per cent. That is not a bad thing, but because it is badly designed policy it has a lot of knockon consequences for newly listed, innovative drugs. The minister has no hold on the interconnection between these two things. He wanders around saying, ‘It all doesn't matter because I know my policy has caused four drug companies-and four drugs-to say that they will not accept the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme listed price. I know that means that patients will have to pay a contribution, but it does not matter because there are chemically equivalent drugs available on the PBS.' Wrong, Minister: there is no chemically equivalent drug to eclipta, which is taken for lung cancer; there is no chemically equivalent drug to keppra, which is taken for epilepsy. Doctors say you cannot substitute. The Minister for Health and Ageing comes into this place and says, ‘If you can't substitute, then you can have it at the PBS price.' My question to you, Minister, is: what is this special patient contribution which announced ever going to do for these two drugs? If there is no chemical substitute, if every patient who is taking that drug needs only that drug and you say they do not have to pay the special patient contribution, that means that no-one will ever pay the special patient contribution, but you cannot have it both ways. You should get up to the dispatch box and say that you announced a mythical policy last Wednesday and that no-one will ever pay the special patient contribution, or you should say that in truth you know some people who need that drug and will pay the special patient contribution despite all of your words of comfort and guarantees. There are only two possibilities, there is no third choice: patients are going to end up paying that special patient contribution, even though it is the only drug they can take, or your special patient contribution is a myth and you can guarantee that no-one will ever have to pay it. But I know what is going to happen: people with lung cancer who cannot take any other medication will have to pay $500 out of their pocket. That is a disgrace equal to where we started this session with you breaking your rock solid ironclad guarantee. It is an absolute disgrace. (Time expired)",104
183,Mr ABBOTT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,So much special bitterness and bile in one person! Mr Crean-What about yourself?,105
184,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Hotham is on thin ice. Ms Gillard interjecting,105
185,Mr ABBOTT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I wish the Australian people could see that. That would be interesting. Today, the member for Lalor has made a rare prime time appearance. The incredible, disappearing shadow minister for health has, advisedly, been kept under wraps for the last you six months by the Leader of the Opposition. Mr Crean-Where have you been?",105
186,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Hotham will remove himself from the House understanding order 94(a). The member for Hotham then left the chamber.,105
187,Mr ABBOTT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Until today, all she has been allowed has been four questions. In the face of what she keeps saying is a collapsing health system, chronic incompetence and maladministration, the Leader of the Opposition has allowed her just four questions until today. She got three questions today. Good on her! Obviously, the little touch-up that she got yesterday has worked.",105
188,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The minister will refer to the member by her seat or title.,106
189,Mr ABBOTT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am delighted to think that I still have the capacity to get under her skin. This bile, this anger transference from the Leader of the Opposition-who has advisedly kept her under wraps for the last six months-is quite unbecoming and demeans her. It certainly does not enhance the standards of this House. If our health system is the disaster that the member for Lalor keeps telling us it is then why, when the Leader of the Opposition went out yesterday to reverse his collapsing poll standings and revive the spirit of his demoralised troops, did he nominate three areas he was going to focus on for the rest of this term? He was not going to be distracted by the concerns of voters, he was not going to have anything to do with suggestions that his front-bench are a bunch of dills-oh no, they are all brilliant, as has been demonstrated time after time in question time over the last 10 days-and the three areas they are going to focus on are Telstra, IR and debt. Where is health? Ms Gillard interjecting",106
190,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Lalor is in a difficult position. She has been warned.,106
191,Mr ABBOTT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The Leader of the Opposition either does not think that health is very important or, more likely, he does not like his shadow health minister and does not trust her competence to deliver a substantial message. I was quite interested to hear on Sky News on Monday, 13 June the opposition signalling that it wants to shift the focus to health and land some blows on Minister Tony Abbott. I was quivering with fear and apprehension! I was so nervous I could hardly eat my cornflakes on Tuesday morning! I had to wait all this time to have three or four questions, which are all essentially the same, to which there is a clear answer. Since the member for Lalor made her announcement on Sky News, we have had four press releases and four doorstops but, until today, not a single question on health. We constantly get from the member for Lalor a string of hysterical press releases and a succession of shrill doorstops saying that the sky is falling in and we will all be destroyed because of the evil of the Howard government. Obviously I do not believe her, because I am presiding over the health system. The Australian public do not believe her. According to Newspoll, more and more Australians believe that the Howard government is best placed to handle the issues of health and Medicare. The Leader of the Opposition does not believe the member for Lalor. If he did, he would give her more questions in question time. When the Leader of the Opposition took office, he was asked: Have you given thought to how Labor will change its approach, will need to change its approach to meet that challenge in the Reps? The Leader of the Opposition replied: Yes, I have and totally new significance will come around our tactics committee in the House of Representatives and the role that Julia Gillard plays … A lot of new significance has come in: she now has almost no role! Under the former Leader of the Opposition, the member for Lalor would do a doorstop every day and then ask a question in the House of Representatives. Under the current Leader of the Opposition, she does the doorstop every day-the same shrill, hysterical attacks on the Howard government-but almost never asks a question. It is not just that I do not believe her, it is not just that the Australian public does not believe her and it is not just that her own leader does not believe her; it is that the premiers do not believe her. If the health system were as chronically mismanaged as the member for Lalor keeps telling us, why is it that the premiers and the Prime Minister said in the communique that came out of COAG last week that Australia has one of the world's best health systems? How can it be one of the world's best health systems if, in the words of the member for Lalor, it is suffering from ‘ongoing mismanagement'? The member for Lalor is on her own. She is isolated among her colleagues, unpopular with the Leader of the Opposition and scorned by the premier-those successful and responsible Labor politicians. She is on her own. Let me take a few moments of the House's time to talk about some of the precise issues that the member for Lalor has raised. She says that I denied involvement in the Australians for Honest Politics Trust. I ask: what has that got to do with health? I have never denied involvement in the Australians for Honest Politics Trust. For the record, let me say that I have never denied that. If the member for Lalor is going to come into this House and make statements, as a former partner in a law firm she should at least get right, tell the truth. I think she is suffering from TDD-truth deficit disorder! The next statement she made was that I denied a meeting with Cardinal Pell. Ms Gillard-That is true. I have got the videotape!",106
192,Mr ABBOTT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I did not deny a meeting with Cardinal Pell. I said, when asked, that I had no recollection of a meeting. The member for Lalor then said that we had denied that savings were possible in the PBS. Again, that is not true. What we saidMs Gillard-Well, get your letter out!",107
193,Mr ABBOTT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,This caterwauling is unbecoming of the House. This shadow minister will treat other members of this House with the same courtesy she received when she made her contribution earlier.,107
194,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The chair will ensure that, Minister.",107
195,Mr ABBOTT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am sure you will, Mr Deputy Speaker. The member for Lalor said we had denied that savings were possible in the PBS. That is not true. We said that savings could not be included in the forward estimates if they were merely speculative or hypothetical; in order to be included in the forward estimates they had to be the result of a change in government policy. When she finally dropped the personal abuse and the litany of untruths and tried to talk about health, she came up with two criticisms. The first criticism was that the 12½ per cent mandatory price cut policy means that patients will allegedly have to pay hundreds of dollars more for necessary drugs. I have already said this several times in the House today, but let me say it again for ‘Madam Slow Learner': if it is clinically necessary in the opinion of the treating doctor that a patient should get a particular drug, all the doctor needs to do is seek an authorisation from the Health Insurance Commission and that it drug will be available to that person at the standard copayment. Please, let us not hear any more of this furphy, this scare tactic. Let us have the member for Lalor tell the truth for once and properly describe the policy of the government as I have repeatedly explained it today. Her next statement about health was that negotiations with the Pharmacy Guild were not going particularly well. Has the member for Lalor ever had negotiations with the Pharmacy Guild? What is the proposal of the member for Lalor? How does the member for Lalor imagine that we are going to get savings out of the PBS through the use of generics? How does the member for Lalor imagine that we are going to get savings out of the PBS through more effective management of the supply and distribution chain? It behoves responsible politicians not just to come in here like Chicken Little and cry day in, day out that the sky is falling in but to come up with some policies of their own. The current Australian Labor Party has two policies. The first policy is Medicare Gold. That policy was described by Michael Costello, the former Chief of Staff to the Leader of the Opposition, as a strategic disaster. It was described by Peter Botsman, a genuine Labor intellectualMr Laurie Ferguson interjecting",107
196,Mr ABBOTT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I note the laughter and the scorn coming from the member opposite-as a policy that had the body of a wombat and the head of a donkey. It was described by former President of the Australian Labor Party, former respected member of this House and former minister in the Hawke government, Barry Jones, as a turkey. This is policy No. 1: Medicare Gold-a strategic disaster, a turkey with the body of a wombat and the head of a donkey. What a monster! But it is the conception of the member for Lalor. The other policy of the member for Lalor is to totally abolish the Howard government's Medicare safety net. The member for Lalor comes into this House regularlywhen she is allowed. It is not normally in prime time, but it is in the adjournment and grievance debates and in debates on second reading speeches. She comes in and talks about how terrible it is that the thresholds of the Medicare safety net have been adjusted by the Howard government to what we originally proposed. This terrible crime is that we now have the same safety net thresholds that we originally proposed in November 2003. With all these buckets of crocodile tears, the gallons of indignation and the selfrighteousness dripping out of every pore, what would she do to the threshold? She would abolish it altogether. There would be no safety net. There would be 1.6 million Australians who would totally miss out on the additional help from Medicare that they need and deserve, and $1.1 billion would be ripped out of the Medicare budget because these people are Medicare vandals. That is what members opposite are. That is what they would do if they got the chance. I really do invite interested members of the general public who do take health seriously, who might be following the discussion here this afternoon and who want to figure out who is serious about health, to look at the work of the Howard government: look at the $11 billion more that we have invested since October 2003 in the forward estimates for the Health and Ageing Portfolio; look at the fact that we have got bulk-billing rates up from 66 per cent to 73 per cent; look at the fact that bulk-billing rates for kids are now at an all-time high; and look at the fact that we have settled down the crisis that was enveloping our public hospital system. Compare that with the web site of the Australian Labor Party. These people, who think that health is so important, have devoted just 323 words to health. It is pathetic. It is a disgrace. It is a comment on the fact that the member for Lalor has no standing with her own leader, no standing with her own party and increasingly less standing with the general public that she is forced to come into this House and make the kind of shrill, hysterical and false attacks that we have seen today.",108
197,Mr BYRNE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"On reflecting on that very passionate contribution by my friend the Minister for Health and Ageing, Tony Abbott, I was very concerned that he was talking about messages of hate, messages not benefiting his career. What I would like to do in light of the blow that he suffered at the hands of the Treasurer, the mentor of the member for Casey, that savage blow trying to destroy his good career, is give him some advice in the spirit of love and friendship with respect to where he is going wrong with the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and the changes that he has proposed. Please read the Hansard, Minister, because I am concerned about your career. I am going to try to put it back on would but take notice of the very constructive suggestions that the opposition will make. My good friend the Minister for Health and Ageing has left the chamber, but at least you can report back to your mentor, member for Casey, now that the minister has gone. You always worry in politics when an announcement that tastes like a specific sort of sandwich and is a specific sort of sandwich gets delivered when you are least likely to see it, particularly at a time of national rebution (SPC). joicing. I have seen some pretty underhandedMs George-Sneaky.",108
198,Mr BYRNE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"sneaky, mean and tricky press releases put out in the timing of them. Few would match this press release put out just after 6.30 pm, when the nation was rejoicing, under the cover of darkness. I think the minister has got a good career in the SAS after this, quite frankly. He has done an traordinary thing under the cover of darkness that would make the SAS proud. This press release should be of great cern to the least advantaged in our community, who have borne the brunt of a lot of Howard government reforms. It is a very innocuous press release, but it is the hole the dyke. That is what it is and, contrary to what the minister for health has actually said, I think the shadow minister for health is making a very constructive suggestion. As we know, in a number of his public statements the minister for health was quite clear. When he was negotiating that 12.5 per cent cut in prices for generic medicines on the PBS, he said, ‘There won't be any more price rises.' Something happened on the road to Damascus, because very shortly after he said that he issued a very innocuous press release. I am trying to help the minister for health, so I will read some of his press retrack if you lease into the record: The Government is now in the process of implementing 12.5 per cent price cuts for 10 brands of PBS medicines where generic equivalents have applied for listing on August 1. Unfortunately, four companies have not agreed to accept lower prices. As a result four brands of medicines listed on the PBS will be subject to a Special Patient Contribution in addition to the normal PBS co-payment. For these medicines the difference between the existing price for the drug and the new benchmark price will become a Special Patient ContriDr Emerson interjecting",109
199,Mr BYRNE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I know that this government has taken ‘user pays' to a new level, but this is a very Orwellian-I thank the member for Rankin for saying it as it is-use of language. This is the government that basically said that the Medicare safety net was going to be set at a level and it has increased. This is the government that tells people who have ex- paid their taxes that they should be paying more to see their doctor. Now we have the government basically saying to people, ‘We conscrewed the negotiations with the pharmaceutical companies and now we are going to the screw you by passing this on.' It would be bad enough if these were well-off people or in people who did not necessarily need these drugs, but try telling someone with mesothelioma that they need to pay $460 to get their medication. It is interesting-as in my view this is a hole in the wall. Let us look at some of the antipsychotic drugs, because one of the pharmaceutical companies that refused to accept that 12.5 per cent cut was a company that dealt in antipsychotic and antidepressant medication. The problem is that there are a number of new generation drugs coming on stream which are quite expensive. What will happen, for example, when you have someone with schizophrenia who requires risperidone, which costs $423.96 for 25 milligrams and $632 for 375 milligrams, and this patient needs to have an injection every two weeks? As they are about to receive the injection, will they be asked: ‘Sorry, I've just got to check. Can you pay the difference before we administer this?' This leads to my broader concern with respect to the health minister-a concern that has been constructively raised by the shadow minister for health: there are very scant tails about this policy and the mechanisms and process under which it will operate. No official figures have been released, such as how many people are going to have to access this. What about the number of people who are going to be affected and what is going to happen with the Health Insurance Commission? Very interestingly, who did the health minister consult with before he announced these changes through this press release? I am afraid I cannot find any record, and I have checked with the shadow minister for health about whether or not the health minister has consulted with the Australian Medical Association. If you had brought in a change with substantial ramifications for the future of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, wouldn't you consult with the AMA before you put out a press release? No consultation occurred. That tells me that there is something very rotten in the state of Denmark I said, when it comes to this proposition. In fact, according to the Sydney Morning Herald, the new President of the AMA, Mukesh Haikerwal, said that the new measure was ‘a chink in the armour of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme'. The report stated that, according to Dr Haikerwal: Although doctors would have to play a pivotal role in declaring where patients should be exempt from the additional cost, the medical profession had not been consulted about the move. What sort of change is this? We in the electorate of Holt are used to some funny things happening, I tell you. Mr Anthony Smith-I bet they are with you as their member!",109
200,Mr BYRNE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"As the member for Casey would know, when we were lobbying for a Medicare office-and my good friend the health minister did in fact come and open it-it took 10 years and a petition with 22,000 signatures to get it. This was the largde- est shopping centre in the Southern Hemisphere and it did not have a Medicare office. It took 10 years and 22,000 signatures. In Cranbourne, where the government has funded a new Medicare office, it took 10 years and 4,500 signatures. So the message is: you pay your taxes in the south-east but you basically have to get a sledgehammer for the government to deliver a service. What do these changes mean to the least well-off, to those with psychotic disorders, to those many Australians who rely on antidepressants and to those dying of lung cancer? The health minister has not made a statement in this place-unless the shadow minister for health has not told me; I certainly have not heard anything. He has done this by stealth. He has slipped a substantial change into the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme under the door while the Prime Minister was addressing this House on a matter of national importance. It is not just us who believe this. I have quoted the President of the AMA, Mukesh Haikerwal. There is a very appropriate headline to an article written about this by Annabel Stafford in the Australian Financial Review. It sort of summarises the minister for health's approach to life. The headline is ‘This is going to hurt'. I think that is very appropriate. It is not just the opposition being critical. For the member for Casey's edification, I quote from the article: Health experts ... have slammed the government's plans to make patients pay for drugs on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, saying it's a dismantling of the cheap medicines scheme by stealth. Someone who I think would be of great importance to the minister for health is the Chief Executive Officer of Catholic Health Australia, Francis Sullivan. I would hope that the minister for health would take notice of him, given his very strong faith. Mr Sullivan said this about these changes: We should make no mistake that these measures, along with the recent cuts to the PBS [safety indicate that the government is looking at every opportunity to shift costs to patients and this in turn erodes any benefit low-paid people receive from the tax relief. So a good friend of the minister for health, the Chief Executive Officer of Catholic Health Australia, Francis Sullivan, has belled the cat-the health minister is not present in the chamber-so it is not just us who are belling the cat on this issue. This is a serious breach in relation to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. When we tried to have a debate on this, it was gagged. I was here. I watched people such as the member for Casey vote against having a debate of substantial importance to this country. If the government want to continue to do this, that is fine; but they should not stand up in here time after time and just repeat the Crosby Textor polling-‘We're the best friend of Medicare'-because this minister is destroying Medicare by stealth.

201,Mr ANTHONY SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"After listening to the contributions of those opposite-the member for Lalor and most recently the member for Holt-it is quite obvious that the motive behind, and the reason for, this matter of public importance is not a concern for health policy. This is not about health policy at all. Both of those members sketched out an elaborate conspiracy theory that reflects either their particular political outlook at the moment or a vivid imagination, or a combination of both. At the outset, I would like to address in some detail why the conspiracy theory, outlined so vividly by the member for Lalor, and to a lesser extent by the member for Holt, simply does not stack up. The motive for proposing this MPI is something entirely different. It is not about the concern of those opposite for health policy, as they would pretend. I will concede that the member for Lalor is far better at pretending that she benet], lieves in something passionately than is the member for Holt. What this MPI is about-and the reason it has been proposed today-has nothing to do with health policy; rather, it is a desperate and irresponsible act by those on the other side to cover up policy and political calamity on issues far away from health. It is to cover up other issues that are quite obvious and which are not at all the subject of a conspiracy. But they do appear in the Australian, where members opposite are being quoted on their views regarding the Labor Party's approach to so many other issues.",111

203,Mr ANTHONY SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Among those opposite who are interjecting is my good friend the member for Melbourne Ports, for whom I have high regard. Having a high regard for the member for Melbourne Ports means that I know him well. I know that he will always interject when he is sensitive about a subject-always. The member for Lalor outlined with vivid imagination her conspiracy theory based on an episode of The West Wing. The problem is that her conspiracy theory runs like this: last Thursday a press release went out at a terribly nasty time and, therefore, this was something of great concern to those opposite. The member for Lalor and the member for Holt said they were so concerned about this issue that they wanted to propose an MPI. The only problem is that, if they were so concerned, they would have proposed an MPI at the first available opportunity. If were so concerned, they would have proposed this MPI yesterday. Instead of putting forward an MPI on this matter yesterday, we had an MPI on small business, which was proposed by a shadow minister who is, I think, about 32nd in line. The shadow minister, who is 32nd in the Labor team, got precedence over the member for Lalor. Say she missed out on the MPI in the tactics group yesterday; you would have thought that she would have got a question, that she would have come in here on Tuesday morning",111
204,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Casey will refer to members by their title.,112
205,Mr ANTHONY SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Because the member for Lalor cares so deeply about this issue and has proposed an MPI, she would have come in here and asked the first question. But, no, we had 10 questions without the member for Lalor getting a guernsey, without her asking a question. Today, there were five questions on subjects that had nothing to do with this MPI. The first question from the Leader of the Opposition was on petrol. The second question from the member for Grayndler was on whales. The third question from the member for Hunter was on credit cards. The member for Perth asked the startling question about Comcar drivers. Then we had a question on voluntary student unionism. Finally, after last Thursday, the member for Lalor got a guernsey and asked her first question on health. As I said, if those opposite were really concerned about this issue, if they were deeply of the belief that this was such a critical policy issue, we would have had an MPI yesterday. We would have had questions on Monday and Tuesday. We would have had questions today. The member for Lalor had 25 opportunities to ask a question and she they took the 26th question today. She asked the sixth question in question time today. So we know that deep concern is not the reason she has proposed this MPI-and we know that because she could have done so yesterday. We know that the member for Lalor could have asked the first question, not the 26th. So there must be another reason why this MPI has been proposed. The motive for proposing the MPI is obvious. Those opposite know it. It is another episode of The West Wing that the member for Lalor is acting out, and that is the great diversion from their own policy and political catastrophe. Since the member for Lalor raised American politics, it reminded me of another great political figure who had a vivid imagination-that is, former President Lyndon Johnson. To paraphrase, he said that if you have a relative who has one eye and it is in the middle of their forehead, you do not keep them in the front living room. I am grateful that the member for Reid is in the chamber, because he is that person in the Labor Party. The great problem for the Labor Party is that he is not just in the front living room; he is at the doorstops every morning describing a policy that is completely at odds with his backbench and that has led the leadership of the Labor Party into total policy catastrophe throughout this week. He has announced, I think, three separate positions. Two were identical. The first one was followed by a total reversal a point of order. I appreciate that an MPI discussion should be wide ranging, but this is getting well and truly off the subject matter of the MPI.",112

209,Mr ANTHONY SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is why this MPI has been proposed, as the Minister for Health and Ageing outlined quite clearly. The MPI is in the following terms: The Government's failure to be accountable for its ongoing mismanagement of Australia's health system. After the Premiers Conference, I would not have thought that any other Labor figure in Australia believed that. As the minister for health points out, Australia has a good health system, and the Labor Premiers agree with that. Whilst those opposite will criticise health system-and the minister for health outlined just what an irresponsible furphy it was that they ran today in question time-we must ask: what is their alternative? When you look back over the last nine years, you see a doubling of the spending on health policy. You see the introduction of a private health insurance rebate, which never existed before, of 30 per cent for the general public, 35 per cent for those aged over 65 and 40 per cent for those over 70. You see the introduction of a Medicare safety net that is now paying benefits for out-of-hospital expenses that Medicare never paid in that form. You would think that if those opposite were criticising the health system they would be offering to increase spending in those areas. But, far from that, the past for those opposite will actually be the future health policy if Labor ever gets its way. If Labor had its way, what health system would we see? Let us go to the substance of this MPI. You would see a health system with no private health insurance rebate. The member for Holt spoke after the member for Lalor about the deep concern for health in his electorate. He obviously has no concern for the more than 40 per cent of people in his electorate who have private health insurance. That is obviously something they have picked up which would explain his result at the last election. Not only would we have no private health insurance rebate; as the minister for health pointed out, we would have no Medicare safety net because, whilst the member for Lalor will criticise the safety net, what she does not publicly outline is that her policy desire is not to alter it or tweak it but to totally abolish it. What is her alternative-Medicare Gold? It has been called fool's gold. I would call it for what it was: ‘Medicare gold tooth'. That policy, amazingly, is the one policy the member for Lalor still sticks to today, in the spite of opposition from those on her own backbench and inside the shadow cabinet. As the minister for health rightly pointed out, Labor figures have called it everything from a strategic disaster, ‘something with the head of a donkey and the body of a wombat', a hoax, to something that proved to be a turkey. Lindsay Tanner, the member for Melbourne, said it would be a very substantial burden on future budgets. This MPI is a furphy. It has been put up to cover up a policy catastrophe on the other side and it should be dismissed for the irrelevancy that it is. (Time expired)",113
210,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Order! The discussion is concluded. Before we go on with government business, could I just make a comment that there has been a liberal use today of personal pronouns: ‘you', ‘he', ‘she' and ‘your'.

It becomes a personal attack, and that is why the chair always insists that members should speak through the chair and also address members by their seats or by their titles.

Ordered that the reports be made parliamentary papers.",114
212,Mrs MOYLAN,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The committee's sixth report of 2005 addresses the refurbishment of light wells and defence office accommodation at Australia House in London. The works, referred by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, are intended to ensure compliance with current occupational health and safety standards, provide an acceptable level of amenity for tenants, ensure ongoing viability of the property in respect of income generation and redress degradation of the light well areas. Having investigated the proposal, the committee is satisfied that the works will improve the amenity of the 90-year-old building in a cost-effective manner and therefore recommends that the works proceed at an estimated cost of $11.98 million. The committee's seventh report of 2005 examines the midlife upgrade of Australia's existing chancery building at its High Commission in Singapore. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade reported that the chancery in its current form has significant deficiencies in meeting current occupational health and safety and Building Code of Australia standards. It is dysfunctional and noncost-effective in layout and does not present an appropriate image of Australia in its representational and reception areas. To redress these deficiencies, the department proposes to upgrade building services, access, security and communications systems and reconfigure and refurbish tenant office accommodation. The committee was satisfied with the department's responses to its questions and recommends that the work proceed at an estimated cost of $12.7 million. The committee's eighth report of 2005 deals with a proposal, also by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, to construct a new Consulate-General building in Bali, Indonesia, at an estimated cost of $7.15 million. The department reported that the former Consulate-General building in Bali is no longer suitable to fulfil its consular and representative role, with significant deficiencies in respect of occupational health and safety, floor space and functionality, building structure and services and particularly security. Since the terrorist bombing in 2002, the Australian Consulate-General in Bali has been accommodated in leased premises-a situation that is not sustainable in the long term. The committee is in no doubt as to the requirement for the proposed work and recommends that it proceed. Further, the committee is pleased to note that the proposed work will provide a permanent site for, and improve access to, the memorial garden and anniversary pond erected to victims of the Bali bombing. A further proposal by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade-namely, the construction of a new chancery in Vientiane, Laos-forms the subject of the committee's ninth report of 2005. The proposed new building, estimated to cost $11 million, is intended to replace the existing chancery, which was acquired and refurbished in 1961 and no longer maintains modern standards in respect of services, layout, building codes occupational health and safety requirements. The committee has given detailed consideration to this proposal and it recommends that the works proceed at an estimated cost of $11 million. The 10th report of 2005 presents the committee's findings in relation to the proposed construction of a dedicated business resumption site for the Reserve Bank of Australia. The purpose of the proposed work is to provide a facility that, in the event of an emergency, will ensure the continuation of functions critical to the operation of Australia's financial systems. During the course of its inquiry, the committee investigated the revenue to be generated and/or saved by this project, issues relating to relocation and commodation of staff, the use of the facility, electricity supply, energy consumption and green building initiatives. The committee was particularly impressed by the range of energy and water conservation measures proposed for the new facility and was pleased with the high quality of the evidence submitted by the Reserve Bank, which assisted greatly in the speedy completion of inquiry. The committee has no hesitation in recommending that the proposed work proceed, at the estimated cost of $38 million. I would like to take this opportunity to thank my committee colleagues and all those involved in the five inquiries, and I commend the reports to the House.

214,Mr BALDWIN,COMMITTEES,"by leave-On behalf of or the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I have just presented the committee's Report No. 403, Access of Indigenous Australians to law and justice services. The terms of reference were adopted and the inquiry commenced in the previous parliament, when the committee was capably chaired by Bob Charles and his deputy, the member for Sydney, Tanya Plibersek. Two ongoing members of the sectional committee, the current deputy chair, Sharon Grierson, and Senator John Hogg, provided important continuity to the inquiry over the two parliaments. The committee's inquiry examined the delivery of legal services to Indigenous Australians from the perspective of providers and actheir clients. Of particular concern to the committee was the access that Indigenous Australians have to family and civil law services in cases where the safety of individuals is threatened by criminal activity, such as family violence. This report makes 17 recommendations for the government to consider that build upon programs already in place. The comthe mittee has recognised the government's doubling of resources to the Family Violence Protection Legal Services program over the last financial year as an important response to family violence in Indigenous communities and has recommended a further expansion of these services to people living in ban areas. While the committee is in no way opposed to the holistic response to victims of family violence, incorporating services such as counselling, it has recommended that family violence protection legal services be recognised primarily as providers of legal representation and advice to persons at risk of violence, who must be assured of their full rights to protection and compensation under the law. The importance of expert staff in providing legal services to Indigenous Australians should not be underestimated. To this end, the committee has recommended an investigation into and review of comparative rates of remuneration for staff of Indigenousspecific providers of legal services and of publicly funded mainstream providers. There is also room for increased cooperation and coordination between Indigenous-specific and mainstream service providers to promote mutual benefits to staff in both types of organisations. In conclusion, I would like to express the committee's appreciation to those people who contributed to the inquiry by preparing submissions and giving evidence at public hearings. I particularly want to thank the people of the community of Yuendumu in the Northern Territory for their hospitality and their frankness. It was an example of how cultural law and common law can work together for outcomes in the community. I wish to thank all members of the sectional committee involved for their time and dedication in conducting this inquiry. I commend the report to the House.",115
215,Ms GRIERSON,COMMITTEES,"by leave-As Deputy Chair of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I am also pleased to draw the attention of the House to our recent report No. 403, Access of Indigenous Australians to law and ur- justice services. This report's recommendations give government clear direction for the future provision of Indigenous law and justice services. The report strongly recommends the acceptance of separate and specific requirements for the three main areas of legal services-family, civil and criminal law-matched of course by adequate funding. It draws attention to the tendency for legal representation services to be directed primarily at those facing criminal charges and possible incarceration. In the interests of women and children, the family violence prevention legal services so needed in both urban and rural Indigenous communities must be consistently accessible and available. The committee received evidence that from 1991 to 2001 the number of Australian women in custody increased by 147 per cent. Indigenous women were included in that figure. The corresponding increase for Indigenous women alone was 225.8 per cent. To us, it was very evident that services are needed. In my own region, the Many Rivers Aboriginal Legal Service explained that the increase in the incarceration of Indigenous women was a response to high incidences of family violence and child sexual assault. They said: ... we are starting to see the flow-through into older ages of a lot of child victims of sexual assault, physical assault and systems abuse from having been made state wards and left high and dry. We have much to achieve in providing for women and children and in healing the harm that past policies have done to the Indigenous people in this country. No stronger evidence of that was presented than that at Dubbo, where sadly we were part of the grief and despair around a death in custody at that time. For the committee members, it was a very poignant and certainly pointed reminder that we have much to do in representing Indigenous people. Ways for government to adequately respond to the problems of staff recruitment and retention were identified in the report. Comparable pay rates, exchange programs, scholarships bonded to regional service, and assisted training and development plans for paralegal community support workers were all recommended, as were the better coordination of legal services and the sharing of resources. I draw particular attention, as the chair did, to some wonderful initiatives towards multiagency policies and policing in Western Australia, and I thank those involved for their initiative, their innovation and their commitment. Many service providers strongly expressed their concerns that the government's new tendering system may compromise Indigenous ownership of legal services and Indigenous participation. But, pleasingly, it seems that the government has heeded those concerns, with successful tenderers thus far in Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia all being Aboriginal legal services. It was truly a privilege to be invited people of Yuendumu to visit their community. Life experiences reinforce that local solutions work best, and the self-determined initiatives to overcome petrol sniffing, domestic violence and antisocial behaviour by youth that the people of Yuendumu have devised are exemplary. There is no place in government for programs of paternal benevolence such as the recently endorsed petrol for parenting measures, but there is a real place for taking notice of Indigenous communities when they pose local solutions to problems that eat away at their community's prosperity. I thank the people of Yuendumu. I was touched by their wisdom and by their commitment to their kin and community. Recent media articles have raised concerns amongst the community that committees do not achieve real effectiveness in shaping government policy. I am proud to say that this report and this inquiry have already been effective. This report is a tribute to the committee's secretariat, particularly Dr Glen Worthington, and to all those who submitted to and supported the committee in its deliberations. I would also endorse the chair's acknowledgements and appreciation. I can say that this was perhaps one of the too few experiences that we have in this House that motivate us to achieve more through our work here as parliamentarians. I commend the report to the House. Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission Report",116
216,Mr KERR,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission, I present the committee's report on the examination of the Australian Crime Commission's annual report 2003-04 together with the evidence received by the committee. I move that the by the report be made a parliamentary paper. Question agreed to.",117
217,Mr KERR,COMMITTEES,I seek leave of the House to make a short statement. Leave granted.,117
218,Mr KERR,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission, I present the committee's report on the examination of the Australian Crime Commission's annual report 2003-04. The Australian Crime Commission's annual report was presented out of session on 21 December 2004 and was tabled in both houses on 8 February 2005, in accordance with section 61 of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002. The duties of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission are prescribed under section 55 of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002. These duties include examining each annual report of the Australian Crime Commission and reporting to the parliament on any matter appearing in or arising out of any such annual report. In the course of its scrutiny of the Australian Crime Commission report, the committee held a number of hearings in Canberra on 17 March and wrote to a number of individuals and organisations, inviting them to comment on the annual report. We received seven submissions as well as a number of letters that expressed satisfaction with the operation of the Australian Crime Commission. This year's Australian Crime Commission report is significant in that its reporting period covers the first full year of the commission's operation. It gives the committee, the parliament and the electorate the opportunity to evaluate the progress of the Australian Crime Commission towards its stated objective of ‘reducing incidence and impact of serious and organised criminal activity'. The committee draws the House's attention to a number of recommendations made in the report that are designed to provide more public information about the Australian Crime Commission's operation. They include a recommendation that the Australian Crime Commission consider the release of public versions of key research, including a declassified version of the informative picture of criminality. The committee has also recommended that the Australian Crime Commission review the legal and administrative arrangements governing information on its intelligence networks and that it brief the committee on the results. To make some of the performance indicators more informative for the committee, the parliament and the community, the committee has included recommendation 4: ... continued refinement of the performance measures, including an explanation of the significance of quantitative and qualitative indicators. Recommendation 5 also concerns performance indicators. The committee has recommended that those performance indicators relating to criminal intelligence operations include, subject to reasonable security considerations, how priority is given to matters submitted to the Australian Crime Commission board for consideration. In making these recommendations, our committee is acutely aware of the necessarily confidential nature of the work of the Australian Crime Commission; there is a fine line to be drawn between information which must be kept confidential for operational reasons and that which can be released for general use. However, the committee considers that the recommendations made in this report will not compromise the Australian Crime Commission in any way and will provide a greater understanding of the work and achievements of the commission. In conducting its evaluation of the annual report, the committee acknowledges the assistance of the chairman of the ACC board, Commissioner Mick Keelty, the CEO, Mr Alistair Milroy, and officers of the Australian Crime Commission. Throughout the reporting period, the ACC has provided considerable assistance to the committee through written reports and briefings as well as through verbal presentations. The commission's willingness to assist the committee has been of great assistance and has contributed to a transparent and cooperative relationship. The committee would like to acknowledge also the considerable assistance of Professor John MCMillan, the Commonwealth Ombudsman, and his staff. I also take this opportunity to thank the secretariat staff for the consistent support they have given to the committee. Finally, I take this opportunity to inform the House that, following discussions with the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Ellison, the committee has agreed to conduct a statutory evaluation of the operation of the Australian Crime Commission Act, pursuant to section 61 of that act. This inquiry will call for submissions in the near future. It will be an excellent opportunity to examine the adequacy of the act to provide a practical working framework for the Australian Crime Commission in a criminal environment, which is not only national but also transnational in character. NA NA BILL 2005 Second Reading Debate resumed.",117
219,Mr ALBANESE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Grayndler) (4.15 pm)When I began my speech prior to question time, I did not get through to the completion of my amendment, so I might start at the beginning again. I move: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House: (1) notes that: (a) the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Amendment Act 2003 received bi-partisan support as it built constructively on the Ozone Protection legislation of the Hawke and Keating Governments; (b) the licensing process for the air tioning and refrigerant industry being undertaken by an industry board (appointed by the Minister) is the keystone of the proposed ozone and synthetic greenhouse gas emission minimisation program; (c) the licensing regime for 50,000 tradespeople commences on 1 July 2005; and (2) is concerned that, as a result of unnecessary delays caused by the Minister for the Environment; (a) the national industry board for the air conditioning and refrigerant industry was belatedly appointed on 31 May 2005, six months after it was expected to be announced and only one month before the new licensing regime begins; (b) there was widespread frustration and confusion in the industry because the reforms proposed by the Act were delayed; and (c) the environmental improvements which are the rationale for the 2003 Act have not been achieved”. I note that a very similar second reading amendment was passed by the Senate without any dissent being recorded. Clearly, there must be some concern amongst the minister's own Senate colleagues over his handling of this issue; otherwise, the government would have argued against the minister being criticised for causing unnecessary delays in the appointment of the industry board. Also, you would have thought the government would have supported the minister against criticisms that he had not achieved the environmental improvements which are the rationale for the 2003 act. Clearly, the criticisms are well founded, and that is why the Senate voted as it did. The Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill 2005 proposes amendments to two acts: the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act condi- 1989 and the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust Act 2001. The proposed amendments to the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act are relatively uncontroversial and are of a housekeeping nature. They ensure that a person importing or exporting used HCFC or methyl bromide has either a used substances licence or a controlled substances licence-not both, as could be the case under the existing act. It also applies the same controls and reporting requirements to anyone who sets up a synthetic greenhouse gas-SGG-manufacturing operation in Australia as those applying to SGG importers. The amendments to the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust Act 2001 permit the sale of a disused scout hall in Mosman and a land swap to replace the lost public space. These are uncontroversial and have the support of the New South Wales government. The Sydney Harbour Federation Trust legislation is legislation that I spoke on when it was introduced. The harbour is the jewel in Sydney's crown, and I, as someone who was born there and loves Sydney Harbour, certainly believe that Sydney is the jewel in Australia's crown. Anything we can do to protect and enhance the Sydney Harbour National Park and the public space around the harbour is to the benefit of all Australians. On this side of the House, we support these minor changes to the act. I want to confine my comments today primarily to the changes that are effected by the amendments to the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act. The main industries affected by the amendments to this act are the refrigeration and air conditioning industries and the fumigation industry. In Australia, the regulation of the fluorocarbon gases used in the refrigerant industry started when the Hawke Labor government introduced the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act 1989 to phase out CFCs and implement the Montreal protocol. CFCs, as everyone came to know, were causing global ozone depletion or, to put it another way, a hole in the ozone layer. International action on this important issue was urgent, and the Hawke Labor government acted quickly and decisively to phase out the import and manufacture of CFCs by 1 January 1996. Recently I had the pleasure, at an Australian-Israel Chamber of Commerce function in Sydney, to hear Dr David Suzuki talk about climate change and the challenge that it presented to us. He drew parallels with the issue of CFCs and their impact on the ozone layer and how, originally, it was thought that these revolutionary consumer items were going to bring great benefit to us. It took time for the danger that CFCs were causing to the ozone layer and the threat that they posed to the global environment to be recognised. There is a parallel with the current debate on climate change and the danger that greenhouse gases are causing to the climate and, therefore, not just to our environment but also to our potential economic future. I am very pleased and proud to say that the Hawke Labor government's decision to phase out CFCs by 1 January 1996 was achieved with strong community support and without significant disruption to industry. It is a great practical example of taking action that is necessary, rather than finding reasons not to take action as a global community. The Hawke Labor government's actions are in stark contrast to the complacency of the Howard government when it comes to climate change. In 1995, the Keating Labor government continued this good work and introduced the Ozone Protection Amendment Act 1995, which included controls on HCFCs, reflecting their inclusion in the Montreal protocol. HCFCs are also an ozone-depleting gas, albeit considerably less so than CFCs. They will be phased out by 2020 at a rate considerably in advance of Australia's international obligations. This great result was achieved because the Keating government worked with industry to do the best that it could, not merely just the minimum. Again, the Keating Labor government's actions are in stark contrast to the abject complacency and incompetence of the Howard government when it comes to taking action on climate change. The Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Amendment Act 2003 included controls on HFCs and was seen as a useful step by the industry. It received biparminister tisan support. The legislation will minimise emission of HFC gases which are controlled by the Kyoto protocol but previously uncontrolled in Australia. HFC gases are mainly used as refrigerants. These gases do not deplete the ozone layer but do have a significant greenhouse warming potential. End use controls-that is, minimising the emissions of these gases to atmosphere through sound industrial practices-are contained in the regulations dated 16 December 2004. The controls are put in place by improving training and other standards in the industry, fying tradespersons and inspecting associated work. Without an appropriate licence a tradesperson will not be permitted to purchase refrigerants. Companies buying and selling refrigerants or using refrigerants manufacturing process will also have to be appropriately licensed, abide by agreed standards and be subject to inspection. This licensing process is a keystone of the act's emission minimisation program and is to be undertaken by an industry board to be appointed by the minister. The board was to be directed by the Department of the Environment and Heritage. This approach received strong industry support and emerged from a consultation and review process held over a number of years. Somewhat scandalously, the minister did not appoint the industry board until three weeks ago-on 31 May 2005. With nobody to put the program in place until three weeks ago, the legislation passed way back in late 2003 has not, up to this point, produced a tangible environmental benefit. According to ABC news reports in February, the appointment of a national industry board was derailed after lobbying from a small section of the industry in Western Australia. After achieving bipartisan support for such important legislation and also getting industry support for national regulation, the backflipped and wanted to rewrite the whole thing. This step was taken without consultation with industry, and the minister refused to meet with industry representatives. The minister stated that he wanted to take in ‘regional and sectoral' considerations. I think everyone here knows what that is code for when this minister and other ministers in the Howard government speak about ‘sectoral' considerations. The minister delayed the whole licensing regime for six months while he tried to find a way to accommodate these parochial interests. Not certisurprisingly, the minister's approach was severely criticised by the industry. Senior people in the refrigeration industry could not hold back their anger and frustration with the minister. The editorial in the in a April 2005 edition of Climate Control News stated: The Minister's decisionnot to proceed with a single national boardhas left a broad cross section of the Aussie refrigeration industry in varying degrees of anger, frustration and confusion. What an editorial-anger, frustration and confusion caused by government inaction. But the editorial had a bit more to say than that. It went on: But the real loser in all this is the very thing the whole process was set up to save-the environment. ... Despite being millions of dollars and four years down the track, not a single gram of carbon dioxide equivalent has been saved from entering the ether. Like Nero all those centuries ago, the earth is burning while Campbell fiddles. Ms Julie Bishop interjecting",119
220,Mr ALBANESE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,The Minister for Ageing laughs at the predicament that the minister finds himself in. Ms Julie Bishop-I laughed at the Shakespearean overtones.,122
221,Mr ALBANESE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Minister, that was an editorial from the April 2005 edition of Climate Control News. It is not from the Labor Party and it is not from the trade union movement; it is from the main industry newsletter-people on the ground who know what the impact of this government's inaction has been. Also quoted in the April edition of Climate Control News was Rod King, president of the Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Equipment Manufacturers Association-note: the association, not the union; this is the industry. He said: There have been press reports that the Minister is considering establishing multiple boards-but we can find no justification or rationale for this proach. We have just spent years getting to the point where we have comprehensive national regulation of refrigerants and now there seems to be a move to implement accreditation on a state basis. But Mr King went on to say a bit more as well. He said: This approach is completely inconsistent with other Federal Government reforms, such as the move towards a unitary industrial relations system. But who could expect consistency from this government? They have been up at the International Whaling Commission arguing that secret ballots are a bad thing, and yet in industrial relations, when it comes to workers having control over their own environment, they are pro secret ballots. So it is consistency that is needed when it comes to the environment, just as on the issue of the Kyoto protocol we have a different position from that which we had on the Montreal protocol. By our not being a part of the most significant global effort on the most important environmental challenge facing the global community, that of avoiding dangerous climate change, we are undermined when we talk to the international community about issues that everyone here would agree with-everyone except the parliamentary secretary for tourism-which is that whaling is a practice that should be consigned to the dustbin of history. We need consistency when it comes to the environment if we are going to be able to achieve real gains. Alan Woodhouse, the CEO of the Australian Refrigeration Council, another industry body, stated: We are all very disappointed. The Government called for tenders to fulfil a single national industry board. We responded with a very thorough tender that complied with all the specifications. Now, nearly 12 months later the Department of Environment and Heritage is abandoning the original tender and the structure and outcome apfrom work put in over the last three years. Why? Alan Woodhouse then noted he was ‘understandably bewildered and upset' by the minister's actions. In attempting to overturn the national approach and protect parochial interests at the expense of a consistent national approach, the minister has threatened the underlying philosophy behind this important legislation, which enjoyed bipartisan support in this House. The delays in appointing the industry board exposed the air conditioning and refrigeration industry to severe consequences as the industry board issues the licences which will be required by law for 50,000 tradespeople after 1 July 2005. So you have got a system that is going to apply to 50,000 people in 10 days time being debated in this House now, when the board was appointed at the end of last month, on 31 May. This is an extraordinary performance even by the minister's own standards when it comes to taking decisive action on issues of environment and heritage. And that is why Labor is moving the second reading amendment today. It is also possibly why the Senate carried the second reading amendment yesterday without the government members even calling for a vote or expressing opposition to our amendment. Ms George-Amazing. Embarrassed, were they?",122
222,Mr ALBANESE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"As the member for Throsby, the parliamentary secretary for environment and heritage for the Labor Party, says, I think they were embarrassed by this performance, because the whole purpose of the licensing regime is to minimise ozonedamaging gases and other greenhouse gas emissions. There has been widespread frustration and confusion in the air conditioning and refrigeration industry because the reforms proposed by the act have been delayed by the minister. More than 50,000 tradespeople in the air conditioning and refrigeration industry have been frustrated and confused as to what the industry's licensing regime It is a scandal that the environmental improvements which are the rationale for the bipartisan 2003 act have not been achieved. Once again this shows the minister and the Howard government are just not serious about taking practical steps to avoid dangerous climate change. The Howard government is slow, it is reluctant and it is complacent when it comes to tackling the issue of climate change. National leadership is needed to avoid dangerous climate change, but instead Australia has a lethargic, tired approach. Climate change caused by the burning of fossil fuels and greenhouse gases is changing Australia's climate right now. Australia is one of the most important crossroads in its history. What we do in the next 10 years about these issues will determine the fate of our economy and our environment for the rest of this century and beyond. The extended four-year drought gripping Australia is the most dramatic example of climate change to hit our continent. Experts predict Australia is going to get progressively drier over the coming century because of changes to our climate caused by greenhouse pollution. According to the CSIRO, climate change will only worsen drought conditions. The Prime Minister's decision not to ratify the Kyoto protocol-having had the former Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Hill, sign the Kyoto protocol in 1997 and declare it a win for the environment and a win for jobs-is an outrage. Mr Lloyd interjecting",123
223,Mr ALBANESE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"The member for Robertson, sitting opposite, proclaims confusion about jobs and the Kyoto protocol. But I was quoting the Prime Minister from 1997that is what he said. He was right then but he is wrong now when it comes to taking decisive action, because the decision not to ratify is. the Kyoto protocol is stopping new investment in technology which would reduce greenhouse gases, create jobs and move Australia to a cleaner, more secure energy future. The Kyoto protocol is not perfect, but it is an essential first step and shows what can be done when the international community works together. It is a global solution to a global problem. Not ratifying Kyoto means Australia cannot contribute to how the world is dealing with the climate crisis. One hundred and forty other nations are having a say, but we are not. We have no credibility in the discussions over emission reductions in future international agreements, which will take effect after 2012. Quite clearly much at deeper cuts will be necessary. In a passionate speech in Britain recently, the international Chairman of Shell, Lord Oxburgh, stated: We have roughly 45 years. And if we start NOW, not in 10 or 15 years' time, we have a chance of hitting those greenhouse gas reduction targets. But we've got to start now. We have no time to lose ... The boat is sinking, and we have to everything that we possibly can. It is extraordinary that companies such as Shell and BP are so far ahead of the position taken by someone like the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, who thinks that climate change is not really happening. People in industry, including those industries which have contributed greatly to climate change, understand very well that the world has to change. Certainly the frustration of the refrigeration industry is another example of the overwhelming frustration felt by those who recognise the dangers of climate change and want to do something about it. That is what the second reading amendment that we have moved today is about. My colleague the member for Throsby will second it. It is a fair and balanced amendment, and I ask members to join with the Senate in supporting it.",123
224,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,Is the amendment seconded? Ms George-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,124
225,Mr LAMING,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Bowman) (4.39 pm)This afternoon is a timely moment to reflect on Australia's achievements with greenhouse gases. Obviously, the Montreal protocol pertains to the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill 2005 that we are debating today and the amendments to the legislation which, as we can see, have support from both sides of the House and are relatively minor. The Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act 1989 needs to be amended in three or four ways. It will bring licensing of domestic producers into line with importers and exporters. I think that is appropriate. not be the complexity of requiring both used and controlled substance licences. I think that is also appropriate. Finally, the process of reporting to the minister on when these use products are imported and exported will now be brought into line for domestic producers and manufacturers. I think that is all relatively non-controversial. Right now is an excellent time to remember exactly what has been achieved by Australia in reducing the use of these gases. The gases have important roles in industry. The most obvious one is their quarantine application. I experienced that myself when we brought material back from a recent visit from Papua New Guinea which was fumigated. There are quarantine uses for these heavy gases. There are the non-quarantine applications which pertain to the Montreal protocol. That protocol only pertains to nonquarantine uses. In the areas of refrigeration, use in the manufacture of foams, use as solvents and air conditioning, we have seen significant reductions. The point I make today is that had we simply stuck to the bare bones of the protocol we would be importing today 240 tonnes of methyl bromide. But, no, we have done significantly better at 160 tonnes and I think that should be acknowledged. If we hung purely and simply on the symbolism of signing to a protocol and doing not an ounce better, then we would be performing significantly more poorly than we actually are today. I would point out that it is not always government, whether we are in power or opposition, that should be congratulated for those achievements but industry themselves that go out there and go one step better than the protocol. I think that is a fine allegory for the debate we are having around Kyoto where our reductions and emissions are in line with achieving the 2008-2012 objective There will of being as George-So why don't you ratify it?",124
226,Mr LAMING,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Because we are doing it and industry is doing it without that ratification down to 108 per cent of emissions in 1995. These gases also have applications in medicine and science. Heavy gases are used in eye surgery where a millilitre of heavy gas is used to reattach retinas. I do not see that one as threatening the ozone layer, but it is important to remember that there is still, as we reduce the use of these substances, a notable but very small tail where they will still be used. The HCFCs I hope will be phased out within a year or two, but methyl bromide which has some more essential applications one would suspect will be used perhaps early into the next decade. I have made my point already about the use of HCFCs being 160 tonnes of importation. Methyl bromide is at 145 tonnes and that is predicted to fall next year to 66 and the following year to 42 tonnes. That is a substantial reduction and a credit again to industry and also to two bodies that have been running now for some time. I refer to the National Halon Bank, which has been responsible for collecting about 1,985 tonnes of halon. While a small amount of that will be required to be saved for aviation use, the rest is being cleaned up and either preserved or destroyed. The Halon Bank has been a very effective way of avoiding around 160 million tonnes of ozone being destroyed in the atmosphere. The other body is Refrigerant Reclaim Australia, which has been responsible for collecting refrigeration gases-around 1,000 tonnes. Some of these are extremely ozone damaging. We are talking about one kilogram of these gases being able to destroy up to 50 tonnes of ozone. When you think that this molecule is only present in perhaps three or four molecules per million and has such an important role in blocking ultraviolet C and effectively in important health applications, there are very good reasons for keeping ozone intact. What you have effectively done with that reclamation is to avoid around six million tonnes of CO² going into the atmosphere. They are two very good success stories for the work that has been done over recent years. I turn my attention to the member for Grayndler, who spent most of the time allotted to him focusing on effectively cobbling together some opinions of individuals who are unhappy with the speed of the process. And there was a great fixation on board appointments. But what is far more important than anything is the fact that we have had significant reductions-among the best in the world-and have got the use, the importation and the collection of some of these heavy gases to be world standard. That is really where the action is. The action is not what tonnes has been signed and what has not been signed, but what is happening on the ground. For that reason, I believe that industry itself deserves an enormous amount of credit. Industry itself is now finding alternative heavy gases to use. In some cases that is very difficult, and the federal government has set out some critical use exemptions which are very important. This again speaks to the fact that, if you have a government prepared to work with industry rather than using a protocol in a punitive way, you do not need to have that luxury of sitting back and saying, ‘We have signed and that was enough. We have achieved what was signed off on a protocol, and that is all we intend to do.' That a constructive approach goes much further than what one would sign up to in a protocol is evidenced here with Australia's achievements in relation to these heavy gases. That is analogous to the situation with the Kyoto protocol. We now have significant reductions. There is still HCFC reliant equipment and machinery that will be using heavy gases-in small amounts-until the end of its lifespan. That is an important concession made so that industry is able to comply, to go about finding alternatives. But it is not done in a punitive way; it is done with a discrete allocation of time for industry to be able to respond. That is really important. About 5,100 ozone-depleting potential tonnes of material are being prevented from being released into the atmosphere. Again, that is a significant improvement on what is happening in a number of situations around the world in a number of economies. The achievements of the Halon Bank, as I have pointed out, are impressive, as is the reclamation of refrigerant gases. Industry is supportive of all of these three amendments. There is no doubt that, of these ozonedepleting substances, some also have greenhouse impacts, but we have seen a movement from some of the highly ozonedamaging substances, with an ozonedepleting effect of about 0.4, down to some HCFCs that are in the realm of about 0.05. That is a significant improvement, and we are seeing that in the outcomes for Australia in being well in front of its obligations due the Montreal protocol. I believe it is industry that should be congratulated for those achievements; it is the government that has continued to tighten up legislation as required. For each of those reasons, I speak in support of the amendments today. We have excellent end use regulations, so there is provision there for industry, and industry appreciates the flexibility, but end I would say that it is not the small arguments that are contained in these amendments that are important. What is truly important is the eventual emission reductions from Australia, for they are world class.",124
227,Ms GEORGE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I thank the member for Bowman for his contribution to the debate on the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill 2005. It was quite an erudite scientific and technical explanation, some of which went over my head as I do not have that level of detailed knowledge about the science of the issue and its impacts. But what I did find rather surprising in his contribution was that he failed to respond to the essence of the argument of the member for Grayndler, which was to compare and contrast the international action, with Australia's support, to deal with the impacts of the depletion of the ozone layer-how Australia really led the way in that debate and the actions that have subsequently flowed-with the total inactivity over the newest global threat that is confronting all of mankind, and that is global warming. The shadow minister was making the point that Australia supported the ratification of the Montreal protocol. But, unfortunately, and much to the regret of people on this side of the House, the Australian government continues to fail to ratify the Kyoto protocol. The Kyoto protocol, as members know, has now been ratified by about 140 developed to nations. Only Australia and the United States stand outside the ratification process on an issue that many Australian citizens believe is the greatest threat facing not just our own country but the global community. That was a profound point made by the member for Grayndler. People on this side of the chamber take great pride in the fact that it was under the in the Hawke Labor government that this nation took steps to fall into line with the calls that were being made to ensure that we phased out the use of substances that depleted the ozone layer. At that time, the data that was being collected revealed a general thinning of the ozone layer over most of the globe. This included a five to nine per cent depletion over Australia since the 1960s, and it was having very severe impacts over Antarctica. The ozone hole in 2000 was the largest on record. At that time, it measured 32.9 million square kilometres-more than three times the size of Australia. It is not surprising that the Australian community at large was very concerned about the impacts of that depletion and the far-reaching consequences for human health. As the member for Bowman rightly said, governments around the world began the phasing out of CFCs, halons and other ozone-depleting chemicals. Those chemicals had been widely used as refrigerants, aerosol propellants and foam-blowing agents. The success of the action under the Montreal protocol is now evidenced by the fact that eminent scientists now believe that the prospects for the long-term recovery of the ozone layer are improving. Non-essential consumption of major ozone depleting substances did in fact slow down during the early 1990s, and if we continue to give this issue our best efforts some estimate that the hole in the ozone layer could be fully recoverable by around 2050. Interestingly enough, had we not taken action as a nation in concert with the rest of the international community, studies seem to suggest that by 2050 ozone depletion would be 10 times worse than current levels and UVB radiation would have resulted in an estimated 19 million additional cases of nonmelanoma skin cancer, 1.5 million more cases of melanoma and 129 million more cases of eye cataracts. The seriousness of the situation compelled an international response at that time. I am very pleased that our country was part of that international effort. It is much to the shame of the Howard government and the Australian nation that the same commitment to solving another international and global crisis is not being made by this government. The member for Bowman rightly acknowledges-and I want to say a little more about this-that the substitute gases, the more ozone benign gases, are in fact themselves contributing to the greenhouse impact. I recently read a UN report which was headed ‘Safeguarding the ozone layer and the global climate system'. You would assume that the substitution of ozone friendly gases would not cause any irreparable harm and any consequent flow-on effects. But in fact what this and other reports are suggesting is that in phasing out CFCs, halons and other ozone depleting chemicals we have replaced them with alternatives that are having a marked impact on global warming. Like CFCs, some of the alternatives, such as the group referred to as HCFCs, HFCs and PFCs, are themselves powerful greenhouse gases. In the words of the Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organisation: Although climate change and ozone destruction are essentially different issues, our use of certain chemicals links them together. He goes on to argue: We must continuously monitor, undertake research and improve how we manage this group of extremely useful substances, which is implicated in not one, but two of the major environmental problems we have ever known.' To limit their damaging effects governments have included two of the CFC alternatives in the 1992 UN climate change convention and in the Kyoto protocol, under which signatory countries must reduce their emissions from a basket of six greenhouse gases by the period 2008 to 2012. This basket contains the alternative HFCs and PFCs. The contribution that CFCs and their replacements and other ozone-depleting substances currently make to global warming is estimated to be about five per cent of humanity's total greenhouse gas emissions. I raise this issue because the major concern in the public debate is with the contribution of carbon to greenhouse warming. In fact, the substitutes that we are now using to continue to protect the ozone layer are themselves partly contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and global warming. This report went on to recommend some simple and common sense practices that should be put in place to minimise the impact of the ozone friendly chemicals on global warming. The report says that containment can be improved to prevent leaks, evaporation and emissions of unintended by-products. About 65 per cent of today's total emissions from this group of chemicals still comes from CFCs, mainly from existing refrigeration and air conditioning equipment. Reducing leaks from these sources could cut greenhouse gas emissions, benefiting both the ozone layer and climate change. Amounts of the chemicals needed in equipment can be reduced and there should be more end-of-life recovery, recycling and destruction of HFCs and PFCs. Since virtually all ozone depleting substances and their replacements are now used in closed systems, they are not emitted until years or even decades after being produced. Large amounts of CFCs still exist in current refrigeration and air conditioning equipment and in insulating foams from which they can leak or evaporate. Later, as the report indicates, when the equipment is finally decommissioned, these gases can be released into the atmosphere. While I commend the bipartisan approach that we have seen in the past in phasing out ozone depleting substances, many of the alternative gases that are now being used, whilst ozone benign, are potent greenhouse gases contributing to the greenhouse effect. I point out, as the member for Grayndler did, that there was a concerted international effort led by our national government on the ozone layer, but on the issue of global warming this national government is missing in action by its failure to ratify the Kyoto protocol. So, that context, we have to be even more vigilant that there are systems in place to monitor the impact on global warming of these ozone benign gases. On the specifics of the legislation, the member for Grayndler went through the lead-up and the details contained in the amendments so I do not want to dwell on the detail for too long, other than to say that the implementation of the proposed licensing regime and the creation of the new council has been another example of a botched effort on behalf of the minister who has overall responsibility for protection of Australia's environmental conditions. The new refrigeration licensing system is to replace existing state systems and, as the member for Grayndler rightly pointed out in moving his amendments to the bill, the industry has experienced a litany of delays and frustrations in getting the system into place. There is no doubt this has caused concern and frustration in the industry, and the comments the member for Grayndler made, drawing on a number of industry sources and industry bodies, I think make that very clear. Here we are today in parliament debating a piece of legislation that is supposed to come into effect on 1 July. I do note, though, that there are now transitional arrangements under the licensing regime because there is no way that people are going to have their licences properly in place by the operative date of 1 July when something like 50,000 tradespeople are going to be incorporated as part of this new regime. There are also many in the industry who are querying the cost of the licences-$320, I think it is, for a twoyear licence. And some who may not have the requisite trade qualifications are going to go through transitional arrangements that will recognise prior learning, however illdefined that is at the moment. So it has been quite a botch-up in terms of in administrative arrangements. That botch-up is most clearly revealed in the delays that the member for Grayndler outlined in relation to the creation of the Australian Refrigeration Council, the body that was supposed to operate as a service provider under contract to the government. Its main role is to issue the licences and authorisations and to undertake compliance audits. Quite clearly, there was a lot of parochial and sectional pressure on the minister, most notably by the Motor Trade Association over in the west which attempted to derail the national system that was originally outlined in the bill. One has to ask about the special privileges this industry body had in applying the kind of pressure that has seen the new council announced only very recently-on 31 May. So here we have a totally new body announced at the end of May that is supposed to oversee a process to license around 50,000 tradespeople between now and 1 July, and yet this legislation has still not being carried by this liament. It would be hard to find a clearer example of maladministration and botch-up than in the arrangements for the new licensing regime that is to apply. We do support the essence of the bill, while our amendments clearly note the failures of the government and refer to the problems that these delays and pressures are causing in the industry. There is a clear parallel between the action Australia took when the world's community understood the impacts of the thinning of the ozone layer around the world, when we were at the forefront of the international action that has seen the damage to the ozone layer being held at bay with the possibility of the damage being reversed, and the lack of action by this government over a similar global crisis, the crisis of global warming, where we do not have the courage to go along with the rest of the developed nations and ratify the Kyoto protocol. When this bill is passed I look forward to being reassured by the government that we will have proper monitoring in place to look at the impacts that the more ozone friendly chemicals are actually having on global warming and climate change. There should be no trade-offs in my opinion between saving the ozone layer and minimising the very negative impacts of climate change. They are two global issues of equal importance and you cannot have any trade-offs between saving the ozone layer and minimising climate change. Lastly, I ask the members of the government to think seriously about the benefits that would flow to the Australian economy, to the Australian environment and to the health and well-being of our communities if the government were to do the right thing and accept the challenge put forward in the member for Grayndler's private member's bill, which had a second reading in the House the other day. It is a bill that would parsee this government belatedly recognising the impact and the negative consequences of climate change and actually doing the right thing and ratifying the Kyoto protocol. I think the Montreal protocol showed that the international community working together can have a major influence on serious global environmental issues and I think ratification of the Kyoto protocol would show this government belatedly accepting the need for Australia to join again with the rest of the international community in dealing with a major environmental issue confronting mankind today.",126
228,Mr SLIPPER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,It is widely recognised by the Australian community that the coalition government is the greenest government in Australia's history. Ms George-You have got to be joking!,129
229,Mr SLIPPER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I am not joking, my friend. Since 1996 we have spent an unprecedented amount of money repairing the impact of 200 years of European settlement in this country. We have had the Natural Heritage Trust and an enormous range of other objectives, and the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill 2005 is yet another way that the Howard government is doing what it can to make sure we appreciate collectively as a country that we do hold our nation in trust for future tions. Australia is performing strongly in moves to phase out the use of hydrochlorofluorocarbons-HCFCs-as set out in the internationally accepted standards of the Montreal protocol. It follows our commendable results in phasing out other more harmful ozonedepleting gases. Chlorofluorocarbons, the propellants that were so talked about in the 1980s, have not been in use in Australia since 1996, the year that the Labor government was swept from the Treasury benches and a year ahead of the time frames of the Montreal schedule. The almost as equally damaging gas, halon, once used as a coolant in refrigerators and fire-extinguishing systems, has not been used in this country since 1993, also a year ahead of the Montreal timetable. I am not, however, suggesting that side of politics has a monopoly on interest our environment. I believe that one of the important steps forward in recent years has been that everyone, both in the political arena and more generally, has appreciated that as a nation we simply could not go on as we were and that we had to look very closely at our environment and appreciate that obviously we must make sure that the environment is appropriate for succeeding generations of Australians. Methyl chloroformused as a solvent for adhesives and for metal degreasing-was phased out completely by 1996. These three examples give some indication as to how serious Australia is to end use of ozone-depleting gases for the good of the environment. The Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill 2005 will further help Australia's efforts by improving the licensing and administration of the guidelines for importers and exporters of hydrochlorofluorocarbons or used methyl bromide. The bill proposes to amend the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Mangeneraagement Act 1989 by modifying the requirement of importers and exporters of these two gases so that they only require a used substances licence. This mirrors similar actions taken for chlorofluorocarbonsCFCs-and halons, which I mentioned earlier and which are both now out of circulation-quite appropriately-in this country. The bill will effectively have the licensing requirements for importers of HCFCs and methyl bromide gas. Those who may be wondering about the impact of the amendments can rest easy knowing that the environmental protection afforded by the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act 1989 will not be compromised in any way by the amendments currently before the House. The bill will help fix what is largely a numthis ber of anomalies that were overlooked durin ing the drafting of the legislation in 1989. I honestly do not know why so many mistakes have been made in the drafting of legislation over the years. I know that our parliamentary draftsmen do have a very high degree of skill, but it is frustrating to see that it is necessary on so many occasions to dot the i's and cross the t's and finetune the provisions of legislation which has been enacted in earlier times. The bill will also ensure reporting conditions for synthetic greenhouse gases that are manufactured in Australia come into line with reporting conditions currently required for imported and exported synthetic greenthe house gases. Hydrochlorofluorocarbons have between one per cent and 10 per cent the ozone-depleting effect of the CFCs that they replaced one decade ago. Usage in Australia of methyl bromide, which is mainly used as a soil fumigant, has been cut back dramatically, by about 70 per cent of 1991 levels. Australia is continuing to investigate alternaa tive gases that have no detrimental environmental impact; however, for some purposes there are regrettably still no viable alternatives. The use of these two gases in limited amounts and in controlled situations is, sadly, presently unavoidable. While the government recognises the environmental impacts of these substances, there is also an economic advantage in their usage. HCFCs are still the most commonly used refrigerants, as well as being widely used in foamblowing, fire protection and aerosols, while methyl bromide is used as a solvent and, as I have mentioned, in the fumigation industry. However, the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill 2005 encourages the usage of recycled or used HCFCs and methyl bromide to further reduce the detrimental effect that these gases are acknowledged to have on the environment. Importing of these used or recycled gases is an important factor in the ongoing phasing out of the use of these substances altogether. The second part of the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill 2005 ensures that part of Sydney's valuable historic past is conserved and enhanced. Several landmarks on the harbour reflect the colonial history of the area. They map out the growth of the region in terms of our defence and industry, and the population growth of the young fledgling colony of New South Wales. The areas targeted in this bill include Macquarie Lightstation on South Head, the North Head former artillery school, Woolwich Dock and the adjacent parklands, Snapper Island, Cockatoo Island, the once-bustling marine biological station at Watsons Bay and the defence lands at Middle Head, Georges Heights and Chowder Bay. The amendments put forward in the bill will help enable the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust to continue to develop its plans for beautiful parkland. I understand that local residents have already overwhelmingly voiced their support for a proposal that will see a 2,000 square metre block of land owned by the trust-the site of an unwanted scout hut-allowed to be subdivided and sold off to private purchasers. In some communities, a grand plan such as this might ordinarily attract widespread condemnation, but the Sydney community is an understanding one and it will receive other benefits that balance the sell-off that might appear to outsiders looking into be of somewhat limited value. In return for the scout hut land sale, three houses will be purchased in Markham Close, with the houses to be removed and the land then incorporated into a spectacular headland park. The cooperation of the community and its support for the insightful plans of the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust will enable the development of an attractive parkland that is both practical in terms of sensible land use and a great place for families to enjoy. I listened to the political rhetoric of the honourable member for Throsby when she claimed that the government should ratify the Kyoto protocol. It is not in Australia's interests to ratify that particular protocol. We are meeting the targets which would have been set out in that protocol, so Australia is actually playing its part. We are simply not going to react to some knee-jerk requirement by members of the opposition that we should ratify a protocol that is clearly not in Australia's interests. At the outset I said that the coalition government are the greenest government in Australia's history. We do have a proud record. The environmental situation of this nation is infinitely better now than it was when we were elected to office in 1996 and the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill 2005 adds to that excellent environmental record. I am pleased to be able to commend this bill to the House.",129
230,Mr JENKINS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"It is a pleasure to speak to the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill 2005. As has been outlined, the purpose of this bill is to amend the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act 1999 and the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust Act 2001. Amendments to the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act are of a housekeeping nature. They ensure that a person importing or exporting used hydrochlorofluorocarbons or methyl bromide has either a used substance licence or a controlled substances licencenot both, as could be the case under the existing act-and apply the same controls and reporting requirements to anyone who sets up a synthetic greenhouse gas manufacturing operation in Australia as those applying to synthetic greenhouse gas importers. Amendments to the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust Act will permit the sale of some land Mosman and a land swap to replace lost public space. This is an opportune time to review some of the matters that surround the phenomenon of ozone protection. During my time in this place, I have had a number of opportunities to speak on various bills. Sometimes it is worrying to go back over previous speeches - you may be a little concerned that you did not keep a consistent line. Having had the opportunity to speak on ozone protection legislation in 1988, 1992, 1995 and 1998, there was a great risk that perhaps I had not been consistent. One thing that has happened when reviewing pieces of legislation is that at each step we, as legislators, have had to react to the developing body of scientific knowledge to do with this phenomenon. Sometimes I think that is not understood. Scientific investigation is very dynamic. Tonight I wish to go through some of the things that continue to develop our understanding of ozone depletion in the stratosphere which have led to this body of legislation, culminating in the Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act 1989 that is to be amended by the bill tonight. Governments of both political persuasions have come to grips with this over the last 17 years. When these environmental phenomena are tackled by global cooperation and in an international way we can have great success. This phenomenon came to light in the 1980s. Fortunately, we have seen the global community come together and, through the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer, followed by the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, set down a timetable of achievement, cutting out the production of gases identified as being ozone depleting. I am not going to go over the successes because they have been indicated by a number of people already in this debate. Even if we take the poin sition that the honourable member for Bowman put quite strongly-that industry had cooperated and should get a pat on the back-it should be realised that industry is important and has done its part. If we were to look only at Australia's success in isolation, like any global phenomenon, we would do an injustice to the way in which we are attempting to protect the planet. On this side of the chamber we say that through Kyoto we could achieve for climate change and the greenhouse phenomenon what has arisen through the Montreal protocol. It is incongruous that we have this dichotomy where there has been bipartisan support right throughout the 17 years of the Montreal protocol and the 20 years of the Vienna convention. It was never questioned that we should be doing this in an international way through the cooperation we have seen. Regrettably, when we have seen bipartisan support, we do not really want to go into this territory. But on some of the reviews of the Montreal protocol, this government has tended to side with the United States over, for instance, the Europeans in the way in which implementation timetables have been placed. Traditionally these have been seen to extend the timetables. When Australia decides, it is usually not to go with the earlier target placed on removals by Europeans but to fall into line with the Americans. This is a little disappointing. The Chinese have made considerable strides in meeting their targets and are likely to meet them many years ahead of requirements in the Montreal protocol. The points I want to make today have been touched upon in other contributions. Back in 1988 we were endeavouring to set in place a timetable which countries could sign up to and which industry was comfortable with. Industry had started on the development of replacement gases. At that stage there was not much discussion about which gases might replace the ozone-depleting gases. As things have developed and as alternatives have come on board, we have studied those alternatives and realised some of the phenomena that occur with the release of those gases into the atmosphere and then their percolating up to the stratosphere. We saw industry developing the alternatives: hydrochlorofluorocarbons, or HCFCs; hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs; and perfluorocarbons, or PFCs. We now know these are powerful greenhouse gases. We are now tackling ozone depletion by taking measures leading to ozone protection where it intersects with the phenomenon of climate change. It is very important that we realise there is an interconnection. It makes even more important for the government to understand that, even though this is only one grouping of greenhouse gases, these are important environmental phenomena that are the result of mankind's use of the planet and they have to be tackled in an international and global way. We have to make sure we understand the phenomena created by synthetic greenhouse gases and that we look at the replacement of those gases with more benign substances which can have the same effect. Ammonia has been suggested as an alternative for refrigerants and mineral wool has been suggested as an alternative to plastic insulating foam. There is a further intersect about which I was a little surprised. As reported in the Sydney Morning Herald on 28 April this year, it has been suggested, in the monitoring of the Arctic ozone layer, that ozone depletion was at its worse recorded levels as a result not just of the percolation of ozone depleting gases but also of climate change itself. It is known that the stratospheric clouds that are over both poles in winter have some involvement in the phenomenon of ozone depletion. It is now being suggested that, because of climate change, the concentrations of stratospheric cloud are greater, and therefore ozone depletion is greater. It is now being suggested that ozone depletion is the result of not only greenhouse gases but also climate change. Increasing ozone depletion is not only caused by the greenhouse gases that are used to replace ozone depleting gases but is also a direct result of climate change. In fact, the European Union is investing $27 million in a five-year project to try to understand this phenomenon. Returning to where I commenced tonight, I repeat that understanding of this phenomenon requires continuing scientific study. As we go forward, the overlap is getting greater. Given the stage we find ourselves at, in it terms of our cooperation with the international community over matters to do with climate change, Australia must understand that it is better for us to be in the international cart that is represented by the Kyoto protocol than outside it, because these are cooperative efforts going forward. There is no reason to suggest that a phenomenon that happens in the Northern Hemisphere, which is increasing ozone depletion and creating ozone ‘holes'-which, of course, are not holes but areas with a reduced level of ozone-would not be happening in the Southern Hemisphere. Mr Deputy Speaker Quick, as a Tasmanian you would be aware that the so-called ozone hole in the Antarctic is stretching across not only Tasmania but also mainland Australia. The cost to Australia of not doing anything over the last 17 years would have been astronomical. The direct cost to human health is high, and the cost of the change in habitats and biospheres throughout Australia is also high. We only have to think of the effect of UV rays on plankton in the oceans, and the fine balance in the food chain for aquatic animals, which starts with plankton, to realise that this is a very important area public policy. It is not often understood and it has not been repeated in this debate that what we are talking about in the reduction of the production of the gases is one step. The next step is to realise that there are still a lot of CFCsfor instance, in old refrigerators-which continue to be refrigerants. All lations developed recognise that and have put in place proper procedures for the appropriate removal and storage of these gases from obsolete equipment. But it is often not recognised that some of these gases have very long lives when they reach the stratosphere. It may take anything from months to years for the gases to percolate, but once they get there their lives are over tens of years to hundreds of years. So we are taking action now to attempt to get back to levels measured 40 years ago, which may not happen until the middle of this century. This is an investment to make sure that we are doing things today that will have that longer term advantage. Again, if we contrast this to greenhouse, this is exactly what is being said. These are actions we have to take in our proper stewardship of the environment to ensure that later generations are afforded the protection required. To the extent that these matters require bipartisan agreement I think that, in the main, that has been achieved. The opposition places before the House its concerns, which are set out in the second reading amendment passed by the Senate when it dealt with this legislation before sending it to us for our deliberations. The amendment expresses our absolute disquiet about the length time it has taken to put in place requirements for the appointment of a national industry board, leading to industry regulation and the way in which people working in the industry could be registered to carry out actions under the legislation. If we look at the timeline, we see that it was of not until 31 May that the minister indicated that the Australian Refrigeration Council had been selected to administer the national authorisation and licensing system for the sale, use and handling of refrigerants that are ozone-depleting substances and synthetic greenhouse gases, and it was not until a week later that the details of the licensing scheme the acts and reguwere announced. The opposition acknowledge that transition arrangements have been put in place, but we are reliant on the skills and techniques of those who will be licensed under this act to ensure that we do not have the release of ozone-depleting gases into the atmosphere and then into the stratosphere and that we do not have the release of replacement gases that are now acknowledged as greenhouse gases. That was the point of the 2003 legislation. I think it has been acknowledged throughout the debate that all parties have worked together in this important area of public policy. We understand that we need to solve and ameliorate these problems and acknowledge that the partnership between government and industry will set out these achievements. Many of the uses made of ozone-depleting gases are illustrative of the way our society has developed. Artificial refrigeration and many other uses of these gases have been important to our economy. But it is also an example of the way we have gone about ozone protection that various studies of these pieces of legislation have, importantly, highlighted that this has been of benefit to our economy. So we see yet again an example of where we have the collision of measures being taken that are of benefit to the environment, of benefit to the economy and, because people have an understanding of collective action, of benefit to society. (Time expired)",132
231,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I rise to address the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill 2005. I particularly want to focus the attention House on some of the gross mismanagement of vegetation in Queensland through the Queensland vegetation management legislation and on how the Queensland Labor Party through the leadership of Peter Beattie is failing to deliver what he thought he was going to deliver by his punitive measures. He is failing to deliver the positive outcomes to the ozone that could be delivered with good vegetation management laws. The Premier failed to work cooperatively with the key stakeholders-that is, the land-holders and the regional communities-before he brought that legislation forward. Yes, he went out to see them, and I was involved in some of the visits to parts of my electorate. But he failed in that process and, in the end, he just brought his legislation forward with little concern for the impact it would have on local landholders. Our environment is part of our heritage, and it is important that we protect it for future generations. That is undisputed. Australia houses several unique environmental wonders of the world, including the Great Barrier Reef, the Daintree rainforests and, at the back of my electorate, the Simpson Desert-another one of those great unique features of our landscape. Let us not forget the Lake Eyre basin and Lake Eyre itself-what a unique feature that is-the Queensland Mitchell grass plains and the brigalow lands. The Darling Downs is unique as an agricultural land in the Southern Hemisphere because of its features, its soil type and the richness of it. In the west of my electorate is the great Channel Country, where the inland rivers flow, and, of course, there is the Murray-Darling Basin. All have unique vegetation, unique features and unique animal life. Last week we saw the launch of National Bilby Day in this parliament. The bilby is a wonderful little of the mammal that has for many years survived non-native predators like wild cats and foxes that have been introduced into Australia. Thank goodness for those people from my electorate, who were down in Canberra last week, who have done a tremendous job in protecting the bilby and establishing an ecosystem where they can breed in a natural environment. It is a fact that land-holders across Australia have been working since very early settlement to manage our native vegetation. Australia's natural environment and landscape is one of the biggest drawcards in attracting both domestic and international tourists to our wonderful environmental features. The latest figures, for instance-and this demonstrates just how important our environment is-show that tourism contributes substantially to Australia's economy. Tourism is a $73 billion industry, which employs more than half a million Australians, with over 200,000 of those in regional areas. Mr Jenkins- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order: whilst these matters might be of interest, I do not think they relate to the bill. The long title is ‘A Bill for an to amend the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act 1989 and to make changes relating to the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust, and for related purposes'.",135
232,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"The parts I heard of the debate referred to greenhouse gas and emissions, but I will listen to the member's contribution. I ask the member to make sure that he refers to the contents of the bill.",136
233,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I just say to the honourable member that I am demonstrating the uniqueness of some of our environment and how we should protect it, because it does contribute to the ozone layer, and how through protecting our vegetation in our rural areas it will contribute to the protection of the ozone layer. I am just highlighting an issue relating to tourism. The health of the ozone layer is important to tourism as well as to good vegetation management. To complete what I was saying about the tourism industry, tourism earns something like $17.3 billion. Australia earns more export dollars-and this is interesting-from tourism than from the export of coal and wool combined. The honourable member might just reflect on that for a moment, because we know that coal is one of those energy sources that is not a positive on our environment or the ozone. We know we cannot live without it at the moment; it is important. So, when you consider that tourism can replace some of these exports over time, tourism will be a great economic driver for the nation. I just point that out to the House and for the honourable member in the face of his intervention. The government in Queensland introduced into the parliament the Vegetation Management Amendment Bill, which was legislating Act to ban broad-scale tree clearing of remnant native vegetation by December 2006. There were several purposes for that legislation, one of which was to contribute to greenhouse abatement. That was one of the Premier's intentions. It is a known fact that trees contribute to reducing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and, hence, the potential to minimise the ozone being further damaged by industry emission sources such as motor vehicles, which we all obviously drive, factories and coal fired power stations. So trees play an important part in the environment and an important part in contributing to greenhouse abatement. The Queensland government's vegetation management legislation-I will be kind and say ‘inadvertently'-is having a detrimental impact on the environmental ecosystems of parts of Queensland. The only reason I can see for the Premier acting in the way he did is that he was after Greens preferences. He was not really considering ozone; he was after preferences. He should have had that foremost in his mind in addition to his being able to work in a positive and cooperative manner with the land-holders of Queensland. Had he been prepared to work with the landholders of Queensland and get suitable vegetation management laws in place, it would have been a win-win for both the ozone layer and the livelihoods of land-holders. If the Queensland government had worked with land-holders, there would have been a positive outcome for the regional towns as well, because they are just so dependent on the jobs created by the enterprises on the farm lands, the pastoral lands, around those towns. On a recent visit to Quilpie in the west of my electorate-I was there with my parliamentary colleague Senator Ron Boswell, the Leader of The Nationals in the Senate-I inspected a property in the mulga lands where the legislation in Queensland is having a detrimental effect. I have linked trees the ozone, so I think I have the right to continue pointing out where bad laws will have a detrimental impact on the ozone. Stephen Tully is a well-respected and knowledgeable land-holder. He is a descendent of some of the first settlers in the Quilpie region. The families of some of the first settlers are there. They have been there since 1874. We toured parts of his property and, of course, as we all know, that part of Queensland is in exceptional drought. It has been in exceptional drought for the last two years. It will have to be rolled into a third year. We would all love to see rain so that is not necessarybut it looks as though it will be. There has been some rain in the region, but not exceptional drought-breaking rain. On Mr Tully's property the grasses have been eaten out and have not been able to regenerate because of the exceptional drought. Mr Tully, his family and a large number of the pastoralists in that region have harvested mulga trees, which are a source of fodder and nutriment for animals in times of drought. A lot of the land in western Queensland has been mapped by satellites. These satellites are a wonderful tool for all of us, but they are inaccurately describing some of the vegetation on Mr Tully's property. Some mulga trees are described as ‘bastard mulga' when in fact they are not in that region; they are elsewhere on the property. In order for Mr Tully and other landholders in the mulga ecosystems of western Queensland to sustain their stock, as they have done for more than a hundred yearsthe mulga regenerates in the good seasons and is conserved for the bad seasons-they have to harvest that timber. They would have harvested it in the early days with an axe. Later on it would have been with a chainsaw, and then with a tractor. While in some cases that practice is still allowed under a permit, it is becoming more difficult day by day and to year by year as a result of the legislation introduced by the Queensland Labor government, under the premiership of Peter Beattie. One of the aspects of harvesting mulga is that when the trees or the low branches are laid on the ground they protect the soil. We have only got to look at a mulch system in still our own garden to see that when we put mulch on top of the ground we protect the soil and conserve moisture underneath it. Mr Tully was able to show us that, with the last few years of limited rains, trees have been harvested for their fodder but underneath the branches that remain-which have been acting like a mulch-new green plants were emerging. They had germinated. They were also protected from the livestock. So what you have here is some grass and some weeds coming through. It will grow through the mulch if the tree or its branches are allowed to remain on the ground. The mulch also creates a ground cover, which prevents erosion when the rains come. Mr Tully was able to show us how he and his forebears-his family-have successfully used mulga since the late 1890s. They only harvest it when they want to use it as drought fodder. Another point I want to make in relation to the harvesting of mulga is that, if you do not harvest the mulga, the tree will of course grow to its full height and, as it matures, the leaves become very dry. It cannot produce the same sorts of benefits that a young tree, green grass or crops produce for carbon abatement; it cannot create a carbon sink. So by harvesting the mulga and allowing it to regenerate when the seasons come and by using the fodder harvested to feed drought affected stock, you end up with a win-win situation. To my mind, there is no-one better to determine whether or not mulga should be harvested than the land-holders who have been doing it sustainably for 150-odd years. Why a satellite map should be the only determinant for this outcome, I am not quite sure. It should be used as a useful tool, but it should be used in conjunction with the knowledge of the land-holders and of course the regional bodies who are very involved in the agricultural or the pastoral scene, as in this case. An example of what happens when you do not manage your vegetation was clearly demonstrated right here in Canberra with the bushfires. The national parks were not being managed and we saw the tragic consequences of that with the bushfires. When the wind conditions changed the fires raced towards Canberra and, sadly, people lost their lives and over 500 homes were destroyed. Had the vegetation in the national parks been managed to prevent bushfires, those sorts of consequences would not have occurred. The other element of those fires is that the smoke from them is a net negative for our ozone. If we manage our vegetation-our timber resources and our grasses-we can have a win-win for the environment. I believe that, importantly, the issue is about management rather than about the punitive measures that we have seen introduced into Queensland. The land-holders in Queensland who want to work with government to produce sustainable ecosystems are not in the business of destroying the ecosystem. They are not in the business of wanting to destroy their own livelihoods. It is their livelihood; it is what sustains their families. I know time is short, but I want to move very quickly to the recommendations of the Productivity Commission report which was commissioned by this government in the last term of government. That report, which was brought down in June last year, is titled Impacts of native vegetation and biodiversity regulations. I commend that report to the opposition, because the conclusions are the basis on which I believe we should be looking at vegetation management at a national level. I refer to recommendation 10.3, which reflects what I have been saying about fodder harvesting. It states: Ongoing efforts are required to improve the quality of data and science on which native vegetation and biodiversity policy decisions are based, particularly ‘on-the ground' assessments to test the accuracy of vegetation mapping based on satellite imagery. That is the very point that I was raising in relation to the problems Stephen Tully has been having. That is a recommendation from the Productivity Commission report. All this leads to having a positive outcome on the environment and also on the ozone layer, if we manage our vegetation properly and sustainably. It was found that there needed to be an improvement in the regulatory regimes to enhance the transparency, the consistency and the accountability of decision making. In particular, recommendation 10.4 highlights several possible approaches, and I would commend those to others, because of the limited time. I have here. One of the other recommendations that I believe is particularly important is 10.5. It states: - greater use should be made of the extensive knowledge of landholders and local communities … - some across-the-board rules … could be relaxed and replaced with requirements that meet environmental objectives but which reflect regional environmental characteristics and agricultural practices. That fits in exactly with what I have been talking about in relation to the mulga lands of western Queensland-‘that reflect environmental characteristics and agricultural practices'. Finally, the report also says-and this is important in the vegetation laws of Queensland-that regulations assert authority of ownership over the private property's remnant vegetation. Land-holders are held accountable for the management of the vegetation while being left uncompensated for this ongoing day-today management. Incentives for land-holders to voluntarily manage and conserve native vegetation are therefore undermined. Subsequently, when regulation reduces the private value of landholders or native vegetation, incentives to manage it are diminished. In light of the Productivity Commission report and the comments and the experience of the land-holders of Queensland-and I visited the mulga lands of western Queensland only two weeks ago-I commend to this government and all governments across Australia the work of the Productivity Commission in bringing forward sustainable vegetation management rules.

234,Mr HUNT,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Flinders-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage) (5.55 pm)-in reply-In summarising the debate on theEnvironment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill 2005, I wish to do three things. Firstly, I want to address the points raised by both government and opposition members. Secondly, I wish to address some of the issues more generally in relation to the ozone and synthetic gas amendments. Thirdly, I want to outline some key points in the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust amendments. In looking at this bill-and I wish to thank all of speakers-we have had a series of points from both government and opposition members. I want to address the points raised by the three opposition members: the member for Grayndler, the member for Throsby and the member for Scullin. Their points really fall into two categories, other than a general agreement with the government's policy and approach on ozone protection and endorsement of the actions in relation to the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust. The two criticisms that the members of the opposition have raised fall into these categories: firstly, there has been an attack on the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Ian Campbell, who is currently in Korea having enormous success in leading the international campaign against whaling and getting ready to see his reforms in relation to ozone and synthetic gas come into being. The criticism was that the minister had in some way delayed the appointment of the refrigeration and air conditioning industry board to issue licences for refrigeration and air conditioning. I want to set down that there were two absolutely clear principles which the minister adopted. The first was to make sure that any appointment of a group which would regulate would be contested, that there would not just be a desire but a responsibility to ensure that a critical position such as that was fully and properly contested. The minister was not happy that there was sufficient contestation. He made a very clear, very simple ruling that we had to open it and we had to make sure that there was a proper chance for competition. We had to make sure that that was the case. The second principle which he applied was that he had to be prudent, that we had to see that this was a safe, appropriate body capable of protecting this industry and ensurthe ing that licences were allocated properly. So he had to have the best and they had to be up to standard. For taking time to do that, we make no apology. It is utterly the appropriate thing to do. In the second criticism levelled by our friends in the opposition, they drew a comparison between what Australia is doing in relation to ozone protection-and they acknowledge that it is an outstanding set of activities which go back both to this government and to the previous government; and I recognise the work of the previous government-what it is doing in relation to greenhouse gases. That is the criticism. On both ozone protection and greenhouse gas abatement the Australian government has an outstanding contemporary record. The key thing to remember is that not only is the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act world-leading legislation but also we are achieving our targets in terms of our Montreal and Kyoto protocol obligations in relation to greenhouse gas. Australia is one of the only countries in the world to actually be achieving both our ozone and our greenhouse gas targets. We happen to take exception with the mechanism within the Kyoto protocol because we believe that it could well have a net detrimental effect to the general approach of dealing with climate change and greenhouse gases. But we have met our targets and we are one of the very few Annex 1 or developed world nations to be so doing. We are in an almost unique group to be achieving both our Montreal protocol targets in relation to ozone and the Kyoto protocol targets in relation to greenhouse. That is an exceptional situation. The second point that I want to make today is in relation to the ozone and synthetic gas amendments contained within this bill. We agree and accept that there is a critical need to protect against ozone depletion. That threat is real and tangible, but there is traordinary progress. Australia has performed exceptionally by international standards, and has been progressing very well. The third point is that within the ozone protection element of this bill there are two important amendments. The bill amends and streamlines the licensing requirements for the import or export of used or recycled methyl bromide or hydrochlorofluorocarbons and, in addition, it amends and requires that Australian manufacturers of synthetic greenhouse gases report to the government consistent with the existing requirements for importers and exporters of synthetic greenhouse gases. This brings me to the last part of my summary-the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust amendments. I am delighted to be able to make this summary in the presence of the member for North Sydney, who has fought with absolute ferocity to protect and expand the areas under the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust. When we look at the seven sites of the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust, we apply two key principles to dealing with them. The first key principle is public access-opening these lands to public access for the first time in many cases not just for 10 years, not just for a generation, but forever. That is an extraordinary legacy which will be left by the member for North Sydney, the member for Warringah and others involved in the establishment of the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust. The second principle is in relation to the use of these public areas. This may include use for marine science, marine education and for the community-all of the things for which the community has pushed and which are currently being delivered. The next step is in relation to HMAS Platypus. That submarine base should be turned over as quickly as possible from deex- fence land to the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust. The member for North Sydney has been unstinting. He has set a deadline and we are working to that a deadline. This bill puts forward a practical land swap that is all about protecting the environment, and it delivers on that. Ultimately I thank everyone who has spoken on the bill, both government and opposition. I thank the government speakers, the members for Bowman, Fisher and Maranoa, who talked about the legacy that we leave to future generations. They summarised what we are doing in relation to the ozone amendments and in relation to the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust. It is about leaving a legacy for the next generation, and with that I am delighted to commend the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill 2005 to the House and I urge its speedy passage.",139
235,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,The original question was that the bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Grayndler has moved as an amendment that all words after ‘That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The question now is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question. Question agreed to. Original question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading,141

237,Mr COSTELLO,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,"On indulgence, I will add to an answer that I gave in question time today. I was asked a question today about data stolen in the United States from Card Systems Solutions. It is thought that the fraud apparently started in September 2004 and the National Australia Bank first reported a related suspicious transaction in December 2004. In question time today I said that the National Australia Bank had reported in September, but it in fact was December 2004. NA",141

Question agreed to. FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT BILL 2005 Debate resumed from 21 June. Second Reading,141
239,Mr RUDDOCK,BUSINESS,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Family Law Amendment Bill 2005 is a part of the Howard government's continuing reform of the family law system. The bill contains a range of amendments to the Family Law Act 1975, designed to improve the operation of the current family law system. Some of these are technical amendments intended to improve the act's operation, such as amendments to modernise the terminology used. Other amendments relate to procedural matters, including appeal processes. These amendments to the Family Law Act 1975 are ongoing reforms, separate from the package of family law reforms that respond to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs report, Every picture tells a story. The government has announced part of its response to that report, and I will introduce an exposure draft of legislative amendments shortly for comment. Following its introduction into the House on 1 April last year, the Family Law Amendment Bill was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, which reported in July 2004. The committee recommended that the bill should proceed, subject to a number of amendments. The bill lapsed with the proroguing of parand liament before last year's election and was therefore reintroduced in the other place in March 2005. The recommendations made by the Senate committee have been taken on board and are incorporated in the bill before you. The bill contains amendments to address the issue of parenting orders not working in practice. A number of parenting orders, particularly those made by consent, are found not to actually work. The bill contains amendments to allow a court of its own motion to vary orders relating to children. is aimed at situations where contravention proceedings have arisen because the original parenting order is unworkable and allows the court to fix the problem before it leads to further contravention proceedings. Another important amendment in the bill provides a right for persons who are determined not to be a parent of a child, through DNA testing or by other means, to recover any moneys paid or property transferred for the benefit of that child under maintenance orders. During its passage in another place, both government amendments and Democrat amendments were made to this section. The government proposes to introduce further amendments to remove the Democrat amendments, to ensure that this provision gives a clear and predictable result-that is, if a person is found not to be a parent of a child, and that person has paid child maintenance under a court order for that child, the person can expect to bring a claim in the court that made the original order, and to recover what has been paid, unless there are exceptional circumstances. A number of amendments in this bill clarify the Family Court's powers in a range of areas, including the court's rule-making powers to support the Family Law Rules 2004 which commenced on 29 March 2004, in relation to the ability of the court to change the venue of proceedings and to clarify the effect of offers of settlement. The bill also clarifies a number of issues relating to the operation of appeals. One amendment removes the power of the full court to issue a certificate that no special leave to appeal is needed from the High Court to appeal to that Court where ‘an important question of law or public interest' is involved. This amendment was made in response to a recommendation of the Australian Law Reform Commission with which This the High Court and the Family Court both agreed. The government accepted the recommendation as it considers that the High Court, through the special leave to appeal process, should be in control of what matters are dealt with by that court. The bill provides for the transfer of family law proceedings from state courts of summary jurisdiction-that is, magistrates and local courts, direct to the Federal Magistrates Court on the state courts' own initiative. Many proceedings instituted in state courts in relation to property with a value of over $20,000 or in relation to contested parenting orders will be appropriate for determination by the Federal Magistrates Court. Currently the Family Law Act provides for transfers in such matters from courts of summary jurisdiction on the court's own initiative to the Family Court but not to the Federal Magistrates Court. The Family Court then transfers appropriate matters on to the Federal Magistrates Court. This amendment will enable matters to be transferred directly to the Federal Magistrates Court and therefore reduce delays. The bill also widens the range of matters which can be the subject of private arbitration. Currently the matters that can be dealt with by a private arbitrator under the Family Law Act are limited to matters which relate to property, spousal maintenance and maintenance agreements. The bill expands the scope to include financial agreements and certain orders in relation to superannuation. Parties must consent before matters can be referred to private arbitration. Also included in part 16 of the bill is an amendment to the Bankruptcy Act 1966 to support reforms recently made under the Bankruptcy and Family Law Legislation Amendment Act 2005 that relate to bankruptcy and family law reform. This amendment will ensure that the Family Court of Western Australia, along with the Family Court of Australia, acquires all necessary bankruptcy jurisdictions in concurrent family law proceedings where a party is bankrupt. Part 17 also supplements the reforms that are made in that bill, reinforcing the role of the bankruptcy trustee as representing the interests of all creditors in family law property proceedings where a party is bankrupt or subject to a personal insolvency agreement. The bill also modernises the terminology of the act to terms which are commonly used and widely recognised, thereby increasing the public's understanding of the act and accessibility to family law. This should be particularly beneficial in aiding self-represented litigants. It will no doubt surprise many that the term ‘divorce' does not appear in the act. The term ‘dissolution of marriage' is simply replaced with ‘divorce'. There are a range of other minor amendments in this bill. The government is committed to enhancing and making more accessible and efficient the family law system and this bill is part of the government's commitment to that goal. Full details of the measures contained in this bill are included in the revised explanatory memorandum to the bill, which I table. I commend the bill to the House. Leave granted for second reading debate to continue immediately.",141
240,Mr MCCLELLAND,BUSINESS,"As the Attorney-General indicated, the Family Law Amendment Bill 2005 is very similar to the Family Law Amendment Bill 2004, which was introduced in the last parliament. That bill was examined by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, which made a series of very useful recommendations. Labor is pleased to see that the government has clearly taken on board many of those recommendations in the preparation of the new bill. This has been one of many examples of the Senate committee process facilitating constructive bipartisan work on important policy issues. As with the last bill, Labor welcomes this bill as a positive contribution to improving the existing Family Law Act. This is an omnibus bill dealing with amendments in 16 parts. For the most part this bill is noncontroversial. Many are technical changes that will ease practical difficulties faced by the courts and court users. Part 10 deals with terminology. This may seem trivial, but in fact it is very important that the Family Law Act makes use of plain English. This is, as we note, an area of law that touches more people than almost any other. It is also an area where, as a result of economic circumstances, there are a substantial number of self-represented litigants. If ever there was a case for making an effort to clean up arcane language in our statutes, it is in this act and we commend the government for that. Part 5 would extend the range of matters that can be dealt with through private arbitration. This creates a welcome new pathway for certain cases that do not require the expense and delay of litigation but cannot be resolved through mediation alone. Part 16 cleans up a gap in the recently passed Bankruptcy and Family Law Legislation Amendment Bill to ensure that the Family Court of Western Australia has the same jurisdiction as the Family Court of Australia in the area of crossover between family law and bankruptcy law. There are some parts of the bill that are controversial, and these have been the subject of amendments in the other place. The most important is part 14. This would allow claims for the retrospective recovery of maintenance by a person who finds out later that they are not the child's biological parent. Labor supports the intention of this provision. As I will note shortly, it would have limited application, but we have serious reservations about the sorts of outcomes it could produce if applied too rigidly. In most instances, we are talking here about cases where a mistake has been made as opposed to deliberate deception. That is, we are talking about a case where one person was thought to be the father, and a maintenance order was made requiring them to pay maintenance to the mother to support the child. It is a situation where everyone has shared in the mistaken belief: the mother, the purported father and even the court. The question is really about who should bear the cost of the mistake. A good argument can be made for both sides. The man can rightly say that the maintenance order should never have made and that he should never have been required to pay for a child that is not his. the mother could also argue convincingly that she is incapable of paying all the money back while continuing to support herself and her child or other children in circumstances where a genuine mistake occurred. The Family Court, of course, cannot be required to force a mother and her children into poverty-and should not be required to do soto correct an honest mistake. Labor thinks there is only one fair way to deal with this dilemma, and that is to ensure that there is sufficient judicial discretion to have regard to the entirety of circumstances. In short, every case could be different. In some cases mothers may well be doing it tough, and recovery of the full amount could be disastrous for them and their children. In other cases, the mother might have ended up in a new relationship or in secure employment whereas the purported father may have struggled to find the money to pay the maintenance every fortnight. In some cases it will have been an honest mistake; in others a court would regard seriously circumstances of deliberate deception. In some cases the man will have acted quickly upon finding out that he is not the biological father; in others he may have left it for many years, with the result that recovery will be all the more onerous for the mother. We cannot predict all the permutations that will arise and devise a formula that is fair in all circumstances. We need to trust the authority and wisdom of the courts to closely examine each case and make an appropriate order in the circumstances. For this reason, Labor has been anxious to ensure the bill provides the courts with adequate discretion over the amount that is recovered and how it is to be paid. In the Senate, Labor supported an amendment that would have that effect. It is also important to ensure that, where a mother has been required to repay mainteBut nance under these provisions, she is able, in turn, to recover maintenance from the actual biological father of the child. It would hardly be fair if a mother could be liable to retrospectively repay maintenance when the biological father cannot himself be found accountable. Moreover, in many cases the mother will have forgone other income in reliance on the maintenance. In particular, she will have received less in social security benefits. This makes it all the more important that the mother have a right to retrospectively claim maintenance from the actual father. Labor raised this concern with the Attorney-General's office and we were advised that the Family Law Act already provides the court with the power to award backdated maintenance. We received advice from the Attorney-General's adviser which I will quote for the record and perhaps to assist in some way in the future interpretation of the legislation. The adviser replied: I am advised by our Department that a right for the mother to claim maintenance from the biological father already exists under Division 7 of Part VII of the Family Law Act in respect of children to which the new s66X would apply. Under section 66G of the Act, the court has a wide cretion to make any child maintenance order it considers appropriate against the parent of a child. The period covered and the amount of that order would be a matter for the court, considering the principal object in Division 7 to ensure that children receive a proper level of financial port from their parents. We are satisfied with this explanation. It is the case that section 66G provides a wide discretion for the court to make orders for maintenance, and nothing seems to prevent them making backdated or retrospective orders if that is appropriate. As I said, this goes a long way to easing the concerns that Labor had with this particular provision. I should note here also that this provision does not have as profound an effect as I flagged earlier-to the extent that it is already the case that retrospective repayment of maintenance can be ordered by a court where the maintenance has been paid under the administrative assessment scheme of the Child Support (Assessment) Act, in particular under section 143 of that act. This bill would affect only those cases where the maintenance order has been made under the Family Law Act. We are advised by the Attorney-General's office that only around 2.8 per cent of child support liabilities currently administered by the Child Support Agency arise under Family Law Act maintenance orders-and that figure includes some spousal maintenance orders that would not be affected by this amendment. We are talking about a very small minority of cases that could be affected by this bill. Most of the cases that would be affected by the change are those where the maintenance order was made before 1989. This means that not only does the bill affect a small minority of cases of mistaken paternity but that that minority is clearly defined and ever shrinking. As noted, it is desirable to bring the regime under the Family Law Act into accord dis- with the Child Support (Assessment) Act. Having considered these issues, Labor are inclined to support a change to the Family Law Act that would ensure mistaken paternity cases are dealt with under that act as sup- they are under the child support act. However, where we disagree with the government is on the words used to obtain that objective. We therefore supported the amendment in the Senate because it brings the language of the Family Law Act closer to that of the child support act. In doing so, the court has been given a greater discretion to ensure that mistaken paternity can be dealt with in the manner most just and equitable in the circumstances. In this way, it is an amendment which has improved the bill. The other part of the bill that might be controversial is part 1, concerning the parenting compliance regime. The provision in this part would do two things: provide that the court can order parents to participate in counselling or parenting programs before making orders in enforcement proceedings; and provide the court with the power to amend parenting orders where enforcement proceedings have been brought but either no contravention was found or there was a reasonable excuse for the contravention. With respect to the first of these, it is ready possible for the court to order a couple to participate in counselling or parenting programs in other types of proceedings. This change is extending that power to enforcement proceedings. This is a positive move, as counselling and parenting programs have proven very successful at getting to and resolving the issues at the heart of non-compliance. We as members would have seen many instances of constituents coming in and, in one way or another, expressing their grief about serial non-compliance. It is obviously desirable all round if they can be resolved appropriately. Of course, counselling is not appropriate in all cases, especially where there is a history of violence, but we are isfied that the protections already in the Family Law Act provide sufficient guidance to the court as to when these orders should and should not be made. The second change in this part allows the court to vary parenting orders in enforcement proceedings, even if no contravention is found or there was a reasonable excuse for contravention. This will allow the court to iron out the practical or other problems in parenting orders that gave rise to the complaint of non-compliance. In some cases it will also allow a reasonable excuse for non-compliance, such as an apprehension of violence, to form the basis for a substantive change to the orders. Currently these changes require separate proceedings for variation of orders. It makes a lot of practical sense for courts to be given the power to deal with variation at the same time as hearing enforcement proceedings. The National Network of Women's Legal Services has recommended that this new power be limited to certain cases, such as those where violence is an issue. When this was raised in the Senate committee on the 2004 bill, the Attorney-General's Department aladvised the committee that the court's power would be effectively limited by the considerations the court must always have when making parenting orders: the best interests of the child and the factors set out in section 68F(2). Labor is comfortable with the response provided by the Attorney-General's Department. In summary, although this is a useful bill containing several practical reforms to the workings of the family law system, we did have some concerns with part 14 in its original form. But we believe those concerns have substantially been addressed by the amendment that was made in the Senate. Given that amendment, the opposition will sat- be supporting the bill in the House.",143
241,Mr SLIPPER,BUSINESS,"Fisher) (6.27 pm)Because of the time frame allocated to this debate it is necessary to reduce at the request of the whips the amount of time taken to speak on the Family Law Amendment Bill 2005 to five minutes. I will therefore have to truncate somewhat what I was otherwise going to say. There is probably no area of Australian law which affects people more significantly than family law. Tragically, many marriages in our country collapse. Indeed, I suspect this is the case right around the Western world. It is incumbent on governments, therefore, to have the very best family law system to endeavour to manage, on behalf of families, in the best possible way a situation which is often less than entirely desirable. The Australian government is committed to doing all that it can to ensure that Australian families are given the best possible chance to live their lives with as few unwanted disruptions as possible. The Family Law Amendment Bill 2005 does back up the commitment of the government to ensuring the best possible outcomes for Australian families, particularly given family breakdown. The bill endeavours to ensure that the most vulnerable during these times of immense stress and hardship, the children, are given the best support and protection that can be provided by a legal system. There is a long list of improvements afforded by this bill to the Family Law Act 1975 and, as has been mentioned previously, a number of these changes have come forward as a result of a Senate inquiry report. The amendments are ongoing reforms, as I think the Attorney has pointed out, quite different from the package of family law reforms which will respond to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs report, Every picture tells a story. There will be a government response to that report and legislation will be brought forward, possibly in the form of an exposure draft. The changes in this bill, however, include clarification of the own motion powers of the courts to modify parenting orders and the courts' power to order parties to attend counselling or post-separation parenting programs. There are changes in the provisions relating to the costings as well as offers of settlement to allow aggrieved parties to settle out of court, thereby avoiding the draining expenses of legal costs and further pressure on family members. The bill includes an increase in flexibility in courts in their dealings with parties who breach parenting orders, giving the court power to order a suspended prison sentence. This deterrent will be a useful tool in encouraging the compliance of some family members and there are provisions for sentences to be revoked at a later date. There is simplification of the processes involved with issuing a warrant for a parent who fails to comply with a parenting order and an expansion of the various matters that can be dealt with through private negotiation and arbitration. This will include issues such as superannuation and other financial issues. It also follows up on the desire of government to encourage the use of alternatives to the courts to once again reduce the psychological and financial burdens of the courtroom. There is an ability to change the venue of a proceeding, replicating the powers also available to the High Court and to the Federal Magistrates Court, and clarification of the definitions of those depositions that could be set aside by the court. This becomes relevant when one party has made a submission that has the sole purpose of counteracting or nullifying an existing or anticipated court order. There is an extension of the list of procedural applications for the purpose of the appeal provisions, and provision for the magistrate's court or local court to have the power to transfer Family Court proceedings directly to the Federal Magistrates Court in order to reduce unnecessary delays. The bill includes modernisation and clarification of some of the language in the Family Law Act to make laws more user friendly. For example, the term ‘proceedings for principal relief' is replaced by the term ‘divorce and validity of marriage proceedings'. The amendments in the bill also allowand this may surprise some-the use of the word ‘divorce' in legislation for the first time. There is clarification of guidelines related to when leave to appeal is required and the introduction of power enabling the court to stay or dismiss the appeal where the court is of the opinion that the appellant has not presented a proper ground for the appeal. The bill allows the removal of a timeconsuming procedural hurdle whereby the full court of the Family Court is required to issue the certificate requiring the High Court to hear an appeal. There is a provision that a person who is found by the court not to be a parent of a child will be able to recover the money out laid or the money transferred for the child under a maintenance order-and this is a very important initiative. Whether a person is a parent or not, of course, is most often determined through DNA testing. The bill gives judges of the Family Court the ability to delegate to judicial registrars, allowing them to make orders that vary parenting orders in relation to complying with existing court orders. It ensures that bankruptcy jurisdiction is correctly given to the Family Court of Western Australia, as it is to the Family Court, to supplement reforms made under the Bankruptcy and Family Law Legislation Amendment Bill 2005. It varies the Bankruptcy Act to add a provision previously omitted that limits the application of the Bankruptcy and Family Law Legislation Amendment Bill 2005. In summary-as, alas, my five minutes has almost elapsed-the amendments relate to procedural matters such as appeal processes and improvements and clarification in terminology, all designed to improve the operation of the current family law system. All of these amendments address the issue of parenting orders issued by the court that are failing to deliver on their intended outcomes. These outcomes, as I mentioned at the commencement of this speech, are intended to improve the smooth operation of the Family Law Act 1975, with the overall motivation of protecting parents and children from as many as possible of the difficulties associated with family breakdown. I commend this bill to the House.",146
242,Mr CADMAN,BUSINESS,"I express my disappointment that we have such a short time to speak, but I live in expectation of a wonderful change coming forward from the Attorney-General to the Family Law Act based on the comprehensive inquiry conducted by the members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs. The inquiry report to which I refer is Every picture tells a story. I believe it was a report done over a short period of time and it proposes some substantial changes. I look forward to the government's and the Attorney's response to the recommendations of the committee. I note that the changes in the legislation tonight do move in part in some areas towards the recommendations of that report. Substantially, this legislation is that which was offered to the House prior to the elections and which lapsed with the proroguing of the parliament. We now have that legislation back with some changes. I note in particular that parenting orders are a part of these proposals and that the cost and offers of settlement, enforcement processes and private arbitration, changes of venue and other matters are involved in these changes. I have always considered the Family Law Act would be better entitled the ‘dissolution of marriage act', but that is a personal view and I am pleased to see that in this legislation there are some changes which reflect common usage by replacing references such as ‘dissolution of marriage' with the term ‘divorce', which is simple and easily understood. There is no doubt that in this area of intense human relationships the warfare that is conducted or may be conducted by a smallish percentage of those whose marriage is dissolved or is on the point of breakdown is a terrible thing to see and is a daunting thing to cope with as far as a legislative framework is concerned. I am very pleased to see in this legislation that there is a shift towards the prospect of private arbitration, which can be recommended by the court. I think that is a direction that needs to be pursued and, I hope, will be pursued: firstly, conciliation; then arbitration, if necessary; and finally a court decision at the end of the day. That court decision must be the indication that there has been a final and absolute breakdown and the judge has to make the settlement. Australia has one of most legally interventionist forms of family law in the world. Other parts of the world, generally those of English-speaking traditions, tend to look to a process whereby the partners in the dissolution take greater responsibility for the resoluvalue tion of the problems that they themselves have created, so they are asked to resolve, under supervision, matters such as the custody of the children and the settlement of property. I believe that process is superior to the one that we have pursued for such a long time and I suspect that there will be changes to that process. I note that even in this legischanges lation there is pressure to refer more matters to a federal magistrate. In many ways it is a crazy thing that 60 per cent of the work of the High Court of Australia is taken up by immigration matters-and we have been dealing with immigration matters today. Family law matters are dealt with by a superior court and I do not know that that is necessarily the process that we are looking for. A superior court normally requires rules of evidence along with other very tight rules of the court that cannot be fulfilled by the Family Court. Much of the evidence given in the Family Court is evidence that is untested and simply taken on hearsay. I think unproven evidence is dangerous because it encourages people to make extraordinary claims and statements which do not have to be justified. I note that the costs of and the processes of changing orders are dealt with here. I think it is a very good move to waive the costs and make the changing of court orders a simpler factor, and the compliance problem is in part dealt with too. I look forward to a future occasion when we will deal with substantial changes which have been agreed to by both sides of the House, and with that progress I trust that we and the Attorney, in particular, will be successful in the advances we seek to make.",148
243,Mr FAWCETT,BUSINESS,"I have the same time limit as other speakers have, so rather than go through this bill in detail, item by item, I would like to put it in the context of some of the broader changes that this government is looking to make to families in our society. I would also like to look at some of the linkages of areas that the changes to this bill make to the broader changes that are coming in. The Family Law Amendment Bill 2005 is part of the government's continuing reform of the family law system. The changes that are being proposed will be the most significant in over 30 years. In the budget this year nearly $400 million was put aside over four years as one of the biggest investments to be made in the family law system. Importantly, what we are looking at here are not just changes in legislation. The government are looking to fundamentally change the way that Australia looks at its families, the way we support them in marriage and, where necessary, the way that family breakdowns are then handled. The comprehensive package includes an expansion of services to assist families, as well as changes to the laws and the courts. Together, these changes aim to promote the involvement of both parents in their children's lives, to reduce the impact of conflict on the children and to reduce the enormous emotional and financial costs to families and the community of relationship breakdown and separation. A key part of the government's initiatives is a network of 65 family relationship centres. As well as providing information, advice and dispute resolution, the centres will work closely with other services and agencies and will refer families to the help that they need. One of the key elements of this package is that we are looking to provide the opportunity for families to have a less adversarial approach to dealing with disputes and relationship breakdowns. I am pleased to say that at the moment in Parramatta, in Sydney, family law courts-as their own initiative and using consent by parents rather than legislation-are already seeing terrific developments in terms of a reduction in conflict, a reduction in time in the courts and a reduction in cost as well as better outcomes through an increased level of mediation and the use of direct discussion between parents and judges. The courts are using community and other services to provide the kind of support and counselling that families need. Importantly, these services, under the government's proposed reforms, will have a large proactive element as well as supporting people during separation. The services will also aim to reduce conflict after separation and help non-resident parents maintain contact with their children. The nonresident can be either a mother or a father but, generally speaking, it is a father. I cannot overstate importance of fathers in the lives of their children. These reforms are an important step to making sure that that contact is possible. So while this bill that is being considered today contains important amendments to the Family Law Act 1975, it does not represent the package of law reforms that I have just talked about. But it does provide the start of some enabling legislation which will support those reforms. As other members have mentioned, this legislation has been to the Senate, which proposed a number of amendments which have been incorporated, so today I wish to touch briefly on the aspects of increasing coordination between agencies and services, suspended sentences, disputed parenthood and increased scope for private arbitration. The aspect of coordination with other services is really one of looking at the issue of parenting orders that are not working. As most members of parliament would know, this is one of the significant sources of discontent-in fact, more than that: despairfor many parents who do not have their children resident with them. I welcome these moves in this bill, as the measures underpin the concept of increasing coordination between the courts and other services that can help the two parties come together to reduce the conflict which affects their children. They increase the ability of both parents to have a role in their children's lives. Professor Parkinson, in his report on reforming the child support system, said: There is strong evidence that dealing with separating parents through the legal system alone can entrench conflict, rather than resolve it. Because the government sees that and recognises that, not only through this bill but through other measures, it is continuing to explore the best way to have good outcomes for children. A Griffith University report on children's contact services highlighted the the very good outcomes that the children's contact services have. Through some of the broader reforms I mentioned earlier, the government has committed an additional $17 million to fund 30 new contact services throughout Australia. The bill also talks about suspended sentences. In terms of easing the angst of parents who see that orders that have been made by the court are being breached continually, the option for the courts to be able to impose a suspended sentence means that there is a very real lever that they can use to provide the incentive for the parent who has custody to provide access to the other parent. On the issue of disputed parenthood, I welcome the move to make it easier for people who can prove that they are not the biological parent to reclaim money. A gentleman in my electorate of Wakefield has been in this situation and went bankrupt through the actions of the CSA before it was proved that he is not the father. I notice that Professor Parkinson also highlights this as something that is needed and proposes in his report that, where a court makes an order for repayment of an overpaid amount, that payment should be registered with the Child Support Registrar as a registrable maintenance liability for enforcement. I welcome the increased scope of matters that can be the subject of private arbitration, opportunities to make them less adversarial and to help people achieve better outcomes for them and for their families. In summary, it is important to note that these amendments support the direction in which the government is reforming the family law system. I welcome the fact that we are not just changing rules and legislation but really looking to bring about cultural change in the way we support families and the way the government is committing to a more proactive approach to keeping marriages together in the first place. I commend the bill to the House.",149
244,Mr LINDSAY,BUSINESS,"The Family Law Amendment Bill 2005 contains a mixed bag of amendments. That is not to say that they are not positive, but there is a raft of amendments which are not related other than that they are amendments to the Family Law Act. I would like to speak about giving people who have paid child maintenance incorrectly under a court orderincorrectly because they are not actually the parent of the child-the right to recover moneys paid or property transferred. All of us over the years have received representations from constituents who have paid child support, often for many years, only to find that the child is not theirs. It is a very bitter pill in many circumstances. When the person has sought to recover money paid, that has virtually not been possible. In some circumstances, on presentation of absolute proof of paternity, the Child Support Agency has still been unable or unwilling to address that matter. On behalf of parents in Townsville in that situation, I am very pleased to support this amendment to the Family Law Act. There was quite a celebrated appeal case in Victoria last year. It related to a person who had discovered that he was the biological father of only one of his three children and had paid child support for seven years. The judge in the Victorian County Court found that the person's former wife had knowingly lied when filling out the birth certificates for her two youngest children, who had been fathered by a family friend. That case raises a number of very 21st century questions. Should any man, rich or poor, be made financially responsible for a child found not to be biologically his? Should courts hold mothers accountable when they make false statements regarding paternity? That inevitably leads to deeper questions of what defines a father-child raising or genes? In my view and I think in the view of the government, the father is the biological father of a child. It is appropriate that we address this because every day in Australia at least 10 men open their mail to find the potentially explosive results of a DNA paternity test. Between two and three will receive the unhappy news that they are not the biological father of their child. Fortunately it is now possible to determine with virtually foolproof accuracy whether someone is the father of a child. I also note that one in four men taking a paternity test in Australia discovers that he is not the father of his children. According to a US survey, up to 30 per cent of unwed mothers who sign affidavits of paternity name the wrong man as the father. That is why it is important that it be made clear that a person who is not the biological father of a child should not be responsible for child support payments. I thank the Labor Party for supporting this very important principle. I am aware that the Democrats tried to amend the government's legislation, basically saying that this amendment should not be passed because it is not in the best interests of the child, but is very much in the best interests of a person's biological children. So I thank the Labor Party for changing their view and supporting the government on this amendment. This will be widely supported in my electorate in Townsville and Thuringowa. I appreciate the privilege of supporting this bill in the House tonight.",151
245,Mr RICHARDSON,BUSINESS,"I rise today in support of the Family Law Amendment Bill 2005. The first amendment in this bill inserts an additional part 17 to schedule 1 of the original legislation. The purpose of this insertion is to correct an oversight. The amendments are designed to limit the role of third-party creditors in family property proceedings in cases where the trustee in bankruptcy can appropriately represent the interests of third-party creditors in those proceedings. The second series of amendments included in this bill propose to amend section 66X in part XIV of the act. The changes would allow the recovery of child maintenance paid or property transferred under a Family Court order in cases where a person is later found not liable for child support. This would apply, for example, where a paternity test later confirms that a father who has been paying child support is in fact not the father of the child he has been supporting. In this case, under the current system the father may have paid out tens of thousands of dollars in supporting a child and would instantly lose any access rights he had to that child. This legislation makes the situation much fairer for de facto couples in relation to property settlements. Under the current legislation in South Australia, a de facto couple must live together in a de facto relationship for three years, or have a child, before the courts can intervene to make an order in relait tion to property. For example, an individual in South Australia may have owned their own home for some years and, after the birth of their child to their partner, the de facto partner and the child of the relationship may move into their home. If that relationship were to break down six months later, the mother may have a claim over half the house by virtue of having a child with her de facto. Under this legislation, if a court order were made that there was an entitlement to a percentage of the property, any moneys paid out would be recoverable in the event that the home owner was later found not to be the parent of the child. There is no doubt that relationships are difficult, and they are even more difficult when children are involved. The breakdown of relationships in these circumstances is devastating to all parties involved. This legislation is about making the law that little bit fairer. At the end of the day, no amount of legislation is going to stop parties to a failed relationship from feeling hurt and angry. All we can do as legislators is make the basis for those situations as fair as possible. At the end of the day, if an individual has been financially and emotionally responsible for a child, only to find out that the child was not their responsibility, they should have a right to recover what they have lost. No law can ever help them to recover the emotional costs, but we should enable them to recover what they have mistakenly out laid financially. While this government feels it is important to enable the recovery of financial outlays in situations where a party is deemed at a later time not to be liable for child support, we accept that every situation is different. Accordingly, this bill also seeks, through the amendments to section 66X, to introduce a provision which will allow the court to order only partial repayment in cases where child support has been wrongfully paid. However it is important to note that, with this provision, the court will only be able to make such an order in cases where there are exceptional circumstances. An example of exceptional circumstances is where recovery of the child support paid in error would result in the bankruptcy of the mother. For the reasons I have outlined, it is important that this provithat sion only be available in exceptional circumstances. This bill and these amendments are about making the law fair and it should be only in very exceptional circumstances that that fairness is taken away. In considering the exceptional circumstances provision, it must be remembered that paying child support is often a very heavy financial burden. An individual who has struggled to meet that burden for years, only to discover it was not his burden to bear, should have his right to recovery altered only where the circumstances are exceptional. Another government amendment being sought to section 66X relates to the Child Support Agency. This amendment makes it clear that any application for the repayment of child support outlined in this legislation must be against the mother, not the Child Support Agency. The Child Support Agency attempts to intervene in situations which are exceptionally complicated and which are influenced by a very high level of emotion. Those working at the agency make decisions based on the information which is available to them at the time. These changes seek to protect the Child Support Agency from action to recover child support under these amendments. These amendments make it clear that actions for the recovery of incorrectly paid child support must be taken against the mother involved. These changes are not meant to penalise single mothers and will not affect the large majority of them. I have no doubt that the cases where these new laws are invoked will be rare, but we cannot ignore the fact that these cases do occur, and we have a responsibility to those who suffer in these circumstances to do the right thing. These amendments are necessary to ensure there is equality in our family law system and to ensure those who come in contact with the family law system have faith that the outcomes will be just and fair. The Howard government is committed to improving outcomes in the family law system. We will continue to introduce further major reforms in accordance with the committee report entitled Every picture tells a story. We will continue to do all that we can to ensure the family law system provides appropriate and just outcomes for all who come in contact with it. No government can make the separation of a family an easy thing-we do not for a moment fool ourselves into thinking that we can-but these changes and the raft of changes that this government will introduce are aimed at making the system as fair as possible and at assisting families in what are exceptionally difficult times. I commend the bill to the House.",152
246,Mr MICHAEL FERGUSON,BUSINESS,"I rise to speak on the Family Law Amendment Bill 2005. Anybody who knows me in this place or in my community knows that I very much believe in the importance of the family unit. I believe in doing everything we can as individuals, as a government and, indeed, as a parliament to support families, especially children. The bill we are debating tonight contains a range of amendments to the Family Law Act 1975. The bill is designed to improve the operation of the current family law system. Some amendments in the bill, such as those that modernise the terminology used, are technical and are intended to improve the act's operation. Other amendments relate to procedural matters, including the appeals process, and the Attorney-General has covered those extremely well. Families are the cornerstone of society, and they certainly are the cornerstone of Australian society. I do not think there is a person in this place, despite the different brands of politics that we might follow, who would disagree with those statements. It is so important that we get a perspective on this and that we recognise that, since the introduction of the Family Law Act in 1975, in the Whitlam era, we have seen a growth in the rates of divorce in Australia that probably nobody in the parliament of that day would ever have expected to see. That brings great sadness to me. I recognise that families, and indeed relationships between adults, break down for all sorts of reasons, and I reluctantly say that sometimes it is probably for good reason. However, if we are to be honest with ourselves and with each other it has to be said that families are breaking down far too often in this country. While politicians will never be in a position to dictate the relaand tionships that people share and the way in which homes and families can function in the future, we do have a responsibility to make sure that we have covered ourselves and are satisfied that we have provided families with the support they need. An example that springs to mind is one in which a government policy, and I will not try to think of one, may put more pressure on families. If that were to happen, we in this place would have to take some of the blame for some of the growth in the rates of family breakdown. This is not a political point, other than to say that everything we do here that will have an impact on families has to be very carefully scrutinised as to the consequences it will have in homes around Australia. As this bill relates to the Family Law Act, I would like to touch on the issue of access after divorce or separation. I have spoken in this House before on the need for children to have both male and female role models. We need to make it fair and equitable for both a mother and a father to have fair access to children after a relationship has broken down. I feel it is appropriate at this stage to acknowledge a letter I recently received in relation to the growing movement of people who are crying out for change to the Child Support Scheme and the Family Law Act. I quote from my correspondent's letter in which he said: I am writing to you to add my voice to the growing movement of people who are crying out for change to the Child Support scheme and the Family Law Act. There is almost an epidemic of family separation going on and there has to be a fairer outcome available not only for the parents but most importantly for the children. All children of separated parents should be able to see both their mother and father as close to equal time as possible. This just does not happen at the moment. The norm has been for mum to keep the kids with her quite often she keeps the house etc. and dad is lucky if he sees the kids every second weekend. If the mum chooses to be adversarial she can withdraw the kids from their father. Dad keeps paying child support and he doesn't get to see his children. It is very important to recognise that this letter came from a man in a situation where his former partner is cooperative and has a respect for the children that means there is not the conflict between them as he has described. He has himself said to me that he enjoys fair access to his children. His point, I think, is that he is scared to think what could happen if that were not the case, how devastated he would be, the sense of loss he would experience and the sense of loss of his dren were they not in a position to enjoy a healthy relationship with their dad. I think we all know of cases where his example is true. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs report entitled Every picture tells a story: inquiry into child custody arrangements in the event of family separation is provocative reading. It provides very important recommendations relating to the custody of children after broken relationships. It is clear that the committee kept the best interests of children in mind when they listened to witnesses, took submissions, made deliberations and, finally, made recommendations. I was very delighted to see the Attorney General make a public statement earlier this year in which he said that the government's agenda in this regard, in responding to this report, means that we will see the biggest ever investment in the family law system in Australia and that the government's proposed changes will bring about not just tinkering but generational change in how family conflicts are managed in the future following a separation. I am very encouraged to see a growing movement towards mediation rather than litigation. That is a very healthy move. very sad to read the minister's observation that as many as one in four children from separated families will see one parent once a year or not at all. These changes to the law will recognise the rights and needs of children and, importantly, the right of a child know both his or her parents. I am also greatly encouraged to see a commitment to open a network of 65 family relationship centres around Australia. I suspect that not many people at this stage appreciate how significant these family relationship centres will be. I think we are in for exciting times. I know the Attorney-General and the Minchil- ister for Family and Community Services have been very receptive to suggestions as to how they could function in the future. I and some of my colleagues have made public our view that these family relationship centres should not in practice, or indeed in a perceptive sense, be seen as divorce shops, as avenues or first stepping stones that you must overcome in order to achieve a divorce. A good many people would like to see these family relationship centres as places where families can go for advice, referrals or even counselling, not with a view to achieving a divorce but with a view to strengthening their relationships and marriages and provide an even better atmosphere for children to be nurtured to grow into healthy young Aussies. Coming to the end of my remarks tonight, I would like to congratulate the government on the work it is doing. I am very proud to be a member of this government. I said in my first speech in this place, standing where I am tonight, that I believe the rate of family breakdown in this country must be identified. It must be addressed and, if we can, it must be reversed. A final observation I make tonight is that this country has come a very long way in its attitude to family breakdown since 1975. It has been said to me that in 1975, when this legislation was first debated, I was even Paul Keating as a backbencher voted against it. I do not think we are yet settled in this country on our final views on family breakdown. We as a government and I as a member will always respect the various reasons that families cannot survive. But where to they can survive we will continue to hold the family up as the ideal and something that should be supported. With those remarks I commend the bill to the House.",153
247,Mr BARTLETT,BUSINESS,"Too often we hear and see the tragic consequences of relationship breakdown. Too often children, despite the best efforts of their parents and the courts, suffer as a result of these breakdowns. All of us in this place want to believe that we can help those in need-that somehow we can come up with the right outcomes and that somehow we can fix people's problems. But with family breakdowns we can never really achieve this. There is no magical legislative outcome or formula to alleviate the pain of relationship breakdown. The Family Law Amendment Bill 2005, while it cannot ameliorate the pain or rectify all the problems, will at least correct some of the anomalies in the Family Law Act 1975. It is an important step forward and it is evidence of this government's determination to monitor what is happening, adjust the law to meet society's expectations and address some of the concerns and grievances. In the past I have been quite a critic of many aspects of family law and the operations of the Child Support Agency. While I would have liked to have seen some of these issues debated earlier in this place, I am very pleased that we are doing so now and that the Attorney-General has brought this legislation forward. The bill makes a number of technical amendments intended to improve the operation of the act. For instance, it deals with enforcement of court orders. It introduces the term ‘divorce' and also, and in my view this is very significant, allows for a person to recover child support payments made when they are found not liable-that is, when they are later found to have, in fact, not been the parent of the child. On this point, I really want to make it clear that taking child support maintenance from someone who does not have a moral obligation to pay it cannot be condoned. It is bad enough for someone to be emotionally duped into falsely believing that they are the parent of a child, but to add a financial burden to this is an additional and unforgivable insult. At least now there will be some opportunity for financial redress by allowing the courts to make orders to recover payments or transferred property when there is no liability for a child. We can see the start of justice in this area. The bill widens the range of matters that can be the subject of private arbitration, and this is also a very positive step. For instance, financial agreements and certain orders relating to superannuation will now be able to be arbitrated. The bill will remove some of the adversarial judicial features from the current arrangements and therefore prevent some of the destructive actions that often occur. The bill provides for the transfer of family law proceedings-for instance, from state courts directly to the Federal Magistrates Courton the state court's own initiative. This will potentially save large sums of money and reduce a lot of the delays involved in the court processes. In contemplating any changes, we really have to ask: will these changes make the circumstances less painful for those involved? Are we going some way towards mollifying the damage caused by family breakdown? In asking these questions, the fundamental issue is the best interests of the child. In addition to that, we need to look at the issue of fairthe ness to parents-fairness to parents in custody arrangements, fairness to parents in terms of input into the lives of their children and fairness to parents in the financial contributions that they are called on to make. It is worth differentiating, though, between the changes to the Family Law Act contained in this bill and the more substantial changes that, hopefully, will occur following the parliamentary report Every picture tells a story and the task force review into that report headed by Professor Patrick Parkinson. That report is a very important stepping stone to future family law and child support improvements. For instance, coming out of the recommendations of that report we saw the government's commitment in the last budget of $397 million over the next four years that, hopefully, will bring about a tural change in the way that family breakdowns are handled. Of this allocation, $180 million will go towards establishing 65 family relationship centres. These will be a critical entry point into the family law system and will provide mediation services. They will refer families to other appropriate services. They will reduce the expensive resort of adversarial action through the courts-action that so often exacerbates the bitterness of family breakdown and separation and just intensifies the pain that all parties experience. Other imporBarton, tant changes need to come about as well. The report made a number of recommendations regarding changing the formula for child support arrangements. I know there are many in the community who are distressed by the inadequacies as well as the perceived and, dare I say, actual inequities in the way the child support system currently works. Further changes are needed to revolve around custody and parenting arrangements. All children, except in extreme circumstances, need the input of a father and a mother, particularly in their formative years. All children need to have access to the care, the nurturing and the leadership that a mother and a father can provide. On the other hand, both parents deserve a right to have an input into the lives of the children that they have parented, that they love and that they want to care for. Both parents need to have adequate opportunity to share parenting arrangements and to have that input into the lives of their children. These amendments to the Family Law Act are a first step, but they bring with them some very welcome and overdue changes. I believe that in this place we have the opportunity to make generational changes in both family law and child support. While the amendments that we are debating today do culnot provide those fundamental changes, they are a very positive step in the right direction. I commend the bill to the House, and I look forward to the subsequent improvements that we will see coming out of changes to child support arrangements and to the way that parenting and family law work in this country.",155
248,Mr RUDDOCK,BUSINESS,"in reply-I thank all honourable members who have contributed to the debate on the Family Law Amendment Bill 2005. Firstly, I thank the member for who acknowledged that from time to time there are contributions made by Senate committees. I am hopeful that we will see an opportunity to place more emphasis on members of this House contributing through committee discussions to the improvement of legislation, and to avail myself of the opportunity of receiving that advice. Committees can be very useful if their work is undertaken quickly and delivered in a timely manner and is not used to produce constructive delay for other purposes. I can assure the member for Barton that I am always willing to hear constructive views. If they can improve legislation that I am dealing with, I will take them from any quarterparticularly from the member for Barton, whom I usually find very constructive. Further to the advice that my advisor gave in relation to that reference, I understand that the remedy does exist, as he outlined, but it is clearly a discretionary remedy in the hands of the court to be able to provide. I thank the members for Fisher, Mitchell, Wakefield, Herbert, Kingston, Bass and Macquarie for the issues they raised about our new family relationship centres, the rights of children to know their parents, allegations of violence and enforcement of contact orders. I am gratified by the very wide level of interest in family law issues and the very constructive comments that have been made. It is recognised that the Family Law Amendment Bill 2005 is largely a technical bill. While there are some issues that are important, such as those which allow a court to vary a parenting order of its own making in contravention cases, nevertheless, major reforms will follow the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs report entitled Every picture tells a story. I hope to release shortly an exposure draft containing a range of measures and many of the matters that members have referred to. When I am in a position to release that exposure, I look forward to referring it to one of our House committees so that it can hear the input on the draft. I want that to happen quickly. I am anxious that we should proceed with these measures this year. I do not want to see them delayed unnecessarily. Finally, I foreshadow two government amendments to section 66X that will be moved to the bill in the consideration in detail stage. These amendments will have the effect of removing the amendments that were made in the other place on 20 June. Those amendments allowed the court a very wide discretion to decide how much child maintenance a person could recover. The government sees this discretion as too wide and leading to variable results that would undermine the right of recovery that we are wanting to see in place. The government amendments will allow the court to recognise that in exceptional circumstances it may be appropriate to reduce the amount to be repaid. It is to give the court some direction but it acknowledges that in exceptional circumstances those matters can be addressed. I thank honourable members for their contributions. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.",157
249,Mr RUDDOCK,BUSINESS,"by leave-I move government amendments (1) and (2): (1) Schedule 1, item 136, page 34 (lines 25 to 27), omit “may make such order that it considers just and equitable in the circumstances, including”, substitute “must make such order as it considers just and equitable in the circumstances, for”. (2) Schedule 1, item 136, page 34 (line 28) to page 35 (line 6), omit paragraphs 66X(2)(a) and (b), substitute: (a) if the purported order was of a kind referred to in paragraph 66P(1)(a) or (b)-the repayment to the maintenance provider, by the person to whom the amount or amounts referred to in subparagraph (1)(b)(i) of this section were paid, of an amount up to, or equal to, that amount or the sum of those amounts; or (b) if the purported order was of the kind referred to in paragraph 66P(1)(c)-the return to the maintenance provider of: (i) the property referred to in subparagraph (1)(b)(ii) of this section; or (ii) an amount up to, or equal to, the value of that property. The court may only order the repayment of an amount that is less than the amount, or the sum of the amounts, referred to in subparagraph (1)(b)(i) of this section, or the return of an amount that is less than the value of the property referred to in subparagraph (1)(b)(ii) of this section, in exceptional circumstances. The government is committed to making amendments to the Family Law Act to ensure that fathers have a statutory right to recover certain maintenance payments where they have had no right before. The government's amendments give the right to recover child maintenance in a court having jurisdiction to make the original maintenance order-a right that is presently not available. The right will be offered to people who have paid money that they were not in fact liable to pay. Under current law, all that a person in a situation can do is to seek a civil remedy in a state court using remedies and torts in restitution. It is unfair that a person in this position cannot access the courts that have special expertise in these matters. The advantage of the government amendments is that they will give the parties some certainty as to the likely outcome so that there is a real right of recovery of wrongly paid maintenance in appropriate and relevant circumstances. The current subsection 66X(2), passed in the Senate on the Democrat motion, is for a wide and expanded version of the court's discretion to adjust the amount of child maintenance that can be recovered based on what the court thinks is just and equitable. That provision would look similar to section 143 of the Child Support (Assessment Act) 1989, which allows the court to make such orders as it considers just and equitable for the purposes of adjusting or giving effect to the rights of a party or a concerned. This is a wide and variable discretion which in practical terms means that it is very risky to pursue recovery action because it is very difficult to predict how courts will deal with the application. The government amendment to this provision will ensure that court action under section 66X produces results. It should be obvious that a person in this situation should be able to recover what they have paid unless there are exceptional circumstances for ordering a less than full repayment. The phrase ‘exceptional circumstances' shows up already in sections 66M(4), 68L(2A) and 111CR(3) of the Family Law Act and in subsection 74(4), 74(7), 79(13) and 79(16) of the Bankruptcy Family Law Legislation Amendment Act 2005. It is also used in subsection 17B(1) of the Crimes Act 1914. The government have proposed an amendment which is reasonable. We have preserved the right of recovery but given the court the ability to reduce maintenance in exceptional circumstances. The court could take into account extreme hardship caused by giving recovery, such as the fact that it may force a mother into bankruptcy. Another example of exceptional circumstances might be where a father has insisted on a purported child going to a private school. In such results it should be obvious to parties that the money should be repayable except in exceptional circumstances. I commend the amendment and I present a supplementary explanatory memorandum to the bill.",158
250,Mr MCCLELLAND,BUSINESS,"The opposition will be opposing the amendments but, for the benefit of those who may be considering attending a function this evening, I can indicate that we will not be dividing on them. Essentially, there is a distinction between the Labor opposition and the government with respect to the extent of the court's discretion, and the Attorneychild General fairly put the competing arguments. The amendment moved in the Senate and adopted with the majority vote of the opposition parties there provides that the court would be given a broad discretion-in fact, the wording is ‘to make such order that it considers just and equitable in the circumstances'. Effectively, this gives quite a broad discretion, having regard to what we would anticipate to be common sense provisions. On the other hand, the government's approach has been to have a presumption in favour of recovery, if you like. It is perhaps an appropriate thing that there be a presumption in favour of recovery, but it may be too far on the spectrum to say that that presumption is only displaced in exceptional circumstances. I note that in his concluding comments the Attorney-General gave some guidance as to what may constitute an exceptional circumstance, but effectively there will be a presumption that the moneys will be repaid. This is a complex area. While this bill applies to about 2.8 per cent of cases, I think there will probably be circumstances in the future where DNA technology makes it easier to identify parentage and, in those circumstances, it will be an issue not infrequently coming before the courts-certainly not infrequently coming before the Child Support Agency. We believe that commonality between the respective provisions is desirable, but we would obviously oppose the government amendments so that the amendments moved in the other place stand. Having said that, I think from a broader perspective there probably does need to be a review of the situation downstream. Obviously the government amendments will succeed in this House and ultimately we will pass the legislation in the Senate, because it is desirable legislation. But downstream I think there will need to be recognition that perhaps an innocent party in all of this will be the children who have benefited from financial contributions from a man who was not their father but, nonetheless, in circumstances where there was not appropriate recovery from the actual father. Consideration should perhaps be given to whether there is justification, for instance, for supplementing social security payments or a right on behalf of that family and/or child specifically to recover moneys that otherwise would have been payable with respect to social security. These are issues that may require revisiting and review as the effect of the legislation becomes apparent. I flag those but formally, as I said, oppose the government amendments.",159
251,Mr RUDDOCK,BUSINESS,"I thank the honourable member for his indication as to how the matter might progress. I simply say that I obviously do not foreclose looking at these issues if experience suggests the measures have not operated as the government intended. The point I made in the earlier clarification was that the person who is ultimately responsible as a partner for the bringing of the child into the world may of course pick up some of those responsibilities. We will see how it works out in practice. Question agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Third Reading",160

253,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being approximately 7.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Workplace Relations",160
254,Mr ALBANESE,ADJOURNMENT,"Grayndler) (7.29 pm)I rise to draw members' attention to the harsh realities that face workers in my electorate and around Australia under the Howard government. I want to use the example, with his permission, of David Noel Thomas, a constituent in my electorate recently retired from his job after 48 years of service as a semitrailer driver for WM Jago and Sons. When he left the workplace David's employer threw him a farewell party and he was told that his entitlements would be available for him to collect the next day. David Thomas returned the next day only to be told that the cheque had not yet been signed. Following a week of fruitless phone calls, fob-offs and contradictory stories, David returned to the office where he was told by the store manager, ‘I have bad news for you: they have the administrators in.' David Thomas is still waiting for $25,500 in entitlements that are owed to him. Ken Day also worked for the same employer, giving 32 years of service and is accordingly owed approximately $32,000 in long service and other leave entitlements. David and Ken's former colleagues are also still awaiting their entitlements. David has since made an application to the General Employment Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme, GEERS, for his outstanding entitlements. His application to GEERS was rejected outright. He was told that because he retired a week prior to the company going into receivership he was unable to access any assistance under the scheme. After 48 years of service David Thomas is now left to survive on his pension. After a combined 90 years of service, David and Ken have been left high and dry by the failure of the Howard government to adequately legislate to protect entitlements. Innocent workers like Ken and David are left with only financial uncertainty and distress. Instead of protecting workers and ensuring financial security for them and their families, the Howard government intends to reduce their job certainty. This government's proposal to change the unfair dismissal laws to exempt small business and to undermine the job certainty and security of some four million workers is outrageous. This antiworker and, ultimately, antifamily attitude is typical of this government's ideologically indulgent agenda. Employees who have served their probationary period can currently challenge their dismissal in the relevant industrial commission within 21 days, but this right, this basic and fair process of appeal, will be removed under this government's regime. Workers in businesses employing up to 100 people will have no appeal to an industrial commission and new workers will have to serve a double period of probation. The Howard government's proposals could see workers sacked without explanation, perhaps sacked for something they did not do, without recourse to challenging the decision and no way to prove that they did not do it. There will be no warnings for these workers and no justice when they are unfairly sacked. This government intend to see these workers thrown on the scrap heap just as they have done with David Thomas, Ken Day and their former colleagues at WM Jago and Sons. The government's legislation will also remove the right to collectively bargain. David is represented by, and is a proud member of, the Transport Workers Union. Unions have played a proud role in this nation, going back to the very beginning of defending workers in situations such as this, of representing them, but the government is determined to take away that right due to an ideological agenda. The government is also determined to take away minimum wages. In spite of question after question in question time, Mr Speaker, you would recall that we have received no guarantee whatsoever that no worker will be worse off, because the government knows that this will drive down wages particularly for those people who are most vulnerable. There is no justification for this attack on the hard working people of my electorate, workers like David Thomas. Workers and their families deserve protection, they deserve job security and they deserve financial certainty. They do not deserve the Howard government's package of ideologically motivated attacks on their working conditions and, ultimately, on their families. Clerk of the Senate",160
255,Mr CAUSLEY,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight rather reluctantly to speak about an issue that arose out of an article by the Clerk of the Senate, Mr Harry Evans, in the Sydney Morning Herald on 21 June 2005. Mr Speaker, you would realise that I have spoken before about some of the comments that Mr Evans has made on the public record in regard to the parliament, and I have been very concerned each time. I have seen them, but this one arose apparently out of inquiries from the Sydney Morning Herald about committee reports from this parliament which in fact had not been replied to by the government. It is probably interesting to find out why the Sydney Morning Herald made inquiries in the first place; nevertheless Mr Evans, instead of replying to the inquiry, has then put his own view of the world to the Sydney Morning Herald about this establishment of parliament. I would have thought it was the responsibility of the clerks either of the lower house or of the Senate to uphold the principles of this parliamentary democracy, and considering that the Clerk is not prepared to do that I, as Deputy Speaker, feel that I should make some comments. Mr Speaker, if you have a look at part 3, section 10(1)(a) of the Parliamentary Service Act 1999, you will see that it says: ... the Parliamentary Service provides professional advice and support for the Parliament independently of the Executive Government of the Commonwealth ... Part 3, section 10(1)(c) says: ... the Parliamentary Service has the highest cal standards ... Section 12 of the Parliamentary Service Act 1999 says: A Secretary must uphold and promote the Parliamentary Service Values. In my opinion, a clerk of either the House of Representatives or the Senate has no right to go out and make public comments about the parliament. In fact, if you look at some of these comments-and I will quote from the article which in fact Mr Evans has writtenMr Albanese- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I seek your guidance. I know that privilege for an attack such as this would rest in members of parliament, but I wonder whether it is appropriate for an attack such as this to take place on the Clerk of the Senate during an adjournment debate.",162
256,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,The member for Page is in order because he is not talking about a member of the Senate.,162
257,Mr CAUSLEY,ADJOURNMENT,"It is interesting that the member for Grayndler is not prepared to support the parliament either. The Clerk was talking about the founding fathersMr Albanese- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Now the member for Page, the Deputy Speaker, has gone from attacking the Clerk of the Senate to saying",162
258,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,The member for Grayndler will resume his seat. Mr Albanese-I ask that the member for Page withdraw the words that I do not support the parliament. I ask that they be withdrawn.,162
259,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"If the member for Grayndler wishes to join the debate later, he is entitled to,",162
260,Mr CAUSLEY,ADJOURNMENT,"The Clerk says about the founding fathers: Their basic principle, as one of them expressed it, ethiwas that the law-making power should never be vested in a single authority, whether a single man or a single assembly, because that is the definition of tyranny. If you go a little bit further into the article, also says: Giving a monopoly of power to one party is not the essence of good government but, under the way our parties operate, a sure route to corruption and misrule. These are the words of the Clerk of the Senate. I would have thought they were reprehensible to say the least. He also says: ... the Governor General is hired and fired by the Prime Minister; the Prime Minister who is the executive government controls the House of Representatives through an ever-reliable party ity; the Senate has been a restraint on the Prime Minister's will ... So in other words the Clerk of the Senate is attacking the institution again, the highest part of the institution, by saying that, in fact, the Governor General is just a lackey of the Prime Minister. He also goes on to say: ... High Court judges are appointed by the Prime Minister with regard to their ideological persuasion. Now he is attacking the High Court. I find this an extraordinary statement. (Time expired) Drug Action Week",162
261,Mr QUICK,ADJOURNMENT,"It is Drug Action Week and I was pleased to attend the launch by the honourable member for Sturt, Chris Pyne, earlier this week. I know honourable members are busy this week but I was somewhat disappointed to see so few members and senators present at the launch. With the tens of millions of dollars expended by this government and the bipartisan nature of the issue, it would have been wonderful for more of us in this place to be there. What is Drug Action Week? As honourable members would know there are so many worthy causes for us to support and a plethora of coloured ribbons which we wear to show our solidarity with causes such as MS, it motor neurone disease, youth suicide, diabetes, cancer and Daffodil Day et cetera. For me, Drug Action Week is probably one of the most important causes that I support. The week is an annual initiative hosted by the Alcohol and other Drugs Council of Australia. It is the premier event to raise awareness about alcohol and other drug issues in Australia and this year it is being held from 20 to 24 June. The week is part of a host of activities to raise awareness about issues relating to alcomajor- hol and other drugs and to promote the achievement of those people who work to reduce drug related harm. The week also aims to promote public debate about good practice strategies for reducing drug related harm. Each year, Drug Action Week has different theme days to highlight the diversity and complexity of alcohol and other drug issues. The theme days reflect suggestions received from the sector as well as other identified priorities while maintaining the core themes of prevention, treatment and Indigenous Australians. The theme days for 2005 are: Monday, young people; Tuesday, treatment; today, prevention; tomorrow, Indigenous Australians, and Friday, consumers and carers. Alcohol remains the most commonly used psychoactive drug in Australia, with 2001 data showing that over 80 per cent of the population aged 14 years and older consumed alcohol in the previous 12 months. The proportion of the population who used any illicit substance in the previous 12 months was 14.27 per cent. Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit substance with 33.1 per cent of Australians aged 14 and older having used cannabis at some time in their lives. Alcohol misuse and tobacco use are overwhelmingly the cause of most drug related morbidity and mortality in this country and are therefore associated with the greatest social costs. Of the estimated $34.4 billion in costs attributed to problematic drug use each year, alcohol and tobacco combined account for more than $28 billion, with over $21 billion of these costs related to tobacco use. As someone who represents an electorate that contains both a rural as well as an urban component, I am concerned with the following statistics. Rates of smoking are up to 25 per cent higher in rural areas and the proportion of smokers outside of major cities has not decreased in recent years. In 2001, females in inner and outer regional areas were 1.15 and 1.27 times as likely to smoke as females in major cities. Younger males in outer regional areas have been shown to be 1.3 times as likely to smoke as males in major cities. Finally, males in regional areas were more likely to engage in risky alcohol consumption than males in major cities. These are rather startling figures and when said quickly can easily be glossed over. These figures are why programs and campaigns should focus on regional areas, to start making inroads into such risky and costly behaviour. These figures are a cost to Australian society in many ways: hospitalisation, family dislocation, road trauma, suicide, lost productivity, diminished life spans, domestic violence and so on. It is hard to imagine that so much distress can come from the two most commonly accepted and legal drugs in our community, yet we persist in hiding behind the myth of legality and shade our eyes from the destruction caused by misuse of alcohol and tobacco. This year 640 separate events make Drug Action Week the biggest ever, compared to last year's 450 events. It is my fervent hope that this year Drug Action Week will open the eyes of many Australians to the damage done, and that they will take the necessary steps to substantially reduce their abuse of alcohol, tobacco or illicit substances. Pooh Corner",163
262,Mr JOHNSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Ryan) (7.44 pm)Tonight in the parliament, I want to speak about Pooh Corner in the western suburbs of Brisbane. On 21 April, the federal government announced that it intended to transfer the ownership of Pooh Corner from the Department of Defence to the Brisbane City Council for the nominal sum of $1. I want to take this opportunity again to congratulate and commend the federal government and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence for being involved in this transaction and for making it happen. The alternative-namely, the sale of Pooh Corner to private developers for the purpose of highdensity residential living-was not acceptable to me or the local community. In my capacity as the federal member for Ryan, I was pleased to have played a small part in lobbying the parliamentary secretary and the government to see through some of the difficulties that existed and to ensure that the transfer of the land to the local Brisbane City Council could take place smoothly. I want to speak about Pooh Corner for two particular reasons. The first reason is that it is a fine example of where a genuine and relevant local community organisation and its members can work with their local federal member to achieve a very good outcome for the wider community. The second reason is that it is a fine example of how the federal government and the Brisbane City Council can work together for the good of the people they both represent in their respective ways. Pooh Corner is a very special piece of land just outside my Ryan electorate. It is adjacent to the Ipswich Motorway, Sanananda Barracks and the Centenary Highway. The Ryan suburbs of Riverhills, Middle Park and Jamboree Heights are only minutes away by car from Pooh Corner's peaceful and serene environment. I was very pleased to be able to support the many Ryan residents who contacted my office to ask for my support in this matter. Pooh Corner is about 1.4 square kilometres in size and has a very high conservation value. It is a piece of real estate that is home to a large population of eastern grey kangaroos that are frequently seen eating and relaxing near Wacol Station Road. It is also a site that is home to 26 species of animals and 16 plant species that are rare vulnerable. Clearly, the size of the land and the nature of the land meant that Pooh Corner had to be protected and preserved not only for the future residents of my Ryan electorate but for other people of Brisbane. I mention again that the April announcement about Pooh Corner's future would have been a great relief to the wider community. The alternative, as I said, was that it would be sold to private developers. It was going to be put on the market for sale. Once it was purchased by a local developer, the outcome would have been, first, the decimation of an attractive and valuable piece of family friendly land. Secondly, there would have been a massive increase in the amount of traffic onto the local road network and infracommitted structure following construction of residential homes or units. I campaigned strongly against such a commercial transaction taking place because it was not in the best interests of the local Ryan community. Apart from the major conservation value that the land has, it is very significant that private development on Pooh Corner would have had a tremendously negative impact on the roads in the community. The Ipswich highway and the Centenary Highway, which are very close to Pooh Corner-in fact, adjacent to it-and Moggill Road a bit further down the road are well over capacity. They are in desperate need of major attention. The opposition's policy is simply to upgrade the Ipswich highway. This is, quite frankly, a bandaid solution. Together with the member for Blair, I worked very strongly with the government to come to a long-term solution that will deliver to the people who use the Ipswich Motorway a more sustainable outcome. Centenary Highway and Moggill Road in the Ryan electorate are state roads. I call on the Queensland Labor government to use some of the money from its massive GST funds on the roads in the Ryan electorate. and The Queensland government is awash in funds. It has nearly $8 billion of funds out of an Australian total of $35 billion. It is high time that the Queensland government spent more of this money on the roads in Ryan. Moggill Road is desperately in need of funding. I call on the transport minister and the Queensland Premier to spend more money on the roads. (Time expired) Road Safety",164
263,Mr GEORGANAS,ADJOURNMENT,"This year 68 people have died on South Australian roads already. We had an absolutely horrible month in March, with 27 people being killed, compared with just eight people last year in the same month. The South Australian Labor government has been to reducing that devastating figure and has introduced legislation to crack down on dangerous driving and improve the conditions on our roads. Groups like Neighbourhood Watch, including the Morphettville Neighbourhood Watch group in the electorate of Hindmarsh, have been particularly active in calling for a crackdown on the behaviour of motorists. I am aware of a number of roads within the electorate of Hindmarsh which are used as racetracks by inexperienced and inconsiderate drivers. I am relieved that legislation to stop this sort of behaviour has been introduced by the Rann state Labor government. Since the laws came into effect earlier this year, 176 drivers have been reported and at least eight vehicles impounded. In 108 of those cases, motorists were reported for ‘susbreath tained wheel spin', or burnouts, which have been causing residents sleepless nights for years. The first phase of the reforms was introduced in February and created the new offence of misuse of a vehicle and an offence of failing to obey police orders to reduce noise from a car stereo. Both offences attract a maximum fine of $1,250, as well as other penalties. The second phase, introduced last month, gives police the power to impound for 48 hours vehicles suspected of being used for hoon driving-even before the matter reaches court-as long as there are proper grounds for laying charges. Upon conviction, a court can impose a second period of impoundment. The penalty is up to three months for one prior offence and up to six months for two priors. Those with three or more prior offences risk having their vehicle forfeited permanently. The proceeds from the sale of forfeited vehicles will go directly the Victims of Crime Fund. This is common sense legislation, because it takes away what these drivers value most-their cars. The risk of losing their lives or of hurting or killing someone else seems to mean nothing to them, but the risk of losing their car really hits home. The state government is also targeting other irresponsible driving behaviour. Drinkdrivers now face an immediate loss of licence if they are caught driving with a blood alcohol level above 0.08. Last year 36 per cent of those killed on our roads were driving with an illegal blood alcohol content, more than half of these had levels more than three times the legal limit. Some 28 per cent had been using marijuana or amphetamines. Motorists who drink and drive are now more likely than ever to get caught, because of Rann state Labor government's changes to drink-driving laws. South Australian police can now conduct full-time mobile random testing. The risk of immediately losing their licence might make a difference to people who are too stupid to take a taxi instead of driving home when they have had too much to drink. If it is not enough of an incentive, then at least it will get a few of these fools off the roads and make it safer for other people who are doing the right thing. South Australia is aiming to reduce its road toll by 40 per cent by 2010. This year's toll already makes that a huge challenge. In 2003 the state Labor government in South Australia introduced restricted mobile random breath testing, which is only allowed at certain times of the year, because the Liberal opposition refused to support full-time testing. Since then South Australian police have detected more drink drivers than when they were limited to stationary breath testing units. Because it was a success the government tried again to convince the Liberal opposition to allow police to mobile breath test to all year around and this time the state Labor government succeeded. The new legislation means that if you get caught driving between 0.05 and 0.079 more than once you lose your licence. If you get caught with a blood alcohol level between 0.08 and 0.149 you lose your licence immediately for at least six months. If you are driving with a blood alcohol count higher than 0.15 you lose your licence for at least 12 months, effective immediately. There are no second chances for people killed in car accidents; why should there be second chances for people who are a risk to themand selves and others on the road? This year the state government has also allocated a further $40 million over the next four years to improve the chances of catching drivers who speed or run red lights. Red the light cameras reduce the number of casualty crashes, and over the next four years there will be 48 new cameras installed around South Australia. On urban roads the speed limit has been reduced to 50 kilometres per hour, which reduces the risk of crashes and the sort of damage they cause. Of course, road crashes are not just about driver behaviour; road conditions are also a factor and would be great if the federal government would look more closely at its responsibilities to improve road safety in South Australia. In closing I would like to thank the many residents and community groups who have raised their concerns about driver behaviour with me over the years, both as a candidate and as their local federal member. The feedback they have provided to me, and to other members of parliament, provided the information and input required to get something done about dangerous driving. Now when we report hoons to the police in the police can do something about it. Mrs Mary Preston Mrs Helen Elmslie",165
264,Mr LAMING,ADJOURNMENT,"Bowman) (7.54 pm)Two extraordinary individuals from the bayside of Queensland were recognised this year with Australia Day awards: Helen Elmslie is the first and the second is Mary Preston. Mary Preston's work with the Coochiemudlo Island Bush Care Group dates back 10 years when their love of the island spurred them to form a group of 20 who would fight to protect the glorious foreshore of Coochiemudlo Island. They were concerned about exposed root systems and damage to ecology and habitats. Their work over 10 years has shown that they have achieved enormous steps not only in education and in encouraging young groups to take an interest in ecology and the environment but also in practical improvements. Together with Redland Shire Council, who I know they will be thanking, their workers, the division 10 councillor Peter Downing and the staff of Indigiscapes they have, where necessary, fenced off fragile areas of the coastline and conducted annual curlew counts, weed for tree programs and, most importantly, adopt-a-coastline so the residents of Coochiemudlo Island can reconit nect with their own foreshore in a practical way. Probably the best way of measuring their achievements is that this year their foreshore management plan has been submitted to the state government and is awaiting approval at this time. Should you ever visit Coochiemudlo Island, which is Aboriginal for red rock, if you find Mary Preston down by the foreshore she will probably invite you in for a cup of tea to talk about how the island is going. It is no better exemplified than in the words of poet Mary O'Brien: If I could be a mermaid South Australia, with tail strings of glossy brown kelp rescued from Morwong Beach I'd learn to dip and sway to the rhythm of the moon as you do together we could shimmer restless oceans from shore to shore sharing songs and dreamsuntil one day soon we'd find ourselves again lapping the fringes of Coochiemudlo's beachesHelen Elmslie has had an extraordinary life in the Moreton Bay area. Born in Sudbury, Massachusetts, in 1938, she travelled out to Queensland to complete her zoology undergraduate degree. After defending her thesis in the United States she returned to marry her husband, Leo, have four children and live in the historic township of Dunwich on North Stradbroke Island. From there her two great passions were art and the environment-and her life is one of opening the door for hundreds of people to both of those. It was her children, Daniel, David, Virginia and Leona, and their love of the intertidal mudflats, with its shags, cormorants and sea snails, that drew her down to the water to share her zoological knowledge. Soon there were school groups following in their footsteps. She spent a number of years on her passion for art with the North Stradbroke art and craft group. In 1962 she moved across to Ormiston and joined the Yurara art group where they were running Mount Gravatt TAFE courses in art for art and design students. There she met Robert Barnes, an inspiration to her, and she began teaching art and art history. Of course, one of the great disadvantages of teaching art is that you do not have enough time to do it yourself. So in the early 1990s Helen decided to open an art gallery in Manly. From there she became an institution in the area, painting on the footpaths and down by the waterside. She won Redlands Shire Council awards in 1991 and 1992; had a joint exhibition at the Manly Gallery in 1993; in 1994 was featured artist with the Redlands art and craft festival; and in 1995 had a sole exhibition at Manly Gallery and was featured artist for the Manly sailing festhe tival. In 1996 Helen Elmslie was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. We all know her commitment and energy to tasks throughout her life. This was no different. She joined Parkinson's Queensland and thought about helping those who lived with Parkinson's. She developed a board game called Parkinson's Daily Olympics. It is her hope that that will now be distributed free through Parkinson's Queensland to schools, nursing homes and doctors surgeries around the country. Helen Elmslie is a woman who has shared her love of art and her love of nature with hundreds of people in the Moreton Bay region. She was awarded an Australia Day award, as was Mary Preston with her Coochiemudlo Island Bush Care Group. I congratulate them both for their awards and for devoting their lives to their passions on the bayside. Work and Family Roles",167
265,Ms LIVERMORE,ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to use the time that is left to congratulate the federal Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Pru Goward, on the discussion paper Striking the balance: women, men, work and family, which was released and widely reported today. The paper is about prompting submissions to HREOC's inquiry into paid work and family responsibilities. The paper shows that the balance between work and family is just not there currently and that is especially the case for working women. The paper shows in stark figures that women employed full time are putting in 14.3 hours per week of unpaid work in the home and women employed part time are putting in 20.1 hours per week of work into the home, compared to six hours and 5.2 hours respectively for men employed full time and part time.

I wish to make a few comments about on the governor's observations. The curis no question about that-but it is not producthe business community or the economics commuby the governor.

Firstly, If we go back to the early or mid-1990s, we see of a very large fiscal deficit. The government Now Labor's debt has been largely paid off and lender. So the fiscal deficit has been largely businesses were net borrowers; now they are is with Australian households, which have gone be fair-to being relatively considerably more considerable concern not least to the Reserve current account deficit but simply because of they are exposed to greater risk if financial NA conditions deteriorate, if income declines ployment or if interest rates were to rise. The rise in this household debt has been say the property bubble-and there is a very instructive last year by the Deputy Governor of the Reserve the change in Australia's saving/investment periods where there has been an increase in about the last period, which he sets out as that, as in previous periods, there was a decline is what produces the deficit-but the three per investment in dwellings, was extraordinarily 1999 there was a 2.9 per cent increase in investment 0.7 per cent was investment in dwellings. In investment was three per cent, of which 1.7 driven the change is our fascination with real this increase in borrowings by households, easy to borrow against. It is much easier to business to borrow against its own cash flow.
