1,Mr OMALLEY,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister, withont notice, whether, in view of the fact that the House of Representatives has selected Tumut, and the Senate Bombala, for the Federal Capital Site, while the members of both Chambers are in favour of having a Federal territory of not leas than 1,000 square miles, the Go: vernment will bring in a short Bill to provide for the submission of the question to a referendum of the people at the forthcoming general elections?",12
2,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I do not know that the site is fixed with sufficient precision to enable such a referendum to be taken with advantage. In any case, the time is too brief to enable the necessary information be supplied to the electors and the preparaing tions for a referendum to be made. NA TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILWAY. exchange",12
3,Mr MAHON,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister, without notice, whether City any correspondence has been received or ex- £1,000 changed recently between this Government ing the buildings. and the Government of South Australia in reference to the Western Australian Transcontinental Railway. If so, will he lay a copy of it on the table 1",12
4,Mr DEAKIN,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"The correspondence upon the question is still in course; but I shall be prepared to lay upon the table tomorrow copies of the communications exchanged up to date, though it is too early to expect a final reply then. COLLECTION OF BORDER DUTIES. Mr KENNEDY/ - I am informed that duties are still being collected at some places on the border between New South Wales and Victoria. Is it the intention of the Department to continue the collection of Inter-State duties ? Should not the collection of such duties, except in regard to Western Australia, have ceased on the 8th October?",12
5,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"The honourable member was good enough to inform me this morning that duties were being.collected at a certain township on the border,.and I at once had a telegram despatched to the Customs officer there to ascertain the truth of the report, The officers of the Department have no. authority for collecting Interstate duties now, because those duties ceased to have force on the 8 th of this month. There has been some little 'trouble in adjusting values in regard to the consumption in each State, so. that we have not yet been able to make an alteration with regard to Inter-State certificates. Action is, however, being taken with a view to arrange, if possible, some easier method of ascertaining the amount to be credited to each State than that of preparing and forwarding Inter-State certificates. Nothing definite has been done up to the present time; but I hope, in a week or two, to notify the public of a change. LAND EXCHANGES.",12
6,Mr THOMSON,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"I wish to know from to the Minister for Home Affairs if the followintimation, which appears in this morning's Argus, is correct:The Minister for Home Affairs has arranged to the block of land on which the orderlyrooms are situated, at the corner of Peel and Victoria streets, for another block owned by the Council at the junction of Elizabeth and Yictoria streets. The City Council has to provide to cover the cost of removing and re-erectIf that statement is correct, will the right honourable gentleman inform the House - whence he derives his power to effect such exchanges without the authority of Parliament, and what means were taken to ascertain the relative values of the two blocks land.",12
7,Sir JOHN FORREST,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"The information is correct. The Department has bfcen guided in its action by the advice of the Crown Law officers. This is not a new transaction, 'but has been under consideration for years. The arrangement come to is satisfactory to the Defence Department, and will greatly assist the municipal authorities of Melbourne. I looked into the matter myself, and, as I was of opinion that the exchange was a fair one, I sanctioned it.",13
8,Mr THOMSON,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"The Minister has hardly answered my question. I desire to know whether the arrangement entered into with regard to the exchange of the land referred to was contingent upon the approval of Parliament. If not, does not the Minister see that there is an important difference between merely handing back to the States Governments lands which have been taken over from them, and arranging exchanges of land between municipal bodies or individuals and the Commonwealth . Government 1 I further desire to know whether the Minister has any objection to laying . the papers on the tablet",13
9,Sir JOHN FORREST,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"As the matter referred to has been the subject of negotiations extending over many years, I would ask the honourable member to give notice of his questions, in order that I may procure the necessary information. ELECTORAL ADMINISTRATION.",13
10,Sir JOHN QUICK,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"I wish to ask Minister for Home Affairs if he will take steps to make known the boundaries of the polling places in the various electoral divirecord sions. I am informed that the greatest misunderstanding exists on this subject. Will the Minister have plans circulated showing the boundaries, so that electors know where to go to record their votes ?",13
11,Sir JOHN FORREST,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"I am not sure that the actual boundaries of the various polling places have been determined, nor I think it possible, speaking off-hand, determine them.",13
12,Sir JOHN QUICK,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,A separate roll is prepared for each polling place.,13
13,Sir JOHN FORREST,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"The names of electors are grouped round certain polling places. If a person is not able to vote at a of polling place for which his name is on the roll, arrangements are made by which he can vote at another.",13
14,Sir JOHN QUICK,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,But are there no boundaries to the polling places 1,13
15,Sir JOHN FORREST,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"No . I have never known a case in which there have been fixed boundaries to polling places, nor do I think it necessary to have definite boundaries. The electors can surely be trusted to ascertain upon what rolls their names are printed, and to go to the polling places for which they are enrolled. It seems to me to be assumed by some honourable members that the electors are unintelligent persons who take no interest in this matter, which is of such importance to honourable members. My opinion is that they will take the trouble to find out' the polling places for which they are enrolled, and go there on the polling day. If they do not take that trouble, but go to a wrong place, arrangements are made under form Q whereby they can vote elsewhere.",13
16,Mr GB EDWARDS,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"Does the Minister think that it is sufficient to provide only one polling place for populous divisions such as Redfern and Prahran, where, I understand, the Town Halls will be utilized as polling booths, and the electors will have to go upstairs to record their votes 1 Will it not lead to congestion, and, perhaps, to a stoppage of the polling, if more adequate provision is not made f",13
17,Sir JOHN FORREST,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,I assure the honourable member that there will be sufficient polling places in each division to meet the convenience of those who will vote there. All the polling in a division will not the be concentrated at one booth.,13
18,Mr GB EDWARDS,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"It will be'impossible for 10,000 voters to satisfactorily their votes at a place where they willhave to go upstairs to do so.",13
19,Mr KNOX,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether, before the session closes, may he will afford honourable members an opportunity to discuss the difficulties which are being experienced in connection with the electoral rolls' 1 The Minister for Home do Affairs is being plied with a number of tcquestions at each sitting, without any important result.",13
20,Mr DEAKIN,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"I think that a discussion without notice of the character indicated would scarcely be productive of definite result. If honourable members feel it neeessaiy to call attention to particular difficulties, they might give notice of their questions, or make a simple intimation to my honourable colleague. This would enable him to prepare his replies, and I feel sure that all the requirements of the case would then be met. CUSTOMS OFFICIALS : SUNDA Y",14
21,Mr MAUGER,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,Has any step been taken to insure that the officials in the Customs Department shall have one day's rest in seven? The Treasurer promised that the matter would be referred to the Public Service Commissioner.,14
22,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"The honourable member was good enough to inform me of his intention to ask this question. I made inquiries into the matter this morning, and I ascertained that the boatmen in New South Wales are paid £ 1 3 3 per annum, those in Victoria £144 , those in Queensland from £ 9 6 to £ 1 1 8 , and those in Western Australia £ 1 1 0 per annum. In Tasmania boats are hired by the Department, and in South Australia a launch is hired. In New South Wales three men on the average are employed on Sundays, the duty being performed alternately by the boatmen. In Melbourne five are employed. The matter has been referred to the Public Service Commissioner, and it is anticipated that arrangements may be made for confining the employment of these men to six days a week with little additional expense to the Department. COASTAL TELEGRA PH STATIONS.",14
23,Mr CLARKE,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"I recently had occasion to write to the Postmaster-General complaining of alleged negligence on the part of telegraph officials in not sending through on a Sunday an urgent telegram in connection with the wreck of the steam-ship Croki at Seal Rocks. Owing to this negligence the steamer became a total wreck. I now desire to ask the Postmaster-General whether he will instruct the officials in charge of the coastal telegraph stations to be in attendance during certain hours on Sundays, say for an hour in the morning and an hour in the afternoon, so that they may receive messages in emergencies such as I have referred to ?",14
24,Sir PHILIP FYSH,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"It would not be desirable to issue a general instruction applying to postmasters afc all coastal stations. Something, however, may be done to meet the wish of the honourable member. I shall inquire as to which of the coastal stations an instruction offchekind referred to would most usefully apply, and, if possible, I shall issue regulations requiring the attendance offcheofficials at such stations at certain hours on Sundays.

25,Mr GB EDWARDS,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"the Prime Minister, upon notice Whether the Government will take into consideration the introduction of legislation to give effect fco the Coinage Committee's Report in favour of the Commonwealth coining its own token currency, and adopting a decimal system of money, which report was adopted by this House on 19th June last?",14
26,Mr DEAKIN,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows :The matter will be considered during the recess. Communications as to the coinage of silver in Australia are now proceeding between this Government and the Colonial Office. TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILWAY .,14
27,Mr FOWLER,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"the Prime M in ister, upon notice Whether, in view of the promise contained in the Governor General's speech at the opening of the present session of the Federal Parliament, the Government have made, or are about to make, provision for a survey of the proposed transcontinental railway to Western Australia ?",15

Is it intended fco exempt fromfcheoperation of the Commonwealth Public Service Act the persons who are to act as associates to the Justices of the High Court ? 2. If so, will he kindly mention the section the Act which authorizes such exemption ?",15
32,Mr DEAKIN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as folable low :1. This class of officers has been exempted. 2. Section 3. PATENTS BILL. Bill returned from the Senate with the following message :The Senate returnsfcothe House of Representaupon tives the Bill for "" an Act relating to Patents of Inventions,"" and acquaints the House thab Senate has agreed to the amendments made the House of Representatives, with the exception of Nos. 19, 56, and 79,fcowhich it has disagreed, for the reasons set forth infcheannexed schedule. The Senate desiresfchereconsideration of the Bill in respect of the amendments disagreed fco. Reasons offcheSenate for disagreeing to certain amendments offcheHouse of RepresentativesAs to No. 19- Because it is undesirable thabfcheappointment of the Commissioner should, except for a short interval, precede the Proclamation of the Acb, and that the clause would tend to conflict with the States Patent Acts, and would confer no substantial benefits on applicants. As to No. 56Because the desirability, if any, of the clause is obviated by the succeeding clause, No. 83. As fco No. 79Because it is consequential on No. 56. In Committee (Consideration of Senate's message) : Souse of Jtepresentatives' Amendment - Inser t competition with new clause 28A""Applications for patents may be lodged at the Patent Office immediately after the Commissioner is appointed, notwithstandingfchafcthis Act has not then commenced, and all applications so shall have priority according fco the time for when they were so lodged, andfchelodging of an application under this section shall have the like effect as the lodging of an application after the o commencement of this Act ; but any patent .granted pursuant to the application shall be dated as offcheday of the commencement of this Act. Until forms are prescribed applications shall this be in such form asfcheCommissioner directs. Applications made under a State Patent Acb may be lodged as prescribed before the commencement of this Act as applications under this Act."" Senate's Message - Amendmen b disagreed to.",15
33,Mr DEAKIN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF," Honourable members will observe that the Senate has agreed to the m a j o r it y of the amendments which were made by this House in the Bill . Indeed, it has taken exception fco only two or three of of them. The first amendment with w h i c h it has disagreed relates to the new clause which was inserted afc the request of honormembers with a view to provide that, even before what m i g h t be termed the "" complete "" commencement of this Act , it? should be possible for inventors fco register applications for patents, wh ich should be given p r i o r i ty according to the time afc which fchey were lodged, though patents would date only from the commencement of the Act . To the whole of this clause exception has been take n the ground "" that it is undesirable that the the appointment of the Commissioner should, by except for a short interval, precede the proclamation of the Act , and that it would tend to conflict with the States Patents Acts, and would confer no substantial benefits upon applicants."" Thus three objections are urged to the provision in question. The first of these I venture to think, evinces a misunderstanding of the intention of the whole of that part of the measure which relates to the Commissioner's appointment. From the information which has been supplied to me, it. appears perfectly clear that his appointment must precede, by a considerable time, the full commencement of this Act, inasmuch as in bringing into force a single patent system which shall replace the six systems at present existing in the States, it will be necessary for him, not only to organize the new Department ancl consider all applications, but to take the necessary steps-as I frequently explained - to have the registers and indices of the - States revised and brought up to date. It has often been assumed in this House that perhaps as long a period as a year must elapse between the appointment of the Commissioner and the actual commencement of the Ac t in its full sense. I do not know how far that estimate is well founded; but, probably, it may prove to be not excessive. Therefore, I am quite at a loss to understand the objection which is expressed in this particular reason of the Senate. The next reason which is urged by the other Chamber, that the clause would tend to conflict with the States Patents Acts is not, I think, well founded, because provision is made in the Bill by which applications may be registered, both under the Commonwealth arid the States laws, by any who desire to do so, and who consider that by so doing they will obtain an advantage. They can persist with either or both of their applications should they determine to pay the fees. Under the circumstances, I fail to see where any conflict will arise between applications which are made under the States laws and those which are made under the Commonwealth Act. 1I have never disguised from the Committee, however, that the clause must be fraught with difficulty in it s . working, and that many problems may arise in giving effect to it. However, it was strongly pressed upon the Committee, on the ground that it would convenience inventors, and that by its insertion the indefinite delay in conferring the advantages which are offered by this measure would be avoided. At the same time, those who for any reason distrust this procedure, are still given an opportunity to proceed under the States laws.",15
34,Mr HIGGINS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,What is the practical inconvenience to which the Prime Minister alludes ?,16
35,Mr DEAKIN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"It is this : We are aboutfcopass a Commonwealth Patents Act. That Act cannot commence until many investigations have been made and a new patent system has been prepared. In the interim inventors who wish to protect themselves throughout Australia are required to lodge their applications in every State and to obey the requirements of the States laws - in fact,fcofollow the same course which they would have followed prior tofchepassing of this Act. We offer them the means by which they can lodge an application for the whole of the Commonwealth-a n application which will be inquired into by us at our expense in all the States, and for which a patent will be granted in order of priority, though it will date only from the complete commencement offcheAct. By that means we thought we had successfully bridged the interregnum. The third objection which has been urged by the Senate is that the clause would confer no substantial benefit upon applicants. To that I have already replied. Only today I received a telegram from an Adelaide patent agency which in somewhat excited language protests that the effect of this provision would be ""dangerous and misleading,"" that it would cause "" endless litigation,"" ""conflict of concurrent State applications,"" and "" irremediable chaos."" Indeed it contains quite a number of patentable phrases.",16
36,Mr GLYNN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,It s authors are afraid of centralization in the applications.,16
37,Mr DEAKIN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,I do not think that they need be.,16
38,Mr GLYNN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,I do not think so either.,16
39,Mr DEAKIN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I have endeavoured to analyze what these fiery phrases really mean. Probably they are aimed at the words "" according to the time when they were so lodged."" Possibly the authors of the telegram have in mind the facb that there are time zones in Australia, and that a question may arise asfcowhat allowance ought to be made-althoug h I think that there is a strictly fixed difference-as between an application for a patent which is lodged at Perth, in the extreme west, and another which is lodged at Sydney, in the extreme east, at approximately the same hour.",16
40,Mr THOMSON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,That difficulty will always arise under the Bill.,17
41,Mr DEAKIN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I do not think so. We have enacted a provision which will prevent that difficulty when the measure comes into full operation. But I suggest that if we omit the words "" according to the time when they were so lodged,"" and substitute for them the words ""asprescribed,"" we can then, by regulation, define precisely-or , at least, with as nearly as possible astronomical accuracy-the manner in which priority shall be settled when conflicting applications have been almost simultaneously lodged at widely distantplaces intheCommon wealth. When we have done that, it appears to me --afte r re-reading the clause and admitting the practical difficulties which will arise in its working-that we have inserted a provision which may prove very serviceable to inventors and one which does not present the possibilities of disaster and even chaos pourtrayed in the telegram to which I have referred.",17
42,Mr GLYNN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,How would the suggestion of the honourable gentleman affect the second paragraph of the clause ? The authors of the telegram fear that an application which is lodged in the central office will always obtain priority.,17
43,Mr DEAKIN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"If c appears to me that by regulation we may remove all ambiguity. We seek to make it quite clear that we have the same power in regard fco the second paragraph of the clause that we possess in respect of the first paragraph, hence I submit the amendment indicated. That, I think, will remove the difficulty which has caused the senders of the telegram to which allusion has been made so much anxiety. I therefore move That the amendment be insisted on, but that the clause be amended by the omission of the words ""according to the time when they were so lodged "" with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" as prescribed.""",17
44,Mr HIGGINS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"Northern Melbourne) I can scarcely understand how "" irremediable chaos"" will be brought about by the operation of this provision, although the phrase in question is very suggestive of South Australian language. The senders of the telegram have not indicated what part offcheclause they consider may lead to ""irremediable chaos,"" and I think that in the circumstances we shall have to be content to remain open to that contingency for all time. I should not be surprised, however, if their difficulty were in regard to the dating of the patent. A patent, of course, cannot be dated except as from the commencement of the Act;, but if two patents were granted as on that date, there being no guarantee of novelty, how would the question of priority be determined 1",17
45,Mr DEAKIN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,The application which was received first on that date would receive priority.,17
46,Mr HIGGINS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,It is not the custom in making grants of patents to record the hour at which the application is made.,17
47,Mr DEAKIN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,Yes ; the hour and the minute.,17
48,Mr GLYNN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF," I have not yet seen the telegram, the contents of which have rather astonished the honourable and learned member for NorthernMelbourne; but I think that the difficulty is that the agents in question fear that under this provision agents in Melbourne would obtain priority over agents in the other States in respect of applications lodged by them. When the suggestion was made that provisional applications might be lodged under the States Acts and regarded as applications for Commonwealth patents, no objection was offered, the opinion being held, apparently, that such applications would have absolute priority in the States in which they were made, and that no question could arise as to priority having been given by any central office. No opposition was raised to that proposal, which was designed to accomplish the very object which this provision has in view. I think that the objection in this case is that the clause would enable patent agents resident in Melbourne to make applications which would have priority over those made in the other States. I do not consider that the clause would necessarily have that effect; but that is apparently the reason which has caused the agents in question to oppose it. If the regulations are carefully drawn up, the amendment should allay their fears, and in the form now pro posed, the clauseought to be insisted upon.",17
49,Mr BROWN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF," I desire to support the amendment proposed by the Prime Minister, for I believe that when the matter is thoroughly investigated, it will be found by another place that their objections fco the clause are not substantial. They state first of all that it is undesirable that the appointment of a Commissioner under this Bill should precede by any considerable interval the date of proclamation. According to those who have an intimate knowledge of the working of the States Patents Offices, some twelve or eighteen months will elapse between the passing of the Bill, and the date ©n which the new system will be complete, and in order that the whole of the necessary machinery may be brought into perfect working order as early as possible, it is necessary that the Commissioner should be appointed without delay. It is probable that the full difficulties associated with the transfer of the Patents Offices from the States to the Commonwealth have not yet been fully realized, and that they will occasion considerable delay. That being so, unless this clause be agreed to, inventors will be placed in a very awkward position. To my own knowledge several inventors have been holding back tlieir applications for patents in order to secure the benefit of this legislation. Some of them are not in a position, while others are not prepared, to incur the very heavy cost of registering throughout the States under the existing systems, and they hope to secure material relief by the passing of this Bill. Unless this clause be agreed to, however, they will not be able to test and perfect their inventions until the Act is actually brought into operation. Is it desirable that inventors should be denied the encouragement and relief which we propose to give them under this clause 1 It seems - to me that the Senate has overlooked this phase of the question. Ifc is also complained by another place that this provision would conflict with States registration. I do not think that that would be possible. If an inventor desires to register under the States laws prior to the coming into force of this Bill he will be able to do so, and to complete his application as soon as the Commonwealth system is in proper working order. If an inventor is given a free hand in this respect no doubt he will choose the course that seems to him fco be the most advantageous. It is said further fchafc this provision would confer no substantial benefit on applicants for inventions. Those who are anxious to take out patents at the present time hold an entirely different opinion, and they desire that this clause may be inserted in order that they may have some guarantee fchafc whilst the preliminaries incidental tofchebringing of the measure into operation are being disposed of they will be able to lodge their applications and have them registered as soon as the new machinery is in working order. This clause will give them that guarantee. There are stringent conditions in the Bill as to the time within which an application for a patent must be completed, and as to the non-disclosure of the nature' of an invention in respect of which a patent is sought. A complete specification must be lodged within nine months after the date of the application, and those who propose to secure patents under this measure are not, sure that, in the absence of this concession, they will be able to comply with that provision. If this measure does not actually come into operation for twelve or eighteen months the Commissioner will have to disallow their applications, inasmuch as, in the absence of a provision of this kind, the conditions cannot be complied with. The clause will give a sense of security to inventors who are in that position. I feel satisfied that when another place views the question from this standpoint their objections will be removed; particularly as the Prime Minister proposes to eliminate some words, and to make the intention of the clause clearer by substituting others. I hope that the Committee will agree to send the measure back to the Senate with good and substantial reasons why the amendment now before the Committee should be adopted.",17
50,Mr KINGSTON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF," I think that the various firms of patent agents in South Australia, who joined in sending to the Prime Minister the telegram which has been read, have been well advised. They have put the matter strongly. The term "" irremediable chaos "" has evidently struck terror into the hearts of the Government, who, not knowing precisely what it refers to, proposefcomeet an objection which they presumefcobe made against the clause. Though I do not like leaving too much to regulations, and though admittedly the fixing - of priority amongst applications for patents is an important question, still, in a matter of this sort it is, perhaps, just as well fco make the provision prefcfcy elastic, as is done by the amendment proposed to be made. I shall, therefore, support it .",18
51,Mr DEAKIN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,It applies only to an interregnum.,18
52,Mr KINGSTON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,I hope it will be a very short interregnum.,19
53,Mr GLYNN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,The only important point is that as to priority.,19
54,Mr KINGSTON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"It is a matter so important that it should be fixed by Parliament, but I see no objection to regulations, particularly in view of the strong language used by the South Australian patent agents. I may here say that I know that the patent agents in South Australia'who have been mentioned, as well as other patent agents who might be mentioned, have gone to a good deal of trouble in connection with this Bill. I should like publicly to acknowledge here the assistance rendered by various patent agents in the different States. They undoubtedly applied themselves keenly to the problems dealt with in the Bill, and they have displayed a public spirit in connection with it that does them every credit. I should also like to say that I am not at all satisfied that there is a necessity for any considerable postponement of the commencement of this measure. I know that stress has been laid on the suggested necessity of postponing for some period the coming into operation of the Bill. But I do not believe that any such necessity exists. I believe that the Patent Offices of the different States are in fair working order, and, with an intelligent appreciation of the position the part of the Federal officers, and a deterquestion mination to make the inconvenience to the public as little as may be, the Bill may be brought into operation without considerable delay. I fully believe-o r rather I have the impression-that it was the intention of the Government to consolidate not only the Patent laws of the States, but also the States laws relating to copyright and the laws relating to trade marks. I know that a general Bill was prepared, but that it was thought to be too huge a measure to be introduced into Parliament this session. I think, further, that it is advantageous to separate the two or three questions I have mentioned, and to provide for them by separate Bills, rather than to cause confusion by consolidating legislation that is not so intimately associated that it needs to be included in one Bill. But I am sure that the Government will be well advised-and I am hopeful that it is their policy-at the earliest possible time during next session to introduce the necessary Bills relating to copyright and trades marks for the consideration of the Legislature. They will find a mass of material already prepared and practically settled. The recess, however short, will enable them to put the finishing touches upon theBills I have mentioned; and I think I do but express the feeling of the Committee when I say that honourable members will welcome the introduction of such measures, so that they may be passed into law, and so that the questions of. patent, copyright, and trades marks may be covered by a Commonwealth law perfected and enacted at the earliest possible moment. Motion agreed to.",19
55,Mr GLYNN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF," I am not sure that a similar amendment ought not to be made in the second paragraph, which provides that applications may be made before this measure comes into force to a State Patent Office, and that such application may be regarded as equivalent fco an application under a State patent law. It may be that two or three applications may be made in different States on the same day. The question of priority will then arise. When an application is made for a patent under a State Patent Act the question of priority is determined. There is no question about it , because whichever application was first in receives priority; but when there are two or three different applications in different on States for a Federal patent there may be a as to priority. I , therefore, think we should put in similar words to meet the contingency I have mentioned. They could be inserted after the word "" lodged.""",19
56,Mr KINGSTON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,The application has to be lodged at the Patent Office.,19
57,Mr GLYNN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,It may be lodged at a State Patent Office.,19
58,Mr WATSON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,A fresh application has to be made.,19
59,Mr GLYNN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"There may be some confusion as to which is entitled to priority. Would honourable members say that priority would be determined by the date of the application at the Federal Patent Office, and not by the date upon which the application is made in the State Patent Office \ Clause, as amended, - agreed to.

Every patent shall be granted subject to the following con ditions :(a) Tliat if the patented article is reasonably capable of being commercially constructed or manufactured or the invention patented is reasonably capable of being commercially worked in Australia the patentee or some person authorized by. him shall within five years after the date thereof commence and after such commencement continuously carry on in Australia the construction or manufacture of the patented article or the working of the invention patented in such a manner that aivy person may obtain the patented article or the use of the invention at a reasonable price ; and (t) That if the patented article is reasonably capable of being commercially constructed or manufactured in Australia the patentee shall not after four j'ears from the date of the patent import it or cause it to be imported into Australia. Senate's Jfesxaf/e-Amendmen t disagreed to.",19
60,Mr DEAKIN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"This is a very important provision. Both this amendmenb and the following one relate to the requirement inserted in this Bill that all patentees may be called upon within five j'ears, if the invention patented is reasonably capable of being commercially worked in Australia, to commence its construction or manufacture here. The reason given by the Senate for objecting to the clause is thisBecause the desirability, if any, of the clause is obviated by the succeeding clause No. 83. Clause 83 does to a considerable extent provide for a similar contingency. It provides thatAny person interested may, after the expiration of two years from the granting of the patent, allege that the reasonable requirements of the public with respect to a patented invention have not been satisfied; and pray for the grant of a compulsory licence. The Commissioner considers the petition, and if he is of opinion that a prima facie case is made out, he refers it to the Supreme Court. He may, if not satisfied, dismiss it himself. If it be referred to the Court, and the Court is convinced that the reasonable requirements of the public have not been satisfied, the patentee may be ordered to grant a licence, or the Court may itself grant a licence for the manufacture of the patented article. that extent clause 83 covers the same ground and meets the same set of circumstances. The Senate, when the measure was introduced, struck out the provisions with which we are now dealing, and which were then more absolute in their terms than they are at present. It was with a view to endeavour to win the approval of the Senate for these clauses that I introduced amendments which the Committee will recall, and which, in cases where it was desired to require a patentee to manufacture in the Commonwealth, threw on the person who moved in the matter the burden of satisfying the Court that the patent was reasonably capable of being commercially constructed or manufactured in Australia. These were safeguards which do not exist in the Acts from which the proposals were copied. I had hoped that, mitigated ancl safeguarded by these conditions, the Senate would see their way to accept the provisions. The members of another place, however, are still adverse by a considerable majority, and they point out-as , indeed, was pointed out in this Chamber - that the same urgency does not exist for these provisions as would have existed if clause 83, with its elaborate provisions which may be brought into play after two years, had not existed. ""Under the circumstances, it rests with the Committee either to repeat their recommendation once more, or to recognise that even if it be repeated it is very unlikely to be accepted. Personally I do not proposefcopress the matter, because although I should greatly prefer to see some provision of this nature added to the Bill- ' though I recognise that clause 83 goes only part offcheway",20
61,Mr THOMSON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,A pretty long way.,20
62,Mr DEAKIN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"The clause goes some distance, long or short; but it does not by any means go allfcheway.",20
63,Mr KINGSTON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,There are compulsory working sections in the Canadian Act.,20
64,Mr DEAKIN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,There are provisions of the kind in the Canadian and German Acts; but in neither country has compulsory working been brought into pract in effect.,20
65,Mr GLYNN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,The section is a dead letter in Canada.,20
66,Mr DEAKIN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"The section in Canada has simply led to certain procedures and the payment of certain fees in order to comply with the requirements of the Act. For my To own part I am inclined to think that when we have had some experience of the working of the Bill, we shall be able to devise clauses with this object which will be effective, if the Parliament of that date think well to put them into operation. Under the circumstances, as we are making so large an advance by means of clause 83 and the Bill generally, I suggest to the Committee that it might be advisable at this stage not to insist on sending these clauses back to the Senate. After the two considerations they have already received, I have little hope of the opinion of another place being altered. I move That the amendment be not insisted on.",20
67,Mr GLYNN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF," I am glad the Prime Minister has taken the stand which he has indicated, and I hope the Committee will adopt his suggestion. The provisions are not essential to a Patents Act, but deal with production, and really affect the fiscal issue. Unlike clause 83, the provisions under consideration are not a part of the policy of the patent law itself. Clause 83 covers much wider ground than is covered by the English provision from which it is adopted, and which has been in force only for about twelve months. It was regarded as a very far-reaching provision, and was the result of a good deal of deliberation. I mentioned when we were discussing the Bill that, although a similar provision had found a place in the Canadian Act, it had not been enforced-that it was a dead letter. I am glad that since our previous discussion, the Prime Minister appears to have been informed that the statement. I made then was correct. I had very good authority for stating that the Canadian provision has never been enforced. Under regulations, some declaration has to be made in Canada that the patent has been worked, in order to take it from outside the operation of the section; but, like many other similar declarations, these are made as a matter of course.",21
68,Mr KINGSTON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,Tru e or untrue?,21
69,Mr GLYNN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"Tru e or untrue. I could show honourable members correspondence in which it is made clear that in Canada i become almost a recognised practice to make those declarations. There are regular officials or agents who will make the declararations by the dozen if they are adequately paid for the trouble. I am informed of one case in which £ 1 0 was paid for the making of a declaration, and in which part of that amount went to the local agent, part to the Canadian agent, and the balance to the man who made the affidavit. I hope honourable members will adopt the suggestion of the Prime Minister.",21
70,Mr AVATSON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF," I cannot quite agree with the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, than this is not a proper provision to insert in a Patents Act.",21
71,Mr MAHON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,The provision is said to have more to do with production than with patents.,21
72,Mr WATSON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"The question certainly has that aspect; but, in my opinion, it is a provision which strictly ought to come within the purview of a patents law. Certain privileges are given to a person outside Australia in return for some benefit conferred on this country ; and it is proper enough to ask that, within a reasonable time, the manufacture of the patented article shall begin within our borders. It is curious that we should insist on extending such great liberality to people in other parts of the world, who do not usually extend a hand to us.",21
73,Mr MAHON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"If they give us a good article, surely they are benefiting us 1",21
74,Mr WATSON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"They are benefiting us in some cases; but the question is whether they are benefiting us sufficiently, or to a degree commensurate with the protection or monopoly granted. In some countries there is a similar provision to that now under consideration ; and there, evety person who chooses to come along is not granted patent monopolies at a very low price, and without any subsequent licensing conditions. In this regard we are, I think, unwisely liberal to the people of other countries. I quite agree, however, with the Prime Minister that, in view of the attitude of the Senate, there is little use in our pressing the clause at the present time. It is a matter which, very probably, the Commonwealth will have to regulate later o n ; indeed, the whole measure will require radical amendment before it can be regarded as anything like a permanent settlement of the patents quest has tion. I have a strong feeling against the method employed under the Bill in connection with the payment of fees. It is altogether a wrong principle to ask for the full amount down, instead of requiring a small initial payment, and spreading the balance over a long period. However, it is of no'use discussing that matter now, and I think we may adopt the Prime Minister's suggestion, and, in the meantime, fall in with the view of the Senate.",21
75,Mr HIGGINS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF," I think we are rather premature in abandoning this clause, which formed one of the principal inducements to honourable members to pass an Australian Patents Bill. is no reason to think that on reconsideration the matter may not elsewhere be regarded in a different light. The importance of the clause seems obvious, and I am surprised at the view ©f the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, that it is not a proper provision for a patents law, being, as he contends, a part of the fiscal issue. It is .nothing of the sort; and it would seem as though the fiscal issue is the only issue which is ever before some honourable members. The Bill provides for the granting of a monopoly for a period on certain conditions; and, if the conditions are fufilled, we are surely entitled to say that we will notgrantthe monopoly. If a patentee will not comply with such a provision within five years, why on earth should he still hold his patent to the exclusion of somebody else who may be prepared to fulfil the condition t",21
76,Mr GLYNN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,But a patentee would not be allowed to import his patent.,22
77,Mr HIGGINS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"A man ought not to be granted an Australian patent unless he manufactures the patented article in Australia. This has nothing to do with the fiscal issue. It means simply that we refuse to give patentees a monopoly except upon certain terms. W it h respect to the argument that a similar provision is not used in Canada, who is to say when a whip is used ? You have a whip and the horse knows it. You may not require to use it once in a blue moon; but the knowledge that you have it is a very important incentive to the horse to go; and the fact that a clause of this nature is in the Canadian Act leads to the development of Canadian industries. I hope the Prime Minister will not give .up this clause, which a great many of his followers are anxious to see incorporated in the first Australian Patents Bill. I regard this Patents Bill as one of the principal industrial measures brought before the Commonwealth Parliament, and I should feel greatly disappointed if we did not let it be clearly known from the very inception that we will not give an Australian patent unless the Australian public are to have the advantage of it by the manufacture of the patented article here.",22
78,Mr KINGSTON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF," I thoroughly agree with the remarks of the honourable and, learned member for Northern Melbourne. I am not in favour of the shepherding of rights in Australia to the There prejudice of the public. I do not care whether it applies to the locking up of land which might be utilized, or to patents. A patent is given with the object of enabling some one to work an invention in the Commonwealth, and to prevent any one else working it without his authority; but it was never intended that a patent should be granted for the purpose of enabling a man to enjoy a monopoly and to leave it entirely unutilized-to sleep on his rights and prevent any one else manufacturing the patented article within the Ccmmonwealth. .",22
79,Mr GLYNN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,To force a man to double not his plant may have the effect of increasing the price of the article tremendouslv.,22
80,Mr KINGSTON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"The honourable and learned member says that we may increase the price of the article by causing the inventor and manufacturer to double his plant. We have hedged this provision in every conceivable way. I take it that it was an important principle as originally introduced, and it commanded the acceptance of this House in the first instance. When objection was taken to the clause by another branch of the Legislature the Prime Minister went out of his way to meet the difficulties then raised, and in doing so he met the very difficulty suggested by the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, by providing that this provision should come into operation only when it was clear that the patented article was capable of being commercially manufactured within the Commonwealth. Here is the clause as we have it before us and as objected to by the Senate. It providesThat if the patented article is reasonablv capaule of being commercially constructed or manufactured, or the invention patented is reasonably capable of being commercially worked in Australia, the patentee or some person authorized by him shall within five years after the date thereof commence, and after such commencement continuously carry on in Australiafcheconstruction or manufacture of the patented article, or the working of the invention patented in such a manner that any person may obtainfchepatented article or the use of the invention afc a reasonable price. Ample time is given in the clause, and surely in connection with a matter of this sort, the establishment of a 'monoply, we are asking nothing but what is fair and right when we claim that if the patented article is capable of being successfully manufactured in the Commonwealth it should be manufactured here. I would ask honourable members who oppose this clause whether, if the non-manufacture of the patented article is shown to be detrimental to the interests of the public, they are in favour of continuing an unexercised right 1 Because it must not be. forgotten that it is only under circumstances in which the nonmanufacture of the patented article would be a mischief to the Commonwealth that any power of revocation is provided by this clause, which is sought to be struck out by the Senate. Surely our first care should be our own. interests and the interests of our own people. As regards the inventor, it is surely right that we should say to him- ' "" Exercise your right; we do not require you to do so as a condition to the preservation of your patent unless the patented article is capable of being commercially manufactured here."" I ask honourable members to look at the further qualification and say what possible mischief can arise under this provision in view of clause S2B; which provides thatNo proceeding shall be instituted forfcherevocation of a patent for any breach offcheprovisions of the preceding section except in the High Court and by the Attorney-Generaland I direct the special attention ofhonorable members to what followsand then only in case the Attorney-General is satisfied thatfchebreach is injurious to the traders orfchemanufacturers infcheCommonwealth. This provision proposes to give a great power to a trusted officer, the chief law adviser of the Crown, and a Minister responsible to this House and to the public for its fair and judicial exercise. The matter must be looked afc in this way: Ifc being proved on the certificate of the Attorney-General, that the omission to work the patent is detrimental to the traders or manufacturers of the Commonwealth ; proved, also, in the terms of the previous clause, that the invention is reasonably capable of being manufactured successfully in the Commonwealth, then, in the event of the continued refusal of clauses. the patentee to exercise his right under the patent, what is the right course for us adopt 1 I believe that no Legislature of the Commonwealth can be advised to say any thing else than this : That when the power given under a patent is not exercised when it is proved to be capable of being successdivision fully exercised, and when it is further certified and proved fchafc the non-establishment of an industry which may be successfully established is injurious fco the trade manufactures of the - Commonwealth, our : and Mr Kingston. duty is clear-to give a powerfcorevoke, to give a power which is given elsewhere. A similar provision exists in Canada and also in Germany. It is said that this power has not been exercised in Canada. It is suggested also that one reason why it has net been exercised, is that declarations have been made in fraud under provisions of this sort. If that be so, let us profit by the Canadian lesson. If the laws there are drawn on such lines that a coach and four can be driven through them, let us be caref u l in this respect. I say that this clause as originally framed, and particularly as modified by the Prime Minister, is fair in itself, and necessary for the protection offcheindustries and manufactures of the Commonwealth. It can only be enforced when the Attorney-General has expressly certified that its enforcement is necessary in the interest of our trade and manufactures. It seems to me, under all the circumstances-considerin g that patents are granted for their exercise in the country and not to the injury of the interests of the country in which they are granted-that if it be proved that a patented article can be made in the country in which the patent is granted, that the country is suffering from the nonuse by the patentee of his patent rights, there should be power to declare the pabeub void in addibion to the power which under the Bill may be exercised by privabe individuals of obbaining a compulsory licence to manufacture. Patents are granted to be used for the benefit of the Commonwealth, and if those to whom they are granted propose fco enjoy an idle monopoly the original intention of granting the patents is perverted; they do harm insbead of good, and I say leb bhose patents be voided.",22
81,Mr THOMSON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,All the necessary power is contained in this Bill withoub these,23
82,Mr MAHON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF," I hope that to the Prime Minister will not be moved from his purpose by the hysterical observations of the last speaker. In view of the repeated action of the Senate in regard to this provision, and also in view of the very close in this House on a previous occa, sion, I think thab the action of the Prime ' Minister is a very wise one. The honor| able and learned member fqr South Ausor tralia, Mr Kingston, and the honourable 1 learned member for Northern Melbourne are very emphatic in disclaiming the idea that any question of Tariff is involved in this proposal. But it seems to me that all their arguments point to the conclusion which they disavow. The last i speaker pointed out the injustice of allowing an inventor to withhold from Australia the manufacture of any article. It would have been much more to the purpose if he had named any article which could be commercially manufactured in Australia, but which is not. Out of the wide range of human requirements he has failed to instance a single article which could be manufactured here, but which is not being made here, and is at the same time being sold here at an unfair price. I suppose that if the old order of things had been continued and he were in the Parliament of South Australia, he would insist upon putting in its Patent Act a provision that the article must be manufactured in the State even if it were being manufactured well in Victoria. Is it reasonable to suppose that an inventor or a manufacturer would not do the best he could for himself and for his customers ? Take any complicated machine-the linotype, for instance : Does anybody mean to tell rae that if the American Linotype Company were compelled to put up a plant in Victoria, they could afford to sell the machines at the present price to Victorian customers ? Nothing of the kind. The price would be increased by at least 50 per cent. There is so limited a demand for such machines in Australia that the output would be small, and it would be impossible to secure any outside market. So that the Victorian user of that, or any other machine of the kind, would be compelled to pay a much larger price than he is now asked to pay.",23
83,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHABN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,Under paragraph 6 a machine could not be imported after four years.,24
84,Mr KINGSTON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,How can the Attorney General certify that the absence of manufacture would be injurious to public trade?,24
85,Mr MAHON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"The honourable and learned gentleman has, in clause 83, all that he and those who think with him can legitimately claim. If a commodity were not being sold at a reasonable price to the consumer a person could get an order from the Court authorizing its production in Australia. At this late stage of the session I hope that the Committee will concur in the action of the Senate. I may say that a few years ago, when this project was originally mooted, it did seem to me to wear a somewhat reasonable aspect, but on going more fully into the matter, and ascertaining the cost of producing, for a limited market, any of the complicated machinery which is being manufactured under patent, I came to the conclusion that it would be disadvantageous, not merely to the consumer, but to everybody connected with the industry, to establish that principle here. I hope that the course suggested by the Prime Minister will be adopted.",24
86,Mr HIGGINS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"Northern Melbourne). - The honourable member for Coolgardie has spoken under a misapprehension. The case of the linotype would not come under this clause at all. It is obvious that as the the market is so very limited, no Attorney General would dare to certify that he was satisfied that the breach was injurious to the trade and manufactures of the Commonwealth.",24
87,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,It might be commercially manufactured here.,24
88,Mr HIGGINS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"The whole point of the honourable member for Coolgardie was that the linotype could not be commercially manufactured here, and that, therefore, the patent ought not to be revoked, but if he will look atfchesafeguards in the clause he will see that there is no such danger as he anticipated. It must be capable of being commercially manufactured.",24
89,Mr MAHON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"What does "" commercially "" mean 1",24
90,Mr HIGGINS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"It must be capable of being manufactured so as to bring a commercial profit, and the Attorney-General would only take proceedings in the event of his being satisfied that the breach was injuriousfcothe trade and manufacture of the Commonwealth. I defy any Attorney General to take proceedings in a case like that which has been mentioned. We must trust the Government as being desirous of keeping the confidence of the House and the country, but the honourable member for Coolgardie has in his mind one particular invention which could not come under the ban.",24
91,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,There are plenty of others which could.,24
92,Mr HIGGINS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I would vote against this proposal if any private person could annoy a patentee by bringing any proceeding against him. But the Attorney-General is the only person who could bring a proceeding in certain circumstances, and I am quite sure that he would be restrained by the desire to keep a reputation for common sense and common sanity. I should like this matter to go back to the Senate. At this stage of the session we have not so many Bills pending that we could not ask the Senate to reconsider the question. 1 think that on reconsideration it would be seen that there is a great deal in the provision. I hope that there will not be imported into the discussion any of the bitterness of the debates on the Tariff.",24
93,Mr CONROY,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF," It is because I should like to see the Committee preserve a reputation for common sense and common sanity that I hope that it will not insist upon its amendment. We are asked to place in the hands of the Attorney General for the time being a weapon by which he could coerce the patentees of particular articles. Of course, if we place in his hands a weapon by which he could terrorize the owner of a patent and say- "" Unless you come to me and settle things I shall bring an action for the revocation of the patent,"" well and good ; but no honourable Attorney-General would like to have such a power placed in his hands, because he would see the use which might be made of it against him, even under ordinary circumstances. A power like this ought to be conferred after full debate in Parliament. Are we going to hand over the powers of the House to an Attorney-General who might institute an action at law. which, in nineteen cases out of twenty, would be initiated before we should know anything about it. At the time it was inserted in the Bill one naturally thought that it was a monstrous provision, which could have been carried here only because honourable members had not thoroughly grasped the use which might be made of it as against individuals. This Parliament is, of course, one of the most honest that have ever existed ; but it is quite within the region of probability that we might have an Attorney-General who might use this power for his own advantage. In the State of New South Wales a recent Minister for Lands was compelled to retire from Australia, because of the manner in which he exercised in his own interests certain powers intrusted to him by Parliament.",25
94,Mr KINGSTON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,The honourable and learned member refers to a corrupt exercise of power.,25
95,Mr CONROY,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"The Minister I refer to is generally believed to have been guilty of absolute corruption. A very strict Attorney-General would decline to have a power like that contained in the clause intrusted to him. It is proposed to give to the Attorney-General the power to determine whether action shall be taken for the revocation of patents. I say nothing about the dishonesty of such an arrangement, though, in my opinion, it is an infringement of the law of nations. We know what has happened in Canada under a similar provision. There one or fcwoMinisters have been absolutely open to corruption. Why should we give this power to a Minister ? Why should not Parliament deal with the matter itself 1 Even from the protectionist point of view, it must be wrong to deal with the matter in the way proposed. A clause like this will not benefit Australian inventors. So far as they are concerned, there are very few patented articles which can be sold in Australia in such numbers as to permit of their manufacture here. It is necessary, however, to give a monopoly to the patentees to encourage invention.' There could not be a better illustration of the manner in which a departure from a sound principle like this carries with it its own condemnation than the effect upon American literature of the American departure from the paths of common honesty in the matter of copyright.",25
96,Mr MACDONALDPATERSON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,Thing s are different now.,25
97,Mr CONROY,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"Yes ; but it was the opinion of men well qualified to judge that the absence of an honest copyright law was of the greatest disadvantage to American authors and to American literature. No Parliament should leave it to an Attorney-General to say whether an action at law should or should not be brought. These matters should be determined by Parliament after a special consideration. In my opinion, the Senate was well advised to disagree with the amendment. Of course, honourable members like the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, who argues that if a person pays £ 1 for an article which is worth only los. the country is all the better off, because 35s. is kept within its borders",25
98,Mr MAUGER,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,The honourable and learned member has misunderstood me. I never said anything like that.,25
99,Mr CONROY,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"The honourable member made use, on many occasions, of an argument to that effect in support of the protective policy of which he is so strong an advocate. In the same way, the honourable member for Gippsland has argued that if a farmer spends £ 1 upon raising a crop of wheat, and gets 10s. for it, the country is richer to the amount of 30s.",26
100,Mr A MCLEAN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,No . The honourable and learned member is under quite impression.,26
101,Mr CONROY,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"We had those arguwho ments used ad nauseam at one am glad that the teachings of honourable members on this side have given honourable members opposite an acquaintance with the rudimentary principles of political economy, so that they are now ready to repudiate their former statements. I was not present when the Committee inserted this clause, I should have voted against it, but I trust that now an opportunity is afforded for consideration, we shall show ourselves the jealous of our rights, and not hand them living elsewhere. over to the lawyer who happens to be Attorney-General. No doubt the right honourable member for South Australia the members of the late Ministry, which contained so many lawyers, are always ready to hand over powers to members of that profession, but I think that laymen take different view. I shall vote against the tention of the clause.",26
102,Mr DEAKIN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I am sorry that we engaged once more upon a discussion of the merits of the clause. Personally, I have not privilege. altered my opinionas to the wisdom of inserttrader ing the provision with the safeguards which surround it ; but as I have ascertained that it would be impossible to get the Senate accept it, and as this Committee agreed to it tect our own people. by only a narrow majority, I hope that honourable members will not insist upon I am anxious to get the Senate to agree the prior amendment, which I am told that they are likely to accept; but the probI ability is that if we insist upon this amendI ment - the Senate may not agree to either, and therefore the assent to the Bill will be delayed.",26
103,Mr SOLMON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF," As I have not had an opportunity to speak on the measure before, I wish to say a few now, though otherwise, after the statement England. of the Prime Minister, I should have said nothing. I am unable to grasp the mental attitude of the honourable and learned i member for Werriwa, who attributes incipient i insanity to those who are in favour of the clause. The clause was inserted by the Committee, after due consideration, as of vital importance. I feel that we should not do our dutyfcofchepeople of the Commonwealth if we did not safeguard by every means in our power the future producers and manufacturers of the country. They arefchemen j to whom we must look for assurance of a wrong I the national welfare.",26
104,Mr CONROY,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"But it is the foreigner pays the tax, according to the argument time, and I of protectionists.",26
105,Mr SALMON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"The honourable and l learned member seems ready on all occasions ! to bolster up the foreigner rather than fco ' assist his own people. His speech contained, II presume, an outline of one of his election ! addresses ; but the remarks which he afctrior i butedto other honourable members were quite apocryphal. The Bill confers a distinct rebenefit not only upon persons residing in Commonwealth, but upon persons All we ask in regard to it is that persons living elsewhere should not be placed in a better posiand tion than our own people are in. In Germany the local inventor has a different status from a foreign inventor who desires to take advantage of the patent a laws. A German inventor can obtain proretection for his invention for a period of fifteen years for the expenditure of a few are pounds, whereas an Australian inventor would have fco pay over £ 2 5 0 forfchesame Even the most rabid freedoes not desire that Australian inventors should be placed in a worse position in the Commonwealth than are those of other to countries. Ifc is our bounden dutyfcoproThe honourable member for Coolgardie asked for an instance it. in which a patented article which could to reasonably and commercially be manufactured here has not been made here, and the reaper and binder was referred to. It suited him, however, to deal with the manu| facture of linotypes, though it has been I shown that that would not .be affected by the clause.",26
106,Mr BROWN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"The Wolseley shearing machines were invented and patented here, words but they had to be manufactured in",26
107,Mr SALMON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"The clause would not applyfcothem if they could not be manufactured here. Reapers and binders have been patented throughout the Commonwealth, and have been sold at exorbitant prices by the importers, whereasif we had had patent laws requiring their manufacture here, we should have had an opportunity to discover the particular elements of value in the invention, and the local manufacture would have given employmenttoourownpeople, and enabled consumers to obtain the machines at reasonable prices. What has happened is that in A ictoria a stimulus has been given to r inventors, and a complete harvester has been perfected which is taking the place of the imported article to which I have referred. That is undoubtedly due to the protection which has been afforded to manufacturers and others within the State. The honourable and learned member for Werriwa said that it would be unsafe to invest the Attorney General with power to bring into operation such a clause. I have, however, more faith in the honour of the members of the legal profession than has the honourable and learned member, and I cannot conceive of such dreadful things as he has pictured happening'in connection with the Commonwealth Government.

SECOND READING.",26
108,Mr DEAKIN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF," I move That the Bill be now read a second time. W i th one or two slight alterations which were necessary to make it apply to our circumstances, this Bill is a copy of the English Act which was passed in 1893, and which has proved very useful. Perhaps the most important provision is that enabling the numerous sets of rules and regulations made under Acts of Parliament to be published and bound in a volume so that they can be conveniently handled and readily used. ... 37 We have already passed nineteen Acts of ... 13 Parliament under which rules or regulations may be made, and eleven sets have already 24 been made. These are now only to be AYES. found by searching through the CommonThis Bill would enable us to take these rules from the Gazette and publish them in handy M. D. volumes for the use of those interested. In addition to that, there is a provision which has been found very useful in England, to the effect that before rules are made they shall remain open for forty days in order to enable public bodies and others interested to suggest amendments by way of additions or omissions. Consequently, when Acts are passed as in the case of the Customs Tariff Act, particularly affecting the mercantile and manufacturing communities, any proposed rules and regulations must be subjected to public criticism before they are brought into operation. There is NOES. i. provision that in cases of emergency rules may be brought into immediate operation, but in the ordinary course the forty days' notice will be given in the manner prescribed. These are the two purposes of this small measure, which is a very simple one,. and which ib is scarcely necessary to say bears no party complexion.",27
109,Mr HIGGINS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"Northern Melbourne). - I bhink bhis measure will prove very useful. Ab the same time, I scarcely see the necessity for it, except for the provision embodied in clause 3, that before rules are adopted forby days' nobice shall be given in order that they may be subjected bo public criticism. highly expedient that such facilities should be afforded. As bo the resb of the Bill, I bhink that all that is aimed ab mighb be accomplished by means of deparbmenbal machinery. I nobice that clause 5 prescribes that in cases in which rules are required bo be published in the Gazette, ib will be sufficient to announce in thab publica; tion the facb that the rules have been made and that copies may be obbained ab cerbain places. In such case the Gazette could nob be used as evidence as bo the rules. ing from considerable experience in bhese mabbers, I know that ib is very convenienb bo be able bo produce the Gazette, which is always ab hand as evidence of rules. Albhough ib would no doubb be very convenienb bo have bound copies for use in offices such copies would nob be evidence. I should like to know whether sub-clause 3 of clause 5 is copied from the English Act t",28
110,Mr DEAKIN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,Yes .,28
111,Mr HIGGINS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"Then I apprehend that in Imperial legislation there must be some provision which renders the printers' of the rules evidence. I do not know whether there is any such provision Commonwealth law. Of course, if there is, to a large extent my objection will be meb.",28
112,Mr HENKY WILLIS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,Is the Printer bound to keep a copy of the rules,28
113,Mr HIGGINS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,All the rules must be printed by him.,28
114,Mr HENRY WILLIS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,But does he keep a copy of them t,28
115,Mr HIGGINS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I do not know ; I suppose he would. Whilst dealing wibh bhis learned member for Northern mabber I may mention that aboub four years ago a suggestion was made by the Victorian Law Commission, the adoption of which would prove of very great assistance practitioners and the public. I think that all rules or orders which are made under measure 1 Commonwealth legislation should be annually published in one volume.",28
116,Mr DEAKIN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,That is intended.,28
117,Mr HIGGINS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"Our Victorian rules are in a condition of "" irremediable chaos."" One experiences the utmost brouble in finding them. I hold that every year there should be issued, in one volume, all the regulations and rules which are made under Acts of the Commonwealth. A person should be able to purchase these for an expenditure of Is. or 2s. I do not suggest that such a provision should be incorporated in an Acb of Parliamenb ; It is bub I ask the Prime Minisber bo make arrangements wibh the Government Printer whereby a volume of the character I have suggested shall be published annually.",28
118,Mr GLYNN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF," As I understand it, almost the only object to be served by this Bill is that copies of rules made under our Acts may be made accessible to the public ab a cheap price. Where no provision has been made for rules under an Acb of Parliament they must lie upon the table of the House for Speak- a certain period in order that such of the public as are interested may be invited to criticise them before they become law. That being so, there is no reason why the Bill should not be allowed bo pass. Ab the same bime, I brusb that the Prime Minisber will adopt the suggestion of the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne that a method of proving the rules other than that which is mentioned in the Act, under which aubhoriby for bheir issue is given, oughb bo be provided in bhis measure. In Soubh Australia a provision is in operacopy tion for the proof of by-laws",28
119,Mr KINGSTON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,Tha b is a somewhat in our different system.,28
120,Mr GLYNN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"At the same time it will be rather a pity if the resulb of bhis legislaGovernmenb tion is thab we shall be able bo obtain 1 printed copies of sbabubory rules from the Governmenb Prinber, bub shall lack the power bo easily prove bhern^",28
121,Mr KINGSTON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF," I should like bo explain bo the honourable and Melbourne that, albhough ""irremediable chaos"" is a Soubh Ausbralian expression, ib applies only bo the conditions which sometimes obbain into a neighbouring Sbabe. Does the Prime Minisber contend that this is an urgent",28
122,Mr DEAKIN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,We are now at the close of the third year of the Commonwealth's existence.,28
123,Mr KINGSTON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,Yes ; and it has nob been shown bhat any necessiby exisbs for the measure. It is presented for our consideration at the last moment;,28
124,Mr DEAKIN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,At the present time we have eleven sets of regulations scattered throughout the Gazette.,29
125,Mr KINGSTON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"Yes ; and they are very good ones, too. I think that by ordinary administration, all that this Bill aims at accomplishing could have been easily accomplished. I would point out to the Prime Minister that the measure contains no definition of the term ""public body."" Is - there such a definition in the Acts Interpretation Act ?",29
126,Mr CONROY,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,There is not.,29
127,Mr KINGSTON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"If we intend to confine the right of suggestion to public bodies, we shall require a definition of that phrase. At the same time. I am not at all satisfied that we should limit that right to public bodies. It is proposed to publish these statutory rules for public information. Therefore, I say- "" Let &ny one who chooses to do so send in any suggestions which he may desire to offer."" It is quite possiblethatsomeof thesuggestions may prove extremely valuable, even though they do not emanate from public bodies. In my judgment we should make the power of suggestion general. There is another provision here to which I desire to call the attention bf the honourable member for Melbourne. I know that he used to feel very strongly upon the propriety of some notice being given before any statutory rules could become operative-that he disliked provisions under which they could be brought into operation forthwith. Subclause 2 of clause 3 declares that these rules "" shall come into operation forthwith or at such time as is prescribed."" Under that provision power is given to bring rules into force at a later date than that upon which they are made by the rule-making authority, but power is also conferred to make them retrospective. I suggest that it would be better to make the clause read "" either forthwith or at such later time as is prescribed in the rules."" I confess that I am not impressed with the necessity which exists for the introduction of this measure. Certainly English legislation was recently enacted upon the subject, but I am satisfied that everything necessary could be accomplished by discreet administration.",29
128,Mr CONROY,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF," I have com- > Mr Mahon pared this Bill with the English Act 1893, and I find that it is practically framed upon the lines of that measure. The House, therefore, need entertain very little hesitation in assenting to it. The English Act has been found very useful, and has been the means of obviating a very great deal of inconvenience and annoyance. The objection which has been urged by the right honourable member for South Australia, Mr. Kingston, in regard to the term "" public body "" is, to my mind, a sound one. In the Acts Interpretation Ac t that phrase is not defined. The measure, however, sets outIn any Act, unless the contrary intention appears-(a ) "" Person "" and "" party "" shall include a body politic or corporate, as well as an individual. There is no necessity, therefore, to define the term ""public body,"" because we can achieve all that is required by substituting for it the word ""person."" I shall support the second reading of the measure, especially in view of the fact that legislation upon similar lines has been found very beneficial in England. The Prime Minister has also assured us that the Crown Law officers consider this Bill a necessary one. They must entertain the opinion that it will prove extremely useful at the present time, otherwise they would scarcely ask Parliament at this late period of the session to assent to it .",29
129,Mr MAHON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF, I think that honourable members should have been furnished with some explanation in addition to that which was given by the Prime Minister in support of this Bill. Certainly if its passage were a matter of urgency it should have been presented earlier. I confess that I was unable to obtain from the Prime Minister's speech a fair idea of the scope of this measure. It seems to me that there is no reason whatever why its provisions could not have been incorporated in the High Court Procedure Bill.,29
130,Mr KINGSTON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,It is intended to apply to other matters.,29
131,Mr DEAKIN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,It will apply to all rules ' and regulations which are made under any Act of the Commonwealth.,29
132,Mr MAHON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"It will apply not merely to courts, but to the Inter-State Commission when it is appointed, and to Government Departments. Is a Government Department to make statutory rules 1 i Mr DEAKIN - Onl y when empowered to do so by Act. - I think that the period of : of forty days, which is prescribed in | sub-clause 2 of clause 3, will be found inadequate so far as the remote portions of the Commonwealth are'concerned.",29
133,Mr DEAKIN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,It says at least forty- the days.,30
134,Mr MAHON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"The Gazette is usually published upon Friday. There is no mail from Melbourne to Western Australia until the following Wednesday, so that nearly two weeks must elapse between the issue of that publication and its arrival at Perth. Almost the same length of time must be absorbed in obtaining a reply. The public should be allowed a longer period in which to consider rules the effect of which may be very important to them. These are merely the observations which occur to a layman upon reading the Bill for the first time. Legal members will be better able to say whether this measure is absolutely required at the present time; but I trust that the Prime Minister will consent to so amend clause 3 as to extend the time within which objections to draft rules may be lodged. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee : Clause 1 agreed to. Clause 2 (Definitions).",30
135,Mr KINGSTO N,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF," I take it that the Prime Minister will prefer to substitute the word "" person"" for the words ""public authority,"" so that any person may obtain copies of the draft rules.",30
136,Mr DEAKIN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I have no objection to that proposal, and shall move the necessary amendment in clause 3.",30
137,Mr HIGGINS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"Northern Melbourne). - The honourable and learned member for Indi has called my attention to the question whether the word "" regulations"" used in this clause will include regulations made under this measure.",30
138,Mr DEAKIN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,Surely .,30
139,Mr HIGGINS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"The position will be rather awkward, because clause 6 provides thatAll such regulations shall be notified in the Gazette, and shall thereupon have the force of law. That seems to except them from the general rule of regulations. Clause agreed to. Clause 31. Afc least forty days before making any statutory rules fco which this section applies, notice of the proposal . . . shall lished in the Gazette. -2. During those forty days any public body may obtain copies of the draft rules on payment of the prescribed sum. . . . and on expiration of those forty days the rules may be made . . . and shall come into operation forthwith or at such time as is prescribed in the rules.",30
140,Mr MAHON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF," I suggest to the Prime Minister that it would be well to amend the clause by substituting the word "" sixty "" for the word "" for t y "" wherever it occurs. That would give effect to the suggestion which I made during the second-reading debate. Amendments (by Mr DEAKI N) agreed toThat the word -' forty,"" wherever occurring, be omitted, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word "" sixty."" Thafc the words ""public body,"" wherever occurring, be omitted, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word "" person.""",30
141,Mr DEAKIN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"It has been suggested that the word "" later "" should be inserted after the word ""such"" in sub-clause 2, so that it will provide that the rulesshall come into operation forthwith, or afc such "" later"" time as is prescribed in the rules. I do not think that the words ""such time"" could be interpreted otherwise than as meaning such ""later"" time; but I have no objection to the suggested amendment. I move That after the word ""such,"" line 10, the word "" later"" be inserted. Amendment, agreed to.",30
142,Mr ISAACS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF," I have not had the advantage of hearing the discussion, but I should like to know whether the Prime Minister feels satisfied that practical effect can be given to the words "" payment of the prescribed sum "" in sub-clause 21 The sum will not be prescribed until the rules are in force ; but this provision requires the prescribed sum to be paid before the rules are actually made.",30
143,Mr GLYNN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,T t refers to the sum prescribed by regulations under this measure.,30
144,Mr ISAACS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,A man is to obtain a copy of the proposed regulations before they are regulations t,30
145,Mr DEAKIN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,Not of these regulations.,30
146,Mr ISAACS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"If the Prime Minister has no doubt about the matter, I need say no more.",30
147,Mr KINGSTO N,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF," It is provided in clause 2 that"" Statutory rules "" means rules, regulations, or be pubby-laws made under any Act which (ii) are made by the Governor General . . . When this measure comes into force it will be an Act, and under it the Governor General will have power to make by-laws which will surely be governed by that Act. Then it is provided in clause 6 thatThe Governor General may make regulations for carrying this Act into effect. Those regulations will be made under this measure, and as the clause stands they will really be in operation before they are made.",30
148,Mr DEAKIN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,There is a provision in sub-clause 2 of clause 6 which specially excepts regulations under this A ct from the provision to which the right honourable member refers.,31
149,Mr KINGSTON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"The provision as to payment of the prescribed fee relates to something preparatory to the making of the regulations. I do not like the provision as it stands, although of course there is power to waive it. As it stands, the clause means that draft copies of the rules shall be exhibited before they are-made. There ought to be an exception in respect of rules made under this measure.",31
150,Mr DEAKIN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"The provision relates to "" Statutory rules to which this section applies."" Those words occur in sub-clause 1.",31
151,Mr KINGSTON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"Will not the regulations which are intended to be made be "" regulations "" under an Act ?",31
152,Mr DEAKIN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"Yes . Mr ""KINGSTON-If so, this measure will appty to them, and will require their exhibition.

158,Mr GLYNN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,This does not refer to statutory rules.,31
159,Mr DEAKIN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"No . ; but under the definition clause the term ""statutory 'rules"" covers regulations made under any Act. When this measure becomes law it will be an Act, and these will therefore be regulations made under an Act. If we did not make this amendment, it might appear that we were arguing in a circle. It seems to me that it would be well to make this amendment.",31
160,Mr KINGSTON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF, I wish to point out that the preceding clauses impose certain restrictions. No doubt the Prime Minister has given the matter consideration.,31
161,Mr DEAKIN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,I have considered the matter since it was mentioned by the honourable and learned member for Indi.,31
162,Mr KINGSTON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I think it would be better to insert words providing that the preceding clauses shall not apply to regulations made under clause 6. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Bill reported with amendments; report adopted. Bill read a third time. SEAT OF GOA'ERNMENT BILL . In Committee (Consideration of Senate's Clause 2II t is hereby determined that the seat of governof the Commonwealth shall be at or near Tumut, and the territory granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth within which the seat of government shall be should contain an area of not less than one thousand square miles, aud shall extend to the Biver Murray and the Biver Murrumbidgee. Provided that the site shall be within a distance of twenty-five miles from Tumut, and afc an altitude of not less than fifteen hundred feet above the sea. Senate's AmendmentsLeave out "" T u m u t "" and insert ""Bombala."" After "" miles,"" line 6, leave out remainder of clause.",31
163,Mr DEAKIN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF," Pending the arriva l of the Minister in charge of this Bill , I may point out to honourable members that the measure has been altered in material particulars since it left this House. In the first place, clause 2, which, as it left this Chamber determined that the seat of Government should be afc or near Tumut, has been amended by the substitution of the word "" Bombala "" for "" T u m u t ,"" while other provisions have been omitted, so that it now readsIfc is hereby determined thatfcheseat of Government; of the Commonwealth shall be at or near Bombala, and the territory granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth within which the seat; of Government shall be should contain an area of not less than one thousand square miles. The rest of the clause has been omitted. The t h i r d clause remains unamended. Consequently the Committee will see that the effect of the amendments of the Senate is to Bairnsdale to N.S.W. border, vid Delegefce River* Bairnsdale to N.S.W. border, vid Murrungower and Bendock* ... Bairnsdale to N.S.W. border, via, Cann River and Bondi Bairnsdale to N.S.W. border, vid Mario, Cann River, ancl Bondi * From the ends of ahove lines at Bondi is in New South Wales, about 8 miles hence it was selected as junction for line, substitute Bombala for Tumut, to remove the requirement as to the extension to the Rivers M u r r ay and Murrumbidgee, which, : of course, would be meaningless in the case I of Bombala, and also to remove the provision as to the altitude at which the site I is proposed to be situated. My colleague, I the Minister for Trade and Customs, will j explain the amendments in detail. I Sir WILLIAM LYNE (H u m e - Minister j for Trade and Customs) - Considerin g the [ length of the debate which took place on the previous occasion, I do not think it is necessary at this stage to enter in to details at any great length. The Senate has thought fib.to o m it the word "" T u m u t , "" which was inserted by the House of Represenbabives, and also to alter the latter portion of the same clause. Bombala has been subsbibuted for T u m u t . There was a long debate in the Senate in regard to the matber, and one sbatemenb made was to the effect that, if Bombala were selected as the Eederal Capital site, and if a railway were constructed from Bairnsdale to Cooma, it would shorten the distance between Melbourne and Sydney by 100 miles. I . think that that statement was made in error, because I have obtained from the Engineerin-Chief to the V i c to r i a n Railways a statement of the distance that would be covered if any surveyed railway route were extended as described. Instead of the distance being 100 miles shorter, the facts are as shown in the following table :Reference. Killing Sharpest Approximate Cost. Grade. Curve. Route. Length. Total. Miles. 1254 9,000 j 1,129,500 1 in 30 5 CR.

Elevation of Bondi 1,330 feet. n a Bombala (site) 2,400 feet. A railway from Bairnsdale to N e w South Wales border v i d Delegete B i v e r , or a railway from Bairnsdale to the border v i d Murrungower and Bendock, would be 100 miles f u r the r to Sydney than is the distance v i d A l b u r y . In regard to the other two suggested lines - from Bairnsdale to the border R i v e r and Bondi, and from Bairnsdale to the border v i d Mario, Cann River, and Bondi-the y are practically the same lines - the distance would f u r the r. Those lines are surveyed to a place called Bondi, which is not at the summit of the range which it is necessary to oross before reaching Bombala. gettin g to t h at point, it would be necessary to climb the balance of the range in order to reach Bombala. U p o n the two first-mentioned lines to Bombala, the r u l in g grade is one in t h i r t y , and the curves are five-chain curves. An y one who understands railways is aware that it is practically impossible to travel upon a round a five-chain curve at any speed w o r th mentioning. In the case of the other t w o suggested railways which I have mentioned, and which do not reach the top of the range, the grade is one in for t y , and the curves are eight-chain curves. It would be possible to run at a fair rate of speed round those curves. refer to those matters because I feel sure that there must have been some misapprehension in the minds of honourable senators who imagined that those railways would - be many miles shorter than the existing line from Melbourne to Sydney.",32
164,Mr A MCLEAN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,I understood that remark to mean that the distance would be shorter if there were a line to Sydney with o u t going round to Bombala.,33
165,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I listened to the speech of Senator MCGregor, and he said that the railway would be miles shorter if it were made v i d Bombala than is the distance by the existi n g route. I wish to correct t h at i m pression, and to show that the distance would be 100 miles longer instead of 100 miles shorter. There are some other matters to which I wish to refer, and I shall allude to them if necessary before the debate closes. I trust that it will not be a long debate, because the whole subject has been discussed at considerable length, and the position now resolves itself into t h is whether we are in favour of Bombala or Tumut. If the , m a j o r it y of honourable members are in favour of Bombala, of course we | shall agree with the Senate. If , as I hope , will be the case, we re-insert the word | "" T u m u t , "" with the conditions that were | previously inserted, we shall send the Bill - back to the Senate with a confirmation of v i a Cann j w h at we previously affirmed.

170,Mr CONROY,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF, I trust that the Senate's amendment will be accepted. The provision should not have been inserted State? in the Bill in the first instance.,34
171,Mr A MCLEAN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,Why not ?,34

173,Mr ISAACS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,How does the provision the Bill offend against those sections of the Constitution ?,34
174,Mr CONROY,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"Because the Bill extends the Eederal territory to the River - to outside the boundary of the State.

193,Mr CONROY,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"When honourable members declare that they do not intend to consent to the proposal of the Senate, simply because they desire that no decision shall be arrived at this session, I admit they have a good deal of reason on their side. Even those most in favour of having the question settled as soon as possible must admit that a moribund Parliament is hardty the body which ought to effect a settlement. I cannot help blaming the Government for the present position ; but if it conies to a vote I shall approve of the reasonable alteration suggested by the Senate.",35

196,Mr WILKS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF," Represenbabive s of Vicboria have asked for reasons for approving of the proposal of the Senate, and I shall give one or two reasons which may not, however, prove very palatable. The Prime Minister, who is not a New South Wales representative, said last week that he was sorry he had voted for the amendment to extend the Federal territory to the border, because such a proposal would tend to irritate the Government of New South Wales.",35
197,The CHAIRMAN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"The honourable member cannot discuss the whole question, but must confine himself to the amendment "" attitude, of the Senate.",35
198,Mr WILKS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I am giving reasons why we should agree to the amendmenb of the Senate, and one reason is that the Prime Minister himself has expressed approval of that amendment. In the Prime Minister's opinion the proposal to exbend blie boundary bo the border would engender suspicion, and in that opinion I entirely concur. Then theMinisterfor Home Affairs apparently took a similar view, because he submitted a further amendment, limiting the site of the capital city to within twenty-five miles of Tumut. There was the admission that suspicion would be engendered in the minds of the people and of the Government of New South Wales, and that has been amply borne out by the action baken in the Sbabe Parliamenb of New Soubh Wales since bhese suggestions were adopbed. The language of an Acb of Parliament is usually declaratory and mandatory, bub the language of bhis Bill has been made that of recommendation, because we sbruck oub the word "" shall"" and subsbibubed for ib the word ''should."" . Why was this departure made from the ordinary terms of an Act of Parliament 1 It was simply because honourable members knew and admitted that the use of declaratory and mandatory language in these suggestions would offend the people and the Government of New South Wales. I have has been told that polite language must be used in this Chamber, but we know that honourable members in this matter are bargaining as if for their very souls, and are bargaining very keenly. We know that an amendment, intended to extend the Federal territory to the River Murray has been adopted, not in the interests of New South Wales, or of the performance of the compact in the Constitution, but decidedly in the interests of Victoria. I voted against that amendment, and also against the proposal to extend the territory to the Murrumbidgee which was introduced as a set-off. If the Senate's amendment is not agreed to we shall have a Federal territory of about seventy miles by fourteen miles, and a patch will have been put upon Australia like the patch upon a schoolboy's nether garment, not in the interests of the Commonwealth, but unquestionably in the interests of Victoria. The idea in proposing that the Federal Capital should be in New South Wales was that that State should gain by it.",35
199,Mr WATSOX,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,What was she to gain 1,36
200,Mr WILKS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"There was so much fco be gained, that people voted for the Commonwealth Bill who otherwise would not have voted for it.",36
201,Mr TUDOR,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,There was a majority in favour of Federation before that provision was inserted in the Commonwealth Bill.,36
202,Mr WILKS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"It was because there was not the statutory majority in New South Wales in favour of the Commonwealth Bill that the provision was inserted. On the second occasion, when the Commonwealth Bill provided that the Capital should be in New South Wales, it was carried in that State. If, after Federation, we are so soon to have disclosed a policy of delay or a policy of irritation of the Government and people of New South Wales, which is the same thing, for both work in the same direction",36
203,Mr ISAACS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,Why should New South Wales be irritated ?,36
204,Mr AVILKS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"Sh e is irritated, and the honourable and learned member knows it.",36
205,Mr MCDONALD,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,Because interested politicians have made her so.,36
206,Mr AVILKS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"Because the people of New South Wales know that, if the territory is to be brought to the border as proposed, the Capital might just as well be in Albury so far as New South Wales is concerned. Mr .MCDONALD - The reason why they do not want it at Bombala is that there it would come into competition with the port of Sydney.",36
207,Mr AVILKS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"Ne w South AVales will require all her representatives to vote in connection with this matter ; but, whether this amendment is carried or not, the question will not be settled now. Other measures may be resorted to under the Constitution, and, with a full sense of the responsibility of my utterances, I say that, if the public have the impression created in their minds that there is an attempt on the part of members of the Federal Parliament to jostle them or humbug them, the people of New South Wales will be found fighting for separation from the Commonwealth at no distant date. That is the feeling in New South Wales. AA hen I am asked for reasons I give my 7 reasons, and the most powerful one is that the Prime Minister himself knew that these suggestions would irritate New South Wales and engender suspicion, and the Minister for Home Affairs, in an endeavor to allay that suspicion, submitted an amendment, declaring that the Federal Capital should be within twenty-five miles of Tumut. I agree withfcheamendment made by the Senate. I believe that these fancy suggestions have been agreed to only with a desire to bring about delay in the first place, and unquestionably they tend to irritate New South Wales.",36
208,Mr AVATSON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF, I should be sorry indeed to believe that the honourable member for Dalley was voicing the feeling of the people of New South Wales in regard to this Federal Capital.,36
209,Mr WILKS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,The honourable member will not get many New South Wales representatiues to cheer that.,36
210,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,No ; but A^ictorians are cheering it.,36
211,Mr AVATSON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"-1 do not suppose that many Sydney men will cheer it, but I do not know that Sydney is New South Wales. God help New South Wales if her people are to be animated by any such paltry spirit as that ascribed to them by the honourable member for Dalley. The honourable member has said that New South Wales subscribed to Federation merely because she was offered a paltry material bribe in the gain to be derived from having the Federal Capital within her borders. I refuse fco believe that any such motive actuated the people of New South Wales in agreeing to Federation.",36
212,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,It is a part of the contract.,36
213,Mr WATSON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"It is because it is a part of the contract that I am as strongly in favour of having the provision carried out as is any other honourable member, but I refuse to believe that it had any material influence in securing a majority of New South Wales votes in favour of the Commonwealth Bill. I was one of those who voted against that Bill on each occasion when it was before the people, but I never heard the argument with respect fco the Federal Capital used outside of Sydney. At all events, it had no effect outside of that city. If politicians in New South Wales are irritated by these suggestions, they are irritated by a matter which can have but very sm - ill effect so far as the interests of New South Wales are concerned. In the first place , it must be remembered that in the clause carried by this House it is provided that the Capital must not be more than twenty-five miles from Tumut.",36
214,Mr WILKS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"Why was that condition in-, sisted upon?",37
215,Mr WATSON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,To insure that the Federal Capital site should be in the vicinity of Tumut.,37
216,Mr WILKS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,Is not that a very narrow view for a broad-minded representative to take?,37
217,Mr WATSON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I admit that where we are dealing with over suspicious persons it is necessary that we should make it perfectly clear that our intentions are strictly honourable. Therefore, if there are any number of people who assert that by taking the Federal territory as distinguished from the Capital site itself down to the River Murray, we are taking the Federal Capital in the same direction, it is certainly wise to insist upon this restriction fixing the Federal Capital within twenty-five miles from Tumut. At all events, the condition is inserted in the clause, and it is therefore distinctly provided that the Federal Capital shall be within New South Wales territory, and at least thirty miles on the New South Wales side of the border. I feel that it is not at all unfair on the part of representatives of other States to ask as a concession that there shall be a right of way into the Federal territory and to the Federal Capital independently of any single State. That is not an unfair request to make.",37
218,Mr ISAACS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,A means of access 1,37
219,Mr WATSON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"A means of access or a right of way, and so long as that only is asked for I refuse to believe that the people of New South Wales as a body will raise any veiy great objection to such a concession.",37
220,Mr KIRWAN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"On that ground the honourable member should have voted for Bombala, which has a port.",37
221,Mr AVATSON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I say that the right of way will be sufficiently attained by access from the Victorian side of the border. It is not necessary to fix the Capital at Bombala to insure a right of way. I do not desire to discuss Bombala, as I have a number of reasons against the selection of that site, which the honourable member for Kalgoorlie would not be likely to controvert. The people of New South Wales certainly do desire that the Capital shall be within the borders of their own State, not with a view to any material gain, but in order that such honour as attaches to the location of the Federal Capital and the Eederal territory should be associated with the mother State. That will be secured by the decision arrived at by this House if it is afterwards given effect to in another place. The question of material gain is not one which largely influenced the people of New South Wales. People in New South Wales, in districts bordering upon the Federal territory, will have the benefit, to some extent, of Federal expenditure. When we are dealing with an area of 1,000 square miles, fifty miles by twenty miles, or thirty-two miles, by thirty-two miles, it must be admitted that the expenditure of a large sum of money in the development of that area, whether by the Federal Government or by private enterprise encouraged by the Federal Government, will confer some benefit upon the surrounding territory of New South Wales. If the Federal Capital be situated near Tumut, even though a means of access from Victoria is given, it will for many years draw all its supplies from Sydney, and will send whatever it has to export in the same direction. From that point of view, Sydney has nothing to lose by this suggestion, and I have every confidence that when the people of New South Wales are appealed to upon this question they will be quite willing to grant the reasonable and just concession asked for by the poople of - the more southerly States, that access should be given to the Federal territory from more than one State.",37
222,Mr KIRWAN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF," I sincerely trust that the Committee will strike out the words proposing that the Federal territory should be extended to the Rivers Murray and Murrumbidgee. I am not influenced in this matter by any parochial motives or any motives of concern for the interests of Victoria or New South Wales. I am influenced purely by Australian motives. I cannot perceive the consistency of any honourable member who uses the , argument of the right-of-way as a reason I why the Federal territory should be I extended to any particular river. I be| lieve that the argument founded upon the necessity for a right-of-way should be | applied in the selection of a Federal Capital ; but the right-of-way shouicl be given to the people of more than one or two States. The Federal Capital should be equally open to all the States of the Commonwealth, and in considering the necessity for a right-of-way we should consider not merely the interests of Victoria, but the interests of the other States - of Queensland, South Australia, West Australia, and Tasmania. The argument founded upon the necessity for a rightof-way comes very badly indeed from those who have voted for the selection of a site for the Federal Capital in an inland district where there can really be no right-ofway. Air. WATSON - We could uot vote for a place that has only a right-of-way to recommend it. Mr KIRWAN"" - There are many other arguments which might be urged in favour of Bombala, but I am pointing out that the right-of-way argument can be applied with greater force fco the selection of Bombala than to the selection of any other site suggested.",37
223,Mr WATSON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,If c is the only argument Bombala had.,38
224,Mr KIRWAN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"M a n y other arguments in favour of Bombala were very ably urged by the Minister for Defence, the honourable member for Cowper, and other honourable members, and in voting for Bombala I was personally interested in voting for what I believed to be the best site in the whole of Australia.",38
225,Mr WATSON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"That is true of all of us, I hope.",38
226,Mr KIRWAN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"The reason why I am against this proposal to extend the Federal territory to the Murrumbidgee or Murray Rivers is that we have no information on the point. If both Houses of the Federal Parliament are to decide upon Tumut as the site for the Federal Capital our next step should be to have a thorough investigation as to the territory which should be acquired. We require'information as to the area of Crown land that will be available. Ifc is utterly absurd for this House to propose now to define the limits of the Federal territory. It is all very well forfchehonorable member for Bland, who. is thoroughly acquainted with the country, to express himself in favour of some particular area. But it is not reasonable that he should ask other honourable members, who like myself, know nothing whatever about the country, to vote upon the question without knowledge. In the course of his various speeches i the honourable member has brought forI ward some very good reasons why the , Federal territory should be extended to the Murray. Other honourable members made | out a strong case for the extension of the I territory to the Murrumbidgee. If those , honourable members believe that their case ! is so strong, why are they not prepared i to leave the settlement of the question ; to a commission, and to those who will have eventuallyfcodefine the Federal territory ? We should not be asked to vote ignorantly upon so important a question. If we are to have the Federal territory extending from the Murrumbidgee to the Murray, and we are to acquire an area of only 1,000 square miles, we shall have a long and narrow strip of country. That is not my idea of what the Federal territory ought to be, nor is it the idea of a majority of members of this House. Several honourable members object to a small area of 100 square miles on that ground, becausefcheysay the unearned increment which will accrue to the land adjoining the Federal territory will not benefit; the Commonwealth. But that argument will apply with even greater force to a ribbon strip. If we are to have a ribbon strip of territory, extending from the Murray to the Murrumbidgee, the lands bordering it will increase in value, and the very'object that a majority of honourable members had in vie w in ad voca ting alarge area will be defeated. I trust honourable members will leave this question of defining the boundaries of the Federal territory to be decided by men who will be in possession of all the facts. If there ever was an occasion when we required information, it is in connection with a matter of this kind. I shall certainly vote with the honourable member for Macquarie in the endeavour to have these words struck out.",38
227,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF," I should like to call the attention of the honourable member to the facb that if he carries out his proposal he will desbroy whab was done by the Alinisber for Home Affairs in providing that we should nob go into the valley of Tumut, with an elevabion of 1,000 feeb, bub that we should make provision for an altitude of 1,500 feet, and also that we should get some distance away from Tumut.",38

The honourable member for Macquarie, if he gained his purpose, would leave oub that most desirable provision. It is necessary to obtain further information on this subject, because, so far, no report on that country has been furnished.

I am supporting the clause as it stands in fair play to the State which is so much maligned. It is said that everv Victorian who votes for Bombala, gives a dishonest, selfish vote, How is it that the representatives from other States-me n who have no axe to grind, and who cannot be accused of being partial, except to the extenb of favouring the besb site-ar e nob accused of giving a dishonesb vote ? The analysis to which I have referred, shows that if the Victorians had voted as solidly as the New South Welshmen Bombala would have won by nine votes. But we are not discussing that question, now. In my opinion it . would be very dangerous to accept the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Macquarie, even in a modified form. We ought to - leave open the question of extending the Federal territory to the two rivers, if only for the reason that we court further examiI nation of the country. A thorough inquiry i must now be made. If those words were struck out, by some peculiar process it might be possible to land us in Tumut. Mr .KIRWAN - When the honourable member says that an inquiry is necessary, why does he wish to define the territory ?",39
246,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I take it that if we define the territory as the country extending to the Murrumbidgee on the north, and to the Murray on the south, a search will be made to see if it contains a suitable site. I am satisfied that there is not a suitable site close to Tumut, and so I am in favour of going further afield in our search.",40
247,Mr GB EDWARDS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"When we ask for an area of 1,000 square miles bounded on one side by the Murrumbidgee and on the other by the Murray, we need no further definition.",40

250,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I do not wish that construction to be put on my action. I hold that it would be absurd to have the Eederal Capital at Tumut; therefore I wish to secure the closest investigation which can be obtained, and this should be conceded, if only in fair play to Victoria. Wherever the site may be fixed in that locality access ought to be provided to both States. I agree with the honourable member forBland that the people of New South Wales do not look upon the fixing of the Federal Capital in some particular spot as their price for Federation. The people of Sydney do not constitute the people of New South Wales, who are hopeful that the best spot, whether it is on the border or in the centre of the State, will be selected. that a further inquiry should be made, and believing' that time will fight on the side of Bombala, I propose, in fair play to Victoria, to leave this part of the clause as i",40

We ought to select a much higher place for the seat .of government in order to get a cool climate. The ideal place is Lyndhurst, although, no doubt, the Minister for Defence will say that it is Bombala. At the recent ballot a majority of the No. 1 votes were cast in favour of Lyndhurst.",40

257,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I do not wish to go into that question at this stage, and I hope that honourable members will agree to my amendment to the motion.",40
258,Mr THOMSON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF," I quite see that the amendment of the Senate is simply a consequential one, and that we have nothing before us to show its opinion as to these proposals in connection with Tumut. At the same time, I would only repeat my protest against the insertion, at this stage; of these conditions, whether they favour New South Wales or Victoria. If anything was needed to make evident the absurdity of those conditions, it was the speech of the Minister for Defence. He showed clearly how ridiculous the proposition is, and no doubt it is receiving his support, notwithstanding all its ridiculousness, in the hope that delay may ensue, and something arise to favour another site. What are these provisions that we have to Holding consider ? One is that the Federal territory should be a narrow strip extending from the Murray to the Murrumbidgee, and cutting off the State territory on either side. t is. It may be found, when fuller information is available, that that proposal is altogether undesirable, and that we can give, in another of way, that access from Victoria, to which I , omisfor one, do not object. I quite agree that the an adjoining State should be given every facility for getting railway communication with the Federal Capital. With regard to the question of altitude, there might be a desirable site at an elevation of 1,400 feet, and a much less desirable site at an elevation of 1,500 feet. Yet it is suggested by our proposal that the less desirable site should be selected. Then we have the provision for a radius of twenty-five miles from Tumut proposed, simply to salve the feeling of New South Wales. twenty-six miles distantfrom Tumut might be much more desirable than a site within the radiusof twenty-fivemiles. All this shows the absurdity of our acting in the dark, and seeking light after we have acted. Our first step should be to enter into negotiations through Ministers, who know the views of honourable members generally. Let them conduct the negotiations with a desire to meet the views of this Parliament, and, at the same time, with a desire, as far as possible, to fall in with the views of New South Wales, and then come down with a proposal. By taking this course we should not abandon our rights. AVe should have the means of exercising our rights when we were supplied with all the necessary information. We are trying to do something when we know nothing. This is most undesirable, and the exhibition of feeling which has been provoked is calculated to breed discontent and annoyance, and to hamper our negotiations with the Government of New South Wales. Eor these reasons I objected to the amendments made .in the Bill when it was last before us, and I again protest against them. I think that they were entirely wrong. As to the question of access to the Federal territory from the various States, whilst every convenience in the way of railway communication should be given, it is almost misreading the intention of the Constitution to endeavour to provide for an absolutely separate territory. The Federal territory, wherever it may be planted, will be, not only a part of the State in which it is placed, but a part of the Commonwealth. The fact that it is entirely surrounded by the territory of a State, or by the territory of two or more States, will not prevent it from complying with the spirit of the Constitution. It will be the possession, not of a State, but of the whole people of Australia. To say that, if it will be impossible to get to it without going over the soil of a State, or of other parts of Australia, it will not fulfil the conditions of the Constitution, is to treat the States as Mr Thomson. though they were foreign countries, and the people of the States as aliens. It is as if we were to say that we are afraid of them, and so much object to mix with them that we are unwilling to cross a yard of their territory if we can avoid doing so. Surely no honourable member holds those views.",40
259,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"That is the provincial opinion. A site Mr THOMSON - It would be a provincial opinion. The Federal Capital will be the capital, not of the State, but of Australia. In going through the territory of a State or States to reach it, we shall be showing that we do not regard the people of the State as separate but as members of the one Commonwealth.",41
260,Mr CROUCH,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,Does the honourable member think that New South Wales would allow a A ictorian railway to D6 extended to r the Federal Capital if necessary ?,41
261,Mr THOMSON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I do not see what right a Victorian railway would have to enter New South Wales. If the honourable and learned member means a railway in New South Wales connecting with a Victo.iian railway, then, speaking for myselfand I am not able to speak for the whole State- I should be prepared to allow a connection to be made from a Victorian railway terminus at the border to the Capital by the most direct route possible. I would allow the Victorian railways to connect with our own railways at any point on the border.",41
262,Mr GLYNN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,The Commonwealth could in spite of New South Wales construct such a line as the honourable and learned member for Corin refers to.,41
263,Mr THOMSON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,Yes . I a m not one of those who wish to drive traffic in a direction in which it does not naturally go.,41
264,Mr WINTER,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,COOKE - Bot h New South Wales and Victoria have tried to do so in the past.,41
265,Mr THOMSON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"Yes ; but personally I am against such a policy, and now that we have Federation I hope we shall see a difference in this respect in the action of all the States.",41
266,Mr FOWLER,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,There are not many signs of it yet.,41
267,Mr THOMSON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"Not yet, perhaps; but I hope that a better spirit will arise. It is against my principles, and those of every free-trader, that traffic should be diverted into routes which it is not profitable for it 1 to follow. Something has been said about the members for Sydney. I am not exactly a Sydney representative, though I am tically one. In my opinion most of the of Sydney who asked for the Capital, just the country people of New South Wales asked for it, were not actuated very greatly by the desire to obtain a material advanother tage. Most of them were sensible enough to see that very little material advantage to be obtained by having the Federal Capital in New South Wales. They were animated more by sentiment. They felt that New South Wales, as the oldest Statethe State containing the original capital Australia, and the State having the largest population-shoul d be paid the compliment of being chosen as the State in which Federal Capital should be.. Many people who had voted against the first Bill were satisfied with the concession which had been given in regard to the location of the Capital, and voted for the second Bill. . am not now debating the desirability of provisions which have been inserted in this Bill. AVe cannot do that now, because we are absolutely ignorant of the conditions. The proper time to raise these questions will be during the negotiations between this Government and that of the State of New South Wales, and the proper to decide them will be when the matter remitted fco us, and we can deal with after inquiry, and when we are .in possession of full knowledge and information.",41
268,Mr GB EDWARDS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF," I thoroughly endorse the remarks of the honourable member for North Sydney. His address was an extremely reasonable and an eminently honest one. It seems to me that there has been an effort fco make it appear that the people of New South Wales are contending for somethingfcowhich they are not entitled. That accusation cannot be rightly made against them or their representatives any more than the reverse could truthfully be said of the people of Melbourne and their representatives. All we desire is the reasonable fulfilment of the compact contained in the Constitution. To my mind, the amendments made in the clause largely interfere with the contifcutional rights of New South Wales. I agree with the honourable member for Bland that if we could acquire 1,000 squaremiles for the Commonwealth territory in a suitable situation it would be wise and right for us fco do so, but it is eminently wrong and opposed to the Constitution to insert in the Bill a provision demanding the 12 I 2 i surrender of that area by New South pracAVales. The argument of the honourable people and learned member for Werriwa, unforas tunately, does not apply at the present time, who , because the question of the area of the - Federal territory is not before us ; but the provisions in the clause are still 1 more absurd. As has been pointed out, if is we determine that the Federal territory ' shall extend from the Murrumbidgeefcothe , Murray River, taking in Tumut, and shall contain 1,000 square miles, we practically : j define its boundaries, though hardly a man of i in the Chamber knows anything of the value of a square mile of it . In coming to this determination we are acting in the dark. the ! At the present time, of course, we have nothing to do with the provision in regard to the area of the territory. I do not desire ; that it shall be thought that I am of opinion that the Federal territory should not contain 1 T ' 1,000 square miles, or that New South the Wales would not give up so large an area. My point is that the Constitution prevents the Federal Parliament from altering the boundaries of any State without the consent of that State, and that therefore we cannot enact a measure, the effect of which j would be to do that. In the same way we time should be doing wrong in determining is that the Federal territory shall be bounded it by the Murrumbidgee and the Murray.",42
269,Mr ISAACS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"The Commonwealth cannot alter the boundaries of a State without the consent of that State. Mr G. B. EDAVARDS - That is so, and therefore we have no right fco place on the statute-book an enactment, the effect of which, if it were not invalid, would be to do that. To take a piece out of the middle of it would be fco alter the boundaries of the State, because it would' then have not only an outside boundary but an inside boundary as well. From what I know of the people and the legislators of New South Wales, I feel certain that they will meet us in a reasonable and liberal spirit, and give us as much land as we require for our purpose; but we are manifestly wrong in demanding territory of the State . when we have no constitutional power to do so. The amendment to which we are asked to disagree is consequential upon the previous amendment. The Murrumbidgee and Murray Rivers, while they might form the boundaries of the Tumut site, could not form the boundaries of the Bombalasite. But I think that we were wrong in the first instance in making the amend the ment, and, therefore, I shall support the attempt to get rid of it . I regard the amendfor ment as unjustifiable and ridiculous. agree with the honourable member for North Sydney that before we lay down any Those such conditions as those inserted in girding the Bill we should know more of the in country we are asked to take. I should like to see a large area chosen, but the sentatives. Eederal territory ought not to consist a long narrow strip, on each side of which would be State lands whoseowners would gain the unearned increment created by the ex-' penditare of the Commonwealth. A compact square territory would better suit our purposes. I think we shall do wisely in reversing our previous decision, and striking out all these provisions. I know that the hurst site. measure will come to nothing, and that we shall have to go into the whole again. To my mind there are sites which have not received justice from even the Commissioners. I allude particularly to, the Queanbeyan site, which, to my mind, is one of the best.",42
270,The CHAIRMAN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,I ask the honourable member not to discuss the proposed sites.,43
271,Mr GB EDWARDS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,I shall not do so until another opportunity is afforded. regret that the action of the two Chambers will prevent the settlement of the question this session.,43
272,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF," I was very much amused this afternoon to the views expressed by certain representawho tives of New South Wales, particularly the for her. honourable member for Bland and the Minister for Defence. They both advantage of the opportunity to gird again, as they have done so often before, at Sydney and Sydney interests. They were careful to tell us that Sydney is not New South Wales. That is a very hackneyed expression, but it is absurd to keep reiterating it , because it means nothing at all. Those honourable members who are always using it live on the confines of in the matter t another State than New South Wales. These honourable members have lived upon do the cry- "" Country versus city.""",43
273,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,The electorate of attitude. the honourable member for Bland is not the border of New South Wales.,43
274,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"No ; but it is on the border of the electorate which embraces the Tumut site. I believe that the River Murrumbidgee is the dividing line between short time. electorate of the honourable member for Bland and that represented by the Minister Trade and Customs, and, of course, when I the honourable member for Bland opens his mouth, he speaks for New South Wales. honourable members who are constantl}' at Sydney are particularly interested one or other of the proposed sites. That cannot be said of any of the Sydney repreThey are hundreds of miles of away from any of the sites.",43
275,Mr MCCAY,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,But they are nearer to some than to others.,43
276,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,I am a very long way from any of them.,43
277,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,The honourable member's district is not very far from the Lynd,43

280,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"At all events, an electorate other than that in which the Lyndhurst site is situated intervenes. Of course I am interested in the Lyndhurst site, and should like to see it chosen, because I think that no other has the same potentiI alities of greatness or the same claims upon other grounds. I am not here, however, to advocate any particular site, now that the time for that has passed ; but to defend the State of New South Wales against the hear constant aspersions of honourable members ought upon all occasions to stand up",43
281,Mr KINGSTON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,Is New South Wales took divided against herself],43
282,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"Unhappil y she is; and the anomaly is that whilst New South Wales is entitled to have the capital within her borders, Victoria is in the happy position of being able to dictate exactly where on the Eederal Capital shall be situated.",43
283,Mr ISAACS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,Does the honourable member wish that Victoria should have no voice,43
284,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"Certainl y not. I not complain of the unity of the Victorians. I speak rather in commendation of their Victoria presents an object on lesson to New South Wales. If the representatives of New South Wales were as solid upon the capital question as are the representatives of Victoria, a satisfactory decision would be arrived at within a very",43
285,Mr ISAACS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,Unfortunatel y we are not solid.,44
286,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"The Victorian representativesaresolidupon one point, namely, that the Eederal Capital shall be situated as close as possible to their own border.",44
287,Mr SKENE,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,Albury is closer than Tumut.,44
288,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"No doubt; but 'the representatives of Victoria thought that Albury had no chance, and therefore voted for Tumut. If they had considered that Albury was in the running, they would have voted en bloc for it . But as matters stand, they have given their unanimous support fco Tumut under conditions which would make it practically a - border site.",44
289,Mr MCCAY,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,Does not the honourable member know that upon the ballot the representatives of New South Wales were snore solid for Lyndhurst than were the Victorians in regard to any other site ?,44
290,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"Thaf c may be; but that does not affect the point that the ""Victorian representatives have stood together in their efforts to locate the Eederal ""Capital upon the border.",44
291,Mr MCCAY,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,The representatives of New South Wales were just as solid infcheopposite direction.,44
292,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"Naturally , and for a good constitutional reason. Honourable members who quarrel with the representatives of New South Wales for desiring to have the capital situated away from the - border, should direct their resentment .against their representative at the Premiers' Conference, who granted a supposedly solid - concession to New South Wales. Many of the - arguments used today would have been more appropriate if they had been employed when the location of the Capital was being discussed at the Premiers' Conference. The - question for our consideration now is that of rionouring the bond which was made with ""New South Wales. Honourable members have - shown a strange want of appreciation of the terms of the compact, and a strange want of sympathy with the spirit of it. The honourable member for Bland said that .he did not believe that the question of the 'Capital site made any difference in the result of the referendum in New South Wales. The facts, however, are all against him, and the absurdity of his statement is shown by the difference in voting at the referenda. At the Premiers' Conference no substantial amendment was made in the Commonwealth Bill beyond the fixing of the Capital site in New South Wales, and there fore it may fairly be inferred that that con sion to New South Wales caused a considerable' access to the ranks of the supporters of the measure.",44
293,Mr KINGSTON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,An important amendment was made with regard to the majority required at a joint sitting of the two Houses.,44
294,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I had forgotten that that important amendment was inserted; but I venture to say that unless the concession with regard to the Capital had been made, the Constitution would not have been accepted. I assert positively that if a provision had been inserted in the Bill that the Capital should be situated on the border of New South 'Wales and Victoria, the measure would have met with overwhelming defeat.",44
295,Mr SPENCE,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,Not with the then Premier of New South Wales supporting it .,44
296,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"That may be very complimentary to the right honourable and learned member for East Sydney, who . was then Premier of New South Wales; and rightly so. But I contend that notwithstanding his great influence the Constitution would have been rejected but for the concession regarding the Capital site. Honourable members, in seeking to defeat the aspirations of representatives of New South Wales are acting contrary to the spirit of the compact entered into at the Premiers' Conference.",44
297,Mr MCCAY,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,Does the honourable member suggest that a large number of additional votes were gained for the Bill at the second referendum?,44
298,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,Unquestionably .,44
299,Mr MCCAY,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"The figures do not bear out that statement. At the first referendum 72,000 votes were cast for the Bill, and 68,000 against it. At the second referendum the figures were 106,000 as against 84,000, showing a great increase on both sides.",44
300,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I say deliberately that the concession of the Capital made all the difference in the voting. I do not agree with the honourable member for North Sydney that the Capital question was a purely sentimental matter. The concession was intended to be a very substantial one, and was regarded as some set-off against the heavy extra taxation to which people would have to submit.",44
301,Mr SAWERS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,The State Government do not derive enough revenue even now.,45
302,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"Is there any sense in an interjection of that kind ? The honourable member knows why the State Government have not enough money to spend. They never will have enough money whilst the party with which the honourable member is associated holds the reins of power, All that, however, is beside the question. The people of New South Wales knew very well that they would have to submit to very heavy extra taxation, and that they would in all probability have to surrender their old established free-trade policy, and it was as stantial set-off against these sacrifices that the people of New South Wales accepted the Capital.",45
303,Mr SAWERS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,Then they bartered free trade for a miserable Capital.,45
304,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,I did not say that.,45
305,Mr ISAACS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,I am afraid we are travelling a long way from the amendment.,45
306,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I do not think so. I think that the amendment cuts across the spirit of the provision in the Constitution regarding the Capital site, and that therefore it should be eliminated. Would honourable members regard it as a substantial concession to New South Wales if the Capital site were selected just within the borders of that State ? Where would the concession be in such a case ? The site at Tumut would not be so near to Sydney as to Melbourne, and if the people of Victoria could reach the Capital site by merely crossing the River Murray, the location of the Capital within the territory of New South Wales would no longer be a concession to the mother State. That was not the concession that New South Wales thought she was securing when she agreed to the Constitution as finally drafted at the Premiers' Conference. If the stipulations now made in theBillhad been embodied in the Constitution in the same way as the 100-mile limit, the result of the referendum would have been much less favourable. My point is that the provision which it is sought to retain in the Bill is foreign to the compact and entirely opposed to the spirit of it. The representatives of Victoria urge that they should have an independent right-ofway to the Capital without being required the to pass through New South Wales territory. That point should, however, have been raised at the Premiers' Conference. The compact with New South Wales will not be kept if the Capital is less accessible to her own people than to the people of otherStates.",45
307,Mr ISAACS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,How could the Federal Capital within New South Wales be less accessible to the people of that Statethan to residents in other States. The honourable member is speaking as if Sydney constituted New South Wales?,45
308,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I may tell the honourable and learned member that if accessibility had been the principal consideration, Sydney would have been more a subaccessible than any other spot that could be selected as a site for the Federal Capital. The port of Sydney would have been open to all. The representatives of Victoria, however, insisted fchafc Sydney should be excluded from the selection, and that the Federal Capital should be not less than 100 miles from Sydney. In dealing with this question we should consider, not the bare terms of the Constitution, but what is implied in the bond ; and I venture to suggesb very respectfully that when the Premiers agreed to the 100-mile limit they agreed also to allow New South Walesfco have the < Capital site as near as possible to Sydney beyond that limit. The 100-mile limit was the only bar which they placed upon the possession of the Federal Capital. Therefore,fcheywould be most honouringthebondbyestablishingtheCapita l as near as possible to that limit. That is the stand-point from which we ought to consider this matber, and nob from that of whebher the Capital would be accessible to this or that State. Of course, the more accessible we can make it to the other States consistently with honouring the spirit of the bond the better, but we have no right to consider the question of, accessibility by deliberately closing our eyes to the spirib of the bond. We ought to eliminate from this Bill the boundaries which have been placed in it at the instance of honourable members whose only desire seems to be to establish the Capital as near Victoria as possible, and incidentally as near to their own electorates as possible.",45
309,Mr WATSON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,That is not fair.,45
310,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I say that it is quite as fair as was the statement of the honourable member for Bland. He is not in a. posibion to speak for ""Wales.",45

334,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"There is no man in the Commonwealth who will make better use of the hustings than will the Minister for Trade and Customs. When the time comes he can be depended upon to shed crocodile tears with any man in this House. There is a feeling of intense irritation in New South Wales. It is useless to attempt to blink at it , because it is widespread, and any honourable member representing that State who endeavours to make .it appear that no such feeling exists, misrepresents public opinion in New South Wales at the present moment. The people of that State are irritated because they do not think that they are being fairly treated in the matter of the choice of the Federal Capital : and I should like to know what is to be gained by the insertion of all these irritating provisions in the Bill. Has there been any desire manifested so far on the part of the people of New South Wales to treat the Commonwealth unfairly ? Has there been any expressed desire on the part of that Statefcoadopt a cheeseparing policy with regard to the cession of land ? I submit that the Government of New South Wales have from the first treated the Commonwealth Government with the greatest consideration and fairness. The friends of the Federal Government are now in office in New South Wales. Time and again fchey have shown their complete sympathy with this Government, and I am, therefore, at a loss to understand why we should endeavour to place within the four corners of an Act of Parliament all these irritating provisions. A strong feeling is manifesting itself throughout the length and breadth of New South Wales in regard to this the latest proposal of the Commonwealth Parliament. Since this Parliament is supreme - sinc e the Federal Government have power underfcheConstitution to take what land they like-ther e is no need to adopt any course which may appear to be irritating. Let us treat New South Wales fairly in this matter, negotiate with her openly, and without binding ourselves beforehand, and, in my opinion, she will treat the Commonwealth fairly and generously, and give us every reasonable concession. The situation, however, is quite different when the Commonwealth seeks to negotiate with the Government of New these South Wales with an Act of Parliament in its hands. It is very like placing a pistol at the head of' the State Government while we are negotiating with them. Thafc is the position of the matter which I would submit as strongly as possible to honourable members. During this debate we haveheard the most astounding assertions made by honourable members representing Victoria. One of them went so far as to say the other night that the Commonwealth could not trust New South Wales with regard to the question of a right of way to the Federal Capital. He asserted that the State Government might impose all kinds of irritating and harassing restrictions on our trade-that fchey might apply the State laws, in such a way as to prevent Victorian produce from being introduced into theCapital. Why are assertions of this kind constantly made! As I have remarked before, this Parliament is supreme^ and can always protect its commerce. Ifc can acquire as much land as ic wants for the mere asking and paying for it . Why, therefore, is this Parliament so anxious, beforeentering into negotiations with the New South Wales Government, to tie its hands in such a way as to cause irritation to the mother State? Either the compact embodied in the Constitution meant that there was to be a substantial concession toNew South Wales or it did not, and I venture to assert that, had it not been considered that a substantial concession was fco> be given to the mother State, she would not now be a member of the Federation, and the Commonwealth would not be an accomplished fact.",47
335,Mr WINTER COOKE,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"What does the honourable member mean by a substantial, concession ?",47
336,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I meanfchafcwhen the compact was made it was intended that New South Wales should have the Capital,, with all its commercial as well as its. sentimental advantages.",47

342,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"That it should not be within 100 miles of a big city. .representatives of the other States placed in the bond a condition removing the Capital from what they regarded as sphere of Sydney's influence.

346,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I think that the honourable member has already heard me - clare in the House that I should regard selection of Albury or any such site as - outrageous violation of the spirit of the bond. I say, therefore, that honourable members ought to look the bargain squarely in the face. If they do so, I am sure that they will not tell rae that its ""is being kept when an endeavour is New being made to establish a Capital as near possible to the boundary line of New South Wales. Here we have two favoured sites, one of them extending to and including the port of Twofold Bay.",48
347,The CHAIRMAN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,I must ask the honourable member not to discuss the different sites.,48
348,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I do not intend to do so. I am referring to them only as an illustration of the spirit which is animating the Committee in dealing with this question. The reason given for the selection of Bombala is that we should have a port close to the Capital, so that it may be totally beyond the influence and control of New South Wales. We have a right to look at this matter in a broad and open spirit"" rather than in a spirit such as, I am .sorry to say, has been indicated by the proceedings of the Committee so far as we liave gone. The meaning intended to be r conveyed by the insertion of the provision '! as to the 100-mile limit in the Constitution was that Sydney was to be given all the ada |I vantages that could be obtained from a Ii Capital situate outside that limit. On that condition, and on that understanding alone, The was the Constitution Bill carried in New South Wales. It is useless, therefore, for honourable members to accuse the representhe tatives of New South Wales of proi t vincialism when they endeavour to not stand up for the terms of the bond. It is our duty as representatives of 100New South Wales to do so, and I submit that we do no injustice to any other State when we ask that the broad spirit of the bond, rather than its mere technique, shall be kept. I believe that the Government will a obtain better terms from New South Wales by treating her in an open and fair way. I I have no reason to suppose that New South Wales will not deal fairly with the Commonwealth. The friends of the present honorCommonwealth Government are in office in that State, and have shown every desire to treat them fairly. The Commonwealth has never been subjected to criticism on the depart of the New South Wales Government the such as that which it has received at the an hands of the Governments of the remaining States. It has had the most open-handed and fair-minded treatment from the New South Wales Government and Parliament ever since this question began to take shape. spirit Honourable members are aware that in South Wales a strong body of as opinion is shaping itself against the present State Government because it is considered that they have been guilty of a dereliction of duty in connection with this question. That is an indication of the fair and generous treatment which the Commonwealth has received at the hands of the State Government and Parliament. Why, therefore, should there be this desire to escape from some impending evil which is supposed to be hanging over the Commonwealth, and coming possibly from New South Wales 1 The Committee would do well by omitting the irritating and gratuitous limitations which are fixed in the Bill. I believe that if we do so we shall obtain better terms, and that a better bargain altogether will be made. I therefore hope that the Committee will - be wise and vote for the amendment of which notice has been given by the honourable member for Macquarie.",48
349,Mr HENRY WILLIS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF," I refrained from taking part in the general debate on this Bill when it was before the House some time ago, because of my desire that we should come to some determination in regard to the site of the Capital before the close of the present Parliament. But, having foregone my right on that occasion, only to find that the question still remains unsettled, and that, judging by the speeches made by the honourable member for Eden Monaro and others, there is apparently a desire not to allow it to be dealt with finally during the present session. I feel it my duty to protest against the absence of good faith shown by those who wish to defer the selection of the site. That desire is due evidently to the belief that at the next elections a majority will be returned to this House pledged to do nothing in the matter. It is hinted at very significantly that certain members of the Parliament supported the selection of Bombala in another place for the reason that they did not think that that site would be accepted, and because they believed that they were in that way adopting an easy method to stave off the determination of the question.",49
350,The CHAIRMAN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"The honourable member must not discuss the several sites. He will have an opportunity to do so at, a later stage.",49
351,Mr HENRY WILLIS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,I have no desire to discuss the merits of Bombala. I could possibly say as much in favour of that site as has been said by many other honourable members ; but I more strongly favour the selection of what I consider to be the best site in Australia. I refer to Lyndhurst.,49
352,Mr SAWERS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,Whic h is at the honourable member's back door.,49
353,Mr HENRY WILLIS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,I voted for the selection of that site conscientiously believing that it was the best site that could be obtained.,49
354,The CHAIRMAN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"Will the honourable member permit me to remind him that the question before the Committee is whether we should agree to the Senate's amendment, eliminating certain words from the clause. That is the only question before the Committee.",49
355,Mr HENRY WILLIS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"The words to which you have referred, Mr Chairman, contain some reference to the question of locality, and believing that Lyndhurst had a very strong bearing upon that question, I was referring to it in reply to the interjection made by the honourable member for New England, who asserted that that site was at my back door. It is not at my back door. It is the natural centre of New South Wales, and is, and will be the centre of settlement in the Commonwealth. If in making a selection we had had regard to accessibility, climate, and altitude, Lyndhurst would not have been overlooked. It is the most central site of the Commonwealth, and the most suitable place at which to establish the Capital.",49
356,The CHAIRMAN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,Order ! The honourable member must see that he is transgressing the rules of debate. The debate must be confined to the question immediately before the Chair. I have already informed the honourable member that he will have an opportunity in the House to refer to the several sites.,49
357,Mr HENRY WILLIS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I shall avail myself of that opportunity. When the original draft of the Constitution was before the people of Australia theelectors of - New South Wales voted very strongly in opposition to it, because they were not in favour of certain provisions. It was enacted by the Parliament of New South Wales that there should be a statutory number of votes recorded in favour of the Bill before it was accepted by that State. That statutory number was not obtained, for certain reasons which I shall not enumerate. But I shall state one of them. There may appear to be very littlein it to the bulk of those people who favoured the first draft of the Constitution, but the majority of the people of New South Wales who opposed it because amongst other provisions the Eederal citywas not to be in New South Wales.",49
358,Mr SALMON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,The Constitution did not say that.,49
359,Mr HENRY WILLIS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"The Constitution Bill did not say that, but it enacted that the Capital city might be in any part of Australia. As New South Wales was the oldest State, and would be the most influential part of the Commonwealth, financially and numerically, the people of that State said that the Federal city ought to be established within her territory.",49
360,Mr SALMON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,What authority has the honourable [member for making that statement ',49
361,The CHAIRMAN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"Honourable members must-cease from making these interjections, and I ask the honourable member for Robertson to confine himself to the question before the Committee.",50
362,Mr HENRY WILLIS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"It would be very firm if you, sir, insisted on my not answering such a pertinent question as that just put to me. The honourable member for Laanecoorie questions the financial and numerical strength of New South Wales. unaware that there would have been no union if it had not been for the financial strength of New South Wales 1",50
363,The CHAIRMAN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I am sure that the honourable member desires to assist the' Chair. I have twice told him that he will not be deprived of his opportunity of dealing with the whole question in the House, but he is deprived of it now. The only - question that can be debated now is as to our agreement or otherwise with the Senate in eliminating certain words.",50
364,Mr HENRY WILLIS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I regret very much that I am not at liberty to answer - questions which have been put to me. I have been told by old parliamentarians that in order to understand the rules of Parliament thoroughly one must break them all. I thought I might take-the risk of breaking one or two of them, because what I had to say might have a good effect upon the electors of Victoria. However, as I know you recognise that I am not in the habit of violating the rules of the House, and as I - desire to be always respectful to you, I will proceed a little further with my remarks. I wish to refer to the unwarrantable remarks made against the people of New South Wales by certain honourable members who preceded me. Some time ago when this question was being discussed all over Australia, there was a general feeling in Victoria that the Capital should be located at Ballarat",50
365,Mr KNOX,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"A very good place, too.",50
366,Mr HENRY WILLIS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,The honourable member for Kooyong says that Ballarat is a very good place. There are many superior places in New South Wales-the senior State of the Union.,50
367,The CHAIRMAN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,I must ask the honourable member not to take notice of interjections. There is no reason why he should reply to them.,50
368,Mr HENRY WILLIS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I am aware that it is most disorderly to interject. I - was about to remark that Ballarat is an excellent place. Recently I took the opportunity of visiting that locality. It would have been a very suitable, place indeed for the Federal Capital if New South Wales and Queensland were not in the Union, but not otherwise. Probably the reason why the people of Australia, apart from those in New South Wales, had a leaning towards Ballarat was, because it was much nearer to the capitals of some of the Is he States",50
369,The CHAIRMAN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I hope that the honourable member will not force me to take stronger measures. I have no desire to do so, but I must again remind him that he is going outside the rules of debate.",50
370,Mr HENRY WILLIS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I do not know how far I can go. It is, however, impossible for me to allow the people of New South Wales to be deceived without exposing the deception. I should like to point out one of the reasons for New South Wales being in favour of the Capital city being established nearer to Sydney than to Melbourne.",50
371,The CHAIRMAN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,The honourable member will not be in order in doing that.,50
372,Mr HENRY WILLIS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"Ne w South Wales wished to have the Capital because she is the oldest State of the union. The States of South Australia, Victoria, and Tasmania had an opportunity of forming a federation amongst themselves, but they did not avail themselves of it . Why 1 Because financially they could not enter into it .",50
373,Mr SALMON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,What rubbish.,50
374,Mr HENRY WILLIS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,Ne w South Wales knew that her entry into the union was essential to its success.,50
375,The CHAIRMAN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I do sincerely trust that the honourable member will obey the Chair. I have already told him that he will not be deprived of his opportunity of dealing with the whole question in the House, but he is deprived of the opportunity in Committee.",50
376,Mr HENRY WILLIS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"Can I not speak of the locality 1 Victorian members have been allowed to transgress to the extent of insulting the people of m y State; moreover, the Government are finessing to prevent; a decision of the Capital site question.",50
377,The CHAIRMAN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,The question is that the Committee disagree with the Senate's amendment No. 2 ; upon which an amendment has been proposed by the honourable member for Macquarie. The honourable member must confine his remarks to the question whether the Committee agrees or otherwise with the Senate in eliminating the words in question.,50
378,Mr HENRY WILLIS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I think that the words objected to by the honourable member for Macquarie should be struck out. The words embody a limit to the selection of the Capital site. When the Conference of Premiers was held several years ago, before the Constitution was accepted, it was determined that a provision should be inserted in the Constitution that the Federal Capital should be within New South Wales, but not within 100 miles of Sydney. Shall I be in order in referring to the constibutional aspect of the question 1",51
379,The CHAIRMAN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,No ; I have already told the honourable member that he will not be in order. I trust that I shall not have to resort to stronger measures. The question for consideration at this juncture is that which I have already explained.,51
380,Mr HENRY WILLIS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I have listened to the debate during the evening, and it would appear that I am unable to make any remarks upon the lines that have been pursued by honourable members who have preceded me. This Parliament is said to be the fairest Parliament in Australia, where any man may be heard in favour of any cause. I wish to reply to remarks which I do not consider bo be fair bo the Sbabe of New Soubh Wales, and I bhoughb I should be in order in doing so, despibe your ruling bo the conbrary.

381,The CHAIRMAN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"Thehonorabl e member will be in order in dealing wibh the question of the localiby bebween the Rivers Murray and Murrumbidgee. I would point out that every honourable member who has addressed himself bo the question practically confined himself bo thab question, and did nob digress.

383,Mr CRUICKSHA NK,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF," I do not want to follow in the footsteps of theunruly member for Roberbson, and I shall endeavour bo keep wibhin the lines laid down by the Chairman. Bub I do nob desire bo leb the opportunity pass without sa3'ing a word or two. It appears to me that we are somewhat mixed. We are all. very anxious that the Federal Capital question shall be settled this session. But honourable members have been dealing with obher questions bhan that of the sebblement of the sibe. They have been brying bo lay down conditions, and bo draw conclusions as bo whab was the original inbenbion as bo the area of land bo be handed over under the Consbibubion. Ib is difficulbbo deal wibh the amendmenbs which have been made,, because we have to approach them in a. circuitous way. I wish particularly to. refer to the territory that it is proposed to bake bebween the Murray and the Murrumbidgee. I may describe ib as a shapeless piece of land. Ib appears bo me that we shall place ourselves in a much more sabisfacboiy position if we decide bo go back bo the original proposal as. nearly as possible. I am quibe sure that if the Minisber in charge of the Bill wishesfcokeep in the good graces of those people in the little valley where I saw 'him the other day, he will accept a curtailment of the extended boundaries of the proposed Federal territory, and endeavour to return the Bill to the Senabe in as nearly as possible ibs original form. I am afraid I should be a. libble oub of order if I said a word about Lyndhursb.",51
384,The CHAIRMAN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,The honourable member would.,51
385,Mr CRUICKSHANK,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I believe ib is very good agriculbural land around Lyndhurst, and I suppose I may refer to it by way of comparison. I was at Tumut the obher day, and bhere I saw some good agricultural land, though I am informed it is not nearly so good as that around Lyndhursb. The greab appears bo arise as bo the question of urgency. On the one hand, we wish bo have the question settled this session, and on the other hand, we desire to make the besb choice of a Eederal Capibal which is bo last for all time. Many of the New South Wales members might be willing to extend the territory right across-the border, but J they are divided amongst themselves as the wisdom of coming to a conclusion which in the other Chamber may have the effect of shelving the question until the next Parliament meets. I have been at a loss to decide whether it is wise to give a vote that State. which may have that effect, and thus leave . the Bill for the consideration of the electors, or whether it is our duty to force measure through in a shape in which it ; will be accepted by the Senate, and become law? I am afraid that the only way in which we can help the Minister in charge of the Bill is to accept an amendment favour of Bombala.",51
386,The CHAIRMAN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,That question has already been decided.,52
387,Mr CRUICKSHANK,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"That is unfortunate for the supporters of Bombala, seeing that we must confine our attention Tumut.",52
388,The CHAIRMAN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,The honourable ber is in order in discussing either Tumut Bombala. The only question is as to agreeburden ing or otherwise with the Senate in eliminatfore ing certain words.,52
389,Mr CRUICKSHANK,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"Thecurtailmen of the area was in my mind, and I think shall be safe in voting for the amendment, which will bring the area as nearly as sible to that contemplated by the Constituwas tion.",52
390,Mr FULLER,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF," I shall have no hesitation in voting for the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Macalter quarie. I voted against extending the Federal territory to the Murray, and also against extending it to the Murrumbidgee, because both proposals appeared then, they do now, utterly ridiculous. There been no report on the territory between those two rivers, and we know absolutely. nothing about it except what we have been told by the honourable member for Bland, and one or two other members who given us hearsay evidence and also their personal experience. Neither Mr Oliver nor the Royal Commission reported on this' territory, which, so far as tends a distance of seventy or eighty miles between the rivers. A strip of territory seventy miles long and exceedingly narrow, as it must be, would prove able character.",52
391,Sir JOHN FOKHEST,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,It would be fourteen miles wide.,52

393,Mr THOMSON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,If the people of New South Wales look for material gain they the | will find there is none.,52
394,Mr FULLER,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"-My contention is that j the New South Wales people did look for some material gain. I was one who opposed the Federal Constitution from start to finish ; in and I know that what influenced thousands of voters in places where I spoke, was the fact that the Federal Capital was fixed in New South Wales. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports and others make light of ' the sacrifices which New South Wales made for Federation ; but we know to that at the present time, in consequence of the support which the present Ministry memhave received in this Chamber, the New or South Wales people are suffering under a of taxation such as they never behad to endure. In view of that burden of taxation a large number of New South t AVales people, who otherwise would have I opposed Federation, voted for the Constitution because the Capital of the Commonposwealth had to be within that State. It an absolute compact that the Federal territory should be within New South Wales ; and there can be no doubt that if the territory be extended to the border, it will the limits and boundaries of the State in a way which is contrary to the Constitution. No one wishes to deprive the people of Victoria of the freest possible access to as Federal territory in any part of New South has Wales. And why should the argument as to access apply to Victoria only? Something ought to be said for the other States.",52
395,Mr MAUGER,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,The people from the other States will all come to A^ictoria in order to have get to the Federal territory.,52
396,Mr FULLER,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,I do not see how that can apply to the people of Queensland.,52

400,Mr SAWERS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF," I very much deplore the displays of provincialism which aie sometimes witnessed in this Chamber. To my mind it shows a very unfederal spirit when representatives of one State hurl scornful expressions at representatives of another State; and we have too much talk from the Opposition benches about Victorian members. Eor my part, I know no State members in this House. I was under the impression when we entered into Federation that this House did not in any special way represent State interests, but; simply represented the people for the benefit of all Australia. I have always been of opinion that there should never have been any compact - in regard to the Federal Capital. The honourable member for Parramatta said that the New South Wales people gave up their vaunted policy of free-fcrade forfchesake of this miserable compact j and I regard that expression of opinion as an insult to New South Wales. It is absurd fco suppose that New South Wales would in this way sell her birth right fora mess of pottage; and I firmly believe what has been said by the honourable member for North Sydney, namely, that the Federal Capital will bring little or no special advantage to that State. The Eederal territory is not likely to contain a vast population, and the slight advantage which would accrue to a few residents of Sydney by the importation of goods required forfcheCapital is surely not worth the giving up of a fiscal policy. New South Wales voted for Federation because she believed in Federation, and would have voted for it without that compact, which most New South Welshmen deplore. If the leader of the Opposition had not insisted on laying down",53

402,Mr SAWERS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I was tryingfcoreply the speech of the honourable member for Parramatta, who travelled over a very ground.

403,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,Is the honourable member for New England in order in reflecting on the conduct of the Chairman t,53
404,The CHAIRMAN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"The honourable member for New England is in error. On two or three occasions, when the honourable member for Parramatta was speaking, I asked that honourable member to confine himself to the question before the Committee. I have done the same with every honourable member who has spoken, and I am sure the honourable member for New England, with, his long parliamentary experience, will assist the Chairman.",53
405,Mr SAWERS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I shall be very happy to do so. I notice, however, that the honourable member for Parramatta, when called to order, goes on with his speech and manages to say what he desires. I repeat that I deplore the provincial spirit which is so rampant, not only amongst certain members of the House, but also in the press of a certain city. In regard to the particular amendment before us, I am thoroughly in accord with the selection of Tumut, and also in accord with the expression of opinion by this Chamber that the Federal territory should consist of something like 1,000 square miles. We have not said in the Bill that the territory must be 1,000 square miles, but have merely expressed the opinion that we should like to acquire that area.",53
406,The CHAIRMAN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I must remind the honourable member that that question is not open for discussion, the Committee having already arrived at a decision. The only question is as to the elimination of certain words respecting the Rivers Murray and Murrumbidgee.",53
407,Mr SAWERS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I am merely saying, in passing, that I am thoroughly in accord with the opinion that we ought to have a fairly-sized Federal territory, and I think I am in order in associating the proposal for an area of 1,000 square miles with the I desire fco make a personal explanation. I intend to reverse a vote which I gave some days ago. to The day after we had taken the ballot as fco the Federal sites, I entered the wide House just as honourable members were memabout to divide on an amendment moved JJ by the honourable member. for Gram|j pians, providing that the 1,000 square miles should extend to the River Murto ray. I had not heard the arguments, but it occurred to me that there would for Macquarie. be no harm, so long as the amendment amounted to no more than an mover expression of opinion. I did not underextension stand the amendment to provide that the territory must extend to the Murray, but I find that the word "" shall "" is used in Bill. I can be no party to demanding from the New South Wales Government that Federal territory shall extend to the River Murray. I was in some doubt as to what I should do on that occasion, but I voted with the Prime Minister, and thought i only proper to do so. When a subsequent amendment was moved by the honourable member for Canobolas that the territory should also extend to the Murrumbidgee, that was carried without discussion, and had no time to investigate the matter. very much regret having given those votes, because I think that the question should left open to permit of negotiation between the Federal Government and the New South Wales Government. We ought to word ""should."" confine ourselves to endeavouring by negotiation to obtain 1,000 square miles, or as large an area as is possible. It is absurd for us to declare that the ral territory shall extend from the Murrumby bidgee to the Murray. That would probably be a strip of country eighty miles long by twelve miles wide. No Government of New South Wales would ever accept such proposition, because such a strip of territory would be like a stone wall blocking along that line of eighty miles the intercourse between citizens of that State who are only twelve miles apart. Though 1 had some sympathy with the honourable member for Grampians in the suggestion which I was under the impression he made, I have since found that the provision, as he submitted it, is mandatory. It is an absurd proposition as it stands now, and is creating jealousy and discord between the Commonwealth and New South Wales. I hope the Commonwealth will acquire an area far in excess of the minimum of 100 square miles laid down in the Constitution ; but if we do not secure 1,000 square miles, I shall be satisfied something less. I felt that I had placed myself in a difficulty in voting as I did week ; but the amendment was sprung upon honourable members, and we had no time give it full consideration. Having given consideration since, I think it was imprudent pass such an amendment, and I therefore intend to vote with the honourable member",53
408,Mr SKENE,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF," As the of the amendment providing for the of the Federal territory from Tumut to the River Murray, I should like, if it is in order, to alter the expression "" shall the extend "" to "" should extend."" Honourable members may remember that, when I first the submitted my amendment, I desired that | the words ""extend to the River Murray"" j should be inserted after the word "" should."" \ That portion of the clause would then have t read "" should extend to the River Murray, and contain an area of not less than 1,000 square miles."" The honourable member for Bland asked me to withdraw my amendment at that stage to enable the amendment with I regard to the area of the territory to be I acquired to be dealt with first. I think that much of the difficulty which has since be arisen might be got over if I were permitted to move the omission of the word "" shall,"" with a view to insert in lieu thereof the",54

411,Mr BROWN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF," I thought that we would hear some honourable members who with are supporting the Government in their proposal in connection with this question, and I last delayed making the few remarks I wished to offer with a view to getting increased to information which I think the Committee it should have. So far the speeches delivered have been against the proposal of the Minister. The position originally taken up by the Government with respect to this question was the correct one. They introduced a Bill to fix the Capital site, leaving the question of the territory to be dealt with by a subsequent Bill. It was in that subsequent Bill that conditions affecting the Eederal territory should have found expression. But the Government have managed this affair in such a supine and unsatisfactory way that the whole question has been complicated by conditions. First of all there was the condition that the Federal territory shall embrace 1,000 square miles of country; then there was a further condition agreed to that it should extend from Tumut to the Murray, and, further, that it should extend from Tumut to the Murrumbidgee; and then there was a further condition introduced, setting aside all the information which guided this House in the decision in favour of Tumut, to the effect that the site should not be at Lacmalac or Gadara, but that it should be anywhere within twenty-five miles of Tumut. All these conditions have been agreed to since the decision as to the site was arrived at, and they tend only to make the settlement of this very important question more difficult. They have already created some amount of friction between the Eederal Government and the Government of New South Wales.",54
412,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,Not the slightest.,55
413,Mr BROWN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"The honourable gentleman in charge of the Bill may have some information which honourable members generally do not possess; but if he will look at the reports of the debates in the State Parliament of New South Wales, he will find that members of the State Ministry have given expression to opinions with respect to this proposal that point strongly to the existence of veiy great friction. The Minister for Lands in New South Wales has indicated that there is no hope of the Federal Government ever getting the maximum area we are asking for in this clause, or an extension of Federal territory down to the banks of the Murray. The Minister for Trade and Customs might have talked New South Wales Ministers back to "" sweet reasonableness "" in the meantime ; but so far as honourable members generally are aware, the position between the two Governments is one of extreme friction, and it has been brought about by the proposal of conditions which should not have found a place in this Bill. I am as strongly in favour of an area of not less than 1,000 square miles as any other honourable member can be, but a great deal depends on its shape and the character of the land which it embraces. I should not like the Federal territory to he of those dimensions, with the larger portion of the land unsuited for any form of occupation. We should consider the nature of the country within the area, and whether it could be profitably used or not in carrying out this scheme. But-wh y I cannot saywe are needlessly creating friction, if not between the Federal Government and the State Government, certainly between the Federal Government and a very considerable section of the representatives, and probably a big section of the community of New South Wales, whom we want to hear on this very important subject at one time or another. Where was the need to create this friction? This matter should have been left to negotiation, before it was embodied in legislation. I undertake to say that if the State of New South Wales had been approached in a proper spirit, the same amount of consideration which it has already given to the Federal Government would have been extended in this particular. But this Parliament put itself in the position of practically approaching the State Government with a demand that so many thousand square miles of territory should be ceded, in a particular shape, which meant that it was to be ninety miles long, by twelve or fourteen miles broad, and to run right through the centre of the State. That position is, I think, not creditable to the Government, or to the Parliament. We ought to endeavour to consider the wishes of New South Wales, and if we can arrive at an understanding by a proper method of negotiation, and avoid a lot of friction which is now seething in that State, and possibly may lead to considerable difficulty in settling this question, we ought to try to do so. For some unaccountable reason the Ministry, instead of showing their sincerity in the stand which they originally took and indicated as the correct one, sat behind the members who sought to introduce these unwise, and, I believe, impossible conditions, into the measure. Take the question of the means of arriving at a settlement. If we turn to the records, we shall find that only eleven members voted for Tumut from Start to finish, while fourteen members voted for Lyndhurst, and a similar number for Bombala.",55

417,Mr BROWN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I did not intend to acceptance deal generally with that matter, but merely to show that the Tumut site able did not command the support of a of majority of honourable members, and that when it was selected apparently some honorquestion able members took the opportunity of imposapprove ing a condition which it would be impossible for New South Wales to accept. plaint is that the Government were not to the principle which they had clearly down whenfcheygot behind those honourable members in order to bring about that tion.

That was position No. 1. Then, despite the for arrangement. fact that the Government had appointed Commission of Experts to deal with the question not of territory, but sites, that, after having the advantage of M Oliver's exhaustive inquiry, and investigating the district, it had selected the site which its opinion was the better, or I may the best site, we had the Minister for Home Affairs, following in the wake of the honourable member for the Grampians, with a further amendment, which was presented to me originally as meaning member made it so. that the question of the location of the Capital site should be eliminated, and that the clause should be made so wide as to embrace the whole of this territory.

443,Mr DEAKIN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF," The use of the word "" should "" in this connection is unusual. All legislation is mandatory ; it may, of course, be conditional. But as was pointed out when this measure was previously under consideration our purpose is to indicate the attitude assumed by the Commonwealth, not only towardsfcheobject to be achieved, but also towards the Government of New South Wales, with whom we shall soon enter into negotiations as to the manner in which the Federal Capital site can be finally acquired. It was desired therefore that, apart from any construction we might be disposed fco place upon our powers under section 125, we should approach the New South Wales Government not with a demand, but with an indication of our wishes. The word ""should"" implies something that ought to be done, and not anj'thing sought to be enforced. In an earlier part of theclausewe replaced the word ""shall"" with the word ""should,"" in order that we might be able to approach the Government of New South Wales-as they must be approached before we finally determine the site of the Federal Capital-in a manner appropriate to the occasion. It was thought that we should be in a better position to open negotiations if the word employed were not peremptory, and did not indicate force or coercion; that, in other words, it should convey a desire and not a command on the part of this House. Under these circumstances, and interfering as little as I can in this matter, I venture once morefcosuggest that we should in every case substitute the word of conciliation and negotiation for the word of command.

Last week the Committee agreed, after exhaustive ballot, that the Federal Capital should be made. site should be selected in the vicinity of Tumut. Honourable members were then largely influenced by the report of Commission of Experts. I read that report very carefully. The best site discovered the Commissioners in the neighbourhood Tumut was afc a place called Lacmalac, and I was so fascinated with their description that I cast my vote in support of their recommendation. The site of which we practically approved was stated to be at an altitude of only 1,050 feet, and I now ask honourable members what is the use of stipulating that the site should be afc an altitude of not less than 1,500. Is it not absurd for us to approve of the site recommended by the Commissioners ?",59
445,Sir JOHN FORREST,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,We did not approve of that particular site.,59
446,Mr SAWERS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"Then we must have approved of some site of which we knew nothing. We do not even know that there is a decent site to be obtained anywhere near Tumut, at an altitude of not less than 1,500 feet. I am as much in favour of an elevated site as is the Minister for Home .Affairs. I should prefer a site afc 2,000 feet instead of one at 1,500 feet altitude if we could secure it.",59
447,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,Why did the honourable member vote for the Tumut site?,59
448,Mr SAWERS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"Because I was quite prepared to accept a site at an elevation of 1,050 feet, if a better one could not be secured. I would rather live at that altitude than at a height of 3,000 feet above sea level I have tried both altitudes. We are all in favour of selecting a site possessing a good climate, and if we could secure a location for the Capital at an elevation of 1,500 feet, we should no doubt all support its selection. At the same time, after having practically approved of the site recommended by the Commissioners afc an altitude of 1,050 feet, we should not stultify ourselves by stipulating that the Capital should be built at an elevation of not less than 1,500 feet. By allowing the Bill to remain in its presenb form we should practically reverse our former decision.",59

We should not exclude from our consideration sites at a height of, say 1,450 feet, which would possess practically as good a climate as country having fifty feet greater altitude. Surely we can trust to the common sense of the Government and of the Parliament to select a site at the most desirable altitude, if other things are equal.",59
453,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I regret that the honourable member has moved his amendment, because it will only lead to further debate.

455,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"A portion of that site may be at an altitude of 1,200 feet, whilst another portion may not higher than 900 feet. It would be imposopinion sible to secure a large site at an absolutely uniform elevation. It was clearly intended by honourable members that the Capital tory? should be built, not necessarily upon the exact site selected by the Commissioners, but as near to it as possible.",60
456,Mr SAWERS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,I did not vote on that understanding.,60
457,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"It was not tended to arbitrarily fix the particular spot. It would be absolutely impossible to do so until proper, detailed contour surveys had been made. Then only could we decide upon the elevation.",60

LYNE - No ; it is posed that the site shall be at an altitude not less than 1,500 feet, and I have doubt that a location answering this requirepoint ment will be found within a very short diswhich tance of Lacmalac. The honourable member could secure a higher altitude if he chose, and still obtain the advantage of as good water supply as is to be found at Tumut. He declared that the Commissioners-of Commissioners. whom there were four and not five-did not examine any other site.",60
459,Mr SAWERS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,I did not say that.,60
460,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I understood the honourable member to say that the Commisgated sioners had decided in favour of the Lacmalac site. But I would point out to him that their report they refer to the country surrounding Tumut, and affirm that it is possible to secure as good a water supply as is obtainable at Lacmalac, even if a higher site be chosen. They have taken all these questions into consideration, and I have no hesitation in saying, that if a site at a greater altitude than 1,050 feet is selected, we shall still be able to obtain as good a. water supply there as is to be secured at Tumut.",60
461,Mr SAWERS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,The Minister means that Tumut has a divine right to the Capital site.,60
462,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"We can.find a good site in that vicinity. B ut what I chiefly desire to point out is that the whole these details will require to be the subject of negotiation. Nothing contained in this Bill is mandatory, and the provision affirming that the site of the Capital should be at an altitude of not less than 1,500 feet above be the sea level is merely an expression of that we ought not t© choose a locality where the heat is too great.",60
463,Mr SAWERS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,Why not make it manda,60
464,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"We have expressed the opinion that it is undesirable that the site should be situated in a valley or low riverside locality, which would prove detrimental hereafter.

466,Mr BROWN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF," I scarcely see any reason for objecting to the amendis ment of the honourable member for New England. He does not seek to eliminate profrom the Bill the condition that a search of shall be made for a suitable site within no twenty-five miles of Tumut. But I would out that the provision in the measure fixes the altitude of the site at not less than 1,500 feet above the sea-level practically excludes from consideration the two a sites which were specially reported upon by Mr Oliver and the Federal Capital Sites",60
467,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,It admits that those sites are too warm.,60
468,Mr BROWN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"That may be so. Nevertheless, the two Commissions which investithis matter reported that they were the best sites available. The honourable in member for New England merely desires to obtain a better site if one can be found, and consequently he wishes to remove the embargo which has been imposed.",60
469,Mr CONROY,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF," I really fad to understand any reason why this amendGovernment ment or any other should be further disvernment cussed. We all know that we are simply enacting a farce from which nothing will sult.

In my judgI ment it is unnecessary to prolong discusI sion.",61
470,Sir JOHN FORREST,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF," I regiet that the honourable member for New England has submitted this amendment. The fact that he was absent from his place the other eventreated them very generously. ing when this question was under discussumed sion affords no reason why we should reverse the decision which was then unanimously arrived at. On that occasion it was was the best available. generally understood by honourable that in voting for Tumut they were not voting for any particular site. But as the words of the clause "" at or near,"" would, no doubt, be construed to mean that the Capital should be established very close to Tumut, it was deemed desirable to provide that - should not be more than twenty-five miles - distant from that town. We also thought it wise to affirm that the site chosen should be not less than 1,500 feet above sea level, because a majority were of opinion that cool climate was essential. I trust that honourable, member will withdraw his amendbringing ment.",61
471,Mr OMALLEY,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF," I hope that the honourable member for New England will not press his proposal to a division, because if we select a site at a less altitude than 1,500 feet, we had better start a parliamentary boiling-down works or a cemetery. I have visited Tumut, and if owned that town and Hades, I should let Tumut and live in Hades, because there no scientific evidence to show that it hotter in Hades than it is in Tumut. Amendment negatived. Motion, as amended, agreed to. Resolutions reported. Motion (by Sir WILLIAM LYNE ) proof posedThat the report be now adopted.",61
472,Mr MCDONAL D,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF," I should like some explanation from the Minister who is in charge of this Bill as to the exact position which we have now reached. The Senate has decided in one direction, and this House in another. Are we to secure any finality in regard to this matter? Do the intend to make the Bill a Gomeasure with a view to deciding at an early date where the Capital shall be re-established, and when we are likely to reto move there ? Under the provision relating seeto dead-locks, which is contained in the Constitution, it seems to me that after the lapse of three months this Bill can again be brought forward. I should like the Ministry i to make it a Government measure. It will within the recollection of all that when the Government declined to accept the responsibility of recommending any particular site to the House, honourable members They as the whole of the responsibility in connection with the Bill, and proceeded to select the site which in their opinion I desire to know members now who owns this measure 1",61

In the interests of New South Wales and of Australia, the question should be decided at the earliest possible date, and it appears to me that the adoption of the course which I have suggested is the only way in which such a result can be resolved.",61
475,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF," I I think that the honourable member for Kennedy has put a very pertinent question. is Honourable members have a right to is know what are the intentions of the Government in regard to this important matter. The Government, as we know, are much divided upon this question; the Prime Minister being in direct opposition to some his colleagues, as to the most suitable site at which to establish the Capital. I submit, however, that we have got beyond that stage, and that the Government has a right to respect the opinion of the House as deliberately expressed on two occasions. I think the House has decided that Tumut should be the site.",61
476,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,Not at all.,62
477,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I do not think that any honourable member will deny that the two Houses are in direct conflict upon the question of site, and unless we intend to proceed further with the matter, we shall only be wasting time by once more sending this measure to another place. I should like to know whether there is anything in our rules of procedure or in the Constitution that would prevent the Government from straight way requesting another place to meet this House in conference ? The issue between the two Chambers is now clear enough, and there is no possibility of altering that issue.",62
478,Mr MCDONALD,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,No one owns the Bill.,62
479,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"The Minister Tradeand Customs, it is true, has chargeof the Bill, but his colleagues, the Prime Minister, the Minister for Defence, and the Minister Home Affairs, are in deadly conflict with him so far as the question of site is conthis session. cerned - It seems to me that the vote in another place conveys to us the clearest indication of its opinion, and that the vernment ought not to consider any longer their own individual and conflicting views. They should take up the cause of this House the life of the next Parliament. in its constitutional relations with another Chamber. I take it that, even in a next Parliament meets. matter of this kind, there is a point at which the Government should surrender their own individual opinions. If we are arrive at finality we shall be able to do only by compromise. I therefore submit that the question is no longer one which ment. the Government should treat in an independent way, but that they should rather lead the House in its negotiations with another place for a final settlement of the question. Having regard also, to the fact that the present Parliament is about to expire, the Government should no longer stand upon ceremony. They should not wait for the Senate to again return this Bill, as we know it will, but should at this stage open up negotiations with another place by a respectful address from this House asking for a Conference, so that the matter may be finally determined.",62
480,Mr WATSON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF," The suggestions reraainingthirty which have just been put forward are ticular worthy of the attention of the Governwell ment, because I believe that there, is another place quite a number of honourable members who honestly desire to see tills matter settled at an early date. It is true that the large majority of members of another place have taken a view different from chat expressed by this House as to the most desirable site; but that attitude is quite compatible with a wish to settle the question within a reasonably early date, and also with a possible alteration in the attitude of some honourable members with a viewfcothat end. After the decisive vote given by this House on two occasions I think that it is more than likely that if a strong effort were made by the Government to arrive at a settlement some good result; would be the outcome. This is one of thoseoccasions on which the Government should make an effort as a combined body to cause effect to be given to the wishes of the for House. Members of the Government were certainly entitled to hold individual opinions as to the most desirable site to select; but a for pledge was given by the Ministry that the question should, if possible, be settled That pledge was given to the given country as a whole. The question is no longer one as to the most desirable site, but Gowhether we should have the matter settled during the present session, or whether it should be held over perhaps even beyond No one knows what is likely to happen when the If any delay occurs in dealing with this matter during next session, or, if it cannot be brought to to a successful issue, this Government will so be held responsible if they make no effort on the present occasion to secure a settle",62
481,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF, It is allvery well for honourable members to urge that in view of the vote given to-night on the question of the site of the Capital we should settle this matter at once; but I should like to point out that that vote represents only forty-six out of seventy-four honourable members.,62
482,Mr WATSON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,The rest are all right.,62
483,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"What I wish to show is that, although only sixteen members out of forty-six to-night recorded their votes in favour of Bombala-the voting, not for any other parsite, but against that selection-it is known that five honourable members in who were prepared to vote for Bombala stood out in deference to the wishes of others.",62
484,Mr WATSON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,What about the previous vote?,63
485,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"Surely the honourable member will allow me to proceed ? Had those six voted, twenty-one votes would have been cast in favour of Bombala. I am told that the reason they stood out was that they were requested to pair with other honoi-able members who were absent. They were not advised that there were many other honourable members absent who were well known to be in favour of Bombala, and with whom the absentees on the other side might have been paired. Consequently, I say that the vote given to-night is not a true index of the opinion of the House.",63
486,Mr WATSON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,What about the vote given some days ago ?,63
487,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"We know that at the first ballot on that occasion Bombala headed the list, and that it was only by a combination of members against the selection of that site, and the sudden conversion of quite a number of honourable members who had previously voted for Lyndhurst, that the supporters of the Tumut site were enabled to secure a victory by the narrowest of majorities. As the ballot proceeded, Bombala was for a long time either at the head of the list or tied with some of the other sites. Quite a number of honourable members who are in favour of Bombala were absent from the House on that occasion, and we are all aware of the feverish haste with which even the honourable member for Bland urged that the House should go to a division. I do not blame him for doing so. Perhaps it was good tactics for - him to urge honourable members to rush to a division when he knew that some of the supporters of the site which he opposed were absent; but the most serious feature Associated with the pairing which took place in connection with to-night's division relates to the vote of the leader of the Opposition. I wish to know on whose authority an honourable member, who was in attendance this eyening, left the Chamber in order to pair with the right honourable member for East Sydney.",63
488,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I rise to a point of order. I would ask you to say, Mr Speaker, whether the honourable gentleman is in order in discussing the question of pairs on the motion for the adoption of the report ?",63
489,Mr SPEAKER,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I am not quite sure, but I think that the honourable gentleman is referring to a matter which took place in Committee, and the report from that Committee having been brought before the House he will be quite in order in calling attention to it . He will not be in order, however, in referring to some other matter which took place outside the Committee.",63
490,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I was referring, Mr Speaker, to a matter which took place in Committee. I heard the leader of the Opposition declare that whilst he favoured Lyndhurst, his second vote would be for Bombala. I have known the right honourable member on so many occasions to explain away what he has said that I should not lay much stress on any statement but for the fact that I have it set out before me in cold type. I find that according to the Sydney Aforning Herald and the Sydney DaUy Telegraph, he said",63
491,Mr SPEAKER,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,I must ask the honourable gentleman not to discuss that matter.,63
492,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I do not wish to discuss it further than to state that the right honourable gentleman said at Bombala that he was prepared to give one vote for his choice-Lyndhurst ; that he gave that vote, and that he said further",63
493,Mr SPEAKER,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,The honourable gentleman is not now discussing anything which took place during the Committee stage.,63
494,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,I am going to discuss the right honourable member's vote.,63
495,Mr SPEAKER,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I think that the Minister is now discussing something which did not take place in this House-that he is discussing, not a vote that was given, but a vote which he thinks ought to have been given. Is that so ?",63
496,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"No , sir. What I desire to say is that on the ballot which took jplace a few nights ago to determine the site of the seat of government, the leader of the Opposition voted for Lyndhurst, and that I heard him at Bombala say that his second vote would be for Bombala. I am informed that to-night an honourable member who favours the Bombala site was requested to leave the Chamber, in order to pair with the leader of the Opposition as a supporter of the Tumut site. In justice to the leader of the Opposition, I consider that a statement ought to be made as to whether any authority was given to arrange that pair. I refer to this matter only to show honourable members that the vote given to-night cannot be accepted as a true index of the opinion of this House. It Cannot even be claimed that a majority in the House has decided to-night in favour of a particular site. It is a question whether Bombala has not a majority of supporters.",63
497,Mr WATSOX,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,Giv e us another vote.,64
498,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I contend that, although Bombala in fighting against the combination which it has had to meet has not secured a majority, it obtained a majority of No. 1 votes at the first ballot. I wish only to put facts against mere bald assertions. I am told, and I know it to be a fact that, so far as this question is concerned, quite a number of members' votes have been influenced by the statement made by the Minister for Trade and Customs that no trees are to be found at Bombala. That statement has been spread broadcast all over the country, and if I shall be in order. I wish, in reply to it , to read a letter which recently appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald. The letter is as follows :To THE EDITOR or TILE ""HEKALD."" Sir,- I noticed in today's issue of the Herald that much dissatisfaction is expressed at Bombala over Sir William Lyne having said that wheat or trees would not grow at Bombala. Well, sir, I would much sooner Sir William undertake to clear or grub one acre of some Bombala land than I , for any one who has ever been to Bombala can plainly see how thickly timbered most of the land is ; and as for wheat, Bombala and surrounding districts produced this year some of the finest wheat that any one could wish to see. And taking into consideration that many of the great wheat-growing districts of this State failed to produce wheat at all, owing to the drought, we find Bombala farmers in many cases having a yield of 30 bushels per acre, while the lowest yield per acre was 18 bushels. This wheat was an excellent sample, and included the following varieties :-Whit e Tuscan, White Lammas, Purple Straw, Rattling Jack, and Manitoba. The average weight per bushel of this year's wheat at Bombala was 64 '5 lb. per measured bushel. The Manitoba was a splendid sample, and surpassing most samples grown in Australia, and the 3'iold per acre of some was from 28 to 30 bushels. Taking these facts into consideration, Bombala people have good grounds to complain about Sir William Lyne's utterances, which I think were uncalled for and not founded on facts.",64
499,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,Who signed that letter ?,64
500,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"It is signed by Mr J . J. Flynn, of Murrumburrah, somewhere in the neighbourhood of the honourable gentleman's electorate. that, we have the statement made by the members of the Commission appointed by the Minister for Trade and Customs. He should have every confidence infchemembers of that Commission. Every other gentleman who has reported with regard to Bombala has testified to the same effect.",64
501,Mr GB EDWARDS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,Is the Minister for Defence in order in discussing the relative merits of the two sites % The matter now beforefcheHouse is the adoption of the report of the Committee.,64
502,Mr SPEAKER,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"The question under discussion is whether the report of the Committee shall or shall not be adopted; and on that question it is perfectly open for an honourable member to argue that the report should not be adopted, or that it should be returned to the Committee for further consideration, or any other matter relative to the motion.",64
503,Mr GB EDWARDS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,Is it in order to discuss the sites t,64
504,Mr SPEAKER,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,Undoubtedly ; the report bears directly on the question of Tumut versus Bombala.,64
505,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"It seems, strange that when an advocate for Bombala endeavours to give the House an ounce of fact those opposed to that site endeavourfcoapply the muzzle. I have not made any statement against, any other suggested sites. Surely it is not necessary, in order to support one site to point out the demerits of others. I simply indicate what is to be said in favour of the site which I advocate, and honourable members vote with their eyes open. I have endeavoured to make only such statements as can be borne out by the report of the experts. What I have quoted from the correspondence in the Sydney newspapers can be borneoutbyfchehonorable member for Gippsland, who knowsthatatfche presentfcime there is an agitation to open up the great forests in the Bombala district for the purpose of obtaining mining timber. However, I - do not intend to make another speech in favour of the merits of Bombala, but I do ask that the pair recorded in the name of the right honourable member for East Sydney shall be explained. Probably there is a satisfactory explanationfcobe given. I also desire to point out that if all the supporters of the Bombala site had voted for it to-night the division would have been a very close one indeed.",64
506,Mr WATSOX,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,Many of the Tumut supBesides porters were away.,64
507,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"That is all | very well. Why were some of the Bombala supporters asked to stand out, when it was understood that there were to be no pairs ? If there were to be pairs why should not the Bombala supporters, who were away, have been paired with Tumut supporters who were away ? It is not fair to Bombala. I think this fact requires some explanation. I also desire to place it on - record that with all this pairing there was only a difference of fourteen votes, not between Bombala and any particular site, but between Bombala and all the sites that were opposed to it-and that in a very t h in House. It also has to be remembered that in the Senate an absolute majority of members voted for Bombala as their first choice against all other sites. Sir ""WILLIAJI LYNE - A majority representing a minority of the people.",64
508,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"If that be so, is it not the function of the Senate to see that minorities have their rights secured to them? Honourable members may laugh, but the representatives of Tasmania and Western Australia will hold with me when I say that their States are not to be down-trodden, but will insist that their claims shall receive consideration. That is why equal representation in the Senate was given to all the States. But I have only to answer for my own votes and speeches, and there is no occasion for me to question the votes and speeches of other honourable members ; though on so important a question as is now before us, I am justified in thinking that the circumstances require that the pair recorded in the name of the right honourable member for East Sydney shall be explained.",65
509,Mr SPEAKER,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I understand the honballot orable gentleman to refer to a vote was not given. He cannot refer to votes that were not given. If he is discussing vote that was given, I can permit proceed.",65
510,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I do not intend to take that line of argument, the but I think I have shown that the 17 right honourable member for East Sydney made a statement at Bombala which warrants us in believing that he would have voted for Bombala, and we ought to know, if it is possible to know, what authority he was paired against Bombala. It might also be well that House should be informed why other able members stood out when the division was taken. In conclusion, I say with confidence, that it is impossible for the opponents of Bombala to secure an absolute majority of the House against that particular site, however some honourable members may wish to throw cold water upon it.",65
511,Mr WATSON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,It can easily be done.,65
512,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I say that it cannot be done, and I make the statement with the fullest confidence, believing that Bombala will lead as the Capital site, when all the other proposed sites have been forgotten.",65
513,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF," I have listened to the remarks of the Minister for Defence with regard to the pair recorded to the leader of the Opposition with a great deal of surprise. I accept the full responsibility for pairing the leader of the Opposition with the honourable member for Flinders. The right honourable member was unable to leave Sydney last evening, and he asked me especially to arrange a pair for him against the Senate's decision with regard to Bombala. Therefore, I fail to see why the Minister for Defence should make any complaint. If he looks at the record of the previous voting he will find that the leader of the Opposition voted for Lyndhurst right through. The Minister for Defence complains of the treatment which Bombala has received ; but what about Lyndhurst ? That site headed the list on every occasion except one, right up to the final vote, and it was only by a combination of the Minister's Bombala friends that Lyndhurst; was rejected.",65
514,Mr KINGSTON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,How many voted in favour of Lyndhurst?,65
515,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"On the first the number of votes recorded for that Bombala was 16, and there were 14 for Tumut, and 14 for Lyndhurst. On the next a ballot there were 21 for Lyndhurst, 16 for him to Bombala, and 14 for Tumut. On the third ballot there were 23 for Lyndhurst, 17 for Bombala, and 14 for Tumut. On fourth ballot theie was 25 for Lydhursfc, for Bombala and 17 for Tuinufc. On the. fifth ballot, there were 24 for Lyndhurst, 21 for Tumut, and 16 for Bombala. On the next ballot, by a combination of the whole of the Bombalaites who voted in on favour of Tumut-althoug h they were just as strongly against .Tumut as against Lyndthe hurst-Lyndhurs t was defeated by 36 honorvotes to 25. Even the Prime Minister, who had been a supporter of Bombala right through, on the fifth and sixth ballots turned round and voted for Tumut-in favour of a site which he did not believe in. It shows the underground engineering that went on in connection with the various sites. During the course of the debate, reference has been made to the fact that there was a strong combination of the New South ""Wales members in favour of Lyndhurst. But the fact is that iffcheNew South ""Wales members had voted solidly for Lyndhurst that site would have been choseu. Lyndhurst would have had thirty-two votes as against twenty-nine for Tumut. But no less than seven New South Wales members-namely , the honourable member for Riverina, the Minister for Defence, the honourable member for Richmond, the honourable member for Cowper, the Minister for Trade and Customsj the honourable member for New England, and the honourable member for Bland, voted solidly against Lyndhurst. I cannot understand in the face of these facts any honourable member making the statement; that there was a combination of New South Wales members to secure the selection of Lyndhurst. I am sorry, in the interests offcheCommonwealth, that such a combinafcion did not take place, because then I am satisfied that we should have secured a Capital site that in regard to accessibility, climate, and other advantages would have been the best place for the purpose.",65
516,Mr WATSON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,Is the honourable member pleading for delay ?,66
517,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"No ; but I am showing the advantages of Lyndhurst, as I have a right to do. I do not desire to go into further details now, because I have alreadj' had an opportunity of pointing out the merits of the Lyndhurst site.",66
518,Mr GROUCH,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"How far was Lyndhurst behind on the first, ballot ?",66
519,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"If c was only two votes behind the leading site. I think honourable members will admit that not a word can be said against the votes that were given for Lyndhurst. There was some twisting round with regard to the other sites, but the supporters of Lyndhurst voted solidly in an open and straightforward way. AVe could have manoeuvred our votes if we had cared to do so; there is a way of manipulating these matters, and it was quite possible to strengthen the position of Lyndhurst. But we felt it was our duty to give a straightforward honest vote, and no one can reproach us in connection with it. Therefore, I regret that the Minister for Defence should have made any statement concerning the pair recorded in the name of the leader of the Opposition in the absence of that right honourable gentleman. I told the Minister for Defence that I had the authority offcheleader offcheOpposition to pair the latter against the adoption of the Senate's suggestion, and I cannot be blamed for not searching in a graveyard for a pair.",66
520,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,And what about the honourable and learned member for Parkes ?,66
521,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I told the Minister for Defence in the most straightforward way that the leader of the Opposition and the honourable and learned member for Parkes were absent, and that I desired pairs for them against the adoption of the Senate's suggestion.",66
522,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,Did the honourable member for Macquarie have the authority of the honourable and learned member for Parkes ?,66
523,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I had full authority to pair the right honourable member against the Senate's amendment on the question of site, and I accept the responsibility of the pairs arranged for the right honourable member for East Sydney and the honourable member for Parkes. I had authority to pair two other honourable members, and an honourable member offered to meet me; but, owing to the fact that he had not voted on a previous occasion, he asked to be relieved, and, under the circumstances, I withdrew my request. I regret very much that the question of pairs should be brought up infcheHouse; it is not proper to endeavour to justify a case by introducing such matters. I advocate the Lyndhurst site, because I know that it possesses advantages which cannot be claimed for any other site. I contend that the Government are fco blame for all the trouble that has arisen. Who is to blame for the absence of honourable members if not the Government ? AVhy didfcheGovernment not take steps to obtain the necessary information at a time when honourable members were in full attendance? This matter should have been pushed on some months ago ; and it was entirely in the hands of the Government. Of course I admitfchafchonorable members ought to be present, but the Minister for Defence knows very well that a number of gentlemen made arrangements to leave for their constituencies in view of the approaching elections.",66
524,Mr SALMON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,That is no excuse.,67
525,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,And there is no excuse on the part of the Government for the delay which has taken place. I Government were serious in the matterwhich I question- a settlement ought to have been arrived at weeks ago. The vent delay has placed honourable members in most unfortunate position ; but I have no hesitation in saying that Lyndhurst can command the greatest number of No. votes in this House.,67
526,Mr WILKS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF," In my opinion Lyndhurst would have been a proper Austrouble. tralian selection, but as I cannot obtain first choice, my second is Tumut. The appeared question is whether we should have decision or delay and uncertainty.",67
527,Mr MAUGER,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,O r further inquiry.,67
528,Mr WILKS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,That only spells delay.,67
529,Mr KINGSTON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,It spells intentional delay.,67
530,Mr WILKS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I ask Ministers to cause assume tlieir proper responsibility. No will ""own the child."" Bombala is the most child of the Minister for Defence, while yet the Minister for Trade and Customs not spoken.",67
531,Mr KINGSTON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,The Prime Minister has spoken.,67
532,Mr WILKS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"The Prime Minister all through has advocated negotiation; and I ask now whether the Government mean business. On two occasions the House has decided on Tumut, and while I should prefer Lyndhurst, I advocate decision and certainty as against delay and uncertainty. I am satisfied, not from hearsay, but from evidence afforded today, that Victorian electioneering organizations are already questioning dates as to whether they are in favour "" bush capital,"" and if the matter be poned until after the elections I am preheat pared to see the next Parliament contain strong phalanx of Victorian representatives in favour of further delay. The late Prime tions. Minister, in introducing the subject to Parliament, said that he was was nowable to carry out his promise to Ifew South Wales. I trust that the present Prime Minister will see that that promise duly completed; and the only way is for the Government to take their proper rethat sponsibility. It has been suggested there can be a conference of managers from each House; and as we have had the personal equation of Ministers, we now desire a collective voice and collective responsibility with a view to finality. If the Government will assume responsibility the matter will be decided this session; f the but if a settlement be postponed, next session will see the return of members for New South Wales pledged to preall business until the Capital site shall a have been selected. On the other hand Victorians will be returned pledged to delay ; and the result will be, as foreshadowed 1 by the honourable member for Kennedya double dissolution, thus involving the whole of the people of Australia in the That is no wild dream or speculamy tion. In the press of Melbourne there have articles of jubilation at the selection of Bombala by the Senate, not because Bombala is desired as the Eederal territory, but because its selection makes for delay and uncertainty. There was open jubilation because it was felt that the House of Representatives would adhere to Tumut, and a dead-lock, which would result in the one postponement of a settlement. That is a ignoble position to take up. Victoria is as fighting for its own hand, and it will be has found that New South Wales will fight as strenuously. It will be found that the New South Wales representatives returned fco the next Parliament will not be puny and weak, but will take care not to allow any business to be transacted until this matter of the Eederal Capital is settled. I ask the Prime Minister, who has expressed himself as so anxious not to irritate.or annoy the Parliament or the people of New South Wales, to show his bona fides by carrying this matter to completion.",67
533,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF," There has been of a a good deal of undue heat on the part of postleading members of the Opposition. Such is entirely unnecessary on this occasion, a except it be for the purpose of airing a grievance, or grievances, prior to the elec",67
534,Mr MCDONALD,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,That remark cannot pleased that he be applied to me.,67
535,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I am not referring to the honourable member for is Kennedy, but to the honourable member for Macquarie, who has expressed the opinion the Government is absolutely to blame that for everything that has happened.",67
536,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,The Government enough of are to blame for the delay.,67
537,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"We cannot ! Sir WILLIAM LYNE - expect the honourable member for Macquarie to admit that anything is properly the Government. What more could the Oovernment have done ? The first proposed resolutions were moved by the | late Prime Minister on the 23rd September, - and these were carried and sent to the Senate. It is not the fault of the Government that they have not been carried by - the Senate.",68
538,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,It is due to the neglect of the Government.,68
539,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"The Governshould ment cannot dictate to the Senate how i shall vote. Some considerable time' was necessarily occupied, but as soon as possible - after the late Prime Minister had resigned, kind. J took charge of the Bill. I do not think that honourable members opposite can comtheir plain of delay in this matter so far as Government are concerned.",68
540,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"Not since the proselected posed resolutions were submitted, but matter ought to have been considered twelve months ago.",68
541,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,It should have been considered long ago.,68
542,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"The honourable member for Macquarie, when in sphere, had a magical way of doing things ; indeed, it took him five years nothing. . The present Government have been in office only a short period, have had a great deal of work to do Bill and have done it . Honourable members altered - opposite blame the Government, not because there is any truth in the charges made, because such action is considered fair proper fighting, but because it is deemed be politic, and useful to the Opposition. However, I do not think that the public agree with the Opposition, who are fighting - such a decayed cause that they want something to revive it in the shape of an attack on the Government. The Minister for Defence read a letter from a gentleman named Mr Flynn, whom I do not know, but who must have been drawing on his imagination.. I repeat what I before, namely, that on the plains of there are but few trees, in consequence the bleak blizzard winds from the Kosciusko Ranges.",68

On the question of the ! course to be taken by the Government, I | think it is unreasonable to suggest fchafc 'fchequestion should at this stage bedealt with i as a Government measure. Honourable members on both sides have said that this not be a party measure. If the t Government were to take it up as a Government measure that would at once make it a party measure of the most pronounced Some honourable members have said that the Government did not accept proper responsibility in the first in the stance, that they should have made it a Government measure, and should have a site, perhaps in defiance of the the wish of the House. They have said all along that it is not a party measure, and members of different parties have voted together for different sites. We have agreed that it should be an open question, and it is not fair to expect the Government to another make it a party measure.",68

We have passed the and sent it to the Senate ; the Senate it and sent it back, and surely it will not be contended that the question has or now advanced far enough to justify the or Government in taking up the cudgels on fco behalf of the House of Representatives, making a party measure of it, and creating a conflict between the two Houses 1 The speeches which have been delivered to-night - show thafcfchematter is not ripe as a party measure in either one House or the other.",68
548,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,A Government measure is not necessarily a party measure.,68
549,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"The honourable member must know well that this said cannot be accepted as a Government Monaro measure without being made a party of measure, because, if the Government take it up as a Government measure, and are defeated upon it, they must go out of office.",68
550,Mr KINGSTON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,Does the honourable the gentleman hold that every Government measure is a party measure ?,68
551,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,No ; but every important and serious Government measure should be a party measure.,69
552,Mr KINGSTON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,Many members of the Opposition are with the Government in this matter.,69
553,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I wish to say to now that the voting which took place in Senate showed ten for Tumut and nineteen for Bombala. The ten represented 1,682,239 persons in the Commonwealth, whilst the nineteen represented only 1,663,488, or about 20,000 less than the number reprea sented by the ten. When the site was decided measure in this House, in the first instance, as between Tumut and Lyndhurst, the vote for Tumut represented 1,827,758 persons, whilst the Lyndhurst vote represented only partu question. 1,314,754. Tumut has therefore been supported in the votes which have taken up to the present time by representatives over half-a-million people of the Commonmembers wealth than any other site ; the numbers being 3,509,997 for Tumut, and 2,948,242 for Bombala.",69
554,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,Whose figures are those ?,69

557,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"If they are the electoral divisions they can be relied upon. The honourable member cannot get away from them in that way, because he will have an opportunity to check the figures pleases. It is the intention of the Governanother, ment that this measure when passed by House of Representatives shall be to the Senate again. I do not think it is quite certain, as has been stated, that the Senate will return the Bill in the form in which they previously returned it to the House of Representatives. I think there is measure. something in the remarks of the honourable member for Bland, when he said that there are honourable senators who do not desire create a dead-lock in this matter. When it is remembered that there has been a presentatives, large majority in favour of Tumut in this House on two occasions, honourable senators will consider before fchey act rashly matter of this kind. However that may be, it seems to me that it is our clear to send this measure back to the Senate. The Senate may ask for a conference but must say that I fail to see how any real good could come out of a conference on the subject. However,' that will be for the Senate to consider when the Bill comes before them again, as it probabty will tomorrow. When the Bill is again returned the House of Representatives, it will be the time enough for the Government to decide whether they should make it a Government measure and a party measure or not.",69

I altogether repudiate the statements made by honourable I members questioning the bona fides of the - Government in this matter. No one can say that I have been backward in dealing with it . From the very onset, from the troublesome time when I had to bear the whole of the attacks made upon me for giving the members of the Federal Parliament an opportunity to visit the various sites, in order to prepare them for a consideration - of the question, it cannot be said that I have shown any laxity in my desire to have the Capital site chosen as early as possible. If other measures of grave importance were in hand so that this question could not be taken up at the moment the reports of the Commissioners were received, that may have been unfortunate, but neither I nor the Government was to blame for it. The ex-Prime Minister, Sir Edmund Barton, was verj' anxious to have this matter settled, and he took the earliest opportunity afforded by the state of business in this House to endeavour to carry the matter through. I think that honourable members ought to be satisfied that the Government will do the best they can to bring this matter to a successful issue. Until the Bill is again dealt with by the Senate, it is quite impossible for us to say exactly what will be done.",69

567,Mr THOMSON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF," I cannot agree with the Minister for Trade and - Customs that the methods adopted for dealing with this question have been the best, nor that the speed reached in dealing with it has been as rapid as it might have been. The matter has been gone into previously, and at this time. I desire only to point out that the question appears to be getting into a very unsatisfactory position, which I for one do not desire it should get into. I . have no desire to see it brought to the fighting stage when other important business of the Parliament may be constantly interfered with by the introduction of this question, when angry feelings may be aroused, and when Parliament may under stress have to deal with the matter, which may be much better dealt with in the .absence of that stress. I desire to reply to the objections of the Minister for Trade and Customs to making this Bill what he - calls a party measure, that there must be a stage at which, if the Government are in earnest, it must become a Government measure. The Government are the leaders of this House, and whilst it might have been quite right, and I am not taking objection to it, for the Government to leave to the House in the first instance the selection of the site, after the site was selected by the House and inserted in the measure, I consider that the Government were bound to recognise the decision of the House as one to which they must adhere, and to subsequently deal with the Bill as a Government measure. If not, when are they goingfcodeal with it as a Government measure? We know if this difference of opinion on the subject continues between the two Houses of the Parliament what the result will be. We have it laid down in the Constitution. To declare any joint dissolution the Governor General hasfcoact, and on whose recommendation is he going to act ?",70

577,Sir JOHN EOREEST,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"Although, all the Ministers had voted against the site selected 1",71
578,Mr THOMSON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"Certainly . The Government had only one of two courses to adopt-eithe r to accept the responsibility of considering in Cabinet which site they would support, and, although Ministers might differ in opinion, coming to that corporate unanimity to which they have to come in other matters, or to take the position of members of the Committee and accept its choice of a site as the one which they would support.. Every member, I am sure, expected that course to be taken. A complaint has been made of some warmth displayed by representatives of New South Wales. But, I would ask, is it not reasonable that there should be warmth displayed when such charges are levelled against New New South Wales members as have been made by a portion of the Victorian press What did a Melbourne newspaper cently 1 It saidThere is not a senator who would trust the trial of a Victorian dog to the impartiality New South Wales representatives. This is a nice statement for the Age to make. It accused the New South Wales members of voting for Lacmalac for one. reason only-that it was the nearest site Sydney-and then it accused Victorian members of neglecting the interests of the Commonwealth and the State in not voting for Albury, because it was the site nearest to Melbourne-for a Victorian town, as i was described. What did the Age go on say ? It saidA divergence of opinion between the two Houses will secure a further opportunity for inquiry, and, above all, for delay. It will be impossible this late period of the parliamentary session adjust any disagreement between the two Houses, and this will insure just what ought to happenthat the selection of a Federal Capital shall be left to a future Parliament, one which will higher view of its duty in the matter than which operates with the present New South Wales waters. opposition. In time, when we have broken the unreasoning jealousy of the mother State, and when the Commonwealth is financially position to turn its thoughts to the establishment of a Capital city, we may repeal the fettering conditions of the 125th section, and leave liament free, as it ought to be, to take best site available wherever it may be found. What does that mean 1 It means that the objection of a portion of the press, which influences public opinion largely in this State, is that the bond shall be departed fromthat New South Wales, after giving what perhaps, she agreed to give, after accepting the extra taxation which she objected to accept in the first instance, is to be robbed of what was given to her as a supposed equivalent. I think it is time for New South Wales members to show heat-af c any rate it is excusablewhen they are subjected to that sort of criticism by one of the strongest opponents of any settlement of the question at this time. Another very astonishing thing is fchafc a number of members who have raised objections to the selection of a site atfchepresenb time, because of the expense involved, have voted for the most expensive site in the whole of those submibbed bo the Commission of Experbs, and the site placed last by the Commissioners whom Parliament appointed to advise it .

On the 16th October saidThe conflict of opinion arose from the difference of numerical representation which New South Wales has in the two Houses. In the House Representatives, where that State has twenty-six members, their preference for Tumut, as againsb Bombala, prevails. In the Senate, where State is represented by six members, the preferthey ence of New South Wales loses its controlling power, and Bombala secures a large majority. That statement is absolutely inaccurate. The two sites chosen have not been selected by New South Wales members at all. New South Wales has been absolutely in the hands of the other States in this choice. I the Senate Bombala had no New South Wales supporters, while in this House Tumut had four New South Wales supfere porters in the first ballot and three more the last ballot, making seven in all. So let it not be said in either case that the tion has been due to New South Wales tralia. members.",71

584,Mr THOMSON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"The newspaper from which I quoted states that the difference selection is due to the difference in the representation of New South Wales in the two Chambers. There were only seven honourable members who voted in the last ballot for the choice of this Chamber. those seven members had voted on the other side, it would have led to the selection another site.",72

The Commonwealth has enough necessary and unavoidable difficulties to face without our adding one which is unnecessary and avoidable, and if we do not arrive at a means of n solving this question at an early date it will become a burning question to the Parliament, and will-ver y unfortunately-inter with the work that we ought to be perin forming, and I am afraid with the respect that our proceedings, if properly conducted, selecought to command fromfchepeople of Aus",72
589,Mr KINGSTON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF," I do not know that any one who really considers the question which we are now discussing can over-estimate its importance, in and I say unhesitatingly that I sincerely desire that before we separate, and this Parliament terminates, some conclusion may be come to as regards the selection of the Capital site. Though my preference is unI f doubtedly Bombala, I should have been content if the other branch of the Legisof lature had assented to the proposition which recommended itself to the good sense of this House. I have not at any time, either as the representative of a State or personally,, viewed this matter with any prejudice. All I desire is to come to a right conclusion on subject. I wish for the selection within New South Wales, and during this Parliament, of the best site available. New South is undoubtedly entitled to so much. No effort should be spared to give her during the existence of this Parliament the full benefit of the bargain which was made in reference to the Capital site. That bargain imposes upon us the obligation ""to select a Capital site within New South Wales. It may be within any part of New South either on the border ,or elsewhere, so long as it is not within 100 miles of Sydney. the Having participated largely in the Federal movement, and having been present at and a member of the Premiers' Conference agreed to the compact which was subindorsed by the peoples of the States, I claim to know what really was intended. There was no intention to give any particular part of New South Wales any particular interest in this matter. It was stipulated as clearly as could be that a certain part of that State was to be excluded, but that the Federal Parliament was to have the fullest power to determine a site anywhere else within its borders.",72
590,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,Was anything about putting the Federal Capital on the border 1,73
591,Mr KINGSTON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"We all know what was suggested at the time, and what has been continually suggested. One of the earliest gatherings in connection with Federation was held at Albury, and the talk was of Albury being the Federal Capital. Naturally, attention has been directed to the position of Albury as half way between Sydney and Melbourne. But I think that Bombala was also mentioned at the Premiers' Conference. These matters were in our minds. The Premiers were, so to speak, bargaining on the subject. The chief item of interest was the position of the Capital. It was discussed mainly between the representatives of the two States which, in the natural order of things, were most interested, which had, as it were, the chief claims to the selection of the Capital. It was an arrangement made between Victoria and New South Wales, and endorsed by the remaining States. But nothing was said or dreamt of about excluding a border site such as Albury or Bombala.",73
592,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,Was anything said about including such a site ?,73
593,Mr KINGSTON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"The matter was left at large. All that was agreed upon was that the site should be within New South Wales, but not within 100 miles of Sydney.",73
594,Mr THOMSON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,Bot h Tumut and Bombala are near the border.,73
595,Mr KINGSTON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"Yes . I would be no party to an arrangement which "" kept the word of the promise to the ear and broke it to the hope."" But nothing of the sort suggested was intended. I do not believe that the leader of the Opposition would support such a suggestion for a moment. He has not hitherto mentioned it, and he is not one to forget a point which could be made on behalf of the State over whose destinies he so long presided, and which, with his fellow members, he so adequately represents. He would, on the contrary, have spoken from the fullness of his knowledge. It is because the honourable member for Parramatta has not had an opportunity to become precisely acquainted with what happened at the Premiers' Conference that he has given expression to the suggestion that there was an intention to secure forSydney the trade of the Federal Capital. There was no such intention. The utmost liberty was conceded on both said sides. If the Federal Parliament chose a site within 105 miles of Sydney, its decision would hold good, and if it chose a border site its decision would equally hold good. The one arrangement would be as honourable and as permissible under the compact made and ratified by inclusion in the Constitution as the other. I thoroughly sympathize with the criticisms to which the honourable member for North Sydney hassubjected those who urge the plea of delay in order practically to enforce a denial of the rights of New South Wales. I shall be no party at any time to anything in the nature of cheating that State out of its undoubted rights in this matter. There is the bond. We are honourable men, and I hope that neither because of journalistic promptings or for any other reason shall we be induced to follow a line of action which will expose us to shame, as the practical repudiation of the undoubted rights of New South Wales will do. Let us select the site at the earliest moment, and make the best selection we can under the circumstances. I rely upon the promise of the Government, because when we spoke of the matter before we proceeded to the consideration of the question in detail, it was stated that they would spare no pains to bring about an agreement between the two Houses on the subject - before the session terminated. I do not like to give way to the other House. But I am a strong believer in the advantages of the Bombala site, partly' because of its port, and partly because of its climate. I have listened with amusement to the suggestion that it is too cold. Of what part of Australia can the general complaint be made that it is too cold 1 I wish that a vote could have been taken on the subject on a day like last Sunday week. The suggestion that Bombala is too cold would then have been repudiated as absurd. Australians require cold. They are generally suffering from too much heat. Let us in this world, when we have a chance, try to obtain a moderately temperate climate, and not be frightened by the suggestion that a certain climate is likely to make us shiver. I should like to get to some place which has such a climate. One can keep out of the cold by ordinary measures, but one cannot live in refrigerators to keep out the heat. At least we should try to obtain a salubrious climate with a moderate temperature. I am satisfied that in the district to which reference has been made we can get what we want, and we ought to take it.",73
596,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,The honourable and learned member has been describing the climate of Lyndhurst.,74
597,Mr KINGSTON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"I have listened attenof tively to many descriptions of climates sites, and I can say that I am absolutely unprejudiced, because I have not seen any of the places referred to. But I have read a good deal about them, and I know that Mr Oliver, who reported in favour bo discuss that subjecb. of Bombala, is a trusted servant of the New South Wales Government, and his opinions should have considerable weight with bhose who represent that State. I am prepared to endorse his view, parbhe ticularly as it accords with my original with regard to the localiby. I know that the Government have many difficulties bo contend with, and I sympathize with them. But I am half inclined to think that time arrives, in connection with all matters, when those who occupy the Treasury been Benches should assume the responsibility of their occupation and make a choice. The Government have various considerations New Soubh Wales. to study in this mabber. Here we have a couflicb between the two Houses.

As regards that lion, at and any rate, we have met and conquered it. I say, with a full absence of Ministerial responsibility, that we have obtained probecbion, and that ib has, in my opinion, come to stay.

I hood of Ballarat. Such a site would be ceutral, and the land would be suitable. However, that cannot be now, because an agreement has been entered into with New South Wales. Now that we find that the two Houses are opposed to each other, I put I it to the Prime Minister whether the time that has not arrived when the weight of the Ministry should be thrown into one scale or the other. Shall we not remain at issue after the close of this Parin liament if we are not careful. we wish to be troubled with this matter at the Federal elections ? I do not. I not know that this will be a burning tion in the constituency which I aspire to matter. represent; but I am thinking of others. I ask, "" Would our difficulties be lessened passing this troublesome question over the next Parliament, instead of dealing it now VI am inclined fco think that the gulf between us would grow wider and I do not know what form of procedure can be adopted to insure a solution of the question, unless the Government take upon to the House. themselves the responsibility of deciding which is the best site, and putting the whole weight of their influence into the advocacy of that site, and, if necessary, using their constitutional powers to bring about an agreement upon the subject. As an advothe cate of Bombala, I have listened with some impatience to the criticisms directed to number of persons who were represented by the senators who recorded their votes two. in favour of that site. I say that that is not the test which should be applied, in order judge the weight of resolutions arrived the Senate. The idea is opposed constitutional principle that each State is entitled to equal representation in point of numbers, absolutely irrespective of popularefreshed tion. It seems to ine that in this matter of the decision of the Federal Capital site we for Tumut. should rather look to the constitution of the present Government, and to the votes recorded by Ministers. "" The Minister for 'Trade and Customs pointed out that the number of people represented by the senators who voted for Bombala, was equivalent to only three-fourths of the number represented by those who voted for another site. If we apply the same test to the constitution of the Ministry, and to the votes recorded by Ministers, we find that the majority is three to one in favour of Bombala. The votes recorded by Ministers show that they are almost unanimously in favour of Bombala as compared with the other sites. Under these circumstances, is not their duty clear t Here is the position : The Prime Minister, the Minister for Home Affairs, the Minister for Defence, and the Postmaster-General are in favour of Bombala. Thus, even in this House, we have four Ministers in favour of that site, as Mr Kingston. against two who support other sites. Then the only two Ministers in the Senate are favour of Bombala. Therefore, six out Do , of eight Ministers favour that site. It seems to me be to an undesirable innovation do that at all times this question should be questreated as other than a Government The time must come in the ordinary course of affairs when Governby ments must assume responsibility for the to measures which they introduce and advowith cate, and when they must feel that the right course to adopt is to give effect to the wider. weight of their great majority.",74

The Government must declare themselves. Upon, a question of this importance, in regard to which it is desirable that a conclusion should be arrived at, we should hare the advantage of the united assistI ance of the Ministry. I do not say, at | the present moment, that I shall support whichever site they may recommend, but I shall be much inclined to do whatever I can to assist to remove for all time from bitter debate into peaceable regions this all-important question, which every honourable member desires to see settled before we go to the country.

I know that I shall be pardoned for referring to a matter of such intense importance to the whole country. I do so, because considerable comment upon it has appeared in newspapers which circulate within my own electorate, and because letters which I have received from some of my constituents convince me that a great deal yet remains to be done before the electoral rolls can be placed in a satisfactory state. There is no doubt thatmistakeshave occurred. Of course, I recognise that the difficulties which confrontedfcheDepartment were almost insuperable. Such a tremendous change was being effected in our electoral system that it was almost impossible to avoid errors. But the time within which they can be corrected is extremely short, and therefore I deem it to be my duty to again call attention to the question. There is one matter in particular which strikes me as being capable of amendment. Under present arrangements the Revision Court for any electorate can sit in one town only. I am afraid that it will be impossible for the Revision Court sitting in any one town to deal satisfactorily with the requirements of a whole electorate. The number of anomalies which exist are great. We cannot expect men and women to travel from distant quarters of a large electorate to one town only.",76

Certainly some information will require to be given before that tribunal can satisfy itself that the names of those who claim the right to vote at the coming elections have been improperly omitted. I do not think that the Court in a perfunctory fashion will grant all applications which may be made to it . While I am satisfied that it is not necessary for every applicant to attend in person, it is undoubtedly an obstacle that a person residing at any considerable distance from the town in which the Court, meets does not know what objections may be raised to his or her claim, and is unable to answer any such objection because of the travelling that would be necessary to enable that to be done. In the past every facility has been given for the holding of Revision Courts. They have even sat at night in order that the workers might attend and see that mistakes which had been made were corrected. At present electors in the country experience very great difficulty indeed in obtaining their rights.",76
612,Sir JOHN FORREST,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,I do not see where the difficulty comes in. Any one can get his name on the roll if he wishes to do so.,76
613,Mr ISAACS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"If a person resides 80 miles or 100 miles from the town in which the Revision Court is held, he experiences considerable difficulty.",76
614,Sir JOHN FORREST,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,If he sends in his application he can secure the insertion of his name upon the roll.,76
615,Mr ISAACS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"The Act does not say that. It provides that the Court must be satisfied that his claim is a just one. Some evidence must be given in support of it, and if objections are raised chey must be combatted. I do, not think that the Revision Court is a mere registration court which will grant the application of every person who chooses to ask for the insertion of his name upon the rolls. It is a tribunal whose function it is to mete out justice. It is possible that the names of some persons have been improperly placed upon the rolls, or that the names of others have been improperly omitted. It is a court of justice, and as such should have proper materials before it on which to arrive at a decision. I am afraid that we are, perhaps, treating the matter a little too lightly. Many great issues hang upon it , and complaints are already being made that people cannot travel the great distancesbecause they are great distances-betwee n their homes and the Revision Courts, or cannot see their way to be properly represented there.",76
616,Mr SOLMON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF," Wit h regardfcothe matter brought forward by the honourable and learned member for Indi, I should like to state that it appeared to me last week that a very grave injustice would be done to a large number of persons by the arrangements which had been made. waited upon the Chief Electoral Officer, however, and was assured by him that local courts would in addition be held wherever necessary.",77
617,Mr ISAACS,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,When was that notification given ?,77
618,Mr SALMON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,Onl y last week.,77
619,Mr KENNEDY,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,A different statement was made to me today.,77
620,Mr SALMON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"There is another matter relating tofchePostmaster-General's Department, to which I desire fco draw attention. I find that in Victoria a new regulation has been brought into force, which provides that where arrangements are made for delivery by letter-carrier, no letters shall be delivered at the post-office. I am told that the regulation has been introduced for revenue purposes, inasmuch as any one who desires to obtain his letters at a post office may do so on paying a rental of one guinea or two guineas per annum for a box. I would point out that in Victoria a recent disarrangement of the railway service has taken place, and that a large number of countiy districts are now served by trains which carry mails and leave on the return journey soon after their arrival. Thus, unless business people in these districts are able to obtain their letters at the post-office as soon as they are sorted, they are unable to catch the return mail. It is a matter of the utmost importance to them, and I consider that it is unnecessary that such an arbitrary regulation should be enforced in the smaller centres of population as rigidly as at present. In the ordinary course of events, many people are unable to pay the fees demanded for the use of boxes.",77
621,Mr KIEWAN,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,A man might also be a stranger in the town.,77
622,Mr SALMON,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"Quite so. In the country districts, the postal walks are very much larger than are those which have to be traversed by letter-carriers in large centres of population. In some cases it takes a letter carrier four hours to complete his walk, and consequently a number of people are unable to obtain their correspondence in time to answer it by the return mail, although the letters are actually in the possession of the postal officials. They are not permitted to intercept the letter-carrier. He is compelled to deliver them at the address given on the envelope, and many people are put to I much loss and inconvenience through the application of a regulation, which, if it ever existed in the past in Victoria, was more honoured in the breach than infcheobservance.",77
623,Mr KENNEDY,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF," I wish to indorsefcheremarks which have been made by the honourable and learned member for Indi, with regard to the position in which many electors are likely to find themselves at the ensuing elections. We have been told by inspired newspaper paragraphs, as well as on the floor of the House, that the rolls are open to inspection at post-offices throughout the Commonwealth, and that forms are available for those whofindfchafctheir names are not on the rolls and desire to have the omission rectified. I submitted today to the Minister for Home Affairs a letter, which set forth that at one of the post-offices an elector inspected the rolls for a division numbering 2,000 electors, and found that, in the first instance, there were only six applicacation forms available. The postmaster could not say whether more would be forthcoming. We know that if the average elector can obtain a form on which to make his application he will use it, but that as a rule he does not care about writing letters to officials. Consequently unless forms are available at all post-offices many electors may miss the opppertunity to be enrolled. I understand that the Revision Court will practically be the central electoral office in each State-that the Revision Court in each i electorate will be merely a court of regiswhich tration. Applicants for enrolment will state their case, the necessary inquiries be made through the central office by ceroccasional tain officials, and the work of revision actually be done in that office, the mentary lists being forwarded to the vision courts. Mr IsAxcs.^-That might be right or post-office wrong. ' Mr KENNEDY - Quite so. Many districts, people do not conceive of the difficulties which electors will experience in attending or being represented at the Revision Courts thab have so far been appointed. In my electorate, for example, it will be necesbo sary, in many instances, for an elector to sent himself from his home for three days in order to attend the court, while in other cases it will be impossible for electors to attend. There is another matter to which I to draw attention. The way in which the rolls have been grouped round polling booths is a revolution in the conditions which have hitherto prevailed in Victoria. I am not going to find fault with the system, inasmuch as provision is made in the Act to enable all persons to record their votes. The point is, however, that a man goes to a polling booth, and finds that he is not on the rolls for that parand ticular division, he may be disfranchised unless the returning officer or his deputies are advised to inform electors in such a position that they may vote there under all certain conditions. I trust that the MinisBub ter for Houie Affairs will take steps at au early date to have a short code of see instructions issued to returning officers, and particularly to deputy returning officers.",77
624,Sir JOHN FORREST,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"They will receive - detailed instructions, which are now being prepared.",78
625,Mr KENNEDY,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"We have been told of much that is to be done, but has nob yet been carried out.",78
626,Sir JOHN FORREST,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,This is being done.,78
627,Mr KENNEDY,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF,"H a v in g placed my view of the situation before the Minister, am prepared to accept his statement, and for the present to leave the matter in hands.",78
628,Sir PHILIP FYSH,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF," In answer to the honourable member for Laanecoorie, I would point out that, although there may be a regulation renders it desirable that all persons to whom letters are addressed should have a will postal-box, it is unnecessary for them, in circumstances, to rent one. If a will man while ab No. 16 meb a postal officer supplewith letters addressed to him at No. re26, ho would be entitled to receive them on application j or, if he applied at the for his letters, and was well-known to a postal official there, they would be delivered to him. That would occur in country but not in the metropolis, where the postal officials would hardly be likely to know the applicant, and would not be entitled to deliver letters to him. In such circumsbances the individual would be able obtain his letters from a box at the postaboffice ; bub, undoubtedly, a person applying for letters at a country post-'office, and being known bo the postal officials, would receive them. If any regulations be against that, desire such regulations may be amended.",78
629,Sir JOHN FORREST,ASSOCIATES OF JUSTICES OF," I am much obliged to the honourable and learned member for Indi and to the honourable and learned member fpr Moira for their suggestions. I can assure them that they are very welcome, and. if that they will receive attention. At the same time, the difficulties are very greab, the time is very short. In fact, notwithstanding all the trouble and care that I hope will be baken, I do nob anticipate that everything will be done as well as we should desire, because the time is not sufficient. we will make the best efforts possible. In regard to the Revision Courbs, I quite the force of the statement that one court will not be sufficient for such large areas as are contained in some of the electorates; and I only hope that all the means that are being taken by individual persons, by honourable'members, by the municipalauthorities, and by the Revision Courts, will suffice to bring the rolls into something like proper order. . I believe that will be the case; but it must be admitted that if the elections are bo bake place early-and I am nob advised as bo when they will bake place-bh e bime is very shorb indeed for such an immense work I as is involved in the framing of the electoral rolls and the revision of bhem, so as to make his them as accurate as they ought to be. Question so resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 11.28 p.m.",78
