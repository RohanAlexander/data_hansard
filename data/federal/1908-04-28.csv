""MASSACRES "" OF NATIVES - LAND SETTLEMENT.",14
1,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"I wish to know if the Prime Minister has'read the paragraph in this morning's Age, headed "" Papuan Natives' Outbreak,"" wherein it is stated that the outbreak is "" regarded as an unpleasant sign of the times."" also published"", a letterfrom a resident of Port Moresby, the writer of which saysIn the vicinity of Cloudy Bay, a district that has been settled for seventeen years, and the natives informed that the Government would protect them if they gave up their arms, . no fewer than forty natives have, during the last twelve months, been massacred in cold blood in twos and threes. These massacres have occurred upon the track between Port Moresby and Kokoda, and others again at Kercma, not five miles from the residency. I am also informed that the natives at. Cape Nelson arc absolutely out of hand, and massacres may occut at any time. Can the honourable and learned' gentleman say .whether there is serious unrest amongst native tribes, and, if so, whether it has been caused, as alleged, by the present condition of dissension and unrest in the Government service of Papua?",14
2,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"On the 21st March, the Papuan Government was asked to supply information with respect to the rumoured murders of natives at different times during the last six months at Cloudy Bay, on the south coast of Papua, of PAPERS. murders of natives on the Gulf of Papua, and on the' track from Port Moresby to Kokoda. A telegram was . received on the 24th inst. as followsReply despatch eight two five eight three, March twenty-third - No knowledge massacres referred to. Patrol under Strong and Bell left Samarai March twenty-third, inquire alleged native murders west of Eastern Division. Strong returned April eleventh; four prisoners. Bell and patrol still in field. Report yesterday received from Resident Magistrate, Gulf; Buchanan and Charpentier were attacked Kaipani River,. Port KomilUjr, March twenty-fifth, twenty-sixth; both escaped unhurt, otherwise all quiet. I leave for Gulf Monday twentieth. The word ""massacre"" has been improperly used. Murders of natives by natives are'continually taking place all over Papua, and occasionally even in the most settled districts. They are due to the - causes to which I alluded when the sub^ ject was being debated in connection with the Estimates, such as charges or countercharges of witchcraft, or other conflicts of The Government has no information as .to. any increase in PAPUA. the average number of these acts; of vio-. lence.: The complaints, so far as one is able to trace them,. appear, as a rule, to have emanated from three or four persons no longer in the Government service. Mr MCWILLIAMS : - I should like to know1. If the land settled on by. Messrs. Buchanan There is and Charpentier had been leased by the settlers from the Government-? or, 2. If the land in. question belongs to the natives? ' - 3. If the Prime Minister will postpone the operations of. the punitive party now organized until the ownership of the land has been ascertained ? If the Prime Minister cannot answer the questions now, I shall put them-on the notice paper for tomorrow. :",14
3,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I hope to g i w the honourable . member further information tomorrow, but may say now that the two settlers mentioned seem to have pressed on into country not yet even under general supervision, and consequently can only be surveying land with a .view to settlement. Technically, "" native l and "" within the settled districts is taken to mean the lands which the natives have used, or are-in the way of using j the areas between the lands of one village and those of its neighbour have always been considered open. Judge Murray has set out to inquire into the matter.",14
4,Mr KELLY,Unknown,The Prime Minister says that statements such as that read by the honourable member for Nepean have usually emanated from three or four persons no longer in the Government service.,15
5,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,That has been evident in several cases.,15
6,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I would ask the Prime Minister whether, in saying that about the statements as to the dissension existing in the Papuan service, he had in his mind the very important remarks on the subject made by the Bishop of New Guinea, who, of course, never was in the Government service?",15
7,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,The dissension alluded to by the Bishop of New Guinea arose in connection with the land case in regard to which I have laid the papers on the table. That dissension has terminated. I am not aware of any other. VISIT OF THE AMERICAN FLEET.,15
8,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Will the Prime Minister say what steps, if any, have been taken by the Government to provide a fitting reception of the American Fleet on the occasion of its proposed visit to Australia? Has anything been done to secure the cooperation of the Governments of the States and of the municipal authorities-of the cities to be visited?",15
9,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The Premier of New South Wales and myself discussed the matter this morning. So far. as I am aware, the only ports to be visited are those of Melbourne and Sydney.",15
10,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,Has the honourable and learned gentleman been informed that effect ? . Mr DEAKIN - They were the only ports mentioned in the first communication. I made inquiry as to whether other ports will be visited.,15
11,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I think that - fleetis to call at King George's Sound.,15
12,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The Premier of New South Wales agreed with me that, until knew the precise date of arrival, the to be visited, arid the duration of stav each, it would be unwise to _ attempt . to frame a definite programme. A number of communications have been received [377]-2 . clubs, private (persons, and others, .making offers of assistance and suggestions for the proper welcoming of the fleet. - Mr JOHNSON - The Mayor of Sydney says that he is waiting for a lead from the Commonwealth.",15
13,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"This Government will communicate with that of New South Wales, and the Premier of the State will, no doubt, communicate with the Mayor of Sydney.'",15
14,Mr REID,Unknown,The Prime Minister mentioned the Premier of New South Wales. I assume that he is also in communication with the Premier of-Victoria on the subject?,15
15,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Yes , and with all other Premiers in a general way. ADVERTISING AUSTRALIA.",15
16,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,"I should be obliged if the Prime Minister could explain a paragraph appearing in the Sydney Morning Herald, which is a distinct reflection upon his business acumen. The paragraph is as followsNotification appears in the Commonwealth Gazette of the expenditure of ^570 for 1,000. copies of Australia To-day for 1907. Why_ a bulk purchase has cost more than the retail price would amount to is not. explained.",15
17,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The explanation of newspaper misprints would come more fittingly from, the newspapers than fromme. I believe the number of copies should be 10,000'. ' COMMONWEALTH YEAR-BOOK.",15
18,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,Can the Minister' representing the Minister of Home Affairs state when Mr Knibbs' Australian statistics are likely .to be published under one cover ? Is there a prospect of getting them in that form within a rasonable time?,15
19,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"I will make into quiries, and let the honourable member know tomorrow. TENDERS.",15
20,Mr STORRER,Unknown,"Some time ago I asked the Minister of Defence a the questionwith regard to tenders for' boots for the Defence - Department in Tasmania, two respectable firms having we tendered and a higher tender than that of ports either of them being accepted. Does the in Minister intend to deduct the extra payment out of the salaries of the officers concerned, and will he take action to prevent from such a thing occurring again ?",15
21,Mr EWING,Unknown,"I remember the case perfectly well. Under the regulations, a commanding officer, with the approval of the Commandant of the State, is entitled to accept any tender for the supply of articles for the use of his company, f informed the honourable member previously that the commanding officer, with the approval of the Commandant, had accepted a higher tender. The reason given was that it was believed that the article supplied by one firm would be better than that supplied by another. It appeared to me to have been rather a serious matter, and I caused instructions to be issued to every Commandant that, if the higher tender in any case appeared more acceptable to them, it must not be accepted before the Minister was informed. That seemed to be the only course open for me to take. I could not interfere with the.tender in the case under review, as the contract had been let. However, it will not happen again.",16
22,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Not even if the article is better for the money ?,16
23,Mr EWING,Unknown,"I did not say that a better article would be obtained. I said the only reason given was that it was thought they would get a better article from one tenderer than from the other. It appears to me that when tenders are called for, and samples are displayed, the lower tender ought to be accepted, unless there be some very good reason indeed-and that reason the Minister ought to know-for not doing so. That course will be followed in the future.",16
24,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I should given like to ask the Prime Minister a question in connection with the matter of tendering. The Minister of Defence has just stated that the lowest tender ought to be accepted if the goods are of equal quality. I am informed that it is not an uncommon thing in the case of imported goods to accept the higher tender, and this is done on the plea of preference. Has not the Prime Minister himself fin' this Chamber fixed the preference which should be given to one country over others by means of the Tariff? Does he think that it is fair to people who tender upon that presumption to find that some other and additional preference is given, of which they know nothing, and as to which they cannot judge the amount when they tender? I know there is great discontent amongst tenderers. The Prime Minister has, in common with other members of this House, had an opportunity of fixing what he considers the proper_preference. Does he think that that oughf to be departed from?",16
25,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"As the honourable merrober for North Sydney puts the matter, it sounds rather serious, but what I am informed is that it has been the practice of all Governments since the Commonwealth was inaugurated, and is the practice of most if not all the State Governments at present, to discriminate between tenders which are received for goods to be supplied.",16
26,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,Not with a preference already deliberately fixed ?,16
27,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"In one case the object may be to give preference; in another, it may be the same suggestion that was made in the case referred to by my colleague in answer to the honourable member for Bass. That is, it may be thought that the Department is obtaining a superior article. The cases are so diversified that it is difficult to lay down a hard and fast rule. I know from my political experience in the State and in the Commonwealth that the Departments, and sometimes the Government, if the. matter is sufficiently important, have always reserved to themselves a perfectly free hand in dealing with tenders.",16
28,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Will the Prime Minister cause inquiry to be made into the question of tenders, and talke some opportunity of informing the House whether the preference fixed by Parliament, as between one country and another-betwee n Great Britain and America, for instance- : is to be the preference recognised by the Departments, or whether there is to be beyond that some secret preference for one reason or another, excepting the reason of difference in quality?",16
29,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Certainly , if the honourable member wishes, I shall make inquiries into the practice with regard to the acceptance of tenders. TARIFF. EFFECT ON EMPLOYMENT.",16
30,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Has the attention of the Minister of Trade .and Customs been called to the following paragraph, which appears in this morning's newspapersSome remarkable figures have been published in regard to the unemployed difficulty in the United States, which for some months past has been acute. According to the New York correspondent of the Daily Telegraph, a moderate estimate of the number of unemployed in the United States is 3,000,000. The socialist leaders, however, state that there are 4,000,000 workless men in the country, and this, despite the fact that 6,000,000 people have left the United States since October last. Can the Minister, tell the House if that state of affairs is the result of.the high protective Tariff which prevails in the United States, and whether a similar result is not likely to obtain from the high .Tariff which the Government are now attempting to pass through this Parliament?",16
31,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I read the paragraph, and I think the honourable member will admit that if we had not a protective Tariff there would be more unemployed in Australia. He will also admit, because it must have come under'his purview in his own electorate, that the raising of duties has already had the effect of establishing industries there and of giving a good deal of employment. DEFENCE : MEDICAL RESERVE. ' Mr SALMON - Is the Minister of Defence yet in a position to make a statement with regard to the proposed establishment"" of a medical reserve in connection with the Defence Forces? Some time ago he gave a promise that this would be done, but so far nothing has been made public with regard to it.",17
32,Mr EWING,Unknown,"I cannot say exactly the date, but a military order has been issued as the initiation of the steps desired by the honourable member.. It was forwarded to each Commandant, and in each State steps are being taken to organize the corps. I will, in 'order to give it publicity, lay upon the table of the House the military order in question. NA DEPARTMENT: SECRETARY. - Mr LIDDELL - I wish to ask the Minister representing the Postmaster-General if it is proposed .to further extend the term of office of the Secretary of the Post and Telegraph Department, it being well known that that officer has more than reached the age limit, and that his term of office has a.lreadv been once extended?",17
33,Mr HUME COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I do not know what is in the mind of the Postmaster General, and I suggest that the honourable gentleman should postpone the question until he returns. TELEPHONE TUNNELS. , Mr SALMON - I desire to ask the Minister representing the Minister of Home Affairs, and also the Postmaster-General, of the facts of the case. whether he knows the cause of the delay in ' proceeding with the undergrounding of the telephone lines in Melbourne and sub-' urbs, for which, I believe, money has been voted ? Is he aware that a very large number of energetic and capable miners will have to go to either Western Australia or South Africa in order to obtain employment, unless the money, which has been voted can be used for the purpose I have indicated ?",17
34,Mr HUME COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I am. aware that a good many persons are unemployed at the present time, and I shall, therefore, have immediate inquiries made into the subject matter of the honourable member's question. Tenders have been called for the larger works; some of these are now let, and a good many persons arc employed. I believe that it is the intention of the Department to carry out the shallower works, but owing to circumstances,, which were explained when the Estimates were under discussionpartly owing to the lack of staff - they could not be pushed on with as rapidly as might otherwise have been the case. However, that difficulty has been overcome, and T hope to be able to report in a day or two that some progress has been made. RIFLE RANGE.",17
35,Mr BOWDEN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I desire to ask the Minister of Defence whether he knows the reason of the delay in effecting repairs to the Flemington rifle range, also whether he is aware that the non-effecting of those repairs is 'causing many persons to leave the clubs which use the' range, and that the other members have to go to Randwick?",17
36,Mr EWING,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I will make inquiry, and inform the honourable, member, tomorrow. EASTER ENCAMPMENT.",17
37,Mr CROUCH,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I desire to ask the Minister of Defence a question in regard to the recent Easter encampment, which I understand was Colonel Stanley's first attempt. Will he ascertain how it was that on Good Friday the Ballarat,. Castlemaine, and Bendigo men were untrained, and given' no work at Langwarrin, and that at the Queenscliff encampment a company of the Geelong Garrison Artillery had no training on work on Friday, Saturday, or Sunday, and training for only a few hours on Monday ?",17
38,Mr EWING,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I shall inquire into the . matter and inform the honourable member . . -\ . CORN AND FLOUR SACKS. - - Mr Glynn asked; - the Minister of Trade and Customs, upon notice I 1. Whether he considers it practically certain' that - the' number of corn and flour sacks in Commonwealth will be sufficient to meet the cessities of the next harvest ? , 2. Upon what evidence is his opinion. based ? 3. Is there any substantial reason why the nothing' to do with hat making. anxiety in this matter expressed by farmers others should not be removed by postponing some months, as requested by them, the date which importation of sacks not of the prescribed size shall cease?.",17
39,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The anregard swers to .the honourable member's questions are as follow1. Yes. ' a. Information obtained . from the trade. am informed that a large stock, amounting probably to about 300,000 dozens, was carried over after the:! late harvest. There have also been importations to - .the extent of about 260,000° dozens since the .ist January this year, and a vessel expected to arrive before 15th May (date when Proclamation begins to operate) is bringinga . large number. Apart from the large stock of old standard bags that will be available, I-am. assured that there will be nodifficultyin obtaining abundant supplies of the new standard' sacks. They. are. quoted in the market' every.day, and orders are being taken. 3. As I am convinced there is no need for any anxiety on the' part of farmers as to - artadequate supply of sacks being obtainable before the next harvest, and as an alteration of the date upon which ' the Proclamation becomes operative, would cause uncertainty and would inflict loss upon those who have entered into contracts for thesupply, of sacks, con forming to the' new standard, I think any postponement Would .be very undesirable. CUSTOMS TARIF F BILL. ' ' tn' Committee (Consideration of Senate's : requests resumed from 24th April, vide1 page'10605).: -' - .' - Item' 121. Hats, Caps', and Bonnets :- ' . . Request - Inser t the following new paragraph :- . ""(E) Caps and Sewn Hats, n.e.i (General Tariff), 7s. per dozen, or 35 per,cent, ad val., whichever rate returns the higher duty; (United Kingdom), 6s. per dozen, or 30 per cent, ad val., whichever rate returns the higher duty."" ' Upon which Sir WILLIAM LYNE had moved- . That the requested amendment be made. And Mr MCWILLIAMS'. That the requested amendment be modified' by leaving-out,-the words V7S. per dozen'or."" - Mr HUTCHISON (Hindmarsh) [3.27]. - It is difficult to understand the peculiar .attitude'of the Opposition towards this reasonable request; - On Friday, the honourable' member for Dalley used almost "" l u r i d "" . language,' - as if an extraordinary injustice were going to be done.tO the poorer section of the community. He stated, as one of his objections to the request, that the he-was astonished at the Committee giving nesuch' enormous protection to the industry . of hat making. Now, 'this request has Here is and an opportunity for the honourable member for and others to' treat the makers of caps just on as reasonably as the makers ofhats have"" been treated, and that is all that we ask for - There is no particular difficulty into cap making - There cannot be the same restriction with regard to the number of. factories as there is in the case of hat making. It does not require an 1 extensive plant for'carrying on cap making. Mr LiDDELL - Ir a this climate caps are; not worn so much as are hats.",18
40,Mr HUTCHISON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"There are a good many caps \v6in>. and, as the honourable member for Dalley 'said, by poor persons'; On Friday, he stated that we wanted tp levy a duty of 7d.' on a cap which is re-] tailed at 6d. . Of. course, there is no such proposal before the ""Committee. Caps are easily made. 'There are at. least half-adozen factories in New South Wales, '.and about the same number in Victoria. I believe that caps are also made in the other States. So far as I know, shoddy is not produced in Australia, .and if we want to cater for the poorer classes, and afford to local manufacturers, a chance to compete w.ith British manufacturers, we cannot give less protection than is proposed, for the simple reason that the latter largely use Yorkshire shoddy. .S.urely honourable.mem' '. bers cannot say that in that 'case 7d. is too large a duty to impose on a cap! ' If the - local, manufacturers can obtain .the raw - material at a reasonable rate, they can make caps as cheaply as they are being sold today. The fact is that the Australian-made cap is iust 'as cheap as the imported article. I do not think. it is necessary to elaborate the matter. We are offering a very small protection to the cheapest caps when, we'take into consideration the fact that a duty of 30 per cent.' has already been levied upon the materials from which they are made.  made out of Australian tweeds?",18
41,Mr HUTCHISON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Ye s j . but . the price of Australian tweeds is too high to enable the poorest class of caps to be manufactured from those 'materials.""'  being made up here.",18
42,Mr HUTCHISON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The honourable light member knows that the cheapest caps are composed of all sorts of rags, which"" torn to pieces by machinery, and which then made into cloth - In reality, those who purchase this shoddy are not obtainNow ing cheap goods. But, unfortunately, some persons are so poor that they have to troduced. purchase the very cheapest goods upon the market, even though in the end these goods may prove to be dear. I should like to see all caps made out of Australian tweeds. But that is not possible. For limited means. these reasons I think that the requestof the Senate is a very - moderate one, and it is one which I am strongly disposed to grant. '",19
43,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Robertson) [3.32] - The argument of the honourable member for Hindmarsh has convinced me that the request of the Senate oughtnot to be entertained. He declares that these caps can be manufactured in Australia as. cheaply as they can be .imported. %Vhat, direction. then, will happen if. the request of the Senate be granted? The fact that imported caps will be dutiable at 7s. per dozen will enable the Australian turer to add that amount to the price of his wares, and he will then be able to sell them at the same priceas that at which the imported article is sold. That, what the honourable member calls- '""- protecrial tion to the manufacturer.""",19
44,Mr HUTCHISON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,What about-competiaffect tion?,19
45,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The unfortuncan ate .feature of this matter is that the posed duty would be a tax upon the poor man and not upon the rich;. For instance, & cap costing 7s. 6d. would be dutiable 35 per cent., whereas the cap worn by poorer classes of the community would be proposals. dutiable at 7d. In - other words, the of means who wants a motor cap will be required to pay 35 per cent, upon it into consideration. - perhap s half the amount that will have to be paid by the individual who purchases a cheap cap. . I do hope that the Comcases, mittee will not accede to the request of Senate. - Mr Reid. (East Sydney) [3.34] - A far as I can understand, the Treasurer the Minister"" of Trade and Customs - went. into these matters very carefully before Tariff was introduced, and they submitted a schedule which, in their opinion, .would sufficiently and liberally encourage Aus-is tralian industries. Having acquired' the best information obtainable, and in the of the experience gained under the operation of the old Tariff, they proposed are a duty upon caps of 35 per. cent, under are the general Tariff and of 30 per cent, under the Tariff for the United Kingdom. we are asked to go beyond the highwater mark of the schedule as it was - inThat is rather a striking departure-it is all the more striking when we realise that it is aimed at - a class of wearing apparel which is admittedly used by those who are possessed - of the most Under the requested amendment of - the Senate the most expensive caps would be dutiable at 30 - per cent, if imported from Great' Britain, 'so that persons who invested in those-articles would actually be called upon to pay a lower duty in proportion to their value than would those who content themselves with the ' cheapest kindsof"" caps.. It seems to me that that would be drawing .a line of demarcation altogether in the wrong ",19
46,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"But duties of 35 per cent, and . 30 per cent.. have already been manufacimposed upon the raw material. .",19
47,Mr REID,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That , fact musfhave been taken into consideration by the' Government when they framed their Tariff - I 'do' not is understand that the'duties on the raw matehave been increased since the schedule was submitted. If that - were so, - it might the matter a little, although it would not at all dispose of the objection' Which be urged to the-duty. But my impropression is that the duties upon the raw material have not been increased since, the Tariff was introduced, and. those .duties at must have been taken into consideration by the the Government in connection with their man Mr HUTCHISON - I think that there .were several things which they did not take - Mr Reid - That may be so, but I suggest to the honourable member that, in many the duty requested would represent the 100' and 120 per cent, upon thecheaper kinds of caps. That is a serious proposis tion, because, after all, the means of the and poorer classes are exceedingly small compared with the means of persons who wear the expensive caps,- and surely we have to pay some regard to the incomes of the poorer sections, of the community: We have to consider them a little. Surely there is a line which even the most ardent advocates of - protection will draw in favour of those who have to use the cheapest kind of wearing apparel. Surely, there is a limit which they will apply to this matter as it affects the poorer sections of the community. Surely .50 .per cent, ought to be regarded as a - pretty liberal extension of the rate of duty upon the .cheaper necessities of life. Duties of 100 per cent, and 150 per cent, upon articles used by the great masses of the people-eve n from the stand-point! of the highest form of protection-ar e an intolerable and gross impost. When the honourable member for Robertson remarked - that the effect of this duty would be to increase the costof Australian made caps by 7 s. per dozen, the honourable member for Hindmarsh interjected, "" What about competition?"" Now, either the duty pro.posed is absolutely required to enable Australian manufacturers to produce and sell their caps, or it is not. If it is absolutely - required, competition will bring prices - down below a fair level, and will lead to all sorts of sweating. That is sometimes one of . the troubles associated with any endeavour to push the protectionist principle too far in connection with items which are really not of very great consequence in the - scale of Australian industry, but which affect the daily necessities of persons of - limited means. There ought to be some - line drawn-eve n by the most enthusiastic 'believer in protection. Surely a line of 120 per cent - against the cheaper necessities of l if e is one which this Committee should be very slow to draw.",19
48,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Appare l attire are dutiable only at 40 and 35 per cent.,20
49,Mr REID,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Exactly . The highest duty levied upon apparel has been fixed - at 40 per cent. Why should there be a jump from. 40 per cent, to 100 per cent, and 150 per cent, upon this article? It seems to me that it is carrying the principle of protection to an extreme. Though the duty does not seem much in the ag<gregate, it is just as much to the poor as a duty fifty times as great would be to the man of more ample means. We must have some regard for the necessities of the people; and this does - seem to me to be an extravagant proposal, which looks too much to the interests of the persons who produce these things and too little to the means of the persons who wear them. I think it is putting matters in a position that is not justified.",20
50,Mr WILKS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Dalley) [3.41] - I am as well aware as any member of the Commits tee can be that the Government have the battalions behind them. But if a protest is to be made with regard to high duties under this Tariff, it should be made on an item such as that which is now under con 7 sideration. In regard to machinery, the pro* tectionists in this Parliament have not been able to climb higher than to secure a duty of 15 per cent. Even the most ardent protectionists in the Senate would not climb higher than that. But they are prepared to climb as high as 120 per cent, in the case of the duties on hats and caps, whch are worn by the men who make machinery: Talk about a scientific Tariff 1 This is the most unscientific Tariff that it is possible to conceive of. The honourable member for Hindmarsh has expressed himself as being astonished at some language used by me'J I am astonished at it myself-astonishe d at my own moderation. But my language is nothing to that which will be used by the people who have to buy these articles. Not satisfied with a high ad valorem duty, the protectionists have proposed an alternative fixed duty in the case of hats and caps: They have devised a drag-net, and desire to bring every tilingpossible into it . It is singular that this particular industry should be picked out for special treatment.",20
51,Mr REID,POST AND TELEGRAPH,It is wonderful the atteri-; tion it has received.,20
52,Mr WILKS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It is marvellous, and yet the honourable member for Hindmarsh is astonished that I should use such language concerning it . I am certain that the eri-: and gineers in his electorate, and their wives who have to purchase hats and caps, not only for their husbands, but for their children, are not prepared to see this industry, specially treated. If the protectionists are prepared to sing a sort of Tariff "" Excelsior,"" and to climb up to high duties in regard to some industries, why have they agreed to so small a duty as 15 per cent in the case of machinery? Another phase of the question which seems to be lost sight of, is that honourable members have allowed the Senate to usurp the functions of this House. A large State like New South Wales might as well not have its proper representation in this Chamber if duties are to be increased in the Senate.",20
53,The CHAIRMAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Order ! The hon-- - orable member must not enter into that question.,20
54,Mr WILKS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I am not arguing the.' constitutional aspect of the question; I am only alleging that we should not have had such duties in the schedule under consideration if there were anything like proportional representation of the States in the Senate. I wish to emphasize die fact that the people's House-whic h this House is supposed to be-ar e not safeguarding their rights sufficiently in allowing duties of this character to be introduced by the Senate. It may not suit honourable members to take a strong stand with regard to the matter today, but any person with the smallest perception can see that in the near future a stand will have to be taken.",20

With regard to the statement of the honourable member for Hindmarsh, that the duty only 5 per cent, above that on the piece goods which are the raw material, I would .remark that it is only reasonable to suppose that the hats and caps manuin factured in this country will be made of niece goods also manufactured in country.

I am dealing now with the statement that a duty on caps should be increased because the duty on the raw material is 30 per cent. That is so in the case of woollen caps,- but it is not so in the case of caps made of other materials, and, so far as I can form an opinion, an enormous quantity of caps made of materials other than wool are used in the Commonwealth. At this stage I do not believe there is much use in fighting these proposals very keenly.

I readily admit that' there is not sufficient sale in Australia to meet the local production of wool; but honourable members, who profess such sympathy with the primary producers, and tell us over and over again that the man on the land is taxed on every item he uses, ought to encourage industries of this kind.",25

109,Mr JOHNSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Lang) [4.15] - A remarkable feature of discussions of this character is the want of unanimity amongst protectionists as to the effect of duties. In this case, as in many others, we have one honourable member declaring that a duty does not increase prices, and another honourable member admitting that a duty may increase prices, but defending the increase on the ground of the employment afforded to local producers. It is obvious that we cannot have two opposite effects arising from the one cause at the same time; we cannot have goods both increased and reduced in price simultaneously. According to the honourable member for Batman, the effect of the duty under discussion. will not be to increase prices. But, if that be so, what, from his point of view, is the object of the duty, seeing that the only advantage that can be looked for ' by the producers is an increase of prices over those of the imported and admittedly cheaper articles alleged to be made by sweated labour? On the other hand, the honourable member for Hindmarsh says that' probably the effect of the duty may be to increase prices by 2d. or 3d. per capthough he admits that these caps are bought chiefly by the wage-earning and poorer classes-and he gives us the astonishing information that by paying the increased prices purchasers will be getting the articles cheaper. I may have some mental kink which prevents me understanding such arguments, but I certainly fail to see how anybody can get an article cheaper by paying more for it. However these are the mutually contradictory and wholly illogical statements we have placed before us, and I draw attention to them merely to show the varied grounds on which increased duties are advocated. Unquestionably, the effect of this duty must be to increase - prices, and those who will have to pay are those who can least afford to do so; it is the poorer classes and their children who will have to suffer.",25

In .1903, the importations were valued at £8,000 odd; in 1904, at £11,000 odd; in 1905, at £21,000 odd ; in 1906, at £29,000 odd; and in 1907, at least, £35,000 odd. The honourable member for East Sydney asked why the Government did not propose the higher duties at the commencement. If the honourable member had heardthe harrowing picture drawn by the deputation which waited upon me- a picture which I was convinced was a true one of the conditions under which these caps are manufactured-h e would probably have been of the same opinion as myself. There is no doubt that caps of this character ' have been imported from Great Britain and elsewhere, with the effect of throwing our own people out of employment. Is - there any reason why there should be a low Tariff, and why caps manufactured under such conditions should be' sent to Australia when they can be manufactured here at a low price ? The honourable .member for East Sydney also asked why the Government had not had the "" pluck ""to propose an ad valorem duty ? But surely there is no absence of pluck when the Government definitely state what 'the duty should be?",26

177,Mr MALONEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Melbourne) [5.7] - I wish to submit an amendment with a view to making the meaning of this paragraph I perfectly clear. Honourable members will recollect that when the Tariff was previously under consideration in this Chamber,, in my efforts to obtain a certain scientific method of dealing with the dress goods of women and children, I suggested the adoption of the weight system. That may not be a perfect system, but at least it represents a step in advance. I included in my proposal everything in the way of dress goods known as "" p r in t e d "" or "" d y e d "" flannels. These, as honourable members are aware, are imported exclusively from France. They are not produced in America ""viz., or Great Britain. Of course, underclothing can be made from these materials just as (Eden- it can be made from silk, but the cost involved in local manufacture would be very great. I have here several samples of Victorian flannels. One is sold at 7d. per yard, another at 7Jd., another at 8d., still another at 8£d., and some darker shades at a less sum.",32
178,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Is the honourable member quoting the wholesale prices?,32
179,Mr MALONEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"No ; I am speaking of the retail prices. It is possible to get a very good flannel at a cost' ranging from 8d. to iod. per yard. Of course, these are essentially dress goods, but unless the position be made perfectly clear, I fear that the Customs Department will regard these materials as flannels, and charge a higher duty upon them. This consideration leads me to ask, "" What is flannel ?'' According to my reading, flannel includes any material made of wool from the finest texture up to the thickest blanket. From Newne's Technological and Scientific Dictionary, I learn thatFlannelette is made of a cotton warp and a woollen weft. Later both the weft and the warp were made of cotton only. In Bartholomew's Atlas of the World's Commerce, I find the following definition of flannelFlannel is a kind of woollen fabric composed of carded fibres lightly fulled. Ordinary flannel, is woven of loosely-spun yarn. The only other definition of the word that I have been able to obtain is frorm the British Encyclopaedia for 1898, which contains the following- FLANNEL (French fanelle, German flanel), an open woollen stuff of various degrees of fineness, from patent flannel, which does not shrink in washing, to baize, which is a coarse woollen stuff, or flannel with a long nap, first introduced into England, together with .serge, by the Flemings. Domett is another variety of flannel, the warp of which is made of cotton, and the woof of wool. . . . The manufacture of flannel is almost the same as that of Other woollen goods, though there are certain wools which are more used for flannel than for any other textiles. For instance, a short staple wool of fine quality from a Southdown variety of the Sussex breed is principally in favour with the flannel^makers at Rochdale, as also the wool from the Norfolk breed, a cross between.the Southdown and Norfolk sheep. In Wales the short-staple wool of the mountain sheep is used, and in Ireland that of the Wicklow variety of the Cottagh breed. Nearly 2,000 persons are employed in this section of woollen manufactures, the chief seat of the industry being Rochdale, in Lancashire; while blankets, a special branch of the flannel trade, are extensively woven at Dewsbury, in Yorkshire. These quotations will serve to show that the definition of flannel is almost as wide as the world. Any material made of wool loosely woven may come under that designation. Of course, nobody would dream of calling delicate tissues such as flannel merino, flannel serge, amazonia, superior cashmere, crepe mikado, and crepe stella, flannels. These have their differentiations, and are well known.",32
180,Mr REID,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"In the form in which the Tariff left this Chamber, under what classification would they come?",33
181,Mr MALONEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"They would be classified as ""women's and children's dress goods not weighing over 5 oz. per square yard."" In order to make the position perfectly clear, however, I move That the following modification be added :"" But that, after the word ' yard ' the words including women's and children's dress flannels' "" be inserted. That these materials are flannels no one can gainsay, but my point is that they are used entirely for external personal adornment. In this connection we should recollect that some dyes are injurious-in France the wearing of dyed stockings .has resulted in three deaths within a single week. No argument therefore is necessary to show honourable members that there is no likelihood of these flannels being used for underwear.",33
182,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Are all of them dyed?,33
183,Mr MALONEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Yes ; and in very fast colours. We cannot manufacture this particular type of goods. The duty proposed is purely a revenue impost: I am altogether opposed to'revenue duties, but I recognise that during the continuance of the Braddon blot the Commonwealth must have revenue.  made in Australia?",33
184,Mr MALONEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I am informed that they cannot  they cannot be made in Victoria.,33
185,Mr MALONEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,So was I . But I am more surprised that a State with the potentialities of Queensland cannot manufacture them. The only way in which they can be produced in Australia is by the establishment of a State workshop for the manufacture of such fabrics - But the cost that would be involved in such an undertaking would be so great that it would practically wipe out the splendid record that we have established in connection with the manufacture of locomotives at Newport.,33
186,Mr CROUCH,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Would the admission of these goods at a reduced rate affect the consumption of Australian made fabrics?,33
187,Mr MALONEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"We cannot manufacture these goods in the Commonwealth. I wish that we could. Of course, we shall be able to do so by-and-by, when we possess a large population, and have established State workshops.",33
188,Mr TUDOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Will not the admission of these goods at a low rate of duty enable them to compete with articles that are being manufactured in the Commonwealth?,33
189,Mr MALONEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I have not had one sample of these flannels made in Australia submitted to me.,33
190,Mr TUDOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,But it is quite possible that they may take the place of some article which is being made here.,33
191,Mr MALONEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Some of these mate1 rials range in price from 8d. per yard to 5d. per yard.,33
192,Mr REID,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Why should not men's materials be admitted upon similar terms?,33
193,Mr MALONEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,A far greater variety of tweeds are used by men than women. The woollen mills have been established rather for the manufacture of the cloth from which men's clothing is made than for women's goods. Women's fancy ranges over a greater variety of colours and patterns than does the taste of the more sober-garbed sex.,33
194,Mr LIDDELL,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I should like to ask whether honourable members are in order in producing in the Chamber the samples which are being handed round?,33
195,The CHAIRMAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The honourable member for Melbourne is quite in order.  sorry that the honourable member has objected to the honourable member for Melbourne bringing samples into the Chamber. They look very pretty. sure that we should not object to the honourable member for Hunter bringing in samples of pills and drugs.

The honourable member says that these goods can be used only for female attire. I must admit that, though I have known some pretty "" loud "" gentlemen in my time, I have never known one who would wear things like these. I cannot see why these goods cannot be printed in Melbourne. If machinery can be built in otherparts of the world for printing flannels, it ought to be possible, by the imposition of a protective duty, to enable them to be printed here. Surely the honourable member for Melbourne is lacking in his duty to his constituents in not asking for a higher duty on these goods, because he is one of. those who is usually satisfied that anything can be made in this city so long as the duty is sufficiently high. However, I shall assist my honourable friend in what he desires to do, because I wish to reduce duties, on the clothing worn by ladies. I like to see them in pretty frocks, and I ' want to see the wives, sisters, and children of the working men of this country wearing as good and tasteful material as^ is worn by women in other parts of the world.",34
198,Mr REID,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"East Sydney) [5.27] - The Government have accepted so many of the Senate'srequests that I cannot see why they should stick at this one, which leaves the principle of the Tariff intact as it went from this House; because it leaves in the essential words "" not weighing over 5 ozs. per square yard."" In-practical administration, how could there be a distinction in regard to the .same material of the same we'ight, oh a question as to whether it was to : be used for women's and children's dresses, or - for other - purposes? How'could'the Customs 'defeat the introduction, of these materials, weighing underJij ozs. to--the) square yard,- as women's and children's I am goods, even if after they left the Customs House they were to be used in some other way ? . . - Mr MATHEWS - They could not - be used for making men's suits.",34
199,Mr REID,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Many of them might be used, not for outside clothing, but for underclothing for men as well as for women. If these materials can only be used for women and children, there is no necessity to leave the words in ; but if 10 per they can be used 'otherwise, leaving the words in would do no good, because there is nothing to prevent the material being used for other purposes after the goods leave the Customs - House. I think the Senate's requested amendment is an advisable one.",34
200,Mr MALONEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"To leave the words out would permit of a quantity of tweeds of fine texture being introduced at a lower rate of duty, although they could be used for men's clothing.",34
201,Mr REID,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I do not think that in any of the materials of which samples have been produced could be used for external clothing for men-excep t perhaps a veryfew. Since so many of the Senate's requests have been accepted, so far, I am quite agreeable to accept this one.",34
202,Mr KNOX,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Kooyong) [5.29] - My feeling is in favour of the-proposed modification ; but I can assure the honourable member for Melbourne that there is a little inconsistency in the manner in which the Tariff is administered by the Department. I hav» a statement from one of the large Customs agents in Melbourne who says thatFancy printed flannels, even when women's and children's dress goods under 5 ounces per square yard, are to be classified as flannels at 7.0 per cent. (United Kingdom) and 25 per cent, (foreignl. Formerly they were given at 10 per cent. (United Kingdom) and 1-5 per. cent, (foreign). That order was issued by the Comptroller General only on the 9th inst. It is clear therefore that the feeling of the Department is rather in the direction of the suggestion made by the honourable member for Melbourne-that'is, of a reduction, of the duty. ' Probably the Minister ' is personally aware ""of the order issued by the Comptroller-General. The Departmental officers - apparently hold the view that there' ought to be a differentiation. 1",34

Under the Tariff of 1901-2, wadding and cotton wool were free. The A section of the Tariff Commission recommended a duty of 5 per cent., and, for some reason or other, the B section desired a duty of 10 per cent. The Government proposed duties of 20 per cent, and 15 per cent., but this Committee, when considering the matter some months ago, decided to make these articles free, and now, at the request of the Senate,it is asked to restore the former duties of 20 and 15 per cent. Surely the experience we are having all along the line shows how unfortunate it was that the decision in regard to the power of the Senate should have been the means, as it is in this case, of placing additional burdens upon the people -- a power which it was not intended to have, and which, in my opinion, it does not possess. I hope that the Minister of Trade and Customs will be more moderate, and will not insist upon asking the Committee to restore the old duties of 15 and 20 per cent., which, it deliberately decided some time ago that it would not have.

I take this step in no disagreeable spirit, but solely because the Committee is reversing its decision. [Quorum formed.""] We are entitled to some explanation of the change of attitude of a number of honourable members, and, in fact, of the Committee generally, on this item. It is somewhat extraordinary that, without any explanation whatever, the Committee should now be prepared to re-impose a duty originally brought in by the Government, and removed by the Committee on a previous occasion absolutely without discussion. The honourable member for Kooyong stated that there was a private concern established, I presume in Melbourne, which had invested a' sum of £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 .",41

277,Mr KELLY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I do not think the honourable member is serious in stating that he did not know that the duty was removed from an item of this importance by a protectionist Government. There seems to be a mysterious companv,41

280,Mr KNOX,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I should think its capital was much more than that.,41

283,Mr KELLY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"When an item is submitted to the Committee with a duty on it , and that duty is taken off, no one offering any objection, it is a novel view of parliamentary procedure to say that no vote was taken. It was competent for any honourable member to object to the removal of the duty just as it is competent now for any member to object to its going on again. I wish to find some reason for this sudden change of front on the part of the Committee. It is stated that this mysterious company",41

I object to a number of stalwart protectionists, who six months ago agreed make the item free, now changing their opinion without any real proof being given of the assertions made. The honourable member for Kooyong, as a representative of the commercial. community here, must have known six months ago of the existence of this most important and mysterious firm. It manufactures blankets, and, incidentally, cotton wool, and because of that the mittee is going to stultify itself in the of the people of Australia.

The Minister has not explained that. It is a most extraorstagdinary grading of the Tariff. If the yarn should have duties of only 15 and ro per to cent., this item should either be free or bear a duty of something like 5 per cent., even from a protectionist stand-point - In accepting this request, the Minister is not improving his Tariff by means of Senate suggestions, as he indicated was his desire, but is actually creating anomalies, and producing an undesirable difference .between the partially finished product-cotto n yarnComand the mere waste product of the industry eyes - cotto n wool.

I have done'that, not because I approve of a duty at all ; indeed, I think that sufficient reasons have been given why the item should be free. But I certainly' desire to see some equality in our Tariff proposals, and, inasmuch as we have fixed duties of 15 and 10 per cent, on yarn, which is the more finished product, how can we possibly' justify a duty of 20 per cent, on cotton wool ? It was urged when we passed the duty on yarn that it was anticipated that a firmin Australia would undertake the manufacture. It is now understood that the firm is making preparations, and are expected to proceed, with the business. May not that firm reasonably say that an improper differentiation has been' made if , after placing duties of 15 and 10 per cent, on yarn, we now - impose duties of 20 and 15 per cent, on cotton wool ?

He of will vote for the higher duties no matter what may be their relationship to other duties. But the Committee ought not to adopt a course that is absolutely against .protectionist principles, as we impose higher duties on the waste of an industry than on the finished product.  listening to the remarks of the honourable than on yarn ?member for Kooyong, I perceive that he is giving effect to his statement on the ings, that he would not ruin any lian industry, especially a Victorian one. This appears to be a South Melbourne inmore. dustry, although the firm has a branch in Queensland. The honourable member for Wentworth has referred to the firm in tion as being a'mysterious one. I think, that it is very mysterious. Certainly the firm is doing trade to the extent £ 4 0 , 0 0 0 or £ 6 0 , 0 0 0 per annum in the Commonwealth. In a letter which the. firm has issued, they sayWe did not increase our price when the duty was imposed and have no intention whatever doing so, because all we desire is the larger market, which will mean, increased output, and consequently reduced cost of manufacture, and we hope reduced price. That is a fine show for the shop front. All they want is protection, and if they get the necessary protection they will not only reduce the cost of manufacture, but they hope-lif e is only hope when all is said and done!-to reduce the price.

The Minister was asked whether he would not, consider the interests of firms engaged in the manufacture of wadding and cotton wool, and he replied that he preferred to rely on the reports of his officers rather than upon the recommendations of anv interested firm. At page 5928 of Hansard, the Treasurer, in alluding to a speech made' by the honourable member for Denison, is reported to have said I do not know to what Minister the honourable . member for Denison has referred; but my experience is that a Minister, in dealing with such matters, always acts on the recommendation of his officers.

If the Government are - so""' anxious to build upindustries why do they allow the metal and machinery industries a protection of only 15 and i 2 | per cent.,' whilst in this case they ask the Committee to vote for a duty of 20 per cent. ? Goethe says that man ie either a hammer or an' anvil. It seems to me that in this case the Government are the hammer, and are constantly hammering at the House to pass increased duties. The Opposition repre-' sent the anvil. We are probably true steel,' but , in view of our numbers we can ""do no more than give forth sparks of indignation every time we. are hit with the hammer.""

As I have said, there are works in my electorate in which £ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 has been invested, and although we are told that £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 has been invested in local works in which cotton and wadding is made, we have to remember that blankets' and other goods are made there, and that the manufacture of wadding is only an auxiliary. The honourable member for Maranoa said very bluntly, but forcibly, "" I am prepared to give this man what I In view of gave the other bloke,"" and adopting his' expressive phraseology I may say that my desire is to see the other "" bloke "" to whom I have referred treated as it is proposed' to treat the "" bloke "" engaged in this in-' dustry. I am at a loss to understand how the Minister of Trade and Customs can work up any enthusiasm in support of this request, having regard to the fact that various machinery items are dutiable at much lower rates. I Said at the outset of the debate on the Tariff that I recognised that I was in a scramble, but I never dreamt of seeing honourable members scrambling for a 20 per cent, duty on suchan item as this whilst far more important items are put on the free list.",47

I am prepared to support the duties of 20 and 15 per cent., believing from the information at my disposal that they are necessary, but should like the Minister to explain what has led the Government to adopt their changed attitude in regard to the item.

If , as the honourable member says, .there is a' discrepancy between these duties and the duties on yarn, I can only regret that we are not in a position to increase the duties on yarn.

The fact remains that these are protective duties.",48
359,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommended a duty of only 5 per cent.,48
360,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That may be so, but it only proves what I have said. From information received subsequent to the publication of the recommendation of the Tariff Commission, the Government decided' fo recommend duties of 20 and 15 per cent.

In justice to the manufacturers, it ought to be said that there are imported some lines of men's half hose made, of cotton, in the case of which, when the weaving'is completed, there is a mere dusting of wool, blown on by a special process; and - these, goods, are sold as woollen socks to purchasers who know no better. It was this class of goods that caused the annoyance in the examination of hosiery under the old Tariff.

Of course, Australia can produce the rawmaterial of the woollen goods in profusion; but we do not profess to produce cotton, which, when - imported, would simply have to be stitched together info socks, and would not give rise to much of an industry, even, if the local articles were better than those imported.

I hope that when the Minister sees that we have the liiumbers, he will allow the ' renuested amendment of the Senate to be made. Mr MALONE Y' (Melbourne)- [9.36] Mr Frederick Robinson, of the firm of : Thomas Murray and Company, hosiery manufacturers, Richmond, when examined on oath before the Tariff Commission, gave this evidenceWhat tyfjes of socks and stockings do you admit you cannot produce ?-We do not profess to make embroidered socks and stockings; Those are fancy goods?-Lisl e thread, or cotton socks, cannot be made here. The Tariff on cotton socks and stockings is only 10 per cent., and that trade is in the hands of Germany, liven America buys most of her cotton productions from Germany; it is a German trade alone. The socks and stockings we mainly prpduce are for people who are not living in luxury-ordinary working men. Do you make any complaint about cotton socks and stockings, which are not mentioned in your letter?-We have not mentioned them, because we did not think there would be any use bringhonoring them before the Commission.' There is no spinning machine in Australia which can make an article such as that which I now hold in my hand. This article cannot be produced in England or in America, notwithstanding the high Tariff of that country. It is made in, Germany, where there is a secretprocess which is carefully guarded. The capital-, ists of America have established a factory in Germany, to which they send stockings to be dyed with what is called the fast But there diamond dye, by means of the Hermsdorf process, which is a trade secret. According - to Kelly's Customs Tariffs of the World. 1904, page 467, the duties' in the United States on cotton stockings are theseStockings (cotton), hose and half-hose, made on knitting machines or frames, n.o.sp. ... ... 30 per cent. $ c.

I have made inquiries, and do - not know a single shop in Melbourne or Sydney at - which an Australian made pair of cotton socks can be bought. Some very strange statements are made. One gentleman in whom I know that honourable members have a great deal of confidence was under the impression that there was a contract between the Victorian Government and a manufacturer named Youl, of South Melbourne, for the supply of cotton socks for the railway servants.",52
391,Mr MATHEWS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"He supplies asvlums. "" Mr MALONEY - I knew that that could not be so, because the Australian railway servant is a free man, and would refuse to be dictated to as to what socks he should wear. These socks are supplied to the military at 8£d. per pair, or 8s. 6d. per dozen. They are a very good article, but a little rougher than the imported cotton socks at 6d. per pair which I hold in my hand. One sock brought under my notice was made of very common cotton yarn mixed with short fibre that had most likely been sweepings from a tweed manufactory. Mr Harold Sampson, hosiery ' manufacturer, Richmond, gave the following evidence' to the Tariff Commission71.520. Do you think it is advisable to 'have a duty of 10 per cent, on cotton socks and stockings?-No ; I do not see the use of it. Even if they were made here, that 10 per cent, would not be sufficient protection. 71.521. Then it is purely a revenue duty?Yes. That statement coincides with the Minister's remark that so much revenue would be lost71.522. Do you not think that could be either reduced or abolished?-It could be abolished, as far as the manufacturers are concerned. Mr Frederick Robinson,. representing .Messrs. Thomas Murray and Company, hosiery manufacturers, Richmond, recalled and re-examined, made the following statements71,563. Are you interested in a duty being placed on cotton hosiery or cotton socks?-Cot ton socks and stockings' we do not touch'. could not do it unless we had the raw materials here. 71,565. Is there any one engaged in making cotton socks and stockings in Australia?-No , not that we know of. That evidence was given on 14th February, 1906. A Nottingham hosiery company tried to do its own dyeing, but could not, and ultimately followed the American example by establishing a factory in Germany. . The machine that made the heavier and coarser sock which I have here would [379] not be good enough to make this much finer article, which one can see through. There are a few - cotton . socks made here, as Mr Youl, of South Melbourne, manufactures them for the military and also for the benevolent asylums. I have heard today, for the first time, that we in Victoria are cruel enough to put cotton socks upon the old and helpless people in the benevolent the asylums. I am glad that this debate has brought that fact under my notice, for I shall - never, in the future, contribute one penny-piece to any institution which puts cotton socks on the feet of old people. When splendid socks like the pair I hold in my hand can be obtained for is. a pair, it is contemptible and uncharitable to save a few paltry pence at the expense of the comfort of the old people. It is an infamy that any hospital or benevolent asylum, or home for the aged poor, should do such a thing. The Minister may ask how it is that I , who am so strong a protectionist, should take the stand I am taking on. this item.' But, as a protectionist, I recognise, with the true free-trader, that we should not draw one penny-piece from the Customs House. We ought to go even as far as to prohibit the importation, of what we can make for our .own citizens, but what we cannot, and do not, manufacture, should be admitted free of duty. If the Minister wants to have, a duty upon these articles, let the Government set up a national workshop for the manufacture of them; and, as soon as that undertaking can produce enough to supply even half the community, let him impose a duty of 100 per cent, if he likes, and he can command my vote. But until that is done, I object to mulcting one out of every two of the adult citizens of Australia by means of a revenue duty.",53

V find that in 1906, out of a total importation of £ 1 5 0 , 0 0 0 worth of cotton socks and stockings, the enormous sum of ,£155 and worth came from Japan. Lest the danger lost of a flood of Chinese cotton socks and it ourstockings should appal the honourable member, I may mention that the immanufacports from Hong Kong during the same year were valued at £ 1 . The fact of the matter is that the woollen manufacturers adare not satisfied with the enormous increased to protection which they are receiving tinder this Tariff-a n increase of 100 per cent , Even Mr TUDOR - No ; the increase is fret a 15 per cent, to 25 per cent.",55

411,Mr REID,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Then I was wrong in saying that there had been an increase of 100 per cent. But the fact remains that there has been a very substantial increase. Having granted that increase, surely we might allow the people who cannot afford to wear - o r who do not wish to wear-WOOPP H socks, to obtain cotton socks free of duty. - It was only 10 per cent, under the Tariff which operated from 1902 to 1907.

412,Mr REID,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I should prefer 10 per cent, to 20 or 25. . But I really think that when honourable members consider the hundreds of thousands of pounds of extra taxation which are put upon the bulk of x the people of Australia they will recognise that this is anoccasion when we might impose a low duty. This Tariff, as honourable members are aware, will yield anything up to something like £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 more in actual cash-Australia n cash-taken out of the pockets of Australians. Surely honourable members opposite can afford to let the purchasers of these articles, which are not articles of-Australian manufacture, have a cheap line.

413,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Robertson) [10.12] - It is surprising to me to observe the amount of interest that is taken in this question of cotton socks and stockings. Honourable members opposite have been piling on the duties line after line, and have imposed upon the great mass of the people taxation to an enormous extent. The ' honourable member for Maranoa is really upset over the question of' cotton socks and stockings having to bear a duty, although, notwithstanding that he is a free-trader, he has agreed to enormous duties on many other lines.

415,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"But , nevertheless, these representatives of the masses of the people imposeenormous taxes upon them. They increase taxation upon the goods that those whom they represent alone have to buy, and then call themselves representatives of the workers. There is a large section of the people of this country who - are unable to buy woollen socks or stockings. The members of the Labour Party are apparently so unfamiliar with the life of the poorer classes that they do not know that the children of the humblest section of the community nearly all wear cotton socks.",56

417,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,That ' is another question. I have always been in favour of a land tax or directtaxation. But that question is not before the Committee just now.,56
418,Mr THOMAS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The honourable n.ember raised it.,56
419,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I am^ opposing indirect taxation. Honourable members opposite are nothing but political humbugs. Here is a body of men callingthemselves the Labour Party, who have not even seen the little children going to school in white cotton socks. Go to the poorest parts of any city in Australia, and you will see nothing but cotton socks worn by the children. Go to South Melbourne, which I believe is represented by the honourable member who has been interjecting so frequently to-night, an)d you will find that most of the children - going to school wear cotton socks. These honourable members profess to represent the working people, and yet they are imposing taxation to the extent of £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 a year upon cotton socks and stockings. 'These gentlemen are, I say again, political humbugs, who are trading, upon the cry of representing the masses of the people, although, they are piling up duties which, have to be paid exclusively by the poor.

Another set of honourable members are in favour of the duty because £20,000 per annum will be lost to the revenue if it is not imposed. The only satisfaction that I can derive from this Tariff is that in States like Tasmania and Queensland the poorer people are paying less than they formerly paid. There is a shortage, of revenue. What does it mean? It means that the poor people of those States are paying less taxation, whilst more money is being taken out of the pockets of. the people of the States where the .revenue is raised from other sources. Yet we find honourable members favouring these duties because they will raise revenue.",57

I hope we shall soon go to a vote, and shall show that we have some intelligence in reference to cotton socks and stockings. They are imported, and evidently they are worn by some one. The people who wear them do so because they cost less than socks and stocking's made of superior material. If we place a duty upon them we shall be taxing the poor people.

430,Mr KELLY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The honourable member for Balaclava said that there were fixed retail prices for cotton socks and stockings in Australia, and that if the duty were removed the only result would be that the importers would make a larger profit at the expense of the general ' consumer. My information is that the duty which the honourable member would have imposed will not put up the prices, but will put down the quality. I have before me two pairs of cotton stockings, one pair having been imported iunder the old Tariff, and the other imported under the present Tariff. Both are sold at is. per pair. The quality of the pair imported under the present duty is infinitely inferior to the quality of that imported prior to this Tariff coming into force. It is invoiced at 5s. 3d. per dozen as against the invoiced price of - 6s. per dozen'in respect of stockings imported under the old Tariff, and both are sold at is. per pair. That shows clearly that this duty will not prevent people from wearing cotton socks and stockings, but that it will lead to their being supplied with an article of much poorer quality. I wish to put it strongly that if honourable members have any thought for the poorest people in this community they will not endeavour to compel them to wear hosiery inferior to that .which they now use, which, Heaven knows, is poor enough.",57
431,Mr THOMAS BROWN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Calare) [10.24] - The debate on the Tariff has disclosed the fact that in this House there are protectionists and protectionists. TEere are those who strongly advocate protective duties to encourage industries that givepromise of being established on a self-supporting basis; there are others who are prepared to advocate taxation through the Customs, and to so allocate it that whilst being a powerful means of raising revenue it will also have a protective incidence. Those who support protective duties* to establish local industries are not in favour of purely revenue duties, and I understand that the honourable member for Melbourne, who has so ably placed this question before the Committee, comes within that category. He desires to establish industries by. means of protective duties; but he is not in favour of Customs taxation merely for the purpose of raising revenue. The' Minister of Trade and Custom's has urged that we should accept this request for the reason, amongst others, that if the honourable member for Melbourne's promission, position were agreed to we should lose a good deal of revenue. I think that he was justified in placing that phase of the tion before the Committee, but I. would ask those who do'not believe in Customs duties for' merely revenue purposes to keep that fact in mind. Many people must necesfree-trade sarily wear cotton socks or stockings. matic conditions throughput a large part of the Commonwealth - render such hosiery almost imperative, and it is absurd for the sake of encouraging a local industry to endeavour to compel those siding'in the warmer parts of Australia use woollen hosiery. If this duty posed, they will be .compelled either, to purchase these goods at a greatly enhanced price and thereby to add materially revenue from Customs taxation, or to do ' without such wear. It has also been urged with much force that cotton hosiery is used higher largely by the poorer classes, and that this tax will fall heavily upon the workerupon the miner and even the factory hand and stockings. engaged in other industries. It will press very heavily upon the working man with family, who has to provide his children followingwith hosiery, £.nd it will be still another charge upon his slender income. I do not think that it is the desire of the protecmanufactured tionists of the Labour Party to' impose mediate burdens upon the poor in this connection. It has been admitted by the Minister Trade and Customs that one strong reason for asking the Committee to agree to this increase is that it is necessary' to good a loss of revenue in other",57

I have not supported duties merelv for the purpose of. raising revenue, because I believe that revenue should be collected in some other way. When the Tariff was previously before the Committee, I did not quote from , reports of either the free-trade or protectionist sections of the Tariff Cornbecause I could never discover' which section told the truth. In every case one or the other must have been saying whatqueswas untrue. When one honourable member' quoted in support of a (proposal the report of the protectionist section, another quoted in opposition to it the report of the' section, and the result was chaos. CliStrangely enough, I find that both sections of the Tariff Commission were agreed in the use of this particular case.",58

434,Mr MATHEWS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I quote the follow-; ing from the report of the free-trade section' to the of the CommissionNo proposal of a duty on cotton hosiery was made by any of the witnesses who asked for a Tariff on woollen goods. On the contrary, a manufacturer deprecated a suggestion by a Commissioner of a duty on cotton socks In a progress report by the protectionist seca tion of the Tariff Commission, I find the Cotton socks and stockings were not at present in Australia. . There was no improspect of the successful initiation of this branch of hosiery production here, and, therefore, these goods did not require to be. of protected by a special duty.' So far the reports by the two sections of the .make Commission agree. The protectionist secdirections.. tion went on to say: - - The hosiery manufacturers who appeared before your Commissioners were interested in securing an increased import duty uponwoollen socks and stockings only, but some of them incidentally stated that if the present duty of 16 per cent, on cotton hosiery were increased to 20' - or 25 per cent., and the raw material locally I feel produced, they could compete with imported cotton socks and stockings. The manufacture of this kind oif cotton hosiery was confinedto Germany. The Australian manufacturers did not spin cotton yarn. These reports proved conclusively to my mind that there was no immediate prospect of the establishment of the manufacture of cotton socks and stockings in Australia, and I therefore deemed it my duty as a protectionist to vote against the imposition of any duties upon these articles. I have learned since that Foy and Gibson, of Collingwood, do. manufacture cotton socks, and I have alsobeen told that they are manufactured by a - firm in my 'own electorate - It will be admitted that I have always fought hard to get for my constituents what they require. ' I know the manufacturer, in South Mel- bourne who has been referred to; and I knew his father befores him as a manufacturer of excellent woollen goods, but until .this evening I never heard that they manufactured cotton socks or stockings.",58

I am aware that when people have been accustomed to pay a certain price for an article, they strongly object if they are asked to pay ahigher price. In voting .
